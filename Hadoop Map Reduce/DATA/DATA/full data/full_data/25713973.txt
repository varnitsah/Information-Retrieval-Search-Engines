25713973	the history of pendennis  by william makepeace thackeray   to dr john elliotson   my dear doctor  thirteen months ago when it seemed likely that this story had come to a close a kind friend brought you to my bedside whence in all probability i never should have risen but for your constant watchfulness and skill i like to recall your great goodness and kindness as well as many acts of others showing quite a surprising friendship and sympathy at that time when kindness and friendship were most needed and welcome  and as you would take no other fee but thanks let me record them here in behalf of me and mine and subscribe myself  yours most sincerely and gratefully  w m thackeray     preface   if this kind of composition of which the two years product is now laid before the public fail in art as it constantly does and must it at least has the advantage of a certain truth and honesty which a work more elaborate might lose in his constant communication with the reader the writer is forced into frankness of expression and to speak out his own mind and feelings as they urge him many a slip of the pen and the printer many a word spoken in haste he sees and would recall as he looks over his volume it is a sort of confidential talk between writer and reader which must often be dull must often flag in the course of his volubility the perpetual speaker must of necessity lay bare his own weaknesses vanities peculiarities and as we judge of a mans character after long frequenting his society not by one speech or by one mood or opinion or by one days talk but by the tenor of his general bearing and conversation so of a writer who delivers himself up to you perforce unreservedly you say is he honest does he tell the truth in the main does he seem actuated by a desire to find out and speak it is he a quack who shams sentiment or mouths for effect does he seek popularity by claptraps or other arts i can no more ignore good fortune than any other chance which has befallen me i have found many thousands more readers than i ever looked for i have no right to say to these you shall not find fault with my art or fall asleep over my pages but i ask you to believe that this person writing strives to tell the truth if there is not that there is nothing  perhaps the lovers of excitement may care to know that this book began with a very precise plan which was entirely put aside ladies and gentlemen you were to have been treated and the writers and the publishers pocket benefited by the recital of the most active horrors what more exciting than a ruffian with many admirable virtues in st giless visited constantly by a young lady from belgravia what more stirring than the contrasts of society the mixture of slang and fashionable language the escapes the battles the murders nay up to nine oclock this very morning my poor friend colonel altamont was doomed to execution and the author only relented when his victim was actually at the window  the exciting plan was laid aside with a very honourable forbearance on the part of the publishers because on attempting it i found that i failed from want of experience of my subject and never having been intimate with any convict in my life and the manners of ruffians and gaolbirds being quite unfamiliar to me the idea of entering into competition with m eugene sue was abandoned to describe a real rascal you must make him so horrible that he would be too hideous to show and unless the painter paints him fairly i hold he has no right to show him at all  even the gentlemen of our agethis is an attempt to describe one of them no better nor worse than most educated meneven these we cannot show as they are with the notorious foibles and selfishness of their lives and their education since the author of tom jones was buried no writer of fiction among us has been permitted to depict to his utmost power a man we must drape him and give him a certain conventional simper society will not tolerate the natural in our art many ladies have remonstrated and subscribers left me because in the course of the story i described a young man resisting and affected by temptation  my object was to say that he had the passions to feel and the manliness and generosity to overcome them you will not hearit is best to know itwhat moves in the real world what passes in society in the clubs colleges messroomswhat is the life and talk of your sons a little more frankness than is customary has been attempted in this story with no bad desire on the writers part it is hoped and with no ill consequence to any reader if truth is not always pleasant at any rate truth is best from whatever chairfrom those whence graver writers or thinkers argue as from that at which the storyteller sits as

 chapter i shows how first love may interrupt breakfast   one fine morning in the full london season major arthur pendennis came over from his lodgings according to his custom to breakfast at a certain club in pall mall of which he was a chief ornament as he was one of the finest judges of wine in england and a man of active dominating and inquiring spirit he had been very properly chosen to be a member of the committee of this club and indeed was almost the manager of the institution and the stewards and waiters bowed before him as reverentially as to a duke or a fieldmarshal  at a quarter past ten the major invariably made his appearance in the best blacked boots in all london with a checked morning cravat that never was rumpled until dinner time a buff waistcoat which bore the crown of his sovereign on the buttons and linen so spotless that mr brummel himself asked the name of his laundress and would probably have employed her had not misfortunes compelled that great man to fly the country pendenniss coat his white gloves his whiskers his very cane were perfect of their kind as specimens of the costume of a military man en retraite at a distance or seeing his back merely you would have taken him to be not more than thirty years old it was only by a nearer inspection that you saw the factitious nature of his rich brown hair and that there were a few crowsfeet round about the somewhat faded eyes of his handsome mottled face his nose was of the wellington pattern his hands and wristbands were beautifully long and white on the latter he wore handsome gold buttons given to him by his royal highness the duke of york and on the others more than one elegant ring the chief and largest of them being emblazoned with the famous arms of pendennis  he always took possession of the same table in the same corner of the room from which nobody ever now thought of ousting him one or two mad wags and wild fellows had in former days and in freak or bravado endeavoured twice or thrice to deprive him of this place but there was a quiet dignity in the majors manner as he took his seat at the next table and surveyed the interlopers which rendered it impossible for any man to sit and breakfast under his eye and that tableby the fire and yet near the windowbecame his own his letters were laid out there in expectation of his arrival and many was the young fellow about town who looked with wonder at the number of those notes and at the seals and franks which they bore if there was any question about etiquette society who was married to whom of what age such and such a duke was pendennis was the man to whom every one appealed marchionesses used to drive up to the club and leave notes for him or fetch him out he was perfectly affable the young men liked to walk with him in the park or down pall mall for he touched his hat to everybody and every other man he met was a lord  the major sate down at his accustomed table then and while the waiters went to bring him his toast and his hot newspaper he surveyed his letters through his gold double eyeglass he carried it so gaily you would hardly have known it was spectacles in disguise and examined one pretty note after another and laid them by in order there were large solemn dinner cards suggestive of three courses and heavy conversation there were neat little confidential notes conveying female entreaties there was a note on thick official paper from the marquis of steyne telling him to come to richmond to a little party at the star and garter and speak french which language the major possessed very perfectly and another from the bishop of ealing and mrs trail requesting the honour of major pendenniss company at ealing house all of which letters pendennis read gracefully and with the more satisfaction because glowry the scotch surgeon breakfasting opposite to him was looking on and hating him for having so many invitations which nobody ever sent to glowry  these perused the major took out his pocketbook to see on what days he was disengaged and which of these many hospitable calls he could afford to accept or decline  he threw over cutler the east india director in baker street in order to dine with lord steyne and the little french party at the star and garterthe bishop he accepted because though the dinner was slow he liked to dine with bishopsand so went through his list and disposed of them according to his fancy or interest then he took his breakfast and looked over the paper the gazette the births and deaths and the fashionable intelligence to see that his name was down among the guests at my lord soandsos fete and in the intervals of these occupations carried on cheerful conversation with his acquaintances about the room  among the letters which formed major pendenniss budget for that morning there was only one unread and which lay solitary and apart from all the fashionable london letters with a country postmark and a homely seal the superscription was in a pretty delicate female hand and though marked immediate by the fair writer with a strong dash of anxiety under the word yet the major had for reasons of his own neglected up to the present moment his humble rural petitioner who to be sure could hardly hope to get a hearing among so many grand folks who attended his levee the fact was this was a letter from a female relative of pendennis and while the grandees of her brothers acquaintance were received and got their interview and drove off as it were the patient country letter remained for a long time waiting for an audience in the antechamber under the slopbason  at last it came to be this letters turn and the major broke a seal with fairoaks engraved upon it and clavering st marys for a postmark it was a double letter and the major commenced perusing the envelope before he attacked the inner epistle  is it a letter from another jook growled mr glowry inwardly pendennis would not be leaving that to the last im thinking  my dear major pendennis the letter ran i beg and implore you to come to me immediately very likely thought pendennis and steynes dinner todayi am in the very greatest grief and perplexity my dearest boy who has been hitherto everything the fondest mother could wish is grieving me dreadfully he has formedi can hardly write ita passion an infatuationthe major grinnedfor an actress who has been performing here she is at least twelve years older than arthurwho will not be eighteen till next februaryand the wretched boy insists upon marrying her  hay whats making pendennis swear nowmr glowry asked of himself for rage and wonder were concentrated in the majors open mouth as he read this astounding announcement  do my dear friend the griefstricken lady went on come to me instantly on the receipt of this and as arthurs guardian entreat command the wretched child to give up this most deplorable resolution and after more entreaties to the above effect the writer concluded by signing herself the majors unhappy affectionate sister helen pendennis  fairoaks tuesdaythe major concluded reading the last words of the lettera dd pretty business at fairoaks tuesday now let us see what the boy has to say and he took the other letter which was written in a great floundering boys hand and sealed with the large signet of the pendennises even larger than the majors own and with supplementary wax sputtered all round the seal in token of the writers tremulousness and agitation  the epistle ran thus  fairoaks monday midnight  my dear unclein informing you of my engagement with miss costigan daughter of j chesterfield costigan esq of costiganstown but perhaps better known to you under her professional name of miss fotheringay of the theatres royal drury lane and crow street and of the norwich and welsh circuit i am aware that i make an announcement which cannot according to the present prejudices of society at least be welcome to my family my dearest mother on whom god knows i would wish to inflict no needless pain is deeply moved and grieved i am sorry to say by the intelligence which i have this night conveyed to her i beseech you my dear sir to come down and reason with her and console her although obliged by poverty to earn an honourable maintenance by the exercise of her splendid talents miss costigans family is as ancient and noble as our own when our ancestor ralph pendennis landed with richard ii in ireland my emilys forefathers were kings of that country i have the information from mr costigan who like yourself is a military man  it is in vain i have attempted to argue with my dear mother and prove to her that a young lady of irreproachable character and lineage endowed with the most splendid gifts of beauty and genius who devotes herself to the exercise of one of the noblest professions for the sacred purpose of maintaining her family is a being whom we should all love and reverence rather than avoidmy poor mother has prejudices which it is impossible for my logic to overcome and refuses to welcome to her arms one who is disposed to be her most affectionate daughter through life  although miss costigan is some years older than myself that circumstance does not operate as a barrier to my affection and i am sure will not influence its duration a love like mine sir i feel is contracted once and for ever as i never had dreamed of love until i saw heri feel now that i shall die without ever knowing another passion it is the fate of my life it was miss cs own delicacy which suggested that the difference of age which i never felt might operate as a bar to our union but having loved once i should despise myself and be unworthy of my name as a gentleman if i hesitated to abide by my passion if i did not give all where i felt all and endow the woman who loves me fondly with my whole heart and my whole fortune  i press for a speedy marriage with my emilyfor why in truth should it be delayed a delay implies a doubt which i cast from me as unworthy it is impossible that my sentiments can change towards emilythat at any age she can be anything but the sole object of my love why then wait i entreat you my dear uncle to come down and reconcile my dear mother to our union and i address you as a man of the world qui mores hominum multorum vidit et urbes who will not feel any of the weak scruples and fears which agitate a lady who has scarcely ever left her village  pray come down to us immediately i am quite confident thatapart from considerations of fortuneyou will admire and approve of my emilyyour affectionate nephew arthur pendennis jr  when the major had concluded the perusal of this letter his countenance assumed an expression of such rage and horror that glowry the surgeonofficial felt in his pocket for his lancet which he always carried in his cardcase and thought his respected friend was going into a fit the intelligence was indeed sufficient to agitate pendennis the head of the pendennises going to marry an actress ten years his seniora headstrong boy going to plunge into matrimony the mother has spoiled the young rascal groaned the major inwardly with her cursed sentimentality and romantic rubbish my nephew marry a tragedy queen gracious mercy people will laugh at me so that i shall not dare show my head and he thought with an inexpressible pang that he must give up lord steynes dinner at richmond and must lose his rest and pass the night in an abominable tight mailcoach instead of taking pleasure as he had promised himself in some of the most agreeable and select society in england  and he must not only give up this but all other engagements for some time to come who knows how long the business might detain him he quitted his breakfast table for the adjoining writingroom and there ruefully wrote off refusals to the marquis the earl the bishop and all his entertainers and he ordered his servant to take places in the mailcoach for that evening of course charging the sum which he disbursed for the seats to the account of the widow and the young scapegrace of whom he was guardian     chapter ii a pedigree and other family matters   early in the regency of george the magnificent there lived in a small town in the west of england called clavering a gentleman whose name was pendennis there were those alive who remembered having seen his name painted on a board which was surmounted by a gilt pestle and mortar over the door of a very humble little shop in the city of bath where mr pendennis exercised the profession of apothecary and surgeon and where he not only attended gentlemen in their sickrooms and ladies at the most interesting periods of their lives but would condescend to sell a brownpaper plaster to a farmers wife across the counteror to vend toothbrushes hairpowder and london perfumery for these facts a few folks at clavering could vouch where peoples memories were more tenacious perhaps than they are in a great bustling metropolis  and yet that little apothecary who sold a stray customer a pennyworth of salts or a more fragrant cake of windsor soap was a gentleman of good education and of as old a family as any in the whole county of somerset he had a cornish pedigree which carried the pendennises up to the time of the druids and who knows how much farther back they had intermarried with the normans at a very late period of their family existence and they were related to all the great families of wales and brittany pendennis had had a piece of university education too and might have pursued that career with great honour but that in his second year at cambridge his father died insolvent and poor pen was obliged to betake himself to the pestle and apron he always detested the trade and it was only necessity and the offer of his mothers brother a london apothecary of low family into which pendenniss father had demeaned himself by marrying that forced john pendennis into so odious a calling  he quickly after his apprenticeship parted from the coarseminded practitioner his relative and set up for himself at bath with his modest medical ensign he had for some time a hard struggle with poverty and it was all he could do to keep the shop and its gilt ornaments in decent repair and his bedridden mother in comfort but lady ribstone happening to be passing to the rooms with an intoxicated irish chairman who bumped her ladyship up against pens very doorpost and drove his chairpole through the handsomest pink bottle in the surgeons window alighted screaming from her vehicle and was accommodated with a chair in mr pendenniss shop where she was brought round with cinnamon and salvolatile  mr pendenniss manners were so uncommonly gentlemanlike and soothing that her ladyship the wife of sir pepin ribstone of codlingbury in the county of somerset bart appointed her preserver as she called him apothecary to her person and family which was very large master ribstone coming home for the christmas holidays from eton overate himself and had a fever in which mr pendennis treated him with the greatest skill and tenderness in a word he got the good graces of the codlingbury family and from that day began to prosper the good company of bath patronised him and amongst the ladies especially he was beloved and admired first his humble little shop became a smart one then he discarded the selling of toothbrushes and perfumery as unworthy of a gentleman of an ancient lineage then he shut up the shop altogether and only had a little surgery attended by a genteel young man then he had a gig with a man to drive him and before her exit from this world his poor old mother had the happiness of seeing from her bedroom window to which her chair was rolled her beloved john step into a close carriage of his own a onehorse carriage it is true but with the arms of the family of pendennis handsomely emblazoned on the panels what would arthur say now she asked speaking of a younger son of herswho never so much as once came to see my dearest johnny through all the time of his poverty and struggles  captain pendennis is with his regiment in india mother mr pendennis remarked and if you please i wish you would not call me johnny before the young manbefore mr parkins  presently the day came when she ceased to call her son by the name of johnny or by any other title of endearment or affection and his house was very lonely without that kind though querulous voice he had his nightbell altered and placed in the room in which the good old lady had grumbled for many a long year and he slept in the great large bed there he was upwards of forty years old when these events befell before the war was over before george the magnificent came to the throne before this history indeed but what is a gentleman without his pedigree pendennis by this time had his handsomely framed and glazed and hanging up in his drawingroom between the pictures of codlingbury house in somersetshire and st bonifaces college cambridge where he had passed the brief and happy days of his early manhood as for the pedigree he had taken it out of a trunk as sternes officer called for his sword now that he was a gentleman and could show it  about the time of mrs pendenniss demise another of her sons patients likewise died at bath that virtuous woman old lady pontypool daughter of reginald twelfth earl of bareacres and by consequence greatgrandaunt to the present earl and widow of john second lord pontypool and likewise of the reverend jonas wales of the armageddon chapel clifton for the last five years of her life her ladyship had been attended by miss helen thistlewood a very distant relative of the noble house of bareacres before mentioned and daughter of lieutenant r thistlewood rn killed at the battle of copenhagen under lady pontypools roof miss thistlewood found a comfortable shelter as far as boarding and lodging went but suffered under such an infernal tyranny as only women can inflict on or bear from one another the doctor who paid his visits to my lady pontypool at least twice a day could not but remark the angelical sweetness and kindness with which the young lady bore her elderly relatives insults and it was as they were going in the fourth mourning coach to attend her ladyships venerated remains to bath abbey where they now repose that he looked at her sweet pale face and resolved upon putting a certain question to her the very nature of which made his pulse beat ninety at least  he was older than she by more than twenty years and at no time the most ardent of men perhaps he had had a love affair in early life which he had to strangleperhaps all early love affairs ought to be strangled or drowned like so many blind kittens well at threeandforty he was a collected quiet little gentleman in black stockings with a bald head and a few days after the ceremony he called to see her and as he felt her pulse he kept hold of her hand in his and asked her where she was going to live now that the pontypool family had come down upon the property which was being nailed into boxes and packed into hampers and swaddled up with haybands and buried in straw and locked under three keys in green baize platechests and carted away under the eyes of poor miss helenhe asked her where she was going to live finally  her eyes filled with tears and she said she did not know she had a little money the old lady had left her a thousand pounds indeed and she would go into a boardinghouse or into a school in fine she did not know where  then pendennis looking into her pale face and keeping hold of her cold little hand asked her if she would come and live with him he was old compared toto so blooming a young lady as miss thistlewood pendennis was of the grave old complimentary school of gentlemen and apothecaries but he was of good birth and he flattered himself of good principles and temper his prospects were good and daily mending he was alone in the world and had need of a kind and constant companion whom it would be the study of his life to make happy in a word he recited to her a little speech which he had composed that morning in bed and rehearsed and perfected in his carriage as he was coming to wait upon the young lady  perhaps if he had had an early lovepassage she too had one day hoped for a different lot than to be wedded to a little gentleman who rapped his teeth and smiled artificially who was laboriously polite to the butler as he slid upstairs into the drawingroom and profusely civil to the ladysmaid who waited at the bedroom door for whom her old patroness used to ring as for a servant and who came with even more eagerness who got up stories as he sent in draughts for his patients amusement and his own profit perhaps she would have chosen a different manbut she knew on the other hand how worthy pendennis was how prudent how honourable how good he had been to his mother and constant in his care of her and the upshot of this interview was that she blushing very much made pendennis an extremely low curtsey and asked leave toto consider his very kind proposal  they were married in the dull bath season which was the height of the season in london and pendennis having previously through a professional friend mrcs secured lodgings in holles street cavendish square took his wife thither in a chaise and pair conducted her to the theatres the parks and the chapel royal showed her the folks going to a drawingroom and in a word gave her all the pleasures of the town he likewise left cards upon lord pontypool upon the right honourable the earl of bareacres and upon sir pepin and lady ribstone his earliest and kindest patrons bareacres took no notice of the cards pontypool called admired mrs pendennis and said lady pontypool would come and see her which her ladyship did per proxy of john her footman who brought her card and an invitation to a concert five weeks off pendennis was back in his little onehorse carriage dispensing draughts and pills at that time but the ribstones asked him and mrs pendennis to an entertainment of which mr pendennis bragged to the last day of his life  the secret ambition of mr pendennis had always been to be a gentleman it takes much time and careful saving for a provincial doctor whose gains are not very large to lay by enough money wherewith to purchase a house and land but besides our friends own frugality and prudence fortune aided him considerably in his endeavour and brought him to the point which he so panted to attain he laid out some money very advantageously in the purchase of a house and small estate close upon the village of clavering before mentioned words cannot describe nor did he himself ever care to confess to any one his pride when he found himself a real landed proprietor and could walk over acres of which he was the master a lucky purchase which he had made of shares in a coppermine added very considerably to his wealth and he realised with great prudence while this mine was still at its full vogue finally he sold his business at bath to mr parkins for a handsome sum of ready money and for an annuity to be paid to him during a certain number of years after he had for ever retired from the handling of the mortar and pestle  arthur pendennis his son was eight years old at the time of this event so that it is no wonder that the latter who left bath and the surgery so young should forget the existence of such a place almost entirely and that his fathers hands had ever been dirtied by the compounding of odious pills or the preparation of filthy plasters the old man never spoke about the shop himself never alluded to it called in the medical practitioner of clavering to attend his family when occasion arrived sunk the black breeches and stockings altogether attended market and sessions and wore a bottlegreen coat and brass buttons with drab gaiters just as if he had been an english gentleman all his life he used to stand at his lodgegate and see the coaches come in and bow gravely to the guards and coachmen as they touched their hats and drove by it was he who founded the clavering book club and set up the samaritan soup and blanket society it was he who brought the mail which used to run through cacklefield before away from that village and through clavering at church he was equally active as a vestryman and a worshipper at market every thursday he went from pen to stall looked at samples of oats and munched corn felt beasts punched geese in the breast and weighed them with a knowing air and did business with the farmers at the clavering arms as well as the oldest frequenter of that house of call it was now his shame as it formerly was his pride to be called doctor and those who wished to please him always gave him the title of squire  heaven knows where they came from but a whole range of pendennis portraits presently hung round the doctors oak diningroom lelys and vandykes he vowed all the portraits to be and when questioned as to the history of the originals would vaguely say they were ancestors of his you could see by his wifes looks that she disbelieved in these genealogical legends for she generally endeavoured to turn the conversation when he commenced them but his little boy believed them to their fullest extent and roger pendennis of agincourt arthur pendennis of crecy general pendennis of blenheim and oudenarde were as real and actual beings for this young gentleman aswhom shall we sayas robinson crusoe or peter wilkins or the seven champions of christendom whose histories were in his library  pendenniss fortune which at the best was not above eight hundred pounds a year did not with the best economy and management permit of his living with the great folks of the county but he had a decent comfortable society of the secondbest sort if they were not the roses they lived near the roses as it were and had a good deal of the odour of genteel life they had out their plate and dined each other round in the moonlight nights twice a year coming a dozen miles to these festivals and besides the county the pendennises had the society of the town of clavering as much as nay more than they liked for mrs pybus was always poking about helens conservatories and intercepting the operation of her souptickets and coalclubs captain glanders h p 50th dragoon guards was for ever swaggering about the squires stables and gardens and endeavouring to enlist him in his quarrels with the vicar with the postmaster with the reverend f wapshot of clavering grammar school for overflogging his son anglesea glanderswith all the village in fine and pendennis and his wife often blessed themselves that their house of fairoaks was nearly a mile out of clavering or their premises would never have been free from the prying eyes and prattle of one or other of the male and female inhabitants there  fairoaks lawn comes down to the little river brawl and on the other side were the plantations and woods as much as were left of them of clavering park sir francis clavering bart the park was let out in pasture and fed down by sheep and cattle when the pendennises came first to live at fairoaks shutters were up in the house a splendid freestone palace with great stairs statues and porticos whereof you may see a picture in the beauties of england and wales sir richard clavering sir francissgrandfather had commenced the ruin of the family by the building of this palace his successor had achieved the ruin by living in it the present sir francis was abroad somewhere nor could anybody be found rich enough to rent that enormous mansion through the deserted rooms mouldy clanking halls and dismal galleries of which arthur pendennis many a time walked trembling when he was a boy at sunset from the lawn of fairoaks there was a pretty sight it and the opposite park of clavering were in the habit of putting on a rich golden tinge which became them both wonderfully the upper windows of the great house flamed so as to make your eyes wink the little river ran off noisily westward and was lost in a sombre wood behind which the towers of the old abbey church of clavering whereby that town is called clavering st marys to the present day rose up in purple splendour little arthurs figure and his mothers cast long blue shadows over the grass and he would repeat in a low voice for a scene of great natural beauty always moved the boy who inherited this sensibility from his mother certain lines beginning these are thy glorious works parent of good almighty thine this universal frame greatly to mrs pendenniss delight such walks and conversation generally ended in a profusion of filial and maternal embraces for to love and to pray were the main occupations of this dear womans life and i have often heard pendennis say in his wild way that he felt that he was sure of going to heaven for his mother never could be happy there without him  as for john pendennis as the father of the family and that sort of thing everybody had the greatest respect for him and his orders were obeyed like those of the medes and persians his hat was as well brushed perhaps as that of any man in this empire his meals were served at the same minute every day and woe to those who came late as little pen a disorderly little rascal sometimes did prayers were recited his letters were read his business dispatched his stables and garden inspected his henhouses and kennel his barn and pigstye visited always at regular hours after dinner he always had a nap with the globe newspaper on his knee and his yellow bandanna handkerchief on his face major pendennis sent the yellow handkerchiefs from india and his brother had helped in the purchase of his majority so that they were good friends now and so as his dinner took place at six oclock to a minute and the sunset business alluded to may be supposed to have occurred at about halfpast seven it is probable that he did not much care for the view in front of his lawn windows or take any share in the poetry and caresses which were taking place there  they seldom occurred in his presence however frisky they were before mother and child were hushed and quiet when mr pendennis walked into the drawingroom his newspaper under his arm and here while little pen buried in a great chair read all the books of which he could lay hold the squire perused his own articles in the gardeners gazette or took a solemn hand at picquet with mrs pendennis or an occasional friend from the village  pendennis usually took care that at least one of his grand dinners should take place when his brother the major who on the return of his regiment from india and new south wales had sold out and gone upon halfpay came to pay his biennial visit to fairoaks my brother major pendennis was a constant theme of the retired doctors conversation all the family delighted in my brother the major he was the link which bound them to the great world of london and the fashion he always brought down the last news of the nobility and was in the constant habit of dining with lords and great folks he spoke of such with soldierlike respect and decorum he would say my lord bareacres has been good enough to invite me to bareacres for the pheasant shooting or my lord steyne is so kind as to wish for my presence at stillbrook for the easter holidays and you may be sure the whereabouts of my brother the major was carefully made known by worthy mr pendennis to his friends at the clavering reading room at justicemeetings or at the countytown their carriages would come from ten miles round to call upon major pendennis in his visits to fairoaks the fame of his fashion as a man about town was established throughout the county there was a talk of his marrying miss hunkle of lilybank old hunkle the attorneys daughter with at least fifteen hundred ayear to her fortune but my brother the major refused this negotiation advantageous as it might seem to most persons as a bachelor he said nobody cares how poor i am i have the happiness to live with people who are so highly placed in the world that a few hundreds or thousands a year more or less can make no difference in the estimation in which they are pleased to hold me miss hunkle though a most respectable lady is not in possession of either the birth or the manners which would entitle her to be received into the sphere in which i have the honour to move i shall live and die an old bachelor john and your worthy friend miss hunkle i have no doubt will find some more worthy object of her affection than a wornout old soldier on halfpay time showed the correctness of the surmise of the old man of the world miss hunkle married a young french nobleman and is now at this moment living at lilybank under the title of baroness de carambole having been separated from her wild young scapegrace of a baron very shortly after their union  the major was a great favourite with almost all the little establishment of fairoaks he was as goodnatured as he was well bred and had a sincere liking and regard for his sisterinlaw whom he pronounced and with perfect truth to be as fine a lady as any in england and an honour to the family indeed mrs pendenniss tranquil beauty her natural sweetness and kindness and that simplicity and dignity which a perfect purity and innocence are sure to bestow upon a handsome woman rendered her quite worthy of her brothers praises i think it is not national prejudice which makes me believe that a highbred english lady is the most complete of all heavens subjects in this world in whom else do you see so much grace and so much virtue so much faith and so much tenderness with such a perfect refinement and chastity and by highbred ladies i dont mean duchesses and countesses be they ever so high in station they can be but ladies and no more but almost every man who lives in the world has the happiness let us hope of counting a few such persons amongst his circle of acquaintancewomen in whose angelical natures there is something awful as well as beautiful to contemplate at whose feet the wildest and fiercest of us must fall down and humble ourselvesin admiration of that adorable purity which never seems to do or to think wrong  arthur pendennis had the good fortune to have a mother endowed with these happy qualities during his childhood and youth the boy thought of her as little less than an angelas a supernatural being all wisdom love and beauty when her husband drove her into the county town or to the assize balls or concerts there he would step into the assembly with his wife on his arm and look the great folks in the face as much as to say look at that my lord can any of you show me a woman like that she enraged some country ladies with three times her money by a sort of desperate perfection which they found in her miss pybus said she was cold and haughty miss pierce that she was too proud for her station mrs wapshot as a doctor of divinitys lady would have the pas of her who was only the wife of a medical practitioner in the meanwhile this lady moved through the world quite regardless of all the comments that were made in her praise or disfavour she did not seem to know that she was admired or hated for being so perfect but carried on calmly through life saying her prayers loving her family helping her neighbours and doing her duty  that even a woman should be faultless however is an arrangement not permitted by nature which assigns to us mental defects as it awards to us headaches illnesses or death without which the scheme of the world could not be carried onnay some of the best qualities of mankind could not be brought into exercise as pain produces or elicits fortitude and endurance difficulty perseverance poverty industry and ingenuity danger courage and what not so the very virtues on the other hand will generate some vices and in fine mrs pendennis had that vice which miss pybus and miss pierce discovered in her namely that of pride which did not vest itself so much in her own person as in that of her family she spoke about mr pendennis a worthy little gentleman enough but there are others as good as he with an awful reverence as if he had been the pope of rome on his throne and she a cardinal kneeling at his feet and giving him incense the major she held to be a sort of bayard among majors and as for her son arthur she worshipped that youth with an ardour which the young scapegrace accepted almost as coolly as the statue of the saint in saint peters receives the rapturous osculations which the faithful deliver on his toe  this unfortunate superstition and idolworship of this good woman was the cause of a great deal of the misfortune which befell the young gentleman who is the hero of this history and deserves therefore to be mentioned at the outset of his story  arthur pendenniss schoolfellows at the greyfriars school state that as a boy he was in no ways remarkable either as a dunce or as a scholar he did in fact just as much as was required of him and no more if he was distinguished for anything it was for versewriting but was his enthusiasm ever so great it stopped when he had composed the number of lines demanded by the regulations unlike young swettenham for instance who with no more of poetry in his composition than mr wakley yet would bring up a hundred dreary hexameters to the master after a halfholiday or young fluxmore who not only did his own verses but all the fifth forms besides he never read to improve himself out of schoolhours but on the contrary devoured all the novels plays and poetry on which he could lay his hands he never was flogged but it was a wonder how he escaped the whippingpost when he had money he spent it royally in tarts for himself and his friends he has been known to disburse nine and sixpence out of ten shillings awarded to him in a single day when he had no funds he went on tick when he could get no credit he went without and was almost as happy he has been known to take a thrashing for a crony without saying a word but a blow ever so slight from a friend would make him roar to fighting he was averse from his earliest youth as indeed to physic the greek grammar or any other exertion and would engage in none of them except at the last extremity he seldom if ever told lies and never bullied little boys those masters or seniors who were kind to him he loved with boyish ardour and though the doctor when he did not know his horace or could not construe his greek play said that that boy pendennis was a disgrace to the school a candidate for ruin in this world and perdition in the next a profligate who would most likely bring his venerable father to ruin and his mother to a dishonoured grave and the likeyet as the doctor made use of these compliments to most of the boys in the place which has not turned out an unusual number of felons and pickpockets little pen at first uneasy and terrified by these charges became gradually accustomed to hear them and he has not in fact either murdered his parents or committed any act worthy of transportation or hanging up to the present day  there were many of the upper boys among the cistercians with whom pendennis was educated who assumed all the privileges of men long before they quitted that seminary many of them for example smoked cigarsand some had already begun the practice of inebriation one had fought a duel with an ensign in a marching in consequence of a row at the theatreanother actually kept a buggy and horse at a livery stable in covent garden and might be seen driving any sunday in hyde park with a groom with squared arms and armorial buttons by his side many of the seniors were in love and showed each other in confidence poems addressed to or letters and locks of hair received from young ladiesbut pen a modest and timid youth rather envied these than imitated them as yet he had not got beyond the theory as yetthe practice of life was all to come and by the way ye tender mothers and sober fathers of christian families a prodigious thing that theory of life is as orally learned at a great public school why if you could hear those boys of fourteen who blush before mothers and sneak off in silence in the presence of their daughters talking among each otherit would be the womens turn to blush then before he was twelve years old and if while his mother fancied him an angel of candour little pen had heard talk enough to make him quite awfully wise upon certain pointsand so madam has your pretty little rosycheeked son who is coming home from school for the ensuing christmas holidays i dont say that the boy is lost or that the innocence has left him which he had from heaven which is our home but that the shades of the prisonhouse are closing very fast over him and that we are helping as much as possible to corrupt him  wellpen had just made his public appearance in a coat with a tail or cauda virilis and was looking most anxiously in his little studyglass to see if his whiskers were growing like those of more fortunate youths his companions and instead of the treble voice with which he used to speak and sing for his singing voice was a very sweet one and he used when little to be made to perform home sweet home my pretty page and a french song or two which his mother had taught him and other ballads for the delectation of the senior boys had suddenly plunged into a deep bass diversified by a squeak which when he was called upon to construe in school set the master and scholars laughing he was about sixteen years old in a word when he was suddenly called away from his academic studies  it was at the close of the forenoon school and pen had been unnoticed all the previous part of the morning till now when the doctor put him on to construe in a greek play he did not know a word of it though little timmins his formfellow was prompting him with all his might pen had made a sad blunder or two when the awful chief broke out upon him  pendennis sir he said your idleness is incorrigible and your stupidity beyond example you are a disgrace to your school and to your family and i have no doubt will prove so in afterlife to your country if that vice sir which is described to us as the root of all evil be really what moralists have represented and i have no doubt of the correctness of their opinion for what a prodigious quantity of future crime and wickedness are you unhappy boy laying the seed miserable trifler a boy who construes de and instead of de but at sixteen years of age is guilty not merely of folly and ignorance and dulness inconceivable but of crime of deadly crime of filial ingratitude which i tremble to contemplate a boy sir who does not learn his greek play cheats the parent who spends money for his education a boy who cheats his parent is not very far from robbing or forging upon his neighbour a man who forges on his neighbour pays the penalty of his crime at the gallows and it is not such a one that i pity for he will be deservedly cut off but his maddened and heartbroken parents who are driven to a premature grave by his crimes or if they live drag on a wretched and dishonoured old age go on sir and i warn you that the very next mistake that you make shall subject you to the punishment of the rod whos that laughing what illconditioned boy is there that dares to laugh shouted the doctor  indeed while the master was making this oration there was a general titter behind him in the schoolroom the orator had his back to the door of this ancient apartment which was open and a gentleman who was quite familiar with the place for both major arthur and mr john pendennis had been at the school was asking the fifthform boy who sate by the door for pendennis the lad grinning pointed to the culprit against whom the doctor was pouring out the thunders of his just wrathmajor pendennis could not help laughing he remembered having stood under that very pillar where pen the younger now stood and having been assaulted by the doctors predecessor years and years ago the intelligence was passed round that it was pendenniss uncle in an instant and a hundred young faces wondering and giggling between terror and laughter turned now to the newcomer and then to the awful doctor  the major asked the fifthform boy to carry his card up to the doctor which the lad did with an arch look major pendennis had written on the card i must take a p home his father is very ill  as the doctor received the card and stopped his harangue with rather a seared look the laughter of the boys half constrained until then burst out in a general shout silence roared out the doctor stamping with his foot pen looked up and saw who was his deliverer the major beckoned to him gravely with one of his white gloves and tumbling down his books pen went across  the doctor took out his watch it was two minutes to one we will take the juvenal at afternoon school he said nodding to the captain and all the boys understanding the signal gathered up their books and poured out of the hall  young pen saw by his uncles face that something had happened at home is there anything the matter with my mother he said he could hardly speak though for emotion and the tears which were ready to start  no said the major but your fathers very ill go and pack your trunk directly i have got a postchaise at the gate  pen went off quickly to his boardinghouse to do as his uncle bade him and the doctor now left alone in the schoolroom came out to shake hands with his old schoolfellow you would not have thought it was the same man as cinderella at a particular hour became from a blazing and magnificent princess quite an ordinary little maid in a grey petticoat so as the clock struck one all the thundering majesty and awful wrath of the schoolmaster disappeared  there is nothing serious i hope said the doctor it is a pity to take the boy away unless there is he is a very good boy rather idle and unenergetic but he is a very honest gentlemanlike little fellow though i cant get him to construe as i wish wont you come in and have some luncheon my wife will be very happy to see you  but major pendennis declined the luncheon he said his brother was very ill had had a fit the day before and it was a great question if they should see him alive  theres no other son is there said the doctor the major answered no  and theres a good eha good ehproperty i believe asked the other in an offhand way  hmso so said the major whereupon this colloquy came to an end and arthur pendennis got into the postchaise with his uncle never to come back to school any more  as the chaise drove through clavering the hostler standing whistling under the archway of the clavering arms winked the postilion ominously as much as to say all was over the gardeners wife came and opened the lodgegates and let the travellers through with a silent shake of the head all the blinds were down at fairoaksthe face of the old footman was as blank when he let them in arthurs face was white too with terror more than with grief whatever of warmth and love the deceased man might have had and he adored his wife and loved and admired his son with all his heart he had shut them up within himself nor had the boy been ever able to penetrate that frigid outward barrier but arthur had been his fathers pride and glory through life and his name the last which john pendennis had tried to articulate whilst he lay with his wifes hand clasping his own cold and clammy palm as the flickering spirit went out into the darkness of death and life and the world passed away from him  the little girl whose face had peered for a moment under the blinds as the chaise came up opened the door from the stairs into the hall and taking arthurs hand silently as he stooped down to kiss her led him upstairs to his mother old john opened the diningroom door for the major the room was darkened with the blinds down and surrounded by all the gloomy pictures of the pendennises he drank a glass of wine the bottle had been opened for the squire four days before his hat was brushed and laid on the hall table his newspapers and his letterbag with john pendennis esquire fairoaks engraved upon the brass plate were there in waiting the doctor and the lawyer from clavering who had seen the chaise pass through came up in a gig half an hour after the majors arrival and entered by the back door the former gave a detailed account of the seizure and demise of mr pendennis enlarged on his virtues and the estimation in which the neighbourhood held him on what a loss he would be to the magistrates bench the county hospital etc mrs pendennis bore up wonderfully he said especially since master arthurs arrival the lawyer stayed and dined with major pendennis and they talked business all the evening the major was his brothers executor and joint guardian to the boy with mrs pendennis everything was left unreservedly to her except in case of a second marriagean occasion which might offer itself in the case of so young and handsome a woman mr tatham gallantly said when different provisions were enacted by the deceased the major would of course take entire superintendence of everything under this most impressive and melancholy occasion aware of this authority old john the footman when he brought major pendennis the candle to go to bed followed afterwards with the platebasket and the next morning brought him the key of the hall clockthe squire always used to wind it up of a thursday john said mrs pendenniss maid brought him messages from her mistress she confirmed the doctors report of the comfort which master arthurs arrival had caused to his mother  what passed between that lady and the boy is not of import a veil should be thrown over those sacred emotions of love and grief the maternal passion is a sacred mystery to me what one sees symbolised in the roman churches in the image of the virgin mother with a bosom bleeding with love i think one may witness and admire the almighty bounty for every day i saw a jewish lady only yesterday with a child at her knee and from whose face towards the child there shone a sweetness so angelical that it seemed to form a sort of glory round both i protest i could have knelt before her too and adored in her the divine beneficence in endowing us with the maternal storge which began with our race and sanctifies the history of mankind  so it was with this in a word that mrs pendennis comforted herself on the death of her husband whom however she always reverenced as the best the most upright wise highminded accomplished and awful of men if the women did not make idols of us and if they saw us as we see each other would life be bearable or could society go on let a man pray that none of his womankind should form a just estimation of him if your wife knew you as you are neighbour she would not grieve much about being your widow and would let your gravelamp go out very soon or perhaps not even take the trouble to light it whereas helen pendennis put up the handsomest of memorials to her husband and constantly renewed it with the most precious oil  as for arthur pendennis after that awful shock which the sight of his dead father must have produced on him and the pity and feeling which such an event no doubt occasioned i am not sure that in the very moment of the grief and as he embraced his mother and tenderly consoled her and promised to love her for ever there was not springing up in his breast a feeling of secret triumph and exultation he was the chief now and lord he was pendennis and all round about him were his servants and handmaids youll never send me away little laura said tripping by him and holding his hand you wont send me to school will you arthur  arthur kissed her and patted her head no she shouldnt go to school as for going himself that was quite out of the question he had determined that that part of his life should not be renewed in the midst of the general grief and the corpse still lying above he had leisure to conclude that he would have it all holidays for the future that he wouldnt get up till he liked or stand the bullying of the doctor any more and had made a hundred of such daydreams and resolves for the future how ones thoughts will travel and how quickly our wishes beget them when he with laura in his hand went into the kitchen on his way to the dogkennel the fowlhouses and other his favourite haunts all the servants there assembled in great silence with their friends and the labouring men and their wives and sally potter who went with the postbag to clavering and the bakers man from claveringall there assembled and drinking beer on the melancholy occasionrose up on his entrance and bowed or curtseyed to him they never used to do so last holidays he felt at once and with indescribable pleasure the cook cried out o lord and whispered how master arthur do grow thomas the groom in the act of drinking put down the jug alarmed before his master thomass master felt the honour keenly he went through and looked at the pointers as flora put her nose up to his waistcoat and ponto yelling with pleasure hurtled at his chain pen patronised the dogs and said poo ponto poo flora in his most condescending manner and then he went and looked at lauras hens and at the pigs and at the orchard and at the dairy perhaps he blushed to think that it was only last holidays he had in a manner robbed the great appletree and been scolded by the dairymaid for taking cream  they buried john pendennis esquire formerly an eminent medical practitioner at bath and subsequently an able magistrate a benevolent landlord and a benefactor to many charities and public institutions in this neighbourhood and county with one of the most handsome funerals that had been seen since sir roger clavering was buried here the clerk said in the abbey church of clavering st marys a fair marble slab from which the above inscription is copied was erected over the fairoaks pew in the church on it you may see the pendennis coat of arms and crest an eagle looking towards the sun with the motto nec tenui penna to the present day doctor portman alluded to the deceased most handsomely and affectingly as our dear departed friend in his sermon next sunday and arthur pendennis reigned in his stead     chapter iii in which pendennis appears as a very young man indeed   arthur was about sixteen years old we have said when he began to reign in person for i see that the artist who is to illustrate this book and who makes sad work of the likeness will never be able to take my friend off he had what his friends would call a dumpy but his mamma styled a neat little figure his hair was of a healthy brown colour which looks like gold in the sunshine his face was round rosy freckled and goodhumoured his whiskers when those facial ornaments for which he sighed so ardently were awarded to him by nature were decidedly of a reddish hue in fact without being a beauty he had such a frank goodnatured kind face and laughed so merrily at you out of his honest blue eyes that no wonder mrs pendennis thought him the pride of the whole county between the ages of sixteen and eighteen he rose from five feet six to five feet eight inches in height at which altitude he paused but his mother wondered at it he was three inches taller than his father was it possible that any man could grow to be three inches taller than mr pendennis  you may be certain he never went back to school the discipline of the establishment did not suit him and he liked being at home much better the question of his return was debated and his uncle was for his going back the doctor wrote his opinion that it was most important for arthurs success in afterlife that he should know a greek play thoroughly but pen adroitly managed to hint to his mother what a dangerous place greyfriars was and what sad wild fellows some of the chaps there were and the timid soul taking alarm at once acceded to his desire to stay at home  then pens uncle offered to use his influence with his royal highness the commanderinchief who was pleased to be very kind to him and proposed to get pen a commission in the foot guards pens heart leaped at this he had been to hear the band at st jamess play on a sunday when he went out to his uncle he had seen tom ricketts of the fourth form who used to wear a jacket and trousers so ludicrously tight that the elder boys could not forbear using him in the quality of a butt or cockshyhe had seen this very ricketts arrayed in crimson and gold with an immense bearskin cap on his head staggering under the colours of the regiment tom had recognised him and gave him a patronising nod tom a little wretch whom he had cut over the back with a hockeystick last quarterand there he was in the centre of the square rallying round the flag of his country surrounded by bayonets crossbelts and scarlet the band blowing trumpets and banging cymbalstalking familiarly to immense warriors with tufts to their chins and waterloo medals what would not pen have given to wear such epaulettes and enter such a service  but helen pendennis when this point was proposed to her by her son put on a face full of terror and alarm she said she did not quarrel with others who thought differently but that in her opinion a christian had no right to make the army a profession mr pendennis never never would have permitted his son to be a soldier finally she should be very unhappy if he thought of it now pen would have as soon cut off his nose and ears as deliberately and of aforethought malice made his mother unhappy and as he was of such a generous disposition that he would give away anything to any one he instantly made a present of his visionary red coat and epaulettes and his ardour for military glory to his mother  she thought him the noblest creature in the world but major pendennis when the offer of the commission was acknowledged and refused wrote back a curt and somewhat angry letter to the widow and thought his nephew was rather a spooney  he was contented however when he saw the boys performances out hunting at christmas when the major came down as usual to fairoaks pen had a very good mare and rode her with uncommon pluck and grace he took his fences with great coolness and yet with judgment and without bravado he wrote to the chaps at school about his topboots and his feats across country he began to think seriously of a scarlet coat and his mother must own that she thought it would become him remarkably well though of course she passed hours of anguish during his absence and daily expected to see him brought home on a shutter  with these amusements in rather too great plenty it must not be assumed that pen neglected his studies altogether he had a natural taste for reading every possible kind of book which did not fall into his schoolcourse it was only when they forced his head into the waters of knowledge that he refused to drink he devoured all the books at home from inchbalds theatre to whites farriery he ransacked the neighbouring bookcases he found at clavering an old cargo of french novels which he read with all his might and he would sit for hours perched upon the topmost bar of doctor portmans library steps with a folio on his knees whether it were hakluyts travels hobbess leviathan augustini opera or chaucers poems he and the vicar were very good friends and from his reverence pen learned that honest taste for port wine which distinguished him through life and as for that dear good woman mrs portman who was not in the least jealous though her doctor avowed himself in love with mrs pendennis whom he pronounced to be by far the finest lady in the countyall her grief was as she looked up fondly at pen perched on the bookladder that her daughter minny was too old for himas indeed she wasmiss myra portman being at that period only two years younger than pens mother and weighing as much as pen and mrs pendennis together  are these details insipid look back good friend at your own youth and ask how was that i like to think of a wellnurtured boy brave and gentle warmhearted and loving and looking the world in the face with kind honest eyes what bright colours it wore then and how you enjoyed it a man has not many years of such time he does not know them whilst they are with him it is only when they are passed long away that he remembers how dear and happy they were  in order to keep mr pen from indulging in that idleness of which his friend the doctor of the cistercians had prophesied such awful consequences mr smirke dr portmans curate was engaged at a liberal salary to walk or ride over from clavering and pass several hours daily with the young gentleman smirke was a man perfectly faultless at a teatable wore a curl on his fair forehead and tied his neckcloth with a melancholy grace he was a decent scholar and mathematician and taught pen as much as the lad was ever disposed to learn which was not much for pen had soon taken the measure of his tutor who when he came riding into the courtyard at fairoaks on his pony turned out his toes so absurdly and left such a gap between his knees and the saddle that it was impossible for any lad endowed with a sense of humour to respect such an equestrian he nearly killed smirke with terror by putting him on his mare and taking him a ride over a common where the county foxhounds then bunted by that staunch old sportsman mr hardhead of dumplingbeare happened to meet mr smirke on pens mare rebecca she was named after pens favourite heroine the daughter of isaac of york astounded the hounds as much as he disgusted the huntsman laming one of the former by persisting in riding amongst the pack and receiving a speech from the latter more remarkable for energy of language than any oration he had ever heard since he left the bargemen on the banks of isis  smirke confided to his pupil his poems both latin and english and presented to mrs pendennis a volume of the latter printed at clapham his native place the two read the ancient poets together and rattled through them at a pleasant rate very different from that steady grubbing pace with which the cistercians used to go over the classic ground scenting out each word as they went and digging up every root in the way pen never liked to halt but made his tutor construe when he was at fault and thus galloped through the iliad and the odyssey the tragic playwriters writers and the charming wicked aristophanes whom he vowed to be the greatest poet of all but he went at such a pace that though he certainly galloped through a considerable extent of the ancient country he clean forgot it in afterlife and had only such a vague remembrance of his early classic course as a man has in the house of commons let us say who still keeps up two or three quotations or a reviewer who just for decencys sake hints at a little greek our people are the most prosaic in the world but the most faithful and with curious reverence we keep up and transmit from generation to generation the superstition of what we call the education of a gentleman  besides the ancient poets you may be sure pen read the english with great gusto smirke sighed and shook his head sadly both about byron and moore but pen was a sworn fireworshipper and a corsair he had them by heart and used to take little laura into the window and say zuleika i am not thy brother in tones so tragic that they caused the solemn little maid to open her great eyes still wider she sat until the proper hour for retirement sewing at mrs pendenniss knee and listening to pen reading out to her of nights without comprehending one word of what he read  he read shakspeare to his mother which she said she liked but didnt and byron and pope and his favourite lalla rookh which pleased her indifferently but as for bishop heber and mrs hemans above all this lady used to melt right away and be absorbed into her pockethandkerchief when pen read those authors to her in his kind boyish voice the christian year was a book which appeared about that time the son and the mother whispered it to each other with awefaint very faint and seldom in afterlife pendennis heard that solemn churchmusic but he always loved the remembrance of it and of the times when it struck on his heart and he walked over the fields full of hope and void of doubt as the churchbells rang on sunday morning  it was at this period of his existence that pen broke out in the poets corner of the county chronicle with some verses with which he was perfectly well satisfied his are the verses signed nep addressed to a tear on the anniversary of the battle of waterloo to madame caradori singing at the assize meetings on saint bartholomews day a tremendous denunciation of popery and a solemn warning to the people of england to rally against emancipating the roman catholics etc etcall which masterpieces mrs pendennis no doubt keeps to this day along with his first socks the first cutting of his hair his bottle and other interesting relics of his infancy he used to gallop rebecca over the neighbouring dumpling downs or into the county town which if you please we shall call chatteris spouting his own poems and filled with quite a byronic afflatus as he thought  his genius at this time was of a decidedly gloomy cast he brought his mother a tragedy in which though he killed sixteen people before the second act it made her laugh so that he thrust the masterpiece into the fire in a pet he projected an epic poem in blank verse cortez or the conqueror of mexico and the incas daughter he wrote part of seneca or the fatal bath and ariadne in naxos classical pieces with choruses and strophes and antistrophes which sadly puzzled poor mrs pendennis and began a history of the jesuits in which he lashed that order with tremendous severity and warned his protestant fellowcountrymen of their machinations his loyalty did his mothers heart good to witness he was a staunch unflinching churchandking man in those days and at the election when sir giles beanfield stood on the blue interest against lord trehawk lord eyries son a whig and a friend of popery arthur pendennis with an immense bow for himself which his mother made and with a blue ribbon for rebecca rode alongside of the reverend doctor portman on his grey mare dowdy and at the head of the clavering voters whom the doctor brought up to plump for the protestant champion  on that day pen made his first speech at the blue hotel and also it appears for the first time in his lifetook a little more wine than was good for him mercy what a scene it was at fairoaks when he rode back at ever so much oclock at night what moving about of lanterns in the courtyard and stables though the moon was shining out what a gathering of servants as pen came home clattering over the bridge and up the stableyard with half a score of the clavering voters yelling after him the blue song of the election  he wanted them all to come in and have some winesome very good madeirasome capital madeirajohn go and get some madeiraand there is no knowing what the farmers would have done had not madam pendennis made her appearance in a white wrapper with a candleand scared those zealous blues so by the sight of her pale handsome face that they touched their hats and rode off  besides these amusements and occupations in which mr pen indulged there was one which forms the main business and pleasure of youth if the poets tell us aright whom pen was always studying and this young fellows heart was so ardent and his imagination so eager that it is not to be expected he should long escape the passion to which we allude and which ladies you have rightly guessed to be that of love pen sighed for it first in secret and like the lovesick swain in ovid opened his breast and said aura veni what generous youth is there that has not courted some such windy mistress in his time  yes pen began to feel the necessity of a first loveof a consuming passionof an object on which he could concentrate all those vague floating fancies under which he sweetly sufferedof a young lady to whom he could really make verses and whom he could set up and adore in place of those unsubstantial ianthes and zuleikas to whom he addressed the outpourings of his gushing muse he read his favourite poems over and over again he called upon alma venus the delight of gods and men he translated anacreons odes and picked out passages suitable to his complaint from waller dryden prior and the like smirke and he were never weary in their interviews of discoursing about love the faithless tutor entertained him with sentimental conversations in place of lectures on algebra and greek for smirke was in love too who could help it being in daily intercourse with such a woman smirke was madly in love as far as such a mild flame as mr smirkes may be called madness with mrs pendennis that honest lady sitting down below stairs teaching little laura to play the piano or devising flannel petticoats for the poor round about her or otherwise busied with the calm routine of her modest and spotless christian life was little aware what storms were brewing in two bosoms upstairs in the studyin pens as he sate in his shooting jacket with his elbows on the green studytable and his hands clutching his curly brown hair homer under his noseand in worthy mr smirkes with whom he was reading here they would talk about helen and andromache andromaches like my mother pen used to avouch but i say smirke by jove id cut off my nose to see helen and he would spout certain favourite lines which the reader will find in their proper place in the third book he drew portraits of herthey are extant stillwith straight noses and enormous eyes and arthur pendennis delineavit et pinxit gallantly written underneath  as for mr smirke he naturally preferred andromache and in consequence he was uncommonly kind to pen he gave him his elzevir horace of which the boy was fond and his little greek testament which his own mamma at clapham had purchased and presented to him he bought him a silver pencilcase and in the matter of learning let him do just as much or as little as ever he pleased he always seemed to be on the point of unbosoming himself to pen nay he confessed to the latter that he had aan attachment an ardently cherished attachment about which pendennis longed to hear and said tell us old chap is she handsome has she got blue eyes or black but doctor portmans curate heaving a gentle sigh cast up his eyes to the ceiling and begged pen faintly to change the conversation poor smirke he invited pen to dine at his lodgings over madame fribsbys the milliners in clavering and once when it was raining and mrs pendennis who had driven in her ponychaise into clavering with respect to some arrangements about leaving off mourning probably was prevailed upon to enter the curates apartments he sent out for poundcakes instantly the sofa on which she sate became sacred to him from that day and he kept flowers in the glass which she drank from ever after  as mrs pendennis was never tired of hearing the praises of her son we may be certain that this rogue of a tutor neglected no opportunity of conversing with her upon that subject it might be a little tedious to him to hear the stories about pens generosity about his bravery in fighting the big naughty boy about his fun and jokes about his prodigious skill in latin music riding etc but what price would he not pay to be in her company and the widow after these conversations thought mr smirke a very pleasing and wellinformed man as for her son she had not settled in her mind whether he was to be senior wrangler and archbishop of canterbury or double first class at oxford and lord chancellor that all england did not possess his peer was a fact about which there was in her mind no manner of question  a simple person of inexpensive habits she began forthwith to save and perhaps to be a little parsimonious in favour of her boy there were no entertainments of course at fairoaks during the year of her weeds nor indeed did the doctors silver dishcovers of which he was so proud and which were flourished all over with the arms of the pendennises and surmounted with their crest come out of the platechests again for long long years the household was diminished and its expenses curtailed there was a very blank anchorite repast when pen dined from home and he himself headed the remonstrance from the kitchen regarding the deteriorated quality of the fairoaks beer she was becoming miserly for pen indeed who ever accused women of being just they are always sacrificing themselves or somebody for somebody elses sake  there happened to be no young woman in the small circle of friends who were in the widows intimacy whom pendennis could by any possibility gratify by endowing her with the inestimable treasure of a heart which he was longing to give away some young fellows in this predicament bestow their young affections upon dolly the dairymaid or cast the eyes of tenderness upon molly the blacksmiths daughter pen thought a pendennis much too grand a personage to stoop so low he was too highminded for a vulgar intrigue and at the idea of an intrigue or a seduction had he ever entertained it his heart would have revolted as from the notion of any act of baseness or dishonour miss minny portman was too old too large and too fond of reading rollins ancient history the miss boardbacks admiral boardbacks daughters of st vincents or fourth of june house as it was called disgusted pen with the london airs which they brought into the country from gloucester place where they passed the season and looked down upon pen as a chit captain glanderss hp 50th dragoon guards three girls were in brownholland pinafores as yet with the ends of their hairplaits tied up in dirty pink ribbon not having acquired the art of dancing the youth avoided such chances as he might have had of meeting with the fair sex at the chatteris assemblies in fine he was not in love because there was nobody at hand to fall in love with and the young monkey used to ride out day after day in quest of dulcinea and peep into the ponychaises and gentlefolks carriages as they drove along the broad turnpike roads with a heart beating within him and a secret tremor and hope that she might be in that yellow postchaise coming swinging up the hill or one of those three girls in beaver bonnets in the back seat of the double gig which the fat old gentleman in black was driving at four miles an hour the postchaise contained a snuffy old dowager of seventy with a maid her contemporary the three girls in the beaver bonnets were no handsomer than the turnips that skirted the roadside do as he might and ride where he would the fairy princess that he was to rescue and win had not yet appeared to honest pen  upon these points he did not discourse to his mother he had a world of his own what generous ardent imaginative soul has not a secret pleasureplace in which it disports let no clumsy prying or dull meddling of ours try to disturb it in our children actaeon was a brute for wanting to push in where diana was bathing leave him occasionally alone my good madam if you have a poet for a child even your admirable advice may be a bore sometimes you are faultless but it does not follow that everybody in your family is to think exactly like yourself yonder little child may have thoughts too deep even for your great mind and fancies so coy and timid that they will not bare themselves when your ladyship sits by  helen pendennis by the force of sheer love divined a great number of her sons secrets but she kept these things in her heart if we may so speak and did not speak of them besides she had made up her mind that he was to marry little laura who would be eighteen when pen was sixandtwenty and had finished his college career and had made his grand tour and was settled either in london astonishing all the metropolis by his learning and eloquence at the bar or better still in a sweet country parsonage surrounded with hollyhocks and roses close to a delightful romantic ivycovered church from the pulpit of which pen would utter the most beautiful sermons ever preached  while these natural sentiments were waging war and trouble in honest pens bosom it chanced one day that he rode into chatteris for the purpose of carrying to the county chronicle a tremendous and thrilling poem for the next weeks paper and putting up his horse according to custom at the stables of the george hotel there he fell in with an old acquaintance a grand black tandem with scarlet wheels came rattling into the inn yard as pen stood there in converse with the hostler about rebecca and the voice of the driver called out hallo pendennis is that you in a loud patronising manner pen had some difficulty in recognising under the broadbrimmed hat and the vast greatcoats and neckcloths with which the newcomer was habited the person and figure of his quondam schoolfellow mr foker  a years absence had made no small difference in that gentleman a youth who had been deservedly whipped a few months previously and who spent his pocketmoney on tarts and hardbake now appeared before pen in one of those costumes to which the public consent that i take to be quite as influential in this respect as johnsons dictionary has awarded the title of swell he had a bulldog between his legs and in his scarlet shawl neckcloth was a pin representing another bulldog in gold he wore a fur waistcoat laced over with gold chains a green cutaway coat with basketbuttons and a white uppercoat ornamented with cheeseplate buttons on each of which was engraved some stirring incident of the road or the chase all which ornaments set off this young fellows figure to such advantage that you would hesitate to say which character in life he most resembled and whether he was a boxer en goguette or a coachman in his gala suit  left that place for good pendennis mr foker said descending from his landau and giving pendennis a finger  yes this yearor more pen said  beastly old hole mr foker remarked hate it hate the doctor hate towzer the second master hate everybody there not a fit place for a gentleman  not at all said pen with an air of the utmost consequence  by gad sir i sometimes dream now that the doctors walking into me foker continued and pen smiled as he thought that he himself had likewise fearful dreams of this nature when i think of the diet there by gad sir i wonder how i stood it mangy mutton brutal beef pudding on thursdays and sundays and that fit to poison you just look at my leaderdid you ever see a prettier animal drove over from baymouth came the nine mile in twoandforty minutes not bad going sir  are you stopping at baymouth foker pendennis asked  im coaching there said the other with a nod  what asked pen and in a tone of such wonder that foker burst out laughing and said he was blowed if he didnt think pen was such a flat as not to know what coaching meant  im come down with a coach from oxford a tutor dont you see old boy hes coaching me and some other men for the little go me and spavin have the drag between us and i thought id just tool over and go to the play did you ever see rowkins do the hornpipe and mr foker began to perform some steps of that popular dance in the inn yard looking round for the sympathy of his groom and the stablemen  pen thought he would like to go to the play too and could ride home afterwards as there was a moonlight so he accepted fokers invitation to dinner and the young men entered the inn together where mr foker stopped at the bar and called upon miss rincer the landladys fair daughter who presided there to give him a glass of his mixture  pen and his family had been known at the george ever since they came into the country and mr pendenniss carriages and horses always put up there when he paid a visit to the county town the landlady dropped the heir of fairoaks a very respectful curtsey and complimented him upon his growth and manly appearance and asked news of the family at fairoaks and of doctor portman and the clavering people to all of which questions the young gentleman answered with much affability but he spoke to mr and mrs rincer with that sort of good nature with which a young prince addresses his fathers subjects never dreaming that those bonnes gens were his equals in life  mr fokers behaviour was quite different he inquired for rincer and the cold in his nose told mrs rincer a riddle asked miss rincer when she would be ready to marry him and paid his compliments to miss brett the other young lady in the bar all in a minute of time and with a liveliness and facetiousness which set all these ladies in a giggle and he gave a cluck expressive of great satisfaction as he tossed off his mixture which miss rincer prepared and handed to him  have a drop said he to pen its recommended to me by the faculty as a whatdoyoucallema stomatic old boy give the young one a glass r and score it up to yours truly  poor pen took a glass and everybody laughed at the face which he made as he put it downgin bitters and some other cordial was the compound with which mr foker was so delighted as to call it by the name of fokers own as pen choked sputtered and made faces the other took occasion to remark to mr rincer that the young fellow was green very green but that he would soon form him and then they proceeded to order dinnerwhich mr foker determined should consist of turtle and venison cautioning the landlady to be very particular about icing the wine  then messrs foker and pen strolled down the high street togetherthe former having a cigar in his mouth which he had drawn out of a case almost as big as a portmanteau he went in to replenish it at mr lewiss and talked to that gentleman for a while sitting down on the counter he then looked in at the fruiterers to see the pretty girl there to whom he paid compliments similar to those before addressed to the bar at the george then they passed the county chronicle office for which pen had his packet ready in the shape of lines to thyrza but poor pen did not like to put the letter into the editors box while walking in company with such a fine gentleman as mr foker they met heavy dragoons of the regiment always quartered at chatteris and stopped and talked about the baymouth balls and what a pretty girl was miss brown and what a dem fine woman mrs jones was it was in vain that pen recalled to his own mind what a stupid ass foker used to be at schoolhow he could scarcely read how he was not cleanly in his person and notorious for his blunders and dulness mr foker was no more like a gentleman now than in his school days and yet pen felt a secret pride in strutting down high street with a young fellow who owned tandems talked to officers and ordered turtle and champagne for dinner he listened and with respect too to mr fokers accounts of what the men did at the university of which mr f was an ornament and encountered a long series of stories about boatracing bumping college grassplats and milkpunchand began to wish to go up himself to college to a place where there were such manly pleasures and enjoyments farmer gurnett who lives close by fairoaks riding by at this minute and touching his hat to pen the latter stopped him and sent a message to his mother to say that he had met with an old schoolfellow and should dine in chatteris  the two young gentlemen continued their walk and were passing round the cathedral yard where they could hear the music of the afternoon service a music which always exceedingly impressed and affected pen but whither mr foker came for the purpose of inspecting the nurserymaids who frequent the elms walk there and who are uncommonly pretty at chatteris and here they strolled until with a final burst of music the small congregation was played out  old doctor portman was one of the few who came from the venerable gate spying pen he came and shook him by the hand and eyed with wonder pens friend from whose mouth and cigar clouds of fragrance issued which curled round the doctors honest face and shovel hat  an old schoolfellow of mine mr foker said pen the doctor said hm and scowled at the cigar he did not mind a pipe in his study but the cigar was an abomination to the worthy gentleman  i came up on bishops business the doctor said well ride home arthur if you like  iim engaged to my friend here pen answered  you had better come home with me said the doctor  his mother knows hes out sir mr foker remarked dont she pendennis  but that does not prove that he had not better come home with me the doctor growled and he walked off with great dignity  old boy dont like the weed i suppose foker said ha whos hereheres the general and bingley the manager how do cos how do bingley  how does my worthy and gallant young foker said the gentleman addressed as the general and who wore a shabby military cape with a mangy collar and a hat cocked very much over one eye  trust you are very well my very dear sir said the other gentleman and that the theatre royal will have the honour of your patronage tonight we perform the stranger in which your humble servant will  cant stand you in tights and hessians bingley young mr foker said on which the general with the irish accent said but i think yell like miss fotheringay in mrs haller or me names not jack costigan  pen looked at these individuals with the greatest interest he had never seen an actor before and he saw dr portmans red face looking over the doctors shoulder as he retreated from the cathedral yard evidently quite dissatisfied with the acquaintances into whose hands pen had fallen  perhaps it would have been much better for him had he taken the parsons advice and company home but which of us knows his fate     chapter iv mrs haller   having returned to the george mr foker and his guest sate down to a handsome repast in the coffeeroom where mr rincer brought in the first dish and bowed as gravely as if he was waiting upon the lordlieutenant of the county mr foker attacked the turtle and venison with as much gusto as he had shown the year before when he used to make feasts off gingerbeer and smuggled polonies pen could not but respect his connoisseurship as he pronounced the champagne to be condemned gooseberry and winked at the port with one eye the latter he declared to be of the right sort and told the waiters there was no way of humbugging him all these attendants he knew by their christian names and showed a great interest in their families and as the london coaches drove up which in those early days used to set off from the george mr foker flung the coffeeroom window open and called the guards and coachmen by their christian names too asking about their respective families and imitating with great liveliness and accuracy the tooting of the horns as jem the ostler whipped the horses cloths off and the carriages drove gaily away  a bottle of sherry a bottle of sham a bottle of port and a shass caffy it aint so bad hay pen foker said and pronounced after all these delicacies and a quantity of nuts and fruit had been dispatched that it was time to toddle pen sprang up with very bright eyes and a flushed face and they moved off towards the theatre where they paid their money to the wheezy old lady slumbering in the moneytakers box mrs dropsicum bingleys motherinlaw great in lady macbeth foker said to his companion foker knew her too  they had almost their choice of places in the boxes of the theatre which was no better filled than country theatres usually are in spite of the universal burst of attraction and galvanic thrills of delight advertised by bingley in the playbills a score or so of people dotted the pitbenches a few more kept a kicking and whistling in the galleries and a dozen others who came in with free admissions were in the boxes where our young gentlemen sate lieutenants rodgers and podgers and young cornet tidmus of the dragoons occupied a private box the performers acted to them and these gentlemen seemed to hold conversations with the players when not engaged in the dialogue and applauded them by name loudly  bingley the manager who assumed all the chief tragic and comic parts except when he modestly retreated to make way for the london stars who came down occasionally to chatteris was great in the character of the stranger he was attired in the tight pantaloons and hessian boots which the stage legend has given to that injured man with a large cloak and beaver and a hearse feather in it drooping over his raddled old face and only partially concealing his great buckled brown wig he had the stage jewellery on too of which he selected the largest and most shiny rings for himself and allowed his little finger to quiver out of his cloak with a sham diamond ring covering the first joint of the finger and twiddling in the faces of the pit bingley made it a favour to the young men of his company to go on in light comedy parts with that ring they flattered him by asking its history the stage has its traditional jewels as the crown and all great families have this had belonged to george frederick cooke who had had it from mr quin who may have bought it for a shilling bingley fancied the world was fascinated with its glitter  he was reading out of the stagebookthat wonderful stagebook which is not bound like any other book in the world but is rouged and tawdry like the hero or heroine who holds it and who holds it as people never do hold books and points with his finger to a passage and wags his head ominously at the audience and then lifts up eyes and finger to the ceiling professing to derive some intense consolation from the work between which and heaven there is a strong affinity anybody who has ever seen one of our great light comedians x in a chintz dressinggown such as nobody ever wore and representing himself to the public as a young nobleman in his apartments and whiling away the time with light literature until his friend sir harry shall arrive or his father shall come down to breakfastanybody i say who has seen the great x over a sham book has indeed had a great pleasure and an abiding matter for thought  directly the stranger saw the young men he acted at them eyeing them solemnly over his gilt volume as he lay on the stagebank showing his hand his ring and his hessians he calculated the effect that every one of these ornaments would produce upon his victims he was determined to fascinate them for he knew they had paid their money and he saw their families coming in from the country and filling the cane chairs in his boxes  as he lay on the bank reading his servant francis made remarks upon his master  again reading said francis thus it is from morn to night to him nature has no beautylife no charm for three years i have never seen him smile the gloom of bingleys face was fearful to witness during these comments of the faithful domestic nothing diverts him o if he would but attach himself to any living thing were it an animalfor something man must love  enter tobias goll from the hut he cries o how refreshing after seven long weeks to feel these warm sunbeams once again thanks bounteous heaven for the joy i taste he presses his cap between his hands looks up and prays the stranger eyes him attentively  francis to the stranger this old mans share of earthly happiness can be but little yet mark how grateful he is for his portion of it  bingley because though old he is but a child in the leadingstring of hope he looks steadily at foker who however continues to suck the top of his stick in an unconcerned manner  francis hope is the nurse of life  bingley and her cradleis the grave  the stranger uttered this with the moan of a bassoon in agony and fixed his eyes on pendennis so steadily that the poor lad was quite put out of countenance he thought the whole house must be looking at him and cast his eyes down as soon as ever he raised them bingleys were at him again all through the scene the manager played at him when he was about to do a good action and sent off francis with his book so that that domestic should not witness the deed of benevolence which he meditated bingley marked the page carefully so that he might continue the perusal of the volume off the stage if he liked but all was done in the direct face of pendennis whom the manager was bent upon subjugating how relieved the lad was when the scene ended and foker tapping with his cane cried out bravo bingley  give him a hand pendennis you know every chap likes a hand mr foker said and the goodnatured young gentleman and pendennis laughing and the dragoons in the opposite box began clapping hands to the best of their power  a chamber in wintersen castle closed over tobiass hut and the stranger and his boots and servants appeared bustling about with chairs and tablesthats hicks and miss thackthwaite whispered foker pretty girl aint she pendennis but stophurraybravo heres the fotheringay  the pit thrilled and thumped its umbrellas a volley of applause was fired from the gallery the dragoon officers and foker clapped their hands furiously you would have thought the house was full so loud were their plaudits the red face and ragged whiskers of mr costigan were seen peering from the sidescene pens eyes opened wide and bright as mrs haller entered with a downcast look then rallying at the sound of the applause swept the house with a grateful glance and folding her hands across her breast sank down in a magnificent curtsey more applause more umbrellas pen this time flaming with wine and enthusiasm clapped hands and sang bravo louder than all mrs haller saw him and everybody else and old mr bows the little first fiddler of the orchestra which was this night increased by a detachment of the band of the dragoons by the kind permission of colonel swallowtail looked up from the desk where he was perched with his crutch beside him and smiled at the enthusiasm of the lad  those who have only seen miss fotheringay in later days since her marriage and introduction into london life have little idea how beautiful a creature she was at the time when our friend pen first set eyes on her and i warn my reader as beforehand that the pencil which illustrates this work and can draw an ugly face tolerably well but is sadly put out when it tries to delineate a beauty can give no sort of notion of her she was of the tallest of women and at her then age of sixandtwentyfor sixandtwenty she was though she vows she was only nineteenin the prime and fulness of her beauty her forehead was vast and her black hair waved over it with a natural ripple that beauties of late days have tried to imitate with the help of the crimpingirons and was confined in shining and voluminous braids at the back of a neck such as you see on the shoulders of the louvre venusthat delight of gods and men her eyes when she lifted them up to gaze on you and ere she dropped their purple deepfringed lids shone with tenderness and mystery unfathomable love and genius seemed to look out from them and then retire coyly as if ashamed to have been seen at the lattice who could have had such a commanding brow but a woman of high intellect she never laughed indeed her teeth were not good but a smile of endless tenderness and sweetness played round her beautiful lips and in the dimples of her cheeks and her lovely chin her nose defied description in those days her ears were like two little pearl shells which the earrings she wore though the handsomest properties in the theatre only insulted she was dressed in long flowing robes of black which she managed and swept to and fro with wonderful grace and out of the folds of which you only saw her sandals occasionally they were of rather a large size but pen thought them as ravishing as the slippers of cinderella but it was her hand and arm that this magnificent creature most excelled in and somehow you could never see her but through them they surrounded her when she folded them over her bosom in resignation when she dropped them in mute agony or raised them in superb command when in sportive gaiety her hands fluttered and waved before her like what shall we saylike the snowy doves before the chariot of venusit was with these arms and hands that she beckoned repelled entreated embraced her admirersno single one for she was armed with her own virtue and with her fathers valour whose sword would have leapt from its scabbard at any insult offered to his childbut the whole house which rose to her as the phrase was as she curtseyed and bowed and charmed it  thus she stood for a minutecomplete and beautifulas pen stared at her i say pen isnt she a stunner asked mr foker  hush pen said shes speaking  she began her business in a deep sweet voice those who know the play of the stranger are aware that the remarks made by the various characters are not valuable in themselves either for their sound sense their novelty of observation or their poetic fancy in fact if a man were to say it was a stupid play he would not be far wrong nobody ever talked so if we meet idiots in life as will happen it is a great mercy that they do not use such absurdly fine words the strangers talk is sham like the book he reads and the hair he wears and the bank he sits on and the diamond ring he makes play withbut in the midst of the balderdash there runs that reality of love children and forgiveness of wrong which will be listened to wherever it is preached and sets all the world sympathising  with what smothered sorrow with what gushing pathos mrs haller delivered her part at first when as count wintersens housekeeper and preparing for his excellencys arrival she has to give orders about the beds and furniture and the dinner etc to be got ready she did so with the calm agony of despair but when she could get rid of the stupid servants and give vent to her feelings to the pit and the house she overflowed to each individual as if he were her particular confidant and she was crying out her griefs on his shoulder the little fiddler in the orchestra whom she did not seem to watch though he followed her ceaselessly twitched twisted nodded pointed about and when she came to the favourite passage i have a william too if he be still aliveah yes if he be still alive his little sisters too why fancy dost thou rack me so why dost thou image my poor children fainting in sickness and crying tototheir mumumother when she came to this passage little bows buried his face in his blue cotton handkerchief after crying out bravo  all the house was affected foker for his part taking out a large yellow bandanna wept piteously as for pen he was gone too far for that he followed the woman about and aboutwhen she was off the stage it and the house were blank the lights and the red officers reeled wildly before his sight he watched her at the sidescenewhere she stood waiting to come on the stage and where her father took off her shawl when the reconciliation arrived and she flung herself down on mr bingleys shoulders whilst the children clung to their knees and the countess mrs bingley and baron steinforth performed with great liveliness and spirit by garbettswhile the rest of the characters formed a group round them pens hot eyes only saw fotheringay fotheringay the curtain fell upon him like a pall he did not hear a word of what bingley said who came forward to announce the play for the next evening and who took the tumultuous applause as usual for himself pen was not even distinctly aware that the house was calling for miss fotheringay nor did the manager seem to comprehend that anybody else but himself had caused the success of the play at last he understood itstepped back with a grin and presently appeared with mrs haller on his arm how beautiful she looked her hair had fallen down the officers threw her flowers she clutched them to her heart she put back her hair and smiled all round her eyes met pens down went the curtain again and she was gone not one note could he hear of the overture which the brass band of the dragoons blew by kind permission of colonel swallowtail  she is a crusher aint she now mr foker asked of his companion  pen did not know exactly what foker said and answered vaguely he could not tell the other what he felt he could not have spoken just then to any mortal besides pendennis did not quite know what he felt yet it was something overwhelming maddening delicious a fever of wild joy and undefined longing  and now rowkins and miss thackthwaite came on to dance the favourite double hornpipe and foker abandoned himself to the delights of this ballet just as he had to the tears of the tragedy a few minutes before pen did not care for it or indeed think about the dance except to remember that that woman was acting with her in the scene where she first came in it was a mist before his eyes at the end of the dance he looked at his watch and said it was time for him to go  hang it stay to see the bravo of the battleaxe foker said bingleys splendid in it he wears red tights and has to carry mrs b over the pinebridge of the cataract only shes too heavy its great fun do stop  pen looked at the bill with one lingering fond hope that miss fotheringays name might be hidden somewhere in the list of the actors of the afterpiece but there was no such name go he must he had a long ride home he squeezed fokers hand he was choking to speak but he couldnt he quitted the theatre and walked frantically about the town he knew not how long then he mounted at the george and rode homewards and clavering clock sang out one as he came into the yard at fairoaks the lady of the house might have been awake but she only heard him from the passage outside his room as he dashed into bed and pulled the clothes over his head  pen had not been in the habit of passing wakeful nights so he at once fell off into a sound sleep even in later days and with a great deal of care and other thoughtful matter to keep him awake a man from long practice or fatigue or resolution begins by going to sleep as usual and gets a nap in advance of anxiety but she soon comes up with him and jogs his shoulder and says come my man no more of this laziness you must wake up and have a talk with me then they fall to together in the midnight well whatever might afterwards happen to him poor little pen was not come to this state yet he tumbled into a sound sleepdid not wake until an early hour in the morning when the rooks began to caw from the little wood beyond his bedroom windows andat that very instant and as his eyes started open the beloved image was in his mind my dear boy he heard her say you were in a sound sleep and i would not disturb you but i have been close by your pillow all this while and i dont intend that you shall leave me i am love i bring with me fever and passion wild longing maddening desire restless craving and seeking many a long day ere this i heard you calling out for me and behold now i am come  was pen frightened at the summons not he he did not know what was coming it was all wild pleasure and delight as yet and as when three years previously and on entering the fifth form at the cistercians his father had made him a present of a gold watch which the boy took from under his pillow and examined on the instant of waking for ever rubbing and polishing it up in private and retiring into corners to listen to its ticking so the young man exulted over his new delight felt in his waistcoat pocket to see that it was safe wound it up at nights and at the very first moment of waking hugged it and looked at itby the way that first watch of pens was a showy illmanufactured piece it never went well from the beginning and was always getting out of order and after putting it aside into a drawer and forgetting it for some time he swapped it finally away for a more useful timekeeper  pen felt himself to be ever so many years older since yesterday there was no mistake about it now he was as much in love as the best hero in the best romance he ever read he told john to bring his shaving water with the utmost confidence he dressed himself in some of his finest clothes that morning and came splendidly down to breakfast patronising his mother and little laura who had been strumming her music lesson for hours before and who after he had read the prayers of which he did not heed one single syllable wondered at his grand appearance and asked him to tell her what the play was about  pen laughed and declined to tell laura what the play was about in fact it was quite as well that she should not know then she asked him why he had got on his fine pin and beautiful new waistcoat  pen blushed and told his mother that the old schoolfellow with whom he had dined at chatteris was reading with a tutor at baymouth a very learned man and as he was himself to go to college and as there were several young men pursuing their studies at baymouthhe was anxious to ride overandand just see what the course of their reading was  laura made a long face helen pendennis looked hard at her son troubled more than ever with the vague doubt and terror which had been haunting her ever since the last night when farmer gurnett brought back the news that pen would not return home to dinner arthurs eyes defied her she tried to console herself and drive off her fears the boy had never told her an untruth pen conducted himself during breakfast in a very haughty and supercilious manner and taking leave of the elder and younger lady was presently heard riding out of the stablecourt he went gently at first but galloped like a madman as soon as he thought that he was out of hearing  smirke thinking of his own affairs and softly riding with his toes out to give pen his three hours reading at fairoaks met his pupil who shot by him like the wind smirkes pony shied as the other thundered past him the gentle curate went over his head among the stingingnettles in the hedge pen laughed as they met pointed towards the baymouth road and was gone half a mile in that direction before poor smirke had picked himself up  pen had resolved in his mind that he must see foker that morning he must hear about her know about her be with somebody who knew her and honest smirke for his part sitting up among the stingingnettles as his pony cropped quietly in the hedge thought dismally to himself ought he to go to fairoaks now that his pupil was evidently gone away for the day yes he thought he might go too he might go and ask mrs pendennis when arthur would be back and hear miss laura her wattss catechism he got up on the little ponyboth were used to his slipping offand advanced upon the house from which his scholar had just rushed away in a whirlwind  thus love makes fools of all of us big and little and the curate had tumbled over head and heels in pursuit of it and pen had started in the first heat of the mad race     chapter v mrs haller at home   without slackening her pace rebecca the mare galloped on to baymouth where pen put her up at the inn stables and ran straightway to mr fokers lodgings which he knew from the direction given to him by that gentleman on the previous day on reaching these apartments which were over a chemists shop whose stock of cigars and sodawater went off rapidly by the kind patronage of his young inmates pen only found mr spavin fokers friend and part owner of the tandem which the latter had driven into chatteris who was smoking and teaching a little dog a friend of his tricks with a bit of biscuit  pens healthy red face fresh from the gallop compared oddly with the waxy debauched little features of fokers chum the latter remarked it whos that man he thought he looks as fresh as a bean his hand dont shake of a morning id bet five to one  foker had not come home at all here was a disappointmentmr spavin could not say when his friend would return sometimes he stopped a day sometimes a week of what college was pen would he have anything there was a very fair tap of ale mr spavin was enabled to know pendenniss name on the card which the latter took out and laid down perhaps pen in these days was rather proud of having a cardand so the young men took leave  then pen went down the rock and walked about on the sand biting his nails by the shore of the muchsounding sea it stretched before him bright and immeasurable the blue waters came rolling into the bay foaming and roaring hoarsely pen looked them in the face with blank eyes hardly regarding them what a tide there was pouring into the lads own mind at the time and what a little power had he to check it pen flung stones into the sea but it still kept coming on he was in a rage at not seeing foker he wanted to see foker he must see foker suppose i go onon the chatteris road just to see if i can meet him pen thought rebecca was saddled in another half hour and galloping on the grass by the chatteris road about four miles from baymouth the clavering road branches off as everybody knows and the mare naturally was for taking that turn but cutting her over the shoulder pen passed the turning and rode on to the turnpike without seeing any sign of the black tandem and red wheels  as he was at the turnpike he might as well go on that was quite clear so pen rode to the george and the hostler told him that mr foker was there sure enough and that hed been a makin a tremendous row the night afore a drinkin and a singin and wanting to fight tom the postboy which im thinking hed have had the worst of it the man added with a grin have you carried up your masters ot water to shave with he added in a very satirical manner to mr fokers domestic who here came down the yard bearing his masters clothes most beautifully brushed and arranged show mr pendennis up to un and pen followed the man at last to the apartment where in the midst of an immense bed mr harry foker lay reposing  the feather bed and bolsters swelled up all round mr foker so that you could hardly see his little sallow face and red silk nightcap  hullo said pen  who goes there brother quickly tell sang out the voice from the bed what pendennis again is your mamma acquainted with your absence did you sup with us last night no stopwho supped with us last night stoopid  there was the three officers sir and mr bingley sir and mr costigan sir the man answered who received all mr fokers remarks with perfect gravity  ah yes the cup and merry jest went round we chanted and i remember i wanted to fight a postboy did i thrash him stoopid  no sir fight didnt come off sir said stoopid still with perfect gravity he was arranging mr fokers dressingcasea trunk the gift of a fond mother without which the young fellow never travelled it contained a prodigious apparatus in plate a silver dish a silver mug silver boxes and bottles for all sorts of essences and a choice of razors ready against the time when mr fokers beard should come  do it some other day said the young fellow yawning and throwing up his little lean arms over his head no there was no fight but there was chanting bingley chanted i chanted the general chantedcostigan i meandid you ever hear him sing the little pig under the bed pen  the man we met yesterday said pen all in a tremor the father of  of the fotheringaythe very man aint she a venus pen  please sir mr costigans in the sittinroom sir and says sir you asked him to breakfast sir called five times sir but wouldnt wake you on no account and has been here since eleven oclock sir  how much is it now  one sir  what would the best of mothers say cried the little sluggard if she saw me in bed at this hour she sent me down here with a grinder she wants me to cultivate my neglected genushe be i say pen this isnt quite like seven oclock schoolis it old boyand the young fellow burst out into a boyish laugh of enjoyment then he addedgo in and talk to the general whilst i dress and i say pendennis ask him to sing you the little pig under the bed its capital pen went off in great perturbation to meet mr costigan and mr foker commenced his toilet  of mr fokers two grandfathers the one from whom he inherited a fortune was a brewer the other was an earl who endowed him with the most doting mother in the world the fokers had been at the cistercian school from father to son at which place our friend whose name could be seen over the playground wall on a publichouse sign under which fokers entire was painted had been dreadfully bullied on account of his trade his uncomely countenance his inaptitude for learning and cleanliness his gluttony and other weak points but those who know how a susceptible youth under the tyranny of his schoolfellows becomes silent and a sneak may understand how in a very few months after his liberation from bondage he developed himself as he had done and became the humorous the sarcastic the brilliant foker with whom we have made acquaintance a dunce he always was it is true for learning cannot be acquired by leaving school and entering at college as a fellowcommoner but he was now in his own peculiar manner as great a dandy as he before had been a slattern and when he entered his sittingroom to join his two guests arrived scented and arrayed in fine linen and perfectly splendid in appearance  general or captain costiganfor the latter was the rank which he preferred to assumewas seated in the window with the newspaper held before him at arms length the captains eyes were somewhat dim and he was spelling the paper with the help of his lips as well as of those bloodshot eyes of his as you see gentlemen do to whom reading is a rare and difficult occupation his hat was cocked very much on one ear and as one of his feet lay up in the windowseat the observer of such matters might remark by the size and shabbiness of the boots which the captain wore that times did not go very well with him poverty seems as if it were disposed before it takes possession of a man entirely to attack his extremities first the coverings of his head feet and hands are its first prey all these parts of the captains person were particularly rakish and shabby as soon as he saw pen he descended from the windowseat and saluted the newcomer first in a military manner by conveying a couple of his fingers covered with a broken black glove to his hat and then removing that ornament altogether the captain was inclined to be bald but he brought a quantity of lank irongrey hair over his pate and had a couple of whisps of the same falling down on each side of his face much whisky had spoiled what complexion mr costigan may have possessed in his youth his once handsome face had now a copper tinge he wore a very high stock scarred and stained in many places and a dresscoat tightly buttoned up in those parts where the buttons had not parted company from the garment  the young gentleman to whom i had the honour to be introjuiced yesterday in the cathadral yard said the captain with a splendid bow and wave of his hat i hope i see you well sir i marked ye in the thayatre last night during me daughters perfawrumance and missed ye on my return i did but conduct her home sir for jack costigan though poor is a gentleman and when i reintered the house to pay me respects to me joyous young friend mr fokerye were gone we had a jolly night of ut sirmr foker the three gallant young dragoons and your umble servant gad sir it put me in mind of one of our old nights when i bore his majestys commission in the foighting hundtherd and third and he pulled out an old snuff box which he presented with a stately air to his new acquaintance  arthur was a great deal too much flurried to speak this shabbylooking buck waswas her father the captain was perfumed with the recollections of the last nights cigars and pulled and twisted the tuft on his chin as jauntily as any young dandy  i hope miss f miss costigan is well sir pen said flushing up sheshe gave me greater pleasure thanthan iii ever enjoyed at a play i think siri think shes the finest actress in the world he gasped out  your hand young man for ye speak from your heart cried the captain thank ye sir an old soldier and a fond father thanks ye she is the finest actress in the world ive seen the siddons sir and the onalethey were great but what were they compared to miss fotheringay i do not wish she should ashume her own name while on the stage me family sir are proud people and the costigans of costiganstown think that an honest man who has borne her majestys colours in the hundred and third would demean himself by permitting his daughter to earn her old fathers bread  there cannot be a more honourable duty surely pen said  honourable bedad sir id like to see the man who said jack costigan would consent to anything dishonourable i have a heart sir though i am poor i like a man who has a heart you have i read it in your honest face and steady eye and would you believe it he added after a pause and with a pathetic whisper that that bingley who has made his fortune by me child gives her but two guineas a week out of which she finds herself in dresses and which added to me own small means makes our all  now the captains means were so small as to be it may be said quite invisible but nobody knows how the wind is tempered to shorn irish lambs and in what marvellous places they find pasture if captain costigan whom i had the honour to know would but have told his history it would have been a great moral story but he neither would have told it if he could nor could if he would for the captain was not only unaccustomed to tell the truthhe was unable even to think itand fact and fiction reeled together in his muzzy whiskified brain  he began life rather brilliantly with a pair of colours a fine person and legs and one of the most beautiful voices in the world to his latest day he sang with admirable pathos and humour those wonderful irish ballads which are so mirthful and so melancholy and was always the first himself to cry at their pathos poor cos he was at once brave and maudlin humorous and an idiot always goodnatured and sometimes almost trustworthy up to the last day of his life he would drink with any man and back any mans bill and his end was in a spunginghouse where the sheriffs officer who took him was fond of him  in his brief morning of life cos formed the delight of regimental messes and had the honour of singing his songs bacchanalian and sentimental at the tables of the most illustrious generals and commandersinchief in the course of which period he drank three times as much claret as was good for him and spent his doubtful patrimony what became of him subsequently to his retirement from the army is no affair of ours i take it no foreigner understands the life of an irish gentleman without money the way in which he manages to keep afloatthe windraising conspiracies in which he engages with heroes as unfortunate as himselfthe means by which he contrives during most days of the week to get his portion of whiskyandwater all these are mysteries to us inconceivable but suffice it to say that through all the storms of life jack had floated somehow and the lamp of his nose had never gone out  before he and pen had had a halfhours conversation the captain managed to extract a couple of sovereigns from the young gentleman for tickets for his daughters benefit which was to take place speedily and was not a bona fide transaction such as that of the last year when poor miss fotheringay had lost fifteen shillings by her venture but was an arrangement with the manager by which the lady was to have the sale of a certain number of tickets keeping for herself a large portion of the sum for which they were sold  pen had but two pounds in his purse and he handed them over to the captain for the tickets he would have been afraid to offer more lest he should offend the latters delicacy costigan scrawled him an order for a box lightly slipped the sovereigns into his waistcoat and slapped his hand over the place where they lay they seemed to warm his old sides  faith sir said he the bullions scarcer with me than it used to be as is the case with many a good fellow i won six hundthred of em in a single night sir when me kind friend his royal highness the duke of kent was in gibralther and he straightway poured out to pen a series of stories regarding the claret drunk the bets made the races ridden by the garrison there with which he kept the young gentleman amused until the arrival of their host and his breakfast  then it was good to see the captains behaviour before the devilled turkey and the mutton chops his stories poured forth unceasingly and his spirits rose as he chatted to the young men when he got a bit of sunshine the old lazzarone basked in it he prated about his own affairs and past splendour and all the lords generals and lordlieutenants he had ever known he described the death of his darling bessie the late mrs costigan and the challenge he had sent to captain shanty clancy of the slashers for looking rude at miss fotheringay as she was on her kyar in the phaynix and then he described how the captain apologised gave a dinner at the kildare street where six of them drank twintyone bottles of claret etc he announced that to sit with two such noble and generous young fellows was the happiness and pride of an old soldiers existence and having had a second glass of curacoa was so happy that he began to cry altogether we should say that the captain was not a man of much strength of mind or a very eligible companion for youth but there are worse men holding much better places in life and more dishonest who have never committed half so many rogueries as he they walked out the captain holding an arm of each of his dear young friends and in a maudlin state of contentment he winked at one or two tradesmens shops where possibly he owed a bill as much as to say see the company im insure ill pay you my boyand they parted finally with mr foker at a billiardroom where the latter had a particular engagement with some gentlemen of colonel swallowtails regiment  pen and the shabby captain still walked the street together the captain in his sly way making inquiries about mr fokers fortune and station in life pen told him how fokers father was a celebrated brewer and his mother was lady agnes milton lord roshervilles daughter the captain broke out into a strain of exaggerated compliment and panegyric about mr foker whose native aristocracie he said could be seen with the twinkling of an oiand only served to adawrun other qualities which he possessed a foin intellect and a generous heartin not one word of which speech did the captain accurately believe  pen walked on listening to his companions prate wondering amused and puzzled it had not as yet entered into the boys head to disbelieve any statement that was made to him and being of a candid nature himself he took naturally for truth what other people told him costigan had never had a better listener and was highly flattered by the attentiveness and modest bearing of the young man  so much pleased was he with the young gentleman so artless honest and cheerful did pen seem to be that the captain finally made him an invitation which he very seldom accorded to young men and asked pen if he would do him the fever to enter his humble abode which was near at hand where the captain would have the honour of inthrojuicing his young friend to his daughther miss fotheringay  pen was so delightfully shocked at this invitation and was so stricken down by the happiness thus suddenly offered to him that he thought he should have dropped from the captains arm at first and trembled lest the other should discover his emotion he gasped out a few incoherent words indicative of the high gratification he should have in being presented to the lady for whosefor whose talents he had conceived such an admirationsuch an extreme admiration and followed the captain scarcely knowing whither that gentleman led him he was going to see her he was going to see her in her was the centre of the universe she was the kernel of the world for pen yesterday before he knew her seemed a period ever so long agoa revolution was between him and that time and a new world about to begin  the captain conducted his young friend to that quiet little street in chatteris which is called priors lane which lies in the ecclesiastical quarter of the town close by deans green and the canons houses and is overlooked by the enormous towers of the cathedral there the captain dwelt modestly in the first floor of a low gabled house on the door of which was the brass plate of creed tailor and robemaker creed was dead however his widow was a pewopener in the cathedral hard by his eldest son was a little scamp of a choirboy who played tosshalfpenny led his little brothers into mischief and had a voice as sweet as an angel a couple of the latter were sitting on the doorstep down which you went into the passage of the house and they jumped up with great alacrity to meet their lodger and plunged wildly and rather to pens surprise at the swallowtails of the captains dresscoat for the truth is that the goodnatured gentleman when he was in cash generally brought home an apple or a piece of gingerbread for these children whereby the widdy never pressed me for rint when not convanient as he remarked afterwards to pen winking knowingly and laying a finger on his nose  pen tumbled down the step and as he followed his companion up the creaking old stair his knees trembled under him he could hardly see when he entered following the captain and stood in the roomin her room he saw something black before him and waving as if making a curtsey and heard but quite indistinctly costigan making a speech over him in which the captain with his usual magniloquence expressed to me child his wish to make her known to his dear and admirable young friend mr awther pindinnis a young gentleman of property in the neighbourhood a person of refoined moind and enviable manners a sincare lover of poethry and a man possest of a feeling and affectionate heart  it is very fine weather miss fotheringay said in an irish accent and with a deep rich melancholy voice  very said mr pendennis in this romantic way their conversation began and he found himself seated on a chair and having leisure to look at the young lady  she looked still handsomer off the stage than before the lamps all her attitudes were naturally grand and majestical if she went and stood up against the mantelpiece her robe draped itself classically round her her chin supported itself on her hand the other lines of her form arranged themselves in full harmonious undulationsshe looked like a muse in contemplation if she sate down on a canebottomed chair her arm rounded itself over the back of the seat her hand seemed as if it ought to have a sceptre put into it the folds of her dress fell naturally round her in order like ladies of honour round a throne and she looked like an empress all her movements were graceful and imperial in the morning you could see her hair was blueblack her complexion of dazzling fairness with the faintest possible blush flickering as it were in her cheek her eyes were grey with prodigious long lashes and as for her mouth mr pendennis has given me subsequently to understand that it was of a staring red colour with which the most brilliant geranium sealingwax or guardsmans coat could not vie  and very warm continued this empress and queen of sheba  mr pen again assented and the conversation rolled on in this manner she asked costigan whether he had had a pleasant evening at the george and he recounted the supper and the tumblers of punch then the father asked her how she had been employing the morning  bows came said she at ten and we studied ophalia its for the twentyfourth when i hope sir we shall have the honour of seeing ye  indeed indeed you will mr pendennis cried wondering that she should say ophalia and speak with an irish inflection of voice naturally who had not the least hibernian accent on the stage  ive secured um for your benefit dear said the captain tapping his waistcoat pocket wherein lay pens sovereigns and winking at pen with one eye at which the boy blushed  mrthe gentlemans very obleging said mrs haller  my name is pendennis said pen blushing iihope youllyoull remember it his heart thumped so as he made this audacious declaration that he almost choked in uttering it  pendennisshe answered slowly and looking him full in the eyes with a glance so straight so clear so bright so killing with a voice so sweet so round so low that the word and the glance shot pen through and through and perfectly transfixed him with pleasure  i never knew the name was so pretty before pen said  tis a very pretty name ophelia said pentweazles not a pretty name remember papa when we were on the norwich circuit young pentweazle who used to play second old men and married miss rancy the columbine theyre both engaged in london now at the queens and get five pounds a week pentweazle wasnt his real name twas judkin gave it him i dont know why his name was harrington that is his real name was potts fawther a clergyman very respectable harrington was in london and got in debt ye remember he came out in falkland to mrs bunces julia  and a pretty julia she was the captain interposed a woman of fifty and a mother of ten children tis you ought to have been julia or my names not jack costigan  i didnt take the leading business then miss fotheringay said modestly i wasnt fit fort till bows taught me  true for you my dear said the captain and bending to pendennis he added rejuiced in circumstances sir i was for some time a fencingmaster in dublin theres only three men in the empire could touch me with the foil once but jack costigans getting old and stiff now sir and my daughter had an engagement at the thayater there and twas there that my friend mr bows who saw her capabilities and is an uncommon cute man gave her lessons in the dramatic art and made her what ye see what have ye done since bows went emily  sure ive made a pie emily said with perfect simplicity she pronounced it poy  if yell try it at four oclock sir say the word said costigan gallantly that girl sir makes the best veal and ham pie in england and i think i can promise ye a glass of punch of the right flavour  pen had promised to be at home to dinner at six oclock but the rascal thought he could accommodate pleasure and duty in this point and was only too eager to accept this invitation he looked on with delight and wonder whilst ophelia busied herself about the room and prepared for the dinner she arranged the glasses and laid and smoothed the little cloth all which duties she performed with a quiet grace and good humour which enchanted her guest more and more the poy arrived from the bakers in the hands of one of the little choirboys brothers at the proper hour and at four oclock pen found himself at dinneractually at dinner with the greatest tragic actress in the world and her fatherwith the handsomest woman in all creationwith his first and only love whom he had adored ever since whenever since yesterday ever since for ever he ate a crust of her making he poured her out a glass of beer he saw her drink a glass of punchjust one wineglass fullout of the tumbler which she mixed for her papa she was perfectly goodnatured and offered to mix one for pendennis too it was prodigiously strong pen had never in his life drunk so much spirits and water was it the punch or the punchmaker who intoxicated him  during dinner when the captain whom his daughter treated most respectfully ceased prattling about himself and his adventures pen tried to engage the fotheringay in conversation about poetry and about her profession he asked her what she thought of ophelias madness and whether she was in love with hamlet or not in love with such a little ojous wretch as that stunted manager of a bingley she bristled with indignation at the thought pen explained it was not of her he spoke but of ophelia of the play oh indeed if no offence was meant none was taken but as for bingley indeed she did not value himnot that glass of punch pen next tried her on kotzebue kotzebue who was hethe author of the play in which she had been performing so admirably she did not know thatthe mans name at the beginning of the book was thompson she said pen laughed at her adorable simplicity he told her of the melancholy fate of the author of the play and how sand had killed him it was for the first time in her life that miss costigan had ever heard of mr kotzebues existence but she looked as if she was very much interested and her sympathy sufficed for honest pen  and in the midst of this simple conversation the hour and a quarter which poor pen could afford to allow himself passed away only too quickly and he had taken leave he was gone and away on his rapid road homewards on the back of rebecca she was called upon to show her mettle in the three journeys which she made that day  what was that he was talking about the madness of hamlet and the theory of the great german critic on the subject emily asked of her father  deed then i dont know milly dear answered the captain well ask bows when he comes  anyhow hes a nice fairspoken pretty young man the lady said how many tickets did he take of you  faith then he took six and gev me two guineas milly the captain said i suppose them young chaps is not too flush of coin  hes full of booklearning miss fotheringay continued kotzebue he he what a droll name indeed now and the poor fellow killed by sand too did ye ever hear such a thing ill ask bows about it papa dear  a queer death sure enough ejaculated the captain and changed the painful theme tis an elegant mare the young gentleman rides costigan went on to say and a grand breakfast intirely that young mister foker gave us  hes good for two private boxes and at leest twenty tickets i should say cried the daughter a prudent lass who always kept her fine eyes on the main chance  ill go bail of that answered the papa and so their conversation continued awhile until the tumbler of punch was finished and their hour of departure soon came too for at halfpast six miss fotheringay was to appear at the theatre again whither her father always accompanied her and stood as we have seen in the sidescene watching her and drank spiritsandwater in the greenroom with the company there  how beautiful she is thought pen cantering homewards how simple and how tender how charming it is to see a woman of her commanding genius busying herself with the delightful though humble offices of domestic life cooking dishes to make her old father comfortable and brewing drink for him with her delicate fingers how rude it was of me to begin to talk about professional matters and how well she turned the conversation by the way she talked about professional matters herself but then with what fun and humour she told the story of her comrade pentweazle as he was called there is no humour like irish humour her father is rather tedious but thoroughly amiable and how fine of him giving lessons in fencing after he quitted the army where he was the pet of the duke of kent fencing i should like to continue my fencing or i shall forget what angelo taught me uncle arthur always liked me to fencehe says it is the exercise of a gentleman hang it ill take some lessons of captain costigan go along rebeccaup the hill old lady pendennis pendennishow she spoke the word emily emily how good how noble how beautiful how perfect she is  now the reader who has had the benefit of overhearing the entire conversation which pen had with miss fotheringay can judge for himself about the powers of her mind and may perhaps be disposed to think that she has not said anything astonishingly humorous or intellectual in the course of the above interview she has married and taken her position in the world as the most spotless and irreproachable lady since and i have had the pleasure of making her acquaintance and must certainly own against my friend pens opinion that his adored emily is not a clever woman the truth is she had not only never heard of kotzebue but she had never heard of farquhar or congreve or any dramatist in whose plays she had not a part and of these dramas she only knew the part which concerned herself a wag once told her that dante was born at algiers and asked herwhich dr johnson wrote first irene or every man in his humour but she had the best of the joke for she had never heard of irene or every man in his humour or dante or perhaps algiers it was all one to her she acted what little bows told herwhere he told her to sob she sobbedwhere he told her to laugh she laughed she gave the tirade or the repartee without the slightest notion of its meaning she went to church and goes every sunday with a reputation perfectly intact and was and is as guiltless of sense as of any other crime  but what did our pen know of these things he saw a pair of bright eyes and he believed in thema beautiful image and he fell down and worshipped it he supplied the meaning which her words wanted and created the divinity which he loved was titania the first who fell in love with an ass or pygmalion the only artist who has gone crazy about a stone he had found her he had found what his soul thirsted after he flung himself into the stream and drank with all his might let those say who have been thirsty once how delicious that first draught is as he rode down the avenue towards homepen shrieked with laughter as he saw the reverend mr smirke once more coming demurely away from fairoaks on his pony smirke had dawdled and stayed at the cottages on the way and then dawdled with laura over her lessonsand then looked at mrs pendenniss gardens and improvements until he had perfectly bored out that lady and he had taken his leave at the very last minute without that invitation to dinner which he fondly expected  pen was full of kindness and triumph what picked up and sound he cried out laughing come along back old fellow and eat my dinneri have had mine but we will have a bottle of the old wine and drink her health smirke  poor smirke turned the ponys head round and jogged along with arthur his mother was charmed to see him in such high spirits and welcomed mr smirke for his sake when arthur said he had forced the curate back to dine he gave a most ludicrous account of the play of the night before and of the acting of bingley the manager in his rickety hessians and the enormous mrs bingley as the countess in rumpled green satin and a polish cap he mimicked them and delighted his mother and little laura who clapped her hands with pleasure  and mrs haller said mrs pendennis  shes a stunner maam pen said laughing and using the words of his revered friend mr foker  a what arthur asked the lady  what is a stunner arthur cried laura in the same voice  so he gave them a queer account of mr foker and how he used to be called vats and grains and by other contumelious names at school and how he was now exceedingly rich and a fellow commoner at st boniface but gay and communicative as he was mr pen did not say one syllable about his ride to chatteris that day or about the new friends whom he had made there  when the two ladies retired pen with flashing eyes filled up two great bumpers of madeira and looking smirke full in the face said heres to her  heres to her said the curate with a sigh lifting the glass and emptying it so that his face was a little pink when he put it down  pen had even less sleep that night than on the night before in the morning and almost before dawn he went out and saddled that unfortunate rebecca himself and rode her on the downs like mad again love had roused himand said awake pendennis i am here that charming feverthat delicious longingand fire and uncertainty he hugged them to himhe would not have lost them for all the world     chapter vi contains both love and war   cicero and euripides did not occupy mr pen much for some time after this and honest mr smirke had a very easy time with his pupil rebecca was the animal who suffered most in the present state of pens mind for besides those days when he could publicly announce his intention of going to chatteris to take a fencinglesson and went thither with the knowledge of his mother whenever he saw three hours clear before him the young rascal made a rush for the city and found his way to priors lane he was as frantic with vexation when rebecca went lame as richard at bosworth when his horse was killed under him and got deeply into the books of the man who kept the huntingstables at chatteris for the doctoring of his own and the hire of another animal  then and perhaps once in a week under pretence of going to read a greek play with smirke this young reprobate set off so as to be in time for the competitor down coach stayed a couple of hours in chatteris and returned on the rival which left for london at ten at night once his secret was nearly lost by smirkes simplicity of whom mrs pendennis asked whether they had read a great deal the night before or a question to that effect smirke was about to tell the truth that he had never seen mr pen at all when the latters bootheel came grinding down on mr smirkes toe under the table and warned the curate not to betray him  they had had conversations on the tender subject of course it is good sport if you are not yourself engaged in the conversation to hear two men in love talk there must be a confidant and depositary somewhere when informed under the most solemn vows of secrecy of pens condition of mind the curate said with no small tremor that he hoped it was no unworthy objectno unlawful attachment which pen had formedfor if so the poor fellow felt it would be his duty to break his vow and inform pens mother and then there would be a quarrel he felt with sickening apprehension and he would never again have a chance of seeing what he most liked in the world  unlawful unworthy pen bounced out at the curates question she is as pure as she is beautiful i would give my heart to no other woman i keep the matter a secret in my family becausebecausethere are reasons of a weighty nature which i am not at liberty to disclose but any man who breathes a word against her purity insults both her honour and mine andand dammy i wont stand it  smirke with a faint laugh only said well well dont call me out arthur for you know i cant fight but by this compromise the wretched curate was put more than ever into the power of his pupil and the greek and mathematics suffered correspondingly  if the reverend gentleman had had much discernment and looked into the poets corner of the county chronicle as it arrived in the wednesdays bag he might have seen mrs haller passion and genius lines to miss fotheringay of the theatre royal appearing every week and other verses of the most gloomy thrilling and passionate cast but as these poems were no longer signed nep by their artful composer but subscribed eros neither the tutor nor helen the good soul who cut all her sons verses out of the paper knew that nep was no other than that flaming eros who sang so vehemently the character of the new actress  who is the lady at last asked mrs pendennis whom your rival is always singing in the county chronicle he writes something like you dear pen but yours is much the best have you seen miss fotheringay  pen said yes he had that night he went to see the stranger she acted mrs haller by the way she was going to have a benefit and was to appear in opheliasuppose we were to goshakspeare you know motherwe can get horses from the clavering arms little laura sprang up with delight she longed for a play  pen introduced shakspeare you know because the deceased pendennis as became a man of his character professed an uncommon respect for the bard of avon in whose works he safely said there was more poetry than in all johnsons poets put together and though mr pendennis did not much read the works in question yet he enjoined pen to peruse them and often said what pleasure he should have when the boy was of a proper age in taking him and mother to see some good plays of the immortal poet  the ready tears welled up in the kind mothers eyes as she remembered these speeches of the man who was gone she kissed her son fondly and said she would go laura jumped for joy was pen happywas he ashamed as he held his mother to him he longed to tell her all but he kept his counsel he would see how his mother liked her the play should be the thing and he would try his mother like hamlets  helen in her good humour asked mr smirke to be of the party that ecclesiastic had been bred up by a fond parent at clapham who had an objection to dramatic entertainments and he had never yet seen a play but shakspearebut to go with mrs pendennis in her carriage and sit a whole night by her sidehe could not resist the idea of so much pleasure and made a feeble speech in which he spoke of temptation and gratitude and finally accepted mrs pendenniss most kind offer as he spoke he gave her a look which made her exceedingly uncomfortable she had seen that look more than once of late pursuing her he became more positively odious every day in the widows eyes  we are not going to say a great deal about pens courtship of miss fotheringay for the reader has already had a specimen of her conversation much of which need surely not be reported pen sate with her hour after hour and poured forth all his honest boyish soul to her everything he knew or hoped or felt or had read or fancied he told to her he never tired of talking and longing one after another as his thoughts rose in his hot eager brain he clothed them in words and told them to her her part of the teteatete was not to talk but to appear as if she understood what pen talked a difficult matter for the young fellow blurted out no small quantity of nonsense and to look exceedingly handsome and sympathising the fact is whilst he was making one of his tiradesand delighted perhaps and wondering at his own eloquence the lad would go on for twenty minutes at a timethe lovely emily who could not comprehend a tenth part of his talk had leisure to think about her own affairs and would arrange in her own mind how they should dress the cold mutton or how she would turn the black satin or make herself out of her scarf a bonnet like miss thackthwaites new one and so forth pen spouted byron and moore passion and poetry her business was to throw up her eyes or fixing them for a moment on his face to cry oh tis beautiful ah how exquisite repeat those lines again and off the boy went and she returned to her own simple thoughts about the turned gown or the hashed mutton  in fact pens passion was not long a secret from the lovely emily or her father upon his second visit his admiration was quite evident to both of them and on his departure the old gentleman said to his daughter as he winked at her over his glass of grog faith milly darling i think yeve hooked that chap  pooh tis only a boy papa dear milly remarked sure hes but a child pen would have been very much pleased if he had heard that phrasehe was galloping home wild with pleasure and shouting out her name as he rode  yeve hooked um any how said the captain and let me tell ye hes not a bad fish i asked tom at the george and flint the grocer where his mother dalesfine fortunedrives in her chariotsplendid park and groundsfairoaks parkonly sonproperty all his own at twentyoneye might go further and not fare so well miss fotheringay  them boys are mostly talk said milly seriously ye know at dublin how ye went on about young poldoody and ive a whole desk full of verses he wrote me when he was in trinity college but he went abroad and his mother married him to an englishwoman  lord poldoody was a young nobleman and in them its natural and ye werent in the position in which ye are now milly dear but ye mustnt encourage this young chap too much for bedad jack costigan wont have any thrilling with his daughter  no more will his daughter papa you may be sure of that milly said a little sip more of the punchsure tis beautiful ye neednt be afraid about the young chapi think im old enough to take care of myself captain costigan  so pen used to come day after day rushing in and galloping away and growing more wild about the girl with every visit sometimes the captain was present at their meetings but having a perfect confidence in his daughter he was more often inclined to leave the young couple to themselves and cocked his hat over his eye and strutted off on some errand when pen entered how delightful those interviews were the captains drawingroom was a low wainscoted room with a large window looking into the deans garden there pen sate and talkedand talkedemily looking beautiful as she sate at her worklooking beautiful and calm and the sunshine came streaming in at the great windows and lighted up her superb face and form in the midst of the conversation the great bell would begin to boom and he would pause smiling and be silent until the sound of the vast music died awayor the rooks in the cathedral elms would make a great noise towards sunsetor the sound of the organ and the choristers would come over the quiet air and gently hush pens talking  by the way it must be said that miss fotheringay in a plain shawl and a close bonnet and veil went to church every sunday of her life accompanied by her indefatigable father who gave the responses in a very rich and fine brogue joined in the psalms and chanting and behaved in the most exemplary manner  little bows the housefriend of the family was exceedingly wroth at the notion of miss fotheringays marriage with a stripling seven or eight years her junior bows who was a cripple and owned that he was a little more deformed even than bingley the manager so that he could not appear on the stage was a singular wild man of no small talents and humour attracted first by miss fotheringays beauty he began to teach her how to act he shrieked out in his cracked voice the parts and his pupil learned them from his lips by rote and repeated them in her full rich tones he indicated the attitudes and set and moved those beautiful arms of hers those who remember this grand actress on the stage can recall how she used always precisely the same gestures looks and tones how she stood on the same plank of the stage in the same position rolled her eyes at the same instant and to the same degree and wept with precisely the same heartrending pathos and over the same pathetic syllable and after she had come out trembling with emotion before the audience and looking so exhausted and tearful that you fancied she would faint with sensibility she would gather up her hair the instant she was behind the curtain and go home to a muttonchop and a glass of brown stout and the harrowing labours of the day over she went to bed and snored as resolutely and as regularly as a porter  bows then was indignant at the notion that his pupil should throw her chances away in life by bestowing her hand upon a little country squire as soon as a london manager saw her he prophesied that she would get a london engagement and a great success the misfortune was that the london managers had seen her she had played in london three years before and failed from utter stupidity since then it was that bows had taken her in hand and taught her part after part how he worked and screamed and twisted and repeated lines over and over again and with what indomitable patience and dulness she followed him she knew that he made her and let herself be made she was not grateful or ungrateful or unkind or illhumoured she was only stupid and pen was madly in love with her  the posthorses from the clavering arms arrived in due time and carried the party to the theatre at chatteris where pen was gratified in perceiving that a tolerably large audience was assembled the young gentlemen from baymouth had a box in the front of which sate mr foker and his friend mr spavin splendidly attired in the most fullblown evening costume they saluted pen in a cordial manner and examined his party of which they approved for little laura was a pretty little redcheeked girl with a quantity of shining brown ringlets and mrs pendennis dressed in black velvet with the diamond cross which she sported on great occasions looked uncommonly handsome and majestic behind these sate mr arthur and the gentle smirke with the curl reposing on his fair forehead and his white tie in perfect order he blushed to find himself in such a placebut how happy was he to be there he and mrs pendennis brought books of hamlet with them to follow the tragedy as is the custom of honest countryfolks who go to a play in state samuel coachman groom and gardener to mr pendennis took his place in the pit where mr fokers man was also visible it was dotted with noncommissioned officers of the dragoons whose band by kind permission of colonel swallowtail were as usual in the orchestra and that corpulent and distinguished warrior himself with his waterloo medal and a number of his young men made a handsome show in the boxes  who is that oddlooking person bowing to you arthur mrs pendennis asked of her son  pen blushed a great deal his name is captain costigan maam he saida peninsular officer in fact it was the captain in a new shoot of clothes as he called them and with a large pair of white kid gloves one of which he waved to pendennis whilst he laid the other sprawling over his heart and coatbuttons pen did not say any more and how was mrs pendennis to know that mr costigan was the father of miss fotheringay  mr hornbull from london was the hamlet of the night mr bingley modestly contenting himself with the part of horatio and reserving his chief strength for william in blackeyed susan which was the second piece  we have nothing to do with the play except to say that ophelia looked lovely and performed with admirable wild pathos laughing weeping gazing wildly waving her beautiful white arms and flinging about her snatches of flowers and songs with the most charming madness what an opportunity her splendid black hair had of tossing over her shoulders she made the most charming corpse ever seen and while hamlet and laertes were battling in her grave she was looking out from the back scenes with some curiosity towards pens box and the family party assembled in it  there was but one voice in her praise there mrs pendennis was in ecstasies with her beauty little laura was bewildered by the piece and the ghost and the play within the play during which as hamlet lay at ophelias knee pen felt that he would have liked to strangle mr hornbull but cried out great praises of that beautiful young creature pen was charmed with the effect which she produced on his motherand the clergyman for his part was exceedingly enthusiastic  when the curtain fell upon that group of slaughtered personages who are despatched so suddenly at the end of hamlet and whose demise astonished poor little laura not a little there was an immense shouting and applause from all quarters of the house the intrepid smirke violently excited clapped his hands and cried out bravo bravo as loud as the dragoon officers themselves these were greatly movedils sagitaient sur leurs bancsto borrow a phrase from our neighbours they were led cheering into action by the portly swallowtail who waved his capthe noncommissioned officers in the pit of course gallantly following their chiefs there was a roar of bravos rang through the house pen bellowing with the loudest fotheringay fotheringay and messrs spavin and foker giving the viewhalloo from their box even mrs pendennis began to wave about her pockethandkerchief and little laura danced laughed clapped and looked up at pen with wonder  hornbull led the beneficiaire forward amidst bursts of enthusiasmand she looked so handsome and radiant with her hair still over her shoulders that pen hardly could contain himself for rapture and he leaned over his mothers chair and shouted and hurrayed and waved his hat it was all he could do to keep his secret from helen and not say look thats the woman isnt she peerless i tell you i love her but he disguised these feelings under an enormous bellowing and hurraying  as for miss fotheringay and her behaviour the reader is referred to a former page for an account of that she went through precisely the same business she surveyed the house all round with glances of gratitude and trembled and almost sank with emotion over her favourite trapdoor she seized the flowers foker discharged a prodigious bouquet at her and even smirke made a feeble shy with a rose and blushed dreadfully when it fell into the pit she seized the flowers and pressed them to her swelling heartetc etcin a wordwe refer the reader to earlier pages twinkling in her breast poor old pen saw a locket which he had bought of mr nathan in high street with the last shilling he was worth and a sovereign borrowed from smirke  blackeyed susan followed at which sweet story our gentlehearted friends were exceedingly charmed and affected and in which susan with a russet gown and a pink ribbon in her cap looked to the full as lovely as ophelia bingley was great in william goll as the admiral looked like the figurehead of a seventyfour and garbetts as captain boldweather a miscreant who forms a plan for carrying off blackeyed susan and waving an immense cocked hat says come what may he will be the ruin of herall these performed their parts with their accustomed talent and it was with a sincere regret that all our friends saw the curtain drop down and end that pretty and tender story  if pen had been alone with his mother in the carriage as they went home he would have told her all that night but he sate on the box in the moonshine smoking a cigar by the side of smirke who warmed himself with a comforter mr fokers tandem and lamps whirled by the sober old clavering posters as they were a couple of miles on their road home and mr spavin saluted mrs pendenniss carriage with some considerable variations of rule britannia on the keybugle  it happened two days after the above gaieties that mr dean of chatteris entertained a few select clerical friends at dinner at his deanery home that they drank uncommonly good port wine and abused the bishop over their dessert are very likely matters but with such we have nothing at present to do our friend doctor portman of clavering was one of the deans guests and being a gallant man and seeing from his place at the mahogany the deans lady walking up and down the grass with her children sporting around her and her pink parasol over her lovely headthe doctor stept out of the french windows of the diningroom into the lawn which skirts that apartment and left the other white neckcloths to gird at my lord bishop then the doctor went up and offered mrs dean his arm and they sauntered over the ancient velvet lawn which had been mowed and rolled for immemorial deans in that easy quiet comfortable manner in which people of middle age and good temper walk after a good dinner in a calm golden summer evening when the sun has but just sunk behind the enormous cathedraltowers and the sickleshaped moon is growing every instant brighter in the heavens  now at the end of the deans garden there is as we have stated mrs creeds house and the windows of the firstfloor room were open to admit the pleasant summer air a young lady of sixandtwenty whose eyes were perfectly wide open and a luckless boy of eighteen blind with love and infatuation were in that chamber together in which persons as we have before seen them in the same place the reader will have no difficulty in recognising mr arthur pendennis and miss costigan  the poor boy had taken the plunge trembling with passionate emotion his heart beating and throbbing fiercely tears rushing forth in spite of him his voice almost choking with feeling poor pen had said those words which he could withhold no more and flung himself and his whole store of love and admiration and ardour at the feet of this mature beauty is he the first who has done so have none before or after him staked all their treasure of life as a savage does his land and possessions against a draught of the fairskins firewater or a couple of bauble eyes  does your mother know of this arthur said miss fotheringay slowly he seized her hand madly and kissed it a thousand times she did not withdraw it does the old lady know it miss costigan thought to herself well perhaps she may and then she remembered what a handsome diamond cross mrs pendennis had on the night of the play and thought sure twill go in the family  calm yourself dear arthur she said in her low rich voice and sniffled sweetly and gravely upon him then with her disengaged hand she put the hair lightly off his throbbing forehead he was in such a rapture and whirl of happiness that he could hardly speak at last he gasped out my mother has seen you and admires you beyond measure she will learn to love you soon who can do otherwise she will love you because i do  deed then i think you do said miss costigan perhaps with a sort of pity for pen  think she did of course here mr pen went off into a rhapsody through which as we have perfect command over our own feelings we have no reason to follow the lad of course love truth and eternity were produced and words were tried but found impossible to plumb the tremendous depth of his affection this speech we say is no business of ours it was most likely not very wise but what right have we to overhear let the poor boy fling out his simple heart at the womans feet and deal gently with him it is best to love wisely no doubt but to love foolishly is better than not to be able to love at all some of us cant and are proud of our impotence too  at the end of his speech pen again kissed the imperial hand with raptureand i believe it was at this very moment and while mrs dean and doctor portman were engaged in conversation that young master ridley roset her son pulled his mother by the back of her capacious dress and said  i say ma look up thereand he waggled his innocent head  that was indeed a view from the deans garden such as seldom is seen by deansor is written in chapters there was poor pen performing a salute upon the rosy fingers of his charmer who received the embrace with perfect calmness and good humour master ridley looked up and grinned little miss rosa looked at her brother and opened the mouth of astonishment mrs deans countenance defied expression and as for dr portman when he beheld the scene and saw his prime favourite and dear pupil pen he stood mute with rage and wonder  mrs haller spied the party below at the same moment and gave a start and a laugh sure theres somebody in the deans garden she cried out and withdrew with perfect calmness whilst pen darted away with his face glowing like coals the garden party had reentered the house when he ventured to look out again the sickle moon was blazing bright in the heavens then the stars were glittering the bell of the cathedral tolling nine the deans guests all save one who had called for his horse dumpling and ridden off early were partaking of tea and buttered cakes in mrs deans drawingroomwhen pen took leave of miss costigan  pen arrived at home in due time afterwards and was going to slip off to bed for the poor lad was greatly worn and agitated and his highstrung nerves had been at almost a maddening pitch when a summons came to him by john the old footman whose countenance bore a very ominous look that his mother must see him below  on this he tied on his neckcloth again and went downstairs to the drawingroom there sate not only his mother but her friend the reverend doctor portman helens face looked very pale by the light of the lampthe doctors was flushed on the contrary and quivering with anger and emotion  pen saw at once that there was a crisis and that there had been a discovery now for it he thought  where have you been arthur helen said in a trembling voice  how can you look thatthat dear lady and a christian clergyman in the face sir bounced out the doctor in spite of helens pale appealing looks where has he been where his mothers son should have been ashamed to go for your mothers an angel sir an angel how dare you bring pollution into her house and make that spotless creature wretched with the thoughts of your crime  sir said pen  dont deny it sir roared the doctor dont add lies sir to your other infamy i saw you myself sir i saw you from the deans garden i saw you kissing the hand of that infernal painted  stop pen said clapping his fist on the table till the lamp flickered up and shook i am a very young man but you will please to remember that i am a gentlemani will hear no abuse of that lady  lady sir cried the doctor that a ladyyouyouyou stand in your mothers presence and call thatthat woman a lady  in anybodys presence shouted out pen she is worthy of any place she is as pure as any woman she is as good as she is beautiful if any man but you insulted her i would tell him what i thought but as you are my oldest friend i suppose you have the privilege to doubt of my honour  no no pen dearest pen cried out helen in an excess of joy i told i told you doctor he was notnot what you thought and the tender creature coming trembling forward flung herself on pens shoulder  pen felt himself a man and a match for all the doctors in doctordom he was glad this explanation had come you saw how beautiful she was he said to his mother with a soothing protecting air like hamlet with gertrude in the play i tell you dear mother she is as good when you know her you will say so she is of all except you the simplest the kindest the most affectionate of women why should she not be on the stageshe maintains her father by her labour  drunken old reprobate growled the doctor but pen did not hear or heed  if you could see as i have how orderly her life is how pure and pious her whole conduct you wouldas i doyes as i dowith a savage look at the doctorspurn the slanderer who dared to do her wrong her father was an officer and distinguished himself in spain he was a friend of his royal highness the duke of kent and is intimately known to the duke of wellington and some of the first officers of our army he has met my uncle arthur at lord hills he thinks his own family is one of the most ancient and respectable in ireland and indeed is as good as our own the costigans were kings of ireland  why god bless my soul shrieked out the doctor hardly knowing whether to burst with rage or laughter you dont mean to say you want to marry her  pen put on his most princely air what else dr portman he said do you suppose would be my desire  utterly foiled in his attack and knocked down by this sudden lunge of pens the doctor could only gasp out mrs pendennis maam send for the major  send for the major with all my heart said arthur prince of pendennis and grand duke of fairoaks with a most superb wave of the hand and the colloquy terminated by the writing of those two letters which were laid on major pendenniss breakfasttable in london at the commencement of prince arthurs most veracious history     chapter vii in which the major makes his appearance   our acquaintance major arthur pendennis arrived in due time at fairoaks after a dreary night passed in the mailcoach where a stout fellowpassenger swelling preternaturally with greatcoats had crowded him into a corner and kept him awake by snoring indecently where a widow lady opposite had not only shut out the fresh air by closing all the windows of the vehicle but had filled the interior with fumes of jamaica rum and water which she sucked perpetually from a bottle in her reticule where whenever he caught a brief moment of sleep the twanging of the horn at the turnpikegates or the scuffling of his huge neighbour wedging him closer and closer or the play of the widows feet on his own tender toes speedily woke up the poor gentleman to the horrors and realities of lifea life which has passed away now and become impossible and only lives in fond memories eight miles an hour for twenty or fiveandtwenty hours a tight mailcoach a hard seat a gouty tendency a perpetual change of coachmen grumbling because you did not fee them enough a fellowpassenger partial to spiritsandwaterwho has not borne with these evils in the jolly old times and how could people travel under such difficulties and yet they did and were merry too next the widow and by the side of the majors servant on the roof were a couple of schoolboys going home for the midsummer holidays and major pendennis wondered to see them sup at the inn at bagshot where they took in a cargo of ham eggs pie pickles tea coffee and boiled beef which surprised the poor major sipping a cup of very feeble tea and thinking with a tender dejection that lord steynes dinner was coming off at that very moment the ingenuous ardour of the boys however amused the major who was very goodnatured and he became the more interested when he found that the one who travelled inside with him was a lords son whose noble father pendennis of course had met in the world of fashion which he frequented the little lord slept all night through in spite of the squeezing and the hornblowing and the widow and he looked as fresh as paint and indeed pronounced himself to be so when the major with a yellow face a bristly beard a wig out of curl and strong rheumatic griefs shooting through various limbs of his uneasy body descended at the little lodgegate at fairoaks where the porteress and gardeners wife reverentially greeted him and still more respectfully mr morgan his man  helen was on the lookout for this expected guest and saw him from her window but she did not come forward immediately to greet him she knew the major did not like to be seen at a surprise and required a little preparation before he cared to be visible pen when a boy had incurred sad disgrace by carrying off from the majors dressingtable a little morocco box which it must be confessed contained the majors back teeth which he naturally would leave out of his jaws in a jolting mailcoach and without which he would not choose to appear morgan his man made a mystery of mystery of his wigs curling them in private places introducing them mysteriously to his masters roomnor without his head of hair would the major care to show himself to any member of his family or any acquaintance he went to his apartment then and supplied these deficiencies he groaned and moaned and wheezed and cursed morgan through his toilet as an old buck will who has been up all night with a rheumatism and has a long duty to perform and finally being belted curled and set straight he descended upon the drawingroom with a grave majestic air such as befitted one who was at once a man of business and a man of fashion  pen was not there however only helen and little laura sewing at her knees and to whom he never presented more than a forefinger as he did on this occasion after saluting his sisterinlaw laura took the finger trembling and dropped itand then fled out of the room major pendennis did not want to keep her or indeed to have her in the house at all and had his private reason for disapproving of her which we may mention on some future occasion meanwhile laura disappeared and wandered about the premises seeking for pen whom she presently found in the orchard pacing up and down a walk there in earnest conversation with mr smirke he was so occupied that he did not hear lauras clear voice singing out until smirke pulled him by the coat and pointed towards her as she came running  she ran up and put her hand into his come in pen she said theres somebody come uncle arthurs come  he is is he said pen and she felt him grasp her little hand he looked round at smirke with uncommon fierceness as much as to say i am ready for him or any manmr smirke cast up his eyes as usual and heaved a gentle sigh  lead on laura pen said with a half fierce half comic airlead on and say i wait upon my uncle but he was laughing in order to hide a great anxiety and was screwing his courage inwardly to face the ordeal which he knew was now before him  pen had taken smirke into his confidence in the last two days and after the outbreak attendant on the discovery of doctor portman and during every one of those fortyeight hours which he had passed in mr smirkes society had done nothing but talk to his tutor about miss fotheringaymiss emily fotheringayemily etc to all which talk smirke listened without difficulty for he was in love himself most anxious in all things to propitiate pen and indeed very much himself enraptured by the personal charms of this goddess whose like never having been before at a theatrical representation he had not beheld until now pens fire and volubility his hot eloquence and rich poetical tropes and figures his manly heart kind ardent and hopeful refusing to see any defects in the person he loved any difficulties in their position that he might not overcome had half convinced mr smirke that the arrangement proposed by mr pen was a very feasible and prudent one and that it would be a great comfort to have emily settled at fairoaks captain costigan in the yellow room established for life there and pen married at eighteen  and it is a fact that in these two days the boy had almost talked over his mother too had parried all her objections one after another with that indignant good sense which is often the perfection of absurdity and had brought her almost to acquiesce in the belief that if the marriage was doomed in heaven why doomed it wasthat if the young woman was a good person it was all that she for her part had to ask and rather to dread the arrival of the guardian uncle who she foresaw would regard mr pens marriage in a manner very different to that simple romantic honest and utterly absurd way in which the widow was already disposed to look at questions of this sort  for as in the old allegory of the gold and silver shield about which the two knights quarrelled each is right according to the point from which he looks so about marriage the question whether it is foolish or good wise or otherwise depends upon the point of view from which you regard it if it means a snug house in belgravia and pretty little dinnerparties and a pretty little brougham to drive in the park and a decent provision not only for the young people but for the little belgravians to come and if these are the necessaries of life and they are with many honest people to talk of any other arrangement is an absurdity of love in lodgingsa babyish folly of affection that cant pay coachhire or afford a decent millineras mere wicked balderdash and childish romance if on the other hand your opinion is that people not with an assured subsistence but with a fair chance to obtain it and with the stimulus of hope health and strong affection may take the chance of fortune for better or worse and share its good or its evil together the polite theory then becomes an absurdity in its turn worse than an absurdity a blasphemy almost and doubt of providence and a man who waits to make his chosen woman happy until he can drive her to church in a neat little carriage with a pair of horses is no better than a coward or a trifler who is neither worthy of love nor of fortune  i dont say that the town folks are not right but helen pendennis was a countrybred woman and the book of life as she interpreted it told her a different story to that page which is read in cities like most soft and sentimental women matchmaking in general formed a great part of her thoughts and i daresay she had begun to speculate about her sons falling in love and marrying long before the subject had ever entered into the brains of the young gentleman it pleased her with that dismal pleasure which the idea of sacrificing themselves gives to certain women to think of the day when she would give up all to pen and he should bring his wife home and she would surrender the keys and the best bedroom and go and sit at the side of the table and see him happy what did she want in life but to see the lad prosper as an empress certainly was not too good for him and would be honoured by becoming mrs pen so if he selected humble esther instead of queen vashti she would be content with his lordships choice never mind how lowly or poor the person might be who was to enjoy that prodigious honour mrs pendennis was willing to bow before her and welcome her and yield her up the first place but an actressa mature woman who had long ceased blushing except with rouge as she stood under the eager glances of thousands of eyesan illiterate and illbred person very likely who must have lived with light associates and have heard doubtful conversationoh it was hard that such a one should be chosen and that the matron should be deposed to give place to such a sultana  all these doubts the widow laid before pen during the two days which had of necessity to elapse ere the uncle came down but he met them with that happy frankness and ease which a young gentleman exhibits at his time of life and routed his mothers objections with infinite satisfaction to himself miss costigan was a paragon of virtue and delicacy she was as sensitive as the most timid maiden she was as pure as the unsullied snow she had the finest manners the most graceful wit and genius the most charming refinement and justness of appreciation in all matters of taste she had the most admirable temper and devotion to her father a good old gentleman of high family and fallen fortunes who had lived however with the best society in europe he was in no hurry and could afford to wait any timetill he was oneandtwenty but he felt and here his face assumed an awful and harrowing solemnity that he was engaged in the one only passion of his life and that death alone could close it  helen told him with a sad smile and shake of the head that people survived these passions and as for long engagements contracted between very young men and old womenshe knew an instance in her own familylauras poor father was an instancehow fatal they were  mr pen however was resolved that death must be his doom in case of disappointment and rather than thisrather than baulk him in factthis lady would have submitted to any sacrifice or personal pain and would have gone down on her knees and have kissed the feet of a hottentot daughterinlaw  arthur knew his power over the widow and the young tyrant was touched whilst he exercised it in those two days he brought her almost into submission and patronised her very kindly and he passed one evening with the lovely piemaker at chatteris in which he bragged of his influence over his mother and he spent the other night in composing a most flaming and conceited copy of verses to his divinity in which he vowed like montrose that he would make her famous with his sword and glorious by his pen and that he would love her as no mortal woman had been adored since the creation of womankind  it was on that night long after midnight that wakeful helen passing stealthily by her sons door saw a light streaming through the chink of the door into the dark passage and heard pen tossing and tumbling and mumbling verses in his bed she waited outside for a while anxiously listening to him in infantile fevers and early boyish illnesses many a night before the kind soul had so kept watch she turned the lock very softly now and went in so gently that pen for a moment did not see her his face was turned from her his papers on his desk were scattered about and more were lying on the bed round him he was biting a pencil and thinking of rhymes and all sorts of follies and passions he was hamlet jumping into ophelias grave he was the stranger taking mrs haller to his arms beautiful mrs haller with the raven ringlets falling over her shoulders despair and byron thomas moore and all the loves of the angels waller and herrick beranger and all the lovesongs he had ever read were working and seething in this young gentlemans mind and he was at the very height and paroxysm of the imaginative frenzy when his mother found him  arthur said the mothers soft silver voice and he started up and turned round he clutched some of the papers and pushed them under the pillow  why dont you go to sleep my dear she said with a sweet tender smile and sate down on the bed and took one of his hot hands  pen looked at her wildly for an instanti couldnt sleep he saidii wasi was writingand hereupon he flung his arms round her neck and said o mother i love her i love herhow could such a kind soul as that help soothing and pitying him the gentle creature did her best and thought with a strange wonderment and tenderness that it was only yesterday that he was a child in that bed and how she used to come and say her prayers over it before he woke upon holiday mornings  they were very grand verses no doubt although miss fotheringay did not understand them but old cos with a wink and a knowing finger on his nose said put them up with th other letthers milly darling poldoodys pomes was nothing to this so milly locked up the manuscripts  when then the major being dressed and presentable presented himself to mrs pendennis he found in the course of ten minutes colloquy that the poor widow was not merely distressed at the idea of the marriage contemplated by pen but actually more distressed at thinking that the boy himself was unhappy about it and that his uncle and he should have any violent altercation on the subject she besought major pendennis to be very gentle with arthur he has a very high spirit and will not brook unkind words she hinted dr portman spoke to him rather roughlyand i must own unjustly the other nightfor my dearest boys honour is as high as any mother can desirebut pens answer quite frightened me it was so indignant recollect he is a man now and be veryvery cautious said the widow laying a fair long hand on the majors sleeve  he took it up kissed it gallantly and looked in her alarmed face with wonder and a scorn which he was too polite to show bon dieu thought the old negotiator the boy has actually talked the woman round and shed get him a wife as she would a toy if master cried for it why are there no such things as lettresdecachetand a bastille for young fellows of family the major lived in such good company that he might be excused for feeling like an earlhe kissed the widows timid hand pressed it in both his and laid it down on the table with one of his own over it as he smiled and looked her in the face  confess said he now that you are thinking how you possibly can make it up to your conscience to let the boy have his own way  she blushed and was moved in the usual manner of females i am thinking that he is very unhappyand i am too  to contradict him or to let him have his own wish asked the other and added with great comfort to his inward self im dd if he shall  to think that he should have formed so foolish and cruel and fatal an attachment the widow said which can but end in pain whatever be the issue  the issue shant be marriage my dear sister the major said resolutely were not going to have a pendennis the head of the house marry a strolling mountebank from a booth no no we wont marry into greenwich fair maam  if the match is broken suddenly off the widow interposed i dont know what may be the consequence i know arthurs ardent temper the intensity of his affections the agony of his pleasures and disappointments and i tremble at this one if it must be indeed indeed it must not come on him too suddenly  my dear madam the major said with an air of the deepest commiseration ive no doubt arthur will have to suffer confoundedly before he gets over the little disappointment but is he think you the only person who has been so rendered miserable  no indeed said helen holding down her eyes she was thinking of her own case and was at that moment seventeen againand most miserable  i myself whispered her brotherinlaw have undergone a disappointment in early life a young woman with fifteen thousand pounds niece to an earlmost accomplished creaturea third of her money would have run up my promotion in no time and i should have been a lieutenantcolonel at thirty but it might not be i was but a penniless lieutenant her parents interfered and i embarked for india where i had the honour of being secretary to lord buckley when commanderinchief without her what happened we returned our letters sent back our locks of hair the major here passed his fingers through his wig we sufferedbut we recovered she is now a baronets wife with thirteen grownup children altered it is true in person but her daughters remind me of what she was and the third is to be presented early next week  helen did not answer she was still thinking of old times i suppose if one lives to be a hundred there are certain passages of ones early life whereof the recollection will always carry us back to youth again and that helen was thinking of one of these  look at my own brother my dear creature the major continued gallantly he himself you know had a little disappointment when he started in thethe medical professionan eligible opportunity presented itself miss balls i remember the name was daughter of an apotha practitioner in very large practice my brother had very nearly succeeded in his suitbut difficulties arose disappointments supervened andand i am sure he had no reason to regret the disappointment which gave him this hand said the major and he once more politely pressed helens fingers  those marriages between people of such different rank and age said helen are sad things i have known them produce a great deal of unhappinesslauras father my cousin whowho was brought up with meshe added in a low voice was an instance of that  most injudicious cut in the major i dont know anything more painful than for a man to marry his superior in age or his inferior in station fancy marrying a woman of low rank of life and having your house filled with her confounded tagragandbobtail of relations fancy your wife attached to a mother who dropped her hs or called maria marire how are you to introduce her into society my dear mrs pendennis i will name no names but in the very best circles of london society i have seen men suffering the most excruciating agony i have known them to be cut to be lost utterly from the vulgarity of their wives connections what did lady snapperton do last year at her dejeune dansant after the bohemian ball she told lord brouncker that he might bring his daughters or send them with a proper chaperon but that she would not receive lady brouncker who was a druggists daughter or some such thing and as tom wagg remarked of her never wanted medicine certainly for she never had an h in her life good ged what would have been the trifling pang of a separation in the first instance to the enduring infliction of a constant misalliance and intercourse with low people  what indeed said helen dimly disposed towards laughter but yet checking the inclination because she remembered in what prodigious respect her deceased husband held major pendennis and his stories of the great world  then this fatal woman is ten years older than that silly young scapegrace of an arthur what happens in such cases my dear creature i dont mind telling you now we are alone that in the highest state of society misery undeviating misery is the result look at lord clodworthy come into a room with his wifewhy good ged she looks like clodworthys mother whats the case between lord and lady willowbank whose love match was notorious he has already cut her down twice when she has hanged herself out of jealousy for mademoiselle de sainte cunegonde the dancer and mark my words good ged one day hell not cut the old woman down no my dear madam you are not in the world but i am you are a little romantic and sentimental you know you arewomen with those large beautiful eyes always are you must leave this matter to my experience marry this woman marry at eighteen an actress of thirtybah bahi would as soon he sent into the kitchen and married the cook  i know the evils of premature engagements sighed out helen and as she has made this allusion no less than thrice in the course of the above conversation and seems to be so oppressed with the notion of long engagements and unequal marriages and as the circumstance we have to relate will explain what perhaps some persons are anxious to know namely who little laura is who has appeared more than once before us it will be as well to clear up these points in another chapter     chapter viii in which pen is kept waiting at the door while the reader is informed who little laura was   once upon a time then there was a young gentleman of cambridge university who came to pass the long vacation at the village where young helen thistlewood was living with her mother the widow of the lieutenant slain at copenhagen this gentleman whose name was the reverend francis bell was nephew to mrs thistlewood and by consequence own cousin to miss helen so that it was very right that he should take lodgings in his aunts house who lived in a very small way and there he passed the long vacation reading with three or four pupils who accompanied him to the village mr bell was fellow of a college and famous in the university for his learning and skill as a tutor  his two kinswomen understood pretty early that the reverend gentleman was engaged to be married and was only waiting for a college living to enable him to fulfil his engagement his intended bride was the daughter of another parson who had acted as mr bells own private tutor in bells early life and it was whilst under mr coachers roof indeed and when only a boy of seventeen or eighteen years of age that the impetuous young bell had flung himself at the feet of miss martha coacher whom he was helping to pick peas in the garden on his knees before those peas and her he pledged himself to an endless affection  miss coacher was by many years the young fellows senior and her own heart had been lacerated by many previous disappointments in the matrimonial line no less than three pupils of her father had trifled with those young affections the apothecary of the village had despicably jilted her the dragoon officer with whom she had danced so many many times during that happy season which she passed at bath with her gouty grandmamma one day gaily shook his bridlerein and galloped away never to return wounded by the shafts of repeated ingratitude can it be wondered at that the heart of martha coacher should pant to find rest somewhere she listened to the proposals of the gawky gallant honest boy with great kindness and goodhumour at the end of his speech she said law bell im sure you are too young to think of such things but intimated that she too would revolve them in her own virgin bosom she could not refer mr bell to her mamma for mr coacher was a widower and being immersed in his books was of course unable to take the direction of so frail and wondrous an article as a ladys heart which miss martha had to manage for herself  a lock of her hair tied up in a piece of blue ribbon conveyed to the happy bell the result of the vestals conference with herself thrice before had she snipt off one of her auburn ringlets and given them away the possessors were faithless but the hair had grown again and martha had indeed occasion to say that men were deceivers when she handed over this token of love to the simple boy  number 6 however was an exception to former passionsfrancis bell was the most faithful of lovers when his time arrived to go to college and it became necessary to acquaint mr coacher of the arrangements that had been made the latter cried god bless my soul i hadnt the least idea what was going on as was indeed very likely for he had been taken in three times before in precisely a similar manner and francis went to the university resolved to conquer honours so as to be able to lay them at the feet of his beloved martha  this prize in view made him labour prodigiously news came term after term of the honours he won he sent the prizebooks for his college essays to old coacher and his silver declamation cup to miss martha in due season he was high among the wranglers and a fellow of his college and during all the time of these transactions a constant tender correspondence was kept up with miss coacher to whose influence and perhaps with justice he attributed the successes which he had won  by the time however when the rev francis bell ma and fellow and tutor of his college was twentysix years of age it happened that miss coacher was thirtyfour nor had her charms her manners or her temper improved since that sunny day in the springtime of life when he found her picking peas in the garden having achieved his honours he relaxed in the ardour of his studies and his judgment and tastes also perhaps became cooler the sunshine of the peagarden faded away from miss martha and poor bell found himself engagedand his hand pledged to that bond in a thousand lettersto a coarse illtempered illfavoured illmannered middleaged woman  it was in consequence of one of many altercations in which marthas eloquence shone and in which therefore she was frequently pleased to indulge that francis refused to take his pupils to bearleaders green where mr coachers living was and where bell was in the habit of spending the summer and he bethought him that he would pass the vacation at his aunts village which he had not seen for many yearsnot since little helen was a girl and used to sit on his knee down then he came and lived with them helen was grown a beautiful young woman now the cousins were nearly four months together from june to october they walked in the summer evenings they met in the early morn they read out of the same book when the old lady dozed at night over the candles what little helen knew frank taught her she sang to him she gave her artless heart to him she was aware of all his story had he made any secrethad he not shown the picture of the woman to whom he was engaged and with a blushher letters hard eager and cruelthe days went on and on happier and closer with more kindness more confidence and more pity at last one morning in october came when francis went back to college and the poor girl felt that her tender heart was gone with him  frank too wakened up from the delightful midsummer dream to the horrible reality of his own pain he gnashed and tore at the chain which bound him he was frantic to break it and be free should he confessgive his savings to the woman to whom he was bound and beg his releasethere was time yethe temporised no living might fall in for years to come the cousins went on corresponding sadly and fondly the betrothed woman hard jealous and dissatisfied complaining bitterly and with reason of her franciss altered tone  at last things came to a crisis and the new attachment was discovered francis owned it cared not to disguise it rebuked martha with her violent temper and angry imperiousness and worst of all with her inferiority and her age  her reply was that if he did not keep his promise she would carry his letters into every court in the kingdomletters in which his love was pledged to her ten thousand times and after exposing him to the world as the perjurer and traitor he was she would kill herself  frank had one more interview with helen whose mother was dead then and who was living companion with old lady pontypoolone more interview where it was resolved that he was to do his duty that is to redeem his vow that is to pay a debt cozened from him by a sharper that is to make two honest people miserable so the two judged their duty to be and they parted  the living fell in only too soon but yet frank bell was quite a grey and wornout man when he was inducted into it helen wrote him a letter on his marriage beginning my dear cousin and ending always truly yours she sent him back the other letters and the lock of his hairall but a small piece she had it in her desk when she was talking to the major  bell lived for three or four years in his living at the end of which time the chaplainship of coventry island falling vacant frank applied for it privately and having procured it announced the appointment to his wife she objected as she did to everything he told her bitterly that he did not want her to come so she went bell went out in governor crawleys time and was very intimate with that gentleman in his later years and it was in coventry island years after his own marriage and five years after he had heard of the birth of helens boy that his own daughter was born  she was not the daughter of the first mrs bell who died of island fever very soon after helen pendennis and her husband to whom helen had told everything wrote to inform bell of the birth of their child i was old was i said mrs bell the first i was old and her inferior was i but i married you mr bell and kept you from marrying her and hereupon she died bell married a colonial lady whom he loved fondly but he was not doomed to prosper in love and this lady dying in childbirth bell gave up too sending his little girl home to helen pendennis and her husband with a parting prayer that they would befriend her  the little thing came to fairoaks from bristol which is not very far off dressed in black and in company of a soldiers wife her nurse at parting from whom she wept bitterly but she soon dried up her grief under helens motherly care  round her neck she had a locket with hair which helen had given ah how many years ago to poor francis dead and buried this child was all that was left of him and she cherished as so tender a creature would the legacy which he had bequeathed to her the girls name as his dying letter stated was helen laura but john pendennis though he accepted the trust was always rather jealous of the orphan and gloomily ordered that she should be called by her own mothers name and not by that first one which her father had given her she was afraid of mr pendennis to the last moment of his life and it was only when her husband was gone that helen dared openly to indulge in the tenderness which she felt for the little girl  thus it was that laura bell became mrs pendenniss daughter neither her husband nor that gentlemans brother the major viewed her with very favourable eyes she reminded the first of circumstances in his wifes life which he was forced to accept but would have forgotten much more willingly and as for the second how could he regard her she was neither related to his own family of pendennis nor to any nobleman in this empire and she had but a couple of thousand pounds for her fortune  and now let mr pen come in who has been waiting all this while  having strung up his nerves and prepared himself without at the door for the meeting he came to it determined to face the awful uncle he had settled in his mind that the encounter was to be a fierce one and was resolved on bearing it through with all the courage and dignity of the famous family which he represented and he flung open the door and entered with the most severe and warlike expression armed capapie as it were with lance couched and plumes displayed and glancing at his adversary as if to say come on im ready  the old man of the world as he surveyed the boys demeanour could hardly help a grin at his admirable pompous simplicity major pendennis too had examined his ground and finding that the widow was already half won over to the enemy and having a shrewd notion that threats and tragic exhortations would have no effect upon the boy who was inclined to be perfectly stubborn and awfully serious the major laid aside the authoritative manner at once and with the most goodhumoured natural smile in the world held out his hands to pen shook the lads passive fingers gaily and said well pen my boy tell us all about it  helen was delighted with the generosity of the majors goodhumour on the contrary it quite took aback and disappointed poor pen whose nerves were strung up for a tragedy and who felt that his grand entree was altogether baulked and ludicrous he blushed and winced with mortified vanity and bewilderment he felt immensely inclined to begin to cryiii didnt know that you were come till just now he said isistown very full i suppose  if pen could hardly gulp his tears down it was all the major could do to keep from laughter he turned round and shot a comical glance at mrs pendennis who too felt that the scene was at once ridiculous and sentimental and so having nothing to say she went up and kissed mr pen as he thought of her tenderness and soft obedience to his wishes it is very possible too the boy was melted  what a couple of fools they are thought the old guardian if i hadnt come down she would have driven over in state to pay a visit and give her blessing to the young ladys family  come come said he still grinning at the couple let us have as little sentiment as possible and pen my good fellow tell us the whole story  pen got back at once to his tragic and heroical air the story is sir said he as i have written it to you before i have made the acquaintance of a most beautiful and most virtuous lady of a high family although in reduced circumstances i have found the woman in whom i know that the happiness of my life is centred i feel that i never never can think about any woman but her i am aware of the difference of our ages and other difficulties in my way but my affection was so great that i felt i could surmount all these that we both could and she has consented to unite her lot with mine and to accept my heart and my fortune  how much is that my boy said the major has anybody left you some money i dont know that you are worth a shilling in the world  you know what i have is his cried out mrs pendennis  good heavens madam hold your tongue was what the guardian was disposed to say but he kept his temper not without a struggle no doubt no doubt he said you would sacrifice anything for him everybody knows that but it is after all then your fortune which pen is offering to the young lady and of which he wishes to take possession at eighteen  i know my mother will give me anything pen said looking rather disturbed  yes my good fellow but there is reason in all things if your mother keeps the house it is but fair that she should select her company when you give her house over her head and transfer her bankers account to yourself for the benefit of miss whatdyoucallemmiss costigandont you think you should at least have consulted my sister as one of the principal parties in the transaction i am speaking to you you see without the least anger or assumption of authority such as the law and your fathers will give me over you for three years to comebut as one man of the world to anotherand i ask you if you think that because you can do what you like with your mother therefore you have a right to do so as you are her dependent would it not have been more generous to wait before you took this step and at least to have paid her the courtesy to ask her leave  pen held down his head and began dimly to perceive that the action on which he had prided himself as a most romantic generous instance of disinterested affection was perhaps a very selfish and headstrong piece of folly  i did it in a moment of passion said pen floundering i was not aware what i was going to say or to do and in this he spoke with perfect sincerity but now it is said and i stand to it no i neither can nor will recall it ill die rather than do so and ii dont want to burthen my mother he continued ill work for myself ill go on the stage and act with her sheshe says i should do well there  but will she take you on those terms the major interposed mind i do not say that miss costigan is not the most disinterested of women but dont you suppose now fairly that your position as a young gentleman of ancient birth and decent expectations forms a part of the cause why she finds your addresses welcome  ill die i say rather than forfeit my pledge to her said pen doubling his fists and turning red  who asks you my dear friend answered the imperturbable guardian no gentleman breaks his word of course when it has been given freely but after all you can wait you owe something to your mother something to your familysomething to me as your fathers representative  oh of course pen said feeling rather relieved  well as you have pledged your word to her give us another will you arthur  what is it arthur asked  that you will make no private marriagethat you wont be taking a trip to scotland you understand  that would be a falsehood pen never told his mother a falsehood helen said  pen hung down his head again and his eyes filled with tears of shame had not this whole intrigue been a falsehood to that tender and confiding creature who was ready to give up all for his sake he gave his uncle his hand  no siron my word of honour as a gentleman he said i will never marry without my mothers consent and giving helen a bright parting look of confidence and affection unchangeable the boy went out of the drawingroom into his own study  hes an angelhes an angel the mother cried out in one of her usual raptures  he comes of a good stock maam said her brotherinlawof a good stock on both sides the major was greatly pleased with the result of his diplomacyso much so that he once more saluted the tips of mrs pendenniss glove and dropping the curt manly and straightforward tone in which he had conducted the conversation with the lad assumed a certain drawl which he always adopted when he was most conceited and fine  my dear creature said he in that his politest tone i think it certainly as well that i came down and i flatter myself that last botte was a successful one i tell you how i came to think of it three years ago my kind friend lady ferrybridge sent for me in the greatest state of alarm about her son gretna whose affair you remember and implored me to use my influence with the young gentleman who was engaged in an affaire de coeur with a scotch clergymans daughter miss mactoddy i implored i entreated gentle measures but lord ferrybridge was furious and tried the high hand gretna was sulky and silent and his parents thought they had conquered but what was the fact my dear creature the young people had been married for three months before lord ferrybridge knew anything about it and that was why i extracted the promise from master pen  arthur would never have done so mrs pendennis said  he hasntthat is one comfort answered the brotherinlaw  like a wary and patient man of the world major pendennis did not press poor pen any farther for the moment but hoped the best from time and that the young fellows eyes would be opened before long to see the absurdity of which he was guilty and having found out how keen the boys point of honour was he worked kindly upon that kindly feeling with great skill discoursing him over their wine after dinner and pointing out to pen the necessity of a perfect uprightness and openness in all his dealings and entreating that his communications with his interesting young friend as the major politely called miss fotheringay should be carried on with the knowledge if not approbation of mrs pendennis after all pen the major said with a convenient frankness that did not displease the boy whilst it advanced the interests of the negotiator you must bear in mind that you are throwing yourself away your mother may submit to your marriage as she would to anything else you desired if you did but cry long enough for it but be sure of this that it can never please her you take a young woman off the boards of a country theatre and prefer her for such is the case to one of the finest ladies in england and your mother will submit to your choice but you cant suppose that she will be happy under it i have often fancied entre nous that my sister had it in her eye to make a marriage between you and that little ward of hersflora laurawhats her name and i always determined to do my small endeavour to prevent any such match the child has but two thousand pounds i am given to understand it is only with the utmost economy and care that my sister can provide for the decent maintenance of her house and for your appearance and education as a gentleman and i dont care to own to you that i had other and much higher views for you with your name and birth sirwith your talents which i suppose are respectable with the friends whom i have the honour to possess i could have placed you in an excellent positiona remarkable position for a young man of such exceeding small means and had hoped to see you at least try to restore the honours of our name your mothers softness stopped one prospect or you might have been a general like our gallant ancestor who fought at ramillies and malplaquet i had another plan in view my excellent and kind friend lord bagwig who is very well disposed towards me would i have little doubt have attached you to his mission at pumpernickel and you might have advanced in the diplomatic service but pardon me for recurring to the subject how is a man to serve a young gentleman of eighteen who proposes to marry a lady of thirty whom he has selected from a booth in a fairwell not a faira barn that profession at once is closed to you the public service is closed to you society is closed to you you see my good friend to what you bring yourself you may get on at the bar to be sure where i am given to understand that gentlemen of merit occasionally marry out of their kitchens but in no other profession or you may come and live down heredown here mon dieu for ever said the major with a dreary shrug as he thought with inexpressible fondness of pall mall where your mother will receive the mrs arthur that is to be with perfect kindness where the good people of the county wont visit you and where by gad sir i shall be shy of visiting you myself for im a plainspoken man and i own to you that i like to live with gentlemen for my companions where you will have to live with rumandwaterdrinking gentlemenfarmers and drag through your life the young husband of an old woman who if she doesnt quarrel with your mother will at least cost that lady her position in society and drag her down into that dubious caste into which you must inevitably fall it is no affair of mine my good sir i am not angry your downfall will not hurt me farther than that it will extinguish the hopes i had of seeing my family once more taking its place in the world it is only your mother and yourself that will be ruined and i pity you both from my soul pass the claret it is some i sent to your poor father i remember i bought it at poor lord levants sale but of course added the major smacking the wine having engaged yourself you will do what becomes you as a man of honour however fatal your promise may be however promise us on our side my boy what i set out by entreating you to grantthat there shall be nothing clandestine that you will pursue your studies that you will only visit your interesting friend at proper intervals do you write to her much  pen blushed and said why yes he had written  i suppose verses eh as well as prose i was a dab at verses myself i recollect when i first joined i used to write verses for the fellows in the regiment and did some pretty things in that way i was talking to my old friend general hobbler about some lines i dashed off for him in the year 1806 when we were at the cape and gad he remembered every line of them still for hed used em so often the old rogue and had actually tried em on mrs hobbler sirwho brought him sixty thousand pounds i suppose youve tried verses eh pen  pen blushed again and said why yes he had written verses  and does the fair one respond in poetry or prose asked the major eyeing his nephew with the queerest expression as much as to say o moses and green spectacles what a fool the boy is  pen blushed again she had written but not in verse the young lover owned and he gave his breastpocket the benefit of a squeeze with his left arm which the major remarked according to his wont  you have got the letters there i see said the old campaigner nodding at pen and pointing to his own chest which was manfully wadded with cotton by mr stultz you know you have i would give twopence to see em  why said pen twiddling the stalks of the strawberries ii but this sentence never finished for pens face was so comical and embarrassed as the major watched it that the elder could contain his gravity no longer and burst into a fit of laughter in which chorus pen himself was obliged to join after a minute when he broke out fairly into a guffaw  it sent them with great goodhumour into mrs pendenniss drawingroom she was pleased to hear them laughing in the hall as they crossed it  you sly rascal said the major putting his arm gaily on pens shoulder and giving a playful push at the boys breastpocket he felt the papers crackling there sure enough the young fellow was delightedconceitedtriumphantand in one word a spoony  the pair came to the teatable in the highest spirits the majors politeness was beyond expression he had never tasted such good tea and such bread was only to be had in the country he asked mrs pendennis for one of her charming songs he then made pen sing and was delighted and astonished at the beauty of the boys voice he made his nephew fetch his maps and drawings and praised them as really remarkable works of talent in a young fellow he complimented him on his french pronunciation he flattered the simple boy as adroitly as ever lover flattered a mistress and when bedtime came mother and son went to their several rooms perfectly enchanted with the kind major  when they had reached those apartments i suppose helen took to her knees as usual and pen read over his letters before going to bed just as if he didnt know every word of them by heart already in truth there were but three of those documents and to learn their contents required no great effort of memory  in no 1 miss fotheringay presents grateful compliments to mr pendennis and in her papas name and her own begs to thank him for his most beautiful presents they will always be kept carefully and miss f and captain c will never forget the delightful evening which they passed on tuesday last  no 2 saiddear sir we shall have a small quiet party of social friends at our humble board next tuesday evening at an early tea when i shall wear the beautiful scarf which with its accompanying delightful verses i shall ever ever cherish and papa bids me say how happy he will be if you will join the feast of reason and the flow of soul in our festive little party as i am sure will be your truly grateful emily fotheringay  no 3 was somewhat more confidential and showed that matters had proceeded rather far you were odious yesterday night the letter said why did you not come to the stagedoor papa could not escort me on account of his eye he had an accident and fell down over a loose carpet on the stair on sunday night i saw you looking at miss diggle all night and you were so enchanted with lydia languish you scarcely once looked at julia i could have crushed bingley i was so angry i play ella rosenberg on friday will you come then miss diggle performsever your e f  these three letters mr pen used to read at intervals during the day and night and embrace with that delight and fervour which such beautiful compositions surely warranted a thousand times at least he had kissed fondly the musky satin paper made sacred to him by the hand of emily fotheringay this was all he had in return for his passion and flames his vows and protests his rhymes and similes his wakeful nights and endless thoughts his fondness fears and folly the young wiseacre had pledged away his all for this signed his name to endless promissory notes conferring his heart upon the bearer bound himself for life and got back twopence as an equivalent for miss costigan was a young lady of such perfect goodconduct and selfcommand that she never would have thought of giving more and reserved the treasures of her affection until she could transfer them lawfully at church  howbeit mr pen was content with what tokens of regard he had got and mumbled over his three letters in a rapture of high spirits and went to sleep delighted with his kind old uncle from london who must evidently yield to his wishes in time and in a word in a preposterous state of contentment with himself and all the world     chapter ix in which the major opens the campaign   let those who have a real and heartfelt relish for london society and the privilege of an entree into its most select circles admit that major pendennis was a man of no ordinary generosity and affection in the sacrifice which he now made he gave up london in mayhis newspapers and his morningshis afternoons from club to club his little confidential visits to my ladies his rides in rotten row his dinners and his stall at the opera his rapid escapades to fulham or richmond on saturdays and sundays his bow from my lord duke or my lord marquis at the great london entertainments and his name in the morning post of the succeeding dayhis quieter little festivals more select secret and delightfulall these he resigned to lock himself into a lone little country house with a simple widow and a greenhorn of a son a mawkish curate and a little girl of ten years of age  he made the sacrifice and it was the greater that few knew the extent of it his letters came down franked from town and he showed the invitations to helen with a sigh it was beautiful and tragical to see him refuse one party after anotherat least to those who could understand as helen didnt the melancholy grandeur of his selfdenial helen did not or only smiled at the awful pathos with which the major spoke of the court guide in general but young pen looked with great respect at the great names upon the superscriptions of his uncles letters and listened to the majors stories about the fashionable world with constant interest and sympathy  the elder pendenniss rich memory was stored with thousands of these delightful tales and he poured them into pens willing ear with unfailing eloquence he knew the name and pedigree of everybody in the peerage and everybodys relations my dear boy he would say with a mournful earnestness and veracity you cannot begin your genealogical studies too early i wish to heavens you would read in debrett every day not so much the historical part for the pedigrees between ourselves are many of them very fabulous and there are few families that can show such a clear descent as our own as the account of family alliances and who is related to whom i have known a mans career in life blasted by ignorance on this important this allimportant subject why only last month at dinner at my lord hobanobs a young man who has lately been received among us young mr suckling author of a work i believe began to speak lightly of admiral bowsers conduct for ratting to ministers in what i must own is the most audacious manner but who do you think sate next and opposite to this mr suckling whywhy next to him was lady grampound bowsers daughter and opposite to him was lord grampound bowsers soninlaw the infatuated young man went on cutting his jokes at the admirals expense fancying that all the world was laughing with him and i leave you to imagine lady hobanobs feelingshobanobsthose of every wellbred man as the wretched intru was so exposing himself he will never dine again in south street i promise you that  with such discourses the major entertained his nephew as he paced the terrace in front of the house for his two hours constitutional walk or as they sate together after dinner over their wine he grieved that sir francis clavering had not come down to the park to live in it since his marriage and to make a society for the neighbourhood he mourned that lord eyrie was not in the country that he might take pen and present him to his lordship he has daughters the major said who knows you might have married lady emily or lady barbara trehawk but all those dreams are over my poor fellow you must lie on the bed which you have made for yourself  these things to hear did young pendennis seriously incline they are not so interesting in print as when delivered orally but the majors anecdotes of the great george of the royal dukes of the statesmen beauties and fashionable ladies of the day filled young pens soul with longing and wonder and he found the conversations with his guardian which sadly bored and perplexed poor mrs pendennis for his own part never tedious  it cant be said that mr pens new guide philosopher and friend discoursed him on the most elevated subjects or treated the subjects which he chose in the most elevated manner but his morality such as it was was consistent it might not perhaps tend to a mans progress in another world but it was pretty well calculated to advance his interests in this and then it must be remembered that the major never for one instant doubted that his views were the only views practicable and that his conduct was perfectly virtuous and respectable he was a man of honour in a word and had his eyes what he called open he took pity on this young greenhorn of a nephew and wanted to open his eyes too  no man for instance went more regularly to church when in the country than the old bachelor it dont matter so much in town pen he said for there the women go and the men are not missed but when a gentleman is sur ses terres he must give an example to the country people and if i could turn a tune i even think i should sing the duke of saint davids whom i have the honour of knowing always sings in the country and let me tell you it has a doosed fine effect from the family pew and you are somebody down here as long as the claverings are away you are the first man in the parish and as good as any you might represent the town if you played your cards well your poor dear father would have done so had he lived so might younot if you marry a lady however amiable whom the country people wont meetwell well its a painful subject let us change it my boy but if major pendennis changed the subject once he recurred to it a score of times in the day and the moral of his discourse always was that pen was throwing himself away now it does not require much coaxing or wheedling to make a simple boy believe that he is a very fine fellow  pen took his uncles counsels to heart he was glad enough we have said to listen to his elders talk the conversation of captain costigan became by no means pleasant to him and the idea of that tipsy old fatherinlaw haunted him with terror he couldnt bring that man unshaven and reeking of punch to associate with his mother even about emilyhe faltered when the pitiless guardian began to question him was she accomplished he was obliged to own no was she clever well she had a very good average intellect but he could not absolutely say she was clever come let us see some of her letters so pen confessed that he had but those three of which we have made mentionand that they were but trivial invitations or answers  she is cautious enough the major said drily she is older than you my poor boy and then he apologised with the utmost frankness and humility and flung himself upon pens good feelings begging the lad to excuse a fond old uncle who had only his familys honour in viewfor arthur was ready to flame up in indignation whenever miss costigans honesty was doubted and swore that he would never have her name mentioned lightly and never never would part from her  he repeated this to his uncle and his friends at home and also it must be confessed to miss fotheringay and the amiable family at chatteris with whom he still continued to spend some portion of his time miss emily was alarmed when she heard of the arrival of pens guardian and rightly conceived that the major came down with hostile intentions to herself i suppose ye intend to leave me now your grand relation has come down from town hell carry ye off and youll forget your poor emily mr arthur  forget her in her presence in that of miss rouncy the columbine and millys confidential friend of the company in the presence of the captain himself pen swore he never could think of any other woman but his beloved miss fotheringay and the captain looking up at his foils which were hung as a trophy on the wall of the room where pen and he used to fence grimly said he would not advoise any man to meddle rashly with the affections of his darling child and would never believe his gallant young arthur whom he treated as his son whom he called his son would ever be guilty of conduct so revolting to every idaya of honour and humanity  he went up and embraced pen after speaking he cried and wiped his eye with one large dirty hand as he clasped pen with the other arthur shuddered in that grasp and thought of his uncle at home his fatherinlaw looked unusually dirty and shabby the odour of whiskyandwater was even more decided than in common how was he to bring that man and his mother together he trembled when he thought that he had absolutely written to costigan enclosing to him a sovereign the loan of which the worthy gentleman had need and saying that one day he hoped to sign himself his affectionate son arthur pendennis he was glad to get away from chatteris that day from miss rouncy the confidante from the old toping fatherinlaw from the divine emily herself o emily emily he cried inwardly as he rattled homewards on rebecca you little know what sacrifices i am making for youfor you who are always so cold so cautious so mistrustful and he thought of a character in pope to whom he had often involuntarily compared her  pen never rode over to chatteris upon a certain errand but the major found out on what errand the boy had been faithful to his plan major pendennis gave his nephew no let or hindrance but somehow the constant feeling that the seniors eye was upon him an uneasy shame attendant upon that inevitable confession which the evenings conversation would be sure to elicit in the most natural simple manner made pen go less frequently to sigh away his soul at the feet of his charmer than he had been wont to do previous to his uncles arrival there was no use trying to deceive him there was no pretext of dining with smirke or reading greek plays with foker pen felt when he returned from one of his flying visits that everybody knew whence he came and appeared quite guilty before his mother and guardian over their books or their game at picquet  once having walked out half a mile to the fairoaks inn beyond the lodge gates to be in readiness for the competitor coach which changed horses there to take a run for chatteris a man on the roof touched his hat to the young gentleman it was his uncles man mr morgan who was going on a message for his master and had been took up at the lodge as he said and mr morgan came back by the rival too so that pen had the pleasure of that domestics company both ways nothing was said at home the lad seemed to have every decent liberty and yet he felt himself dimly watched and guarded and that there were eyes upon him even in the presence of his dulcinea  in fact pens suspicions were not unfounded and his guardian had sent forth to gather all possible information regarding the lad and his interesting young friend the discreet and ingenious mr morgan a london confidential valet whose fidelity could be trusted had been to chatteris more than once and made every inquiry regarding the past history and present habits of the captain and his daughter he delicately crossexamined the waiters the ostlers and all the inmates of the bar at the george and got from them what little they knew respecting the worthy captain he was not held in very great regard there as it appeared the waiters never saw the colour of his money and were warned not to furnish the poor gentleman with any liquor for which some other party was not responsible he swaggered sadly about the coffeeroom there consumed a toothpick and looked over the paper and if any friend asked him to dinner he stayed morgan heard at the george of pens acquaintance with mr foker and he went over to baymouth to enter into relations with that gentlemans man but the young student was gone to a coast regatta and his servant of course travelled in charge of the dressingcase  from the servants of the officers at the barracks mr morgan found that the captain had so frequently and outrageously inebriated himself there that colonel swallowtail had forbidden him the messroom the indefatigable morgan then put himself in communication with some of the inferior actors at the theatre and pumped them over their cigars and punch and all agreed that costigan was poor shabby and given to debt and to drink but there was not a breath upon the reputation of miss fotheringay her fathers courage was reported to have displayed itself on more than one occasion towards persons disposed to treat his daughter with freedom she never came to the theatre but with her father in his most inebriated moments that gentleman kept a watch over her finally mr morgan from his own experience added that he had been to see her act and was uncommon delighted with the performance besides thinking her a most splendid woman  mrs creed the pewopener confirmed these statements to doctor portman who examined her personally and threatened her with the terrors of the church one day after afternoon service mrs creed had nothing unfavourable to her lodger to divulge she saw nobody only one or two ladies of the theatre the captain did intoxicate himself sometimes and did not always pay his rent regularly but he did when he had money or rather miss fotheringay did since the young gentleman from clavering had been and took lessons in fencing one or two more had come from the barracks sir derby oaks and his young friend mr foker which was often together and which was always driving over from baymouth in the tandem but on the occasions of the lessons miss f was very seldom present and generally came downstairs to mrs creeds own room  the doctor and the major consulting together as they often did groaned in spirit over that information major pendennis openly expressed his disappointment and i believe the divine himself was ill pleased at not being able to jack a hole in poor miss fotheringays reputation  even about pen himself mrs creeds reports were desperately favourable whenever he come mrs creed said she always have me or one of the children with her and mrs creed marm says she if you please marm youll on no account leave the room when that young gentlemans here and manys the time ive seen him a lookin as if he wished i was away poor young man and he took to coming in servicetime when i wasnt at home of course but she always had one of the boys up if her pa wasnt at home or old mr bowser with her a teaching of her her lesson or one of the young ladies of the theayter  it was all true whatever encouragements might have been given him before he avowed his passion the prudence of miss emily was prodigious after pen had declared himself and the poor fellow chafed against her hopeless reserve which maintained his ardour as it excited his anger  the major surveyed the state of things with a sigh if it were but a temporary liaison the excellent man said one could bear it a young fellow must sow his wild oats and that sort of thing but a virtuous attachment is the deuce it comes of the dd romantic notions boys get from being brought up by women  allow me to say major that you speak a little too like a man of the world replied the doctor nothing can be more desirable for pen than a virtuous attachment for a young lady of his own rank and with a corresponding fortunethis present infatuation of course i must deplore as sincerely as you do if i were his guardian i should command him to give it up  the very means i tell you to make him marry tomorrow we have got time from him that is all and we must do our best with that  i say major said the doctor at the end of the conversation in which the above subject was discussedi am not of course a playgoing manbut suppose i say we go and see her  the major laughedhe had been a fortnight at fairoaks and strange to say had not thought of that well he said why not after all it is not my niece but miss fotheringay the actress and we have as good a right as any other of the public to see her if we pay our money so upon a day when it was arranged that pen was to dine at home and pass the evening with his mother the two elderly gentlemen drove over to chatteris in the doctors chaise and there like a couple of jolly bachelors dined at the george inn before proceeding to the play  only two other guests were in the rooman officer of the regiment quartered at chatteris and a young gentleman whom the doctor thought he had somewhere seen they left them at their meal however and hastened to the theatre it was hamlet over again shakspeare was article xl of stout old doctor portmans creed to which he always made a point of testifying publicly at least once in a year  we have described the play before and how those who saw miss fotheringay perform in ophelia saw precisely the same thing on one night as on another both the elderly gentlemen looked at her with extraordinary interest thinking how very much young pen was charmed with her  gad said the major between his teeth as he surveyed her when she was called forward as usual and swept her curtsies to the scanty audience the young rascal has not made a bad choice  the doctor applauded her loudly and loyally upon my word said he she is a very clever actress and i must say major she is endowed with very considerable personal attractions  so that young officer thinks in the stagebox major pendennis answered and he pointed out to doctor portmans attention the young dragoon of the george coffeeroom who sate in the box in question and applauded with immense enthusiasm she looked extremely sweet upon him too thought the major but thats their wayand he shut up his natty operaglass and pocketed it as if he wished to see no more that night nor did the doctor of course propose to stay for the afterpiece so they rose and left the theatre the doctor returning to mrs portman who was on a visit at the deanery and the major walking home full of thought towards the george where he had bespoken a bed     chapter x facing the enemy   sauntering slowly homewards major pendennis reached the george presently and found mr morgan his faithful valet awaiting him at the door of the george inn who stopped his master as he was about to take a candle to go to bed and said with his usual air of knowing deference i think sir if you would go into the coffeeroom theres a young gentleman there as you would like to see  what is mr arthur here the major said in great anger  no sirbut his great friend mr foker sir lady hagnes fokers son is here sir hes been asleep in the coffeeroom since he took his dinner and has just rung for his coffee sir and i think praps you might like to git into conversation with him the valet said opening the coffeeroom door  the major entered and there indeed was mr foker the only occupant of the place he was rubbing his eyes and sate before a table rated with empty decanters and relics of dessert he had intended to go to the play too but sleep had overtaken him after a copious meal and he had flung up his legs on the bench and indulged in a nap instead of the dramatic amusement the major was meditating how to address the young man but the latter prevented him that trouble  like to look at the evening paper sir said mr foker who was always communicative and affable and he took up the globe from his table and offered it to the newcomer  i am very much obliged to you said the major with a grateful bow and smile if i dont mistake the family likeness i have the pleasure of speaking to mr henry foker lady agnes fokers son i have the happiness to name her ladyship among my acquaintancesand you bear sir a rosherville face  hullo i beg your pardon mr foker said i took youhe was going to sayi took you for a commercial gent but he stopped that phrase to whom have i the pleasure of speaking he added  to a relative of a friend and schoolfellow of yoursarthur pendennis my nephew who has often spoken to me about you in terms of great regard i am major pendennis of whom you may have heard him speak may i take my sodawater at your table i have had the pleasure of sitting at your grandfathers  sir you do me proud said mr foker with much courtesy and so you are arthur pendenniss uncle are you  and guardian added the major  hes as good a fellow as ever stepped sir said mr foker  i am glad you think so  and clever tooi was always a stupid chap i wasbut you see sir i know em when they are clever and like em of that sort  you show your taste and your modesty too said the major i have heard arthur repeatedly speak of you and he said your talents were very good  im not good at the books mr foker said wagging his headnever could manage thatpendennis couldhe used to do half the chaps versesand yetthe young gentleman broke out you are his guardian and i hope you will pardon me for saying that i think hes what we call flat the candid young gentleman said  the major found himself on the instant in the midst of a most interesting and confidential conversation and how is arthur a flat he asked with a smile  you know foker answered winking at himhe would have winked at the duke of wellington with just as little scruple for he was in that state of absence candour and fearlessness which a man sometimes possesses after drinking a couple of bottles of wineyou know arthurs a flatabout women i mean  he is not the first of us my dear mr harry answered the major i have heard something of thisbut pray tell me more  why sir you seeits partly my fault he went to the play one nightfor you see im down here readin for my little go during the long only i come over from baymouth pretty often in my dragwell sir we went to the play and pen was struck all of a heap with miss fotheringaycostigan her real name isan uncommon fine gal she is too and the next morning i introduced him to the general as we call her fathera regular old scamp and such a boy for the whiskyandwaterand hes gone on being intimate there and hes fallen in love with herand im blessed if he hasnt proposed to her foker said slapping his hand on the table until all the dessert began to jingle  what you know it too asked the major  know it dont i and many more too we were talking about it at mess yesterday and chaffing derby oaksuntil he was as mad as a hatter know sir derby oaks we dined together and he went to the play we were standing at the door smoking i remember when you passed in to dinner  i remember sir thomas oaks his father before he was a baronet or a knight he lived in cavendishsquare and was physician to queen charlotte  the young one is making the money spin i can tell you mr foker said  and is sir derby oaks the major said with great delight and anxiety another soupirant  another what inquired mr foker  another admirer of miss fotheringay  lord bless you we call him mondays wednesdays and fridays and pen tuesdays thursdays and saturdays but mind you nothing wrong no no miss f is a deal too wideawake for that major pendennis she plays one off against the other what you call two strings to her bow  i think you seem tolerably wideawake too mr foker pendennis said laughing  pretty well thank you sirhow are you foker replied imperturbably im not clever praps but i am rather downy and partial friends say i know whats oclock tolerably well can i tell you the time of day in any way  upon my word the major answered quite delighted i think you may be of very great service to me you are a young man of the world and with such one likes to deal and as such i need not inform you that our family is by no means delighted at this absurd intrigue in which arthur is engaged  i should rather think not said mr foker connexion not eligible too much beer drunk on the premises no irish need apply that i take to be your meaning  the major said it was exactly though in truth he did not quite understand what mr fokers meaning was and he proceeded to examine his new acquaintance regarding the amiable family into which his nephew proposed to enter and soon got from the candid witness a number of particulars regarding the house of costigan  we must do mr foker the justice to say that he spoke most favourably of mr and miss costigans moral character you see said he i think the general is fond of the jovial bowl and if i wanted to be very certain of my money it isnt in his pocket id invest itbut he has always kept a watchful eye on his daughter and neither he nor she will stand anything but whats honourable pens attentions to her are talked about in the whole company and i hear all about them from a young lady who used to be very intimate with her and with whose family i sometimes take tea in a friendly way miss rouncy says sir derby oaks has been hanging about miss fotheringay ever since his regiment has been down here but pen has come in and cut him out lately which has made the baronet so mad that he has been very near on the point of proposing too wish he would and youd see which of the two miss fotheringay would jump at  i thought as much the major said you give me a great deal of pleasure mr foker i wish i could have seen you before  didnt like to put in my oar replied the other dont speak till im asked when if theres no objections i speak pretty freely heard your man had been hankering about my servantdidnt know myself what was going on until miss fotheringay and miss rouncy had the row about the ostrich feathers when miss r told me everything  miss rouncy i gather was the confidante of the other  confidant i believe you why shes twice as clever a girl as fotheringay and literary and that while miss foth cant do much more than read  she can write said the major remembering pens breastpocket  foker broke out into a sardonic he he rouncy writes her letters he said every one of em and since theyve quarrelled she dont know how the deuce to get on miss rouncy is an uncommon pretty hand whereas the old one makes dreadful work of the writing and spelling when bows aint by rouncys been settin her copies latelyshe writes a beautiful hand rouncy does  i suppose you know it pretty well said the major archly upon which mr foker winked at him again  i would give a great deal to have a specimen of her handwriting continued major pendennis i dare say you could give me one  no no that would be too bad foker replied perhaps i oughtnt to have said as much as i have miss fs writin aint so very bad i dare say only she got miss r to write the first letter and has gone on ever since but you mark my word that till they are friends again the letters will stop  i hope they will never be reconciled the major said with great sincerity and i cant tell you how delighted i am to have had the good fortune of making your acquaintance you must feel my dear sir as a man of the world how fatal to my nephews prospects in life is this step which he contemplates and how eager we all must be to free him from this absurd engagement  he has come out uncommon strong said mr foker i have seen his verses rouncy copied em and i said to myself when i saw em catch me writin verses to a womanthats all  he has made a fool of himself as many a good fellow has before him how can we make him see his folly and cure it i am sure you will give us what aid you can in extricating a generous young man from such a pair of schemers as this father and daughter seem to be love on the ladys side is out of the question  love indeed foker said if pen hadnt two thousand a year when he came of age  if pen hadnt what cried out the major in astonishment  two thousand a year hasnt he got two thousand a yearthe general says he has  my dear friend shrieked out the major with an eagerness which this gentleman rarely showed thank youthank youi begin to see nowtwo thousand a year why his mother has but five hundred a year in the worldshe is likely to live to eighty and arthur has not a shilling but what she can allow him  what he aint rich then foker asked  upon my honour he has no more than what i say  and you aint going to leave him anything  the major had sunk every shilling he could scrape together on an annuity and of course was going to leave pen nothing but he did not tell foker this how much do you think a major on halfpay can save he asked if these people have been looking at him as a fortune they are utterly mistakenandand you have made me the happiest man in the world  sir to you said mr foker politely and when they parted for the night they shook hands with the greatest cordiality the younger gentleman promising the elder not to leave chatteris without a further conversation in the morning and as the major went up to his room and mr foker smoked his cigar against the door pillars of the george pen very likely ten miles off was lying in bed kissing the letter from his emily  the next morning before mr foker drove off in his drag the insinuating major had actually got a letter of miss rouncys in his own pocketbook let it be a lesson to women how they write and in very high spirits major pendennis went to call upon doctor portman at the deanery and told him what happy discoveries he had made on the previous night as they sate in confidential conversation in the deans oak breakfastparlour they could look across the lawn and see captain costigans window at which poor pen had been only too visible some three weeks since the doctor was most indignant against mrs creed the landlady for her duplicity in concealing sir derby oakss constant visits to her lodgers and threatened to excommunicate her out of the cathedral but the wary major thought that all things were for the best and having taken counsel with himself over night felt himself quite strong enough to go and face captain costigan  im going to fight the dragon he said with a laugh to doctor portman  and i shrive you sir and bid good fortune go with you answered the doctor perhaps he and mrs portman and miss myra as they sate with their friend the deans lady in her drawingroom looked up more than once at the enemys window to see if they could perceive any signs of the combat  the major walked round according to the directions given him and soon found mrs creeds little door he passed it and as he ascended to captain costigans apartment he could hear a stamping of feet and a great shouting of ha ha within  its sir derby oaks taking his fencing lesson said the child who piloted major pendennis he takes it mondays wednesdays and fridays  the major knocked and at length a tall gentleman came forth with a foil and mask in one hand and a fencing glove on the other  pendennis made him a deferential bow i believe i have the honour of speaking to captain costiganmy name is major pendennis  the captain brought his weapon up to the salute and said major the honer is moine im deloighted to see ye     chapter xi negotiation   the major and captain costigan were old soldiers and accustomed to face the enemy so we may presume that they retained their presence of mind perfectly but the rest of the party assembled in coss sittingroom were perhaps a little flurried at pendenniss apparition miss fotheringays slow heart began to beat no doubt for her cheek flushed up with a great healthy blush as lieutenant sir derby oaks looked at her with a scowl the little crooked old man in the windowseat who had been witnessing the fencingmatch between the two gentlemen whose stamping and jumping had been such as to cause him to give up all attempts to continue writing the theatre music in the copying of which he had been engaged looked up eagerly towards the newcomer as the major of the wellblacked boots entered the apartment distributing the most graceful bows to everybody present  me daughterme friend mr bowsme gallant young pupil and friend i may call um sir derby oaks said costigan splendidly waving his hand and pointing each of these individuals to the majors attention in one moment meejor im your humble servant and to dash into the little adjoining chamber where he slept to give a twist to his lank hair with his hairbrush a wonderful and ancient piece to tear off his old stock and put on a new one which emily had constructed for him and to assume a handsome clean collar and the new coat which had been ordered upon the occasion of miss fotheringays benefit was with the still active costigan the work of a minute  after him sir derby entered and presently emerged from the same apartment where he also cased himself in his little shelljacket which fitted tightly upon the young officers big person and which he and miss fotheringay and poor pen too perhaps admired prodigiously  meanwhile conversation was engaged between the actress and the newcomer and the usual remarks about the weather had been interchanged before costigan reentered in his new shoot as he called it  i neednt apologoise to ye meejor he said in his richest and most courteous manner for receiving ye in me shirtsleeves  an old soldier cant be better employed than in teaching a young one the use of his sword answered the major gallantly i remember in old times hearing that you could use yours pretty well captain costigan  what yeve heard of jack costigan major said the other greatly  the major had indeed he had pumped his nephew concerning his new friend the irish officer and whether he had no other knowledge of the captain than what he had thus gained or whether he actually remembered him we cannot say but major pendennis was a person of honour and undoubted veracity and said that he perfectly well recollected meeting mr costigan and hearing him sing at sir richard strachans table at walcheren  at this information and the bland and cordial manner in which it was conveyed bows looked up entirely puzzled but we will talk of these matters another time the major continued perhaps not wishing to commit himself it is to miss fotheringay that i came to pay my respects today and he performed another bow for her so courtly and gracious that if she had been a duchess he could not have made it more handsome  i had heard of your performances from my nephew madam the major said who raves about you as i believe you know pretty well but arthur is but a boy and a wild enthusiastic young fellow whose opinions one must not take au pied de la lettre and i confess i was anxious to judge for myself permit me to say your performance delighted and astonished me i have seen our best actresses and on my word i think you surpass them all you are as majestic as mrs siddons  faith i always said so costigan said winking at his daughter major take a chair milly rose at this hint took an uuripped satin garment off the only vacant seat and brought the latter to major pendennis with one of her finest curtseys  you are as pathetic as miss oneill he continued bowing and seating himself your snatches of song reminded me of mrs jordan in her best time when we were young men captain costigan and your manner reminded me of mars did you ever see the mars miss fotheringay  there was two mahers in crow street remarked miss emily fanny was well enough but biddy was no great things  sure the major means the god of war milly my dear interposed the parent  it is not that mars i meant though venus i suppose may be pardoned for thinking about him the major replied with a smile directed in full to sir derby oaks who now reentered in his shelljacket but the lady did not understand the words of which he made use nor did the compliment at all pacify sir derby who probably did not understand it either and at any rate received it with great sulkiness and stiffness scowling uneasily at miss fotheringay with an expression which seemed to ask what the deuce does this man here  major pendennis was not in the least annoyed by the gentlemans illhumour on the contrary it delighted him so thought he a rival is in the field and he offered up vows that sir derby might be not only a rival but a winner too in this lovematch in which he and pen were engaged  i fear i interrupted your fencing lesson but my stay in chatteris is very short and i was anxious to make myself known to my old fellowcampaigner captain costigan and to see a lady nearer who had charmed me so much from the stage i was not the only man epris last night miss fotheringay if i must call you so though your own family name is a very ancient and noble one there was a reverend friend of mine who went home in raptures with ophelia and i saw sir derby oaks fling a bouquet which no actress ever merited better i should have brought one myself had i known what i was going to see are not those the very flowers in a glass of water on the mantelpiece yonder  i am very fond of flowers said miss fotheringay with a languishing ogle at sir derby oaksbut the baronet still scowled sulkily  sweets to the sweetisnt that the expression of the play mr pendennis asked bent upon being goodhumoured  pon my life i dont know very likely it is i aint much of a literary man answered sir derby  is it possible the major continued with an air of surprise you dont inherit your fathers love of letters then sir derby he was a remarkably fine scholar and i had the honour of knowing him very well  indeed said the other and gave a sulky wag of his head  he saved my life continued pendennis  did he now cried miss fotheringay rolling her eyes first upon the major with surprise then towards sir derby with gratitudebut the latter was proof against those glances and far from appearing to be pleased that the apothecary his father should have saved major pendenniss life the young man actually looked as if he wished the event had turned the other way  my father i believe was a very good doctor the young gentleman said by way of reply im not in that line myself i wish you good morning sir ive got an appointmentcos byebyemiss fotheringay good morning and in spite of the young ladys imploring looks and appealing smiles the dragoon bowed stiffly out of the room and the clatter of his sabre was heard as he strode down the creaking stair and the angry tones of his voice as he cursed little tom creed who was disporting in the passage and whose pegtop sir derby kicked away with an oath into the street  the major did not smile in the least though he had every reason to be amused monstrous handsome young man thatas fine a looking soldier as ever i saw he said to costigan  a credit to the army and to human nature in general answered costigan a young man of refoined manners polite affabilitee and princely fortune his table is sumptuous hes adawrd in the regiment and he rides sixteen stone  a perfect champion said the major laughing i have no doubt all the ladies admire him  hes very well in spite of his weight now hes young said milly but hes no conversation  hes best on horseback mr bows said on which milly replied that the baronet had ridden third in the steeplechase on his horse tareaways and the major began to comprehend that the young lady herself was not of a particular genius and to wonder how she should be so stupid and act so well  costigan with irish hospitality of course pressed refreshment upon his guest and the major who was no more hungry than you are after a lord mayors dinner declared that he should like a biscuit and a glass of wine above all things as he felt quite faint from long fastingbut he knew that to receive small kindnesses flatters the donors very much and that people must needs grow well disposed towards you as they give you their hospitality  some of the old madara milly love costigan said winking to his childand that lady turning to her father a glance of intelligence went out of the room and down the stair where she softly summoned her little emissary master tommy creed and giving him a piece of money ordered him to go buy a pint of madara wine at the grapes and sixpennyworth of sorted biscuits at the bakers and to return in a hurry when he might have two biscuits for himself  whilst tommy creed was gone on this errand miss costigan sate below with mrs creed telling her landlady how mr arthur pendenniss uncle the major was abovestairs a nice softspoken old gentleman that butter wouldnt melt in his mouth and how sir derby had gone out of the room in a rage of jealousy and thinking what must be done to pacify both of them  she keeps the keys of the cellar major said mr costigan as the girl left the room  upon my word you have a very beautiful butler answered pendennis gallantly and i dont wonder at the young fellows raving about her when we were of their age captain costigan i think plainer women would have done our business  faith and ye may say that sirand lucky is the man who gets her ask me friend bob bows here whether miss fotheringays moind is not even shuparior to her person and whether she does not possess a cultiveated intellect a refoined understanding and an emiable disposition  o of course said mr bows rather drily here comes hebe blushing from the cellar dont you think it is time to go to rehearsal miss hebe you will be fined if you are laterand he gave the young lady a look which intimated that they had much better leave the room and the two elders together  at this order miss hebe took up her bonnet and shawl looking uncommonly pretty goodhumoured and smiling and bows gathered up his roll of papers and hobbled across the room for his hat and cane  must you go said the major cant you give us a few minutes more miss fotheringay before you leave us permit an old fellow to shake you by the hand and believe that i am proud to have had the honour of making your acquaintance and am most sincerely anxious to be your friend  miss fotheringay made a low curtsey at the conclusion of this gallant speech and the major followed her retreating steps to the door where he squeezed her hand with the kindest and most paternal pressure bows was puzzled with this exhibition of cordiality the lads relatives cant be really wanting to marry him to her he thoughtand so they departed  now for it thought major pendennis and as for mr costigan he profited instantaneously by his daughters absence to drink up the rest of the wine and tossed off one bumper after another of the madeira from the grapes with an eager shaking hand the major came up to the table and took up his glass and drained it with a jovial smack if it had been lord steynes particular and not publichouse cape he could not have appeared to relish it more  capital madeira captain costigan he said where do you get it i drink the health of that charming creature in a bumper faith captain i dont wonder that the men are wild about her i never saw such eyes in my life or such a grand manner i am sure she is as intellectual as she is beautiful and i have no doubt shes as good as she is clever  a good girl sira good girl sir said the delighted father and i pledge a toast to her with all my heart shall i send to theto the cellar for another pint its handy by no well indeed sir ye may say she is a good girl and the pride and glory of her fatherhonest old jack costigan the man who gets her will have a jewl to a wife sir and i drink his health sir and ye know who i mean major  i am not surprised at young or old falling in love with her said the major and frankly must tell you that though i was very angry with my poor nephew arthur when i heard of the boys passionnow i have seen the lady i can pardon him any extent of it by george i should like to enter for the race myself if i werent an old fellow and a poor one  and no better man major im sure cried jack enraptured  your friendship sir delights me your admiration for my girl brings tears to me eyestears sirmanlee tearsand when she leaves me humble home for your own more splendid mansion i hope shell keep a place for her poor old father poor old jack costiganthe captain suited the action to the word and his bloodshot eyes were suffused with water as he addressed the major  your sentiments do you honour the other said but captain costigan i cant help smiling at one thing you have just said  and whats that sir asked jack who was at a too heroic and sentimental pitch to descend from it you were speaking about our splendid mansionmy sisters house i mean  i mane the park and mansion of arthur pendennis esquire of fairoaks park whom i hope to see a mimber of parliament for his native town of clavering when he is of ege to take that responsible stetion cried the captain with much dignity  the major smiled as he recognised a shaft of his own bow it was he who had set pen upon the idea of sitting in parliament for the neighbouring boroughand the poor lad had evidently been bragging on the subject to costigan and the lady of his affections fairoaks park my dear sir he said do you know our history we are of excessively ancient family certainly but i began life with scarce enough money to purchase my commission and my eldest brother was a country apothecary who made every shilling he died possessed of out of his pestle and mortar  i have consented to waive that objection sir said costigan majestically in consideration of the known respectability of your family  curse your impudence thought the major but he only smiled and bowed  the costigans too have met with misfortunes and our house of castle costigan is by no manes what it was i have known very honest men apothecaries sir and theres some in dublin that has had the honour of dining at the lord leftenants teeble  you are very kind to give us the benefit of your charity the major continued but permit me to say that is not the question you spoke just now of my little nephew as heir of fairoaks park and i dont know what besides  funded property ive no doubt meejor and something handsome eventually from yourself  my good sir i tell you the boy is the son of a country apothecary cried out major pendennis and that when he comes of age he wont have a shilling  pooh major youre laughing at me said mr costigan me young friend i make no doubt is heir to two thousand pounds a year  two thousand fiddlesticks i beg your pardon my dear sir but has the boy been humbugging youit is not his habit upon my word and honour as a gentleman and an executor to my brothers will too he left little more than five hundred a year behind him  and with aconomy a handsome sum of money too sir the captain answered faith ive known a man drink his clart and drive his coachandfour on five hundred a year and strict aconomy in ireland sir well manage on it sirtrust jack costigan for that  my dear captain costigani give you my word that my brother did not leave a shilling to his son arthur  are ye joking with me meejor pendennis cried jack costigan are ye thrifling with the feelings of a father and a gentleman  i am telling you the honest truth said major pendennis every shilling my brother had he left to his widow with a partial reversion it is true to the boy but she is a young woman and may marry if he offends heror she may outlive him for she comes of an uncommonly longlived family and i ask you as a gentleman and a man of the world what allowance can my sister mrs pendennis make to her son out of five hundred a year which is all her fortunethat shall enable him to maintain himself and your daughter in the rank befitting such an accomplished young lady  am i to understand sir that the young gentleman your nephew and whom i have fosthered and cherished as the son of me bosom is an imposther who has been thrifling with the affections of me beloved child exclaimed the general with an outbreak of wrathhave you yourself been working upon the feelings of the young mans susceptible nature to injuice him to break off an engagement and with it me adored emilys heart have a care sir how you thrifle with the honour of john costigan if i thought any mortal man meant to do so be heavens id have his blood sirwere he old or young  mr costigan cried out the major  mr costigan can protect his own and his daughters honour and will sir said the other look at that chest of dthrawers it contains heaps of letthers that that viper has addressed to that innocent child theres promises there sir enough to fill a bandbox with and when i have dragged the scoundthrel before the courts of law and shown up his perjury and his dishonour i have another remedy in yondther mahogany case sir which shall set me right sir with any individualye mark me words major pendenniswith any individual who has counselled your nephew to insult a soldier and a gentleman what me daughter to be jilted and me grey hairs dishonoured by an apothecarys son by the laws of heaven sir i should like to see the man that shall do it  i am to understand then that you threaten in the first place to publish the letters of a boy of eighteen to a woman of eightandtwenty and afterwards to do me the honour of calling me out the major said still with perfect coolness  you have described my intentions with perfect accuracy meejor pendennis answered the captain as he pulled his ragged whiskers over his chin  well well these shall be the subjects of future arrangements but before we come to powder and ball my good sirdo have the kindness to think with yourself in what earthly way i have injured you i have told you that my nephew is dependent upon his mother who has scarcely more than five hundred a year  i have my own opinion of the correctness of that assertion said the captain  will you go to my sisters lawyers messrs tatham here and satisfy yourself  i decline to meet those gentlemen said the captain with rather a disturbed air if it be as you say i have been athrociously deceived by some one and on that person ill be revenged  is it my nephew cried the major starting up and putting on his hat did he ever tell you that his property was two thousand a year if he did im mistaken in the boy to tell lies has not been a habit in our family mr costigan and i dont think my brothers son has learned it as yet try and consider whether you have not deceived yourself or adopted extravagant reports from hearsayas for me sir you are at liberty to understand that i am not afraid of all the costigans in ireland and know quite well how to defend myself against any threats from any quarter i come here as the boys guardian to protest against a marriage most absurd and unequal that cannot but bring poverty and misery with it and in preventing it i conceive i am quite as much your daughters friend who i have no doubt is an honourable young lady as the friend of my own family and prevent the marriage i will sir by every means in my power there i have said my say sir  but i have not said mine major pendennisand ye shall hear more from me mr costigan said with a look of tremendous severity  sdeath sir what do you mean the major asked turning round on the threshold of the door and looking the intrepid costigan in the face  ye said in the coorse of conversation that ye were at the george hotel i think mr costigan said in a stately manner a friend shall wait upon ye there before ye leave town sir  let him make haste mr costigan cried out the major almost beside himself with rage i wish you a good morning sir and captain costigan bowed a magnificent bow of defiance to major pendennis over the landingplace as the latter retreated down the stairs     chapter xii in which a shooting match is proposed   early mention has been made in this history of mr garbetts principal tragedian a promising and athletic young actor of jovial habits and irregular inclinations between whom and mr costigan there was a considerable intimacy they were the chief ornaments of the convivial club held at the magpie hotel they helped each other in various bill transactions in which they had been engaged with the mutual loan of each others valuable signatures they were friends in fine although mr garbetts seldom called at costigans house being disliked by miss fotheringay of whom in her turn mrs garbetts was considerably jealous the truth is that garbetts had paid his court to miss fotheringay and been refused by her before he offered his hand to mrs g their history however forms no part of our present schemesuffice it mr garbetts was called in by captain costigan immediately after his daughter and mr bows had quitted the house as a friend proper to be consulted at the actual juncture he was a large man with a loud voice and fierce aspect who had the finest legs of the whole company and could break a poker in mere sport across his stalwart arm  run tommy said mr costigan to the little messenger and fetch mr garbetts from his lodgings over the tripe shop ye know and tell em to send two glasses of whiskyandwater hot from the grapes so tommy went his way and presently mr garbetts and the whisky came  captain costigan did not disclose to him the whole of the previous events of which the reader is in possession but with the aid of the spiritsandwater he composed a letter of a threatening nature to major pendenniss address in which he called upon that gentleman to offer no hindrance to the marriage projected between mr arthur pendennis and his daughter miss fotheringay and to fix an early day for its celebration or in any other case to give him the satisfaction which was usual between gentlemen of honour and should major pendennis be disinclined to this alternative the captain hinted that he would force him to accept by the use of a horsewhip which he should employ upon the majors person the precise terms of this letter we cannot give for reasons which shall be specified presently but it was no doubt couched in the captains finest style and sealed elaborately with the great silver seal of the costigansthe only bit of the family plate which the captain possessed  garbetts was despatched then with this message and letter and bidding heaven bless um the general squeezed his ambassadors hand and saw him depart then he took down his venerable and murderous duellingpistols with flint locks that had done the business of many a pretty fellow in dublin and having examined these and seen that they were in a satisfactory condition he brought from the drawer all pens letters and poems which he kept there and which he always read before he permitted his emily to enjoy their perusal  in a score of minutes garbetts came back with an anxious and crestfallen countenance  yeve seen um the captain said  why yes said garbetts  and when is it for asked costigan trying the lock of one of the ancient pistols and bringing it to a level with his oias he called that bloodshot orb  when is what for asked mr garbetts  the meeting my dear fellow  you dont mean to say you mean mortal combat captain garbetts said aghast  what the devil else do i mean garbettsi want to shoot that man that has trajuiced me honor or meself dthrop a victim on the sod  d if i carry challenges mr garbetts replied im a family man captain and will have nothing to do with pistolstake back your letter and to the surprise and indignation of captain costigan his emissary flung the letter down with its great sprawling superscription and blotched seal  ye dont mean to say ye saw um and didnt give um the letter cried out the captain in a fury  i saw him but i could not have speech with him captain said mr garbetts  and why the devil not asked the other  there was one there i cared not to meet nor would you the tragedian answered in a sepulchral voice the minion tatham was there captain  the cowardly scoundthrel roared costigan hes frightened and already going to swear the peace against me  ill have nothing to do with the fighting mark that the tragedian doggedly said and i wish id not seen tatham neither nor that bit of  hold your tongue bob acres its my belief yere no better than a coward said captain costigan quoting sir lucius otrigger which character he had performed with credit both off and on the stage and after some more parley between the couple they separated in not very good humour  their colloquy has been here condensed as the reader knows the main point upon which it turned but the latter will now see how it is impossible to give a correct account of the letter which the captain wrote to major pendennis as it was never opened at all by that gentleman  when miss costigan came home from rehearsal which she did in the company of the faithful mr bows she found her father pacing up and down their apartment in a great state of agitation and in the midst of a powerful odour of spiritsandwater which as it appeared had not succeeded in pacifying his disordered mind the pendennis papers were on the table surrounding the empty goblets and now useless teaspoon which had served to hold and mix the captains liquor and his friends as emily entered he seized her in his arms and cried out prepare yourself me child me blessed child in a voice of agony and with eyes brimful of tears  yere tipsy again papa miss fotheringay said pushing back her sire ye promised me ye wouldnt take spirits before dinner  its to forget me sorrows me poor girl that ive taken just a drop cried the bereaved fatherits to drown me care that i drain the bowl  your care takes a deal of drowning captain dear said bows mimicking his friends accent what has happened has that softspoken gentleman in the wig been vexing you  the oily miscreant ill have his blood roared cos miss milly it must be premised had fled to her room out of his embrace and was taking off her bonnet and shawl there  i thought he meant mischief he was so uncommon civil the other said what has he come to say  o bows he has overwhellumd me the captain said theres a hellish conspiracy on foot against me poor girl and its me opinion that both them pendennises nephew and uncle is two infernal thrators and scoundthrels who should be conshumed from off the face of the earth  what is it what has happened said mr bows growing rather excited  costigan then told him the majors statement that the young pendennis had not two thousand nor two hundred pounds a year and expressed his fury that he should have permitted such an impostor to coax and wheedle his innocent girl and that he should have nourished such a viper in his own personal bosom i have shaken the reptile from me however said costigan and as for his uncle ill have such a revenge on that old man as shall make um rue the day he ever insulted a costigan  what do you mean general said bows  i mean to have his life bowshis villanous skulking life my boy and he rapped upon the battered old pistolcase in an ominous and savage manner bows had often heard him appeal to that box of death with which he proposed to sacrifice his enemies but the captain did not tell him that he had actually written and sent a challenge to major pendennis and mr bows therefore rather disregarded the pistols in the present instance  at this juncture miss fotheringay returned to the common sittingroom from her private apartment looking perfectly healthy happy and unconcerned a striking and wholesome contrast to her father who was in a delirious tremor of grief anger and other agitation she brought in a pair of exwhite satin shoes with her which she proposed to rub as clean as might be with breadcrumb intending to go mad with them upon next tuesday evening in ophelia in which character she was to reappear on that night  she looked at the papers on the table stopped as if she was going to ask a question but thought better of it and going to the cupboard selected an eligible piece of bread wherewith she might operate on the satin slippers and afterwards coming back to the table seated herself there commodiously with the shoes and then asked her father in her honest irish brogue what have ye got them letthers and pothry and stuff of master arthurs out for pa sure ye dont want to be reading over that nonsense  o emilee cried the captain that boy whom i loved as the boy of mee bosom is only a scoundthrel and a deceiver mee poor girl and he looked in the most tragical way at mr bows opposite who in his turn gazed somewhat anxiously at miss costigan  he pooh sure the poor lads as simple as a schoolboy she said all them children write verses and nonsense  hes been acting the part of a viper to this fireside and a traitor in this familee cried the captain i tell ye hes no better than an impostor  what has the poor fellow done papa asked emily  done he has deceived us in the most athrocious manner miss emilys papa said he has thrifled with your affections and outraged my own fine feelings he has represented himself as a man of property and it turruns out that he is no betther than a beggar havent i often told ye he had two thousand a year hes a pauper i tell ye miss costigan a depindent upon the bountee of his mother a good woman who may marry again whos likely to live for ever and who has but five hundred a year how dar he ask ye to marry into a family which has not the means of providing for ye yeve been grossly deceived and put upon milly and its my belief his old ruffian of an uncle in a wig is in the plot against us  that soft old gentleman what has he been doing papa continued emily still imperturbable  costigan informed milly that when she was gone major pendennis told him in his doublefaced pall mall polite manner that young arthur had no fortune at all that the major had asked him costigan to go to the lawyers wherein he knew the scoundthrels have a bill of mine and i cant meet them the captain parenthetically remarked and see the lads fathers will and finally that an infernal swindle had been practised upon him by the pair and that he was resolved either on a marriage or on the blood of both of them  milly looked very grave and thoughtful rubbing the white satin shoes sure if hes no money theres no use marrying him papa she said sententiously  why did the villain say he was a man of prawpertee asked costigan  the poor fellow always said he was poor answered the girl twas you would have it he was rich papaand made me agree to take him  he should have been explicit and told us his income milly answered the father a young fellow who rides a blood mare and makes presents of shawls and bracelets is an impostor if he has no moneyand as for his uncle bedad ill pull off his wig whenever i see um bows here shall take a message to him and tell him so either its a marriage or he meets me in the field like a man or i tweak um on the nose in front of his hotel or in the gravel walks of fairoaks park before all the county bedad  bedad you may send somebody else with the message said bows laughing im a fiddler not a fighting man captain  pooh youve no spirit sir roared the general ill be my own second if no one will stand by and see me injured and ill take my case of pistols and shoot um in the coffeeroom of the george  and so poor arthur has no money sighed out miss costigan rather plaintively poor lad he was a good lad too wild and talking nonsense with his verses and pothry and that but a brave generous boy and indeed i liked himand he liked me too she added rather softly and rubbing away at the shoe  why dont you marry him if you like him so mr bows said rather savagely he is not more than ten years younger than you are his mother may relent and you might go and live and have enough at fairoaks park why not go and be a lady i could go on with the fiddle and the general live on his halfpay why dont you marry him you know he likes you  theres others that likes me as well bows that has no money and thats old enough miss milly said sententiously  yes d it said bows with a bitter cursethat are old enough and poor enough and fools enough for anything  theres old fools and young fools too youve often said so you silly man the imperious beauty said with a conscious glance at the old gentleman if pendennis has not enough money to live upon its folly to talk about marrying him and thats the long and short of it  and the boy said mr bows by jove you throw a man away like an old glove miss costigan  i dont know what you mean bows said miss fotheringay placidly rubbing the second shoe if he had had half of the two thousand a year that papa gave him or the half of that i would marry him but what is the good of taking on with a beggar were poor enough already theres no use in my going to live with an old lady thats testy and cross maybe and would grudge me every morsel of meat sure its near dinner time and suky not laid the cloth yet and then added miss costigan quite simply suppose there was a familywhy papa we shouldnt be as well off as we are now  deed then you would not milly dear answered the father  and theres an end to all the fine talk about mrs arthur pendennis of fairoaks parkthe member of parliaments lady said milly with a laugh pretty carriages and horses we should have to ridethat you were always talking about papa but its always the same if a man looked at me you fancied he was going to marry me and if he had a good coat you fancied he was as rich as crazes  as croesus said mr bows  well call um what ye like but its a fact now that papa has married me these eight years a score of times wasnt i to be my lady poldoody of oystherstown castle then there was the navy captain at portsmouth and the old surgeon at norwich and the methodist preacher here last year and who knows how many more well i bet a penny with all your scheming i shall die milly costigan at last so poor little arthur has no money stop and take dinner bows weve a beautiful beefsteak pudding  i wonder whether she is on with sir derby oaks thought bows whose eyes and thoughts were always watching her the dodges of women beat all comprehension and i am sure she wouldnt let the lad off so easily if she had not some other scheme on hand  it will have been perceived that miss fotheringay though silent in general and by no means brilliant as a conversationist where poetry literature or the fine arts were concerned could talk freely and with good sense too in her own family circle she cannot justly be called a romantic person nor were her literary acquirement great she never opened a shakspeare from the day she left the stage nor indeed understood it during all the time she adorned the boards but about a pudding a piece of needlework or her own domestic affairs she was as good a judge as could be found and not being misled by a strong imagination or a passionate temper was better enabled to keep her judgment cool when over their dinner costigan tried to convince himself and the company that the majors statement regarding pens finances was unworthy of credit and a mere ruse upon the old hypocrites part so as to induce them on their side to break off the match miss milly would not for a moment admit the possibility of deceit on the side of the adversary and pointed out clearly that it was her father who had deceived himself and not poor little pen who had tried to take them in as for that poor lad she said she pitied him with all her heart and she ate an exceedingly good dinner to the admiration of mr bows who had a remarkable regard and contempt for this woman during and after which repast the party devised upon the best means of bringing this lovematter to a close as for costigan his idea of tweaking the majors nose vanished with his supply of afterdinner whiskyandwater and he was submissive to his daughter and ready for any plan on which she might decide in order to meet the crisis which she saw was at hand  the captain who as long as he had a notion that he was wronged was eager to face and demolish both pen and his uncle perhaps shrank from the idea of meeting the former and asked what the juice they were to say to the lad if he remained steady to his engagement and they broke from theirs what dont you know how to throw a man over said bows ask a woman to tell you and miss fotheringay showed how this feat was to be done simply enoughnothing was more easy papa writes to arthur to know what settlements he proposes to make in event of a marriage and asks what his means are arthur writes back and says what hes got and youll find its as the major says ill go bail then papa writes and says its not enough and the match had best be at an end  and of course you enclose a parting line in which you say you will always regard him as a brother said mr bows eyeing her in his scornful way  of course and so i shall answered miss fotheringay hes a most worthy young man im sure ill thank ye hand me the salt them filberts is beautiful  and there will be no noses pulled cos my boy im sorry youre baulked said mr bows  dad i suppose not said cos rubbing his ownwhatll ye do about them letters and verses and pomes milly darlingye must send em back  wigsby would give a hundred pound for em bows said with a sneer  deed then he would said captain costigan who was easily led  papa said miss millyye wouldnt be for not sending the poor boy his letters back them letters and pomes is mine they were very long and full of all sorts of nonsense and latin and things i couldnt understand the half of indeed ive not read em all but well send em back to him when the proper time comes and going to a drawer miss fotheringay took out from it a number of the county chronicle and chatteris champion in which pen had written a copy of flaming verses celebrating her appearance in the character of imogen and putting by the leaf upon which the poem appeared for like ladies of her profession she kept the favourable printed notices of her performances she wrapped up pens letters poems passions and fancies and tied them with a piece of string neatly as she would a parcel of sugar  nor was she in the least moved while performing this act what hours the boy had passed over those papers what love and longing what generous faith and manly devotionwhat watchful nights and lonely fevers might they tell of she tied them up like so much grocery and sate down and made tea afterwards with a perfectly placid and contented heart while pen was yearning after her ten miles off and hugging her image to his soul     chapter xiii a crisis   meanwhile they were wondering at fairoaks that the major had not returned dr portman and his lady on their way home to clavering stopped at helens lodgegate with a brief note for her from major pendennis in which he said he should remain at chatteris another day being anxious to have some talk with messrs tatham the lawyers whom he would meet that afternoon but no mention was made of the transaction in which the writer had been engaged during the morning indeed the note was written at the pause after the first part of the engagement and when the major had decidedly had the worst of the battle  pen did not care somehow to go into the town whilst his uncle was there he did not like to have to fancy that his guardian might be spying at him from that abominable deans grassplat whilst he was making love in miss costigans drawingroom and the pleasures of a walk a delight which he was very rarely permitted to enjoy would have been spoiled if he had met the man of the polished boots on that occasion his modest love could not show in public by any outward signs except the eyes with which the poor fellow ogled and gazed violently to be sure but it was dumb in the presence of third parties and so much the better for of all the talk which takes place in this world that of lovemakers is surely to the uninitiated the most silly it is the vocabulary without the key it is the lamp without the flame let the respected reader look or think over some old loveletters that he or she has had and forgotten and try them over again how blank and meaningless they seem what glamour of infatuation was it which made that nonsense beautiful one wonders that such puling and trash could ever have made one happy and yet there were dates when you kissed those silly letters with rapturelived upon six absurd lines for a week and until the reactionary period came when you were restless and miserable until you got a fresh supply of folly  that is why we decline to publish any of the letters and verses which mr pen wrote at this period of his life out of mere regard for the young fellows character they are too spooney and wild young ladies ought not to be called upon to read them in cold blood bide your time young women perhaps you will get and write them on your own account soon meanwhile we will respect mr pens first outpourings and keep them tied up in the newspapers with miss fotheringays string and sealed with captain costigans great silver seal  the major came away from his interview with captain costigan in a state of such concentrated fury as rendered him terrible to approach the impudent bogtrotting scamp he thought dare to threaten me dare to talk of permitting his damned costigans to marry with the pendennises send me a challenge if the fellow can get anything in the shape of a gentleman to carry it i have the greatest mind in life not to baulk himpsha what would people say if i were to go out with a tipsy mountebank about a row with an actress in a barn so when the major saw dr portman who asked anxiously regarding the issue of his battle with the dragon mr pendennis did not care to inform the divine of the generals insolent behaviour but stated that the affair was a very ugly and disagreeable one and that it was by no means over yet  he enjoined doctor and mrs portman to say nothing about the business at fairoaks whither he contented himself with despatching the note we have before mentioned and then he returned to his hotel where he vented his wrath upon mr morgan his valet dammin and cussin upstairs and downstairs as that gentleman observed to mr fokers man in whose company he partook of dinner in the servants room of the george  the servant carried the news to his master and mr foker having finished his breakfast about this time it being two oclock in the afternoon remembered that he was anxious to know the result of the interview between his two friends and having inquired the number of the majors sittingroom went over in his brocade dressinggown and knocked for admission  major pendennis had some business as he had stated respecting a lease of the widows about which he was desirous of consulting old mr tatham the lawyer who had been his brothers man of business and who had a branchoffice at clavering where he and his son attended market and other days three or four in the week this gentleman and his client were now in consultation when mr foker showed his grand dressinggown and embroidered skullcap at major pendenniss door  seeing the major engaged with papers and redtape and an old man with a white head the modest youth was for drawing backand said o youre busycall again another time but mr pendennis wanted to see him and begged him with a smile to enter whereupon mr foker took off the embroidered tarboosh or fez it had been worked by the fondest of mothers and advanced bowing to the gentlemen and smiling on them graciously mr tatham had never seen so splendid an apparition before as this brocaded youth who seated himself in an armchair spreading out his crimson skirts and looking with exceeding kindness and frankness on the other two tenants of the room you seem to like my dressinggown sir he said to mr tatham a pretty thing isnt it neat but not in the least gaudy and how do you do major pendennis sir and how does the world treat you  there was that in fokers manner and appearance which would have put an inquisitor into good humour and it smoothed the wrinkles under pendenniss head of hair  i have had an interview with that irishman you may speak before my friend mr tatham here who knows all the affairs of the family and it has not i own been very satisfactory he wont believe that my nephew is poor he says we are both liars he did me the honour to hint that i was a coward as i took leave and i thought when you knocked at the door that you might be the gentleman whom i expect with a challenge from mr costiganthat is how the world treats me mr foker  you dont mean that irishman the actresss father cried mr tatham who was a dissenter himself and did not patronise the drama  that irishman the actresss fatherthe very man have not you heard what a fool my nephew has made of himself about the girlmr tatham who never entered the walls of a theatre had heard nothing and major pendennis had to recount the story of his nephews loves to the lawyer mr foker coming in with appropriate comments in his usual familiar language  tatham was lost in wonder at the narrative why had not mrs pendennis married a serious man he thoughtmr tatham was a widowerand kept this unfortunate boy from perdition as for mr costigans daughter he would say nothing her profession was sufficient to characterise her mr foker here interposed to say he had known some uncommon good people in the booths as he called the temple of the muses well it might be so mr tatham hoped sobut the father tatham knew personallya man of the worst character a winebibber and an idler in taverns and billiardrooms and a notorious insolvent i can understand the reason major he said why the fellow would not come to my office to ascertain the truth of the statements which you made himwe have a writ out against him and another disreputable fellow one of the playactors for a bill given to mr skinner of this city a most respectable grocer and wine and spirit merchant and a member of the society of friends this costigan came crying to mr skinnercrying in the shop sirand we have not proceeded against him or the other as neither were worth powder and shot  it was whilst mr tatham was engaged in telling this story that a third knock came to the door and there entered an athletic gentleman in a shabby braided frock bearing in his hand a letter with a large blotched red seal  can i have the honour of speaking with major pendennis in private he begani have a few words for your ear sir i am the bearer of a mission from my friend captain costiganbut here the man with the bass voice paused faltered and turned palehe caught sight of the red and wellremembered face of mr tatham  hullo garbetts speak up cried mr foker delighted  why bless my soul it is the other party to the bill said mr tatham i say sir stop i say but garbetts with a face as blank as macbeths when banquos ghost appears upon him gasped some inarticulate words and fled out of the room  the majors gravity was also entirely upset and he burst out laughing so did mr foker who said by jove it was a good un so did the attorney although by profession a serious man  i dont think therell be any fight major young foker said and began mimicking the tragedian if there is the old gentlemanyour name tathamvery happy to make your acquaintance mr tathammay send the bailiffs to separate the men and mr tatham promised to do so the major was by no means sorry at the ludicrous issue of the quarrel it seems to me sir he said to mr foker that you always arrive to put me into goodhumour  nor was this the only occasion on which mr foker this day was destined to be of service to the pendennis family we have said that he had the entree of captain costigans lodgings and in the course of the afternoon he thought he would pay the general a visit and hear from his own lips what had occurred in the conversation in the morning with mr pendennis captain costigan was not at home he had received permission nay encouragement from his daughter to go to the convivial club at the magpie hotel where no doubt he was bragging at that moment of his desire to murder a certain ruffian for he was not only brave but he knew it too and liked to take out his courage and as it were give it an airing in company  costigan then was absent but miss fotheringay was at home washing the teacups whilst mr bows sate opposite to her  just done breakfast i seehow do said mr foker popping in his little funny head  get out you funny little man cried miss fotheringay  you mean come in answered the otherhere we are and entering the room he folded his arms and began twirling his head round and round with immense rapidity like harlequin in the pantomime when he first issues from his cocoon or envelope miss fotheringay laughed with all her heart a wink of fokers would set her off laughing when the bitterest joke bows ever made could not get a smile from her or the finest of poor pens speeches would only puzzle her at the end of the harlequinade he sank down on one knee and kissed her hand youre the drollest little man she said and gave him a great goodhumoured slap pen used to tremble as he kissed her hand pen would have died of a slap  these preliminaries over the three began to talk mr foker amused his companions by recounting to them the scene which he had just witnessed of the discomfiture of mr garbetts by which they learned for the first time how far the general had carried his wrath against major pendennis foker spoke strongly in favour of the majors character for veracity and honour and described him as a tiptop swell moving in the uppercircle of society who would never submit to any deceitmuch more to deceive such a charming young woman as miss foth  he touched delicately upon the delicate marriage question though he couldnt help showing that he held pen rather cheap in fact he had a perhaps just contempt for mr pens highflown sentimentality his own weakness as he thought not lying that way i knew it wouldnt do miss foth said he nodding his little head couldnt do didnt like to put my hand into the bag but knew it couldnt do hes too young for you too green a deal too green and he turns out to be poor as job cant have him at no price can she mr bo  indeed hes a nice poor boy said the fotheringay rather sadly  poor little beggar said bows with his hands in his pockets and stealing up a queer look at miss fotheringay perhaps he thought and wondered at the way in which women play with men and coax them and win them and drop them  but mr bows had not the least objection to acknowledge that he thought miss fotheringay was perfectly right in giving up mr arthur pendennis and that in his idea the match was always an absurd one and miss costigan owned that she thought so herself only she couldnt send away two thousand a year it all comes of believing papas silly stories she said faith ill choose for meself another timeand very likely the large image of lieutenant sir derby oaks entered into her mind at that instant  after praising major pendennis whom miss costigan declared to be a proper gentleman entirely smelling of lavender and as neat as a pinand who was pronounced by mr bows to be the right sort of fellow though rather too much of an old buck mr foker suddenly bethought him to ask the pair to come and meet the major that very evening at dinner at his apartment at the george he agreed to dine with me and i think after theafter the little shindy this morning in which i must say the general was wrong it would look kind you knowi know the major fell in love with you miss foth he said so  so she may be mrs pendennis still bows said with a sneerno thank you mr five dined  sure that was at three oclock said miss costigan who had an honest appetite and i cant go without you  well have lobstersalad and champagne said the little monster who could not construe a line of latin or do a sum beyond the rule of three now for lobstersalad and champagne in an honourable manner miss costigan would have gone anywhereand major pendennis actually found himself at seven oclock seated at a dinnertable in company with mr bows a professional fiddler and miss costigan whose father had wanted to blow his brains out a few hours before  to make the happy meeting complete mr foker who knew costigans haunts despatched stoopid to the club at the magpie where the general was in the act of singing a pathetic song and brought him off to supper to find his daughter and bows seated at the board was a surprise indeedmajor pendennis laughed and cordially held out his hand which the general officer grasped avec effusion as the french say in fact he was considerably inebriated and had already been crying over his own song before he joined the little party at the george he burst into tears more than once during the entertainment and called the major his dearest friend stoopid and mr foker walked home with him the major gallantly giving his arm to miss costigan he was received with great friendliness when he called the next day when many civilities passed between the gentlemen on taking leave he expressed his anxious desire to serve miss costigan on any occasion in which he could be useful to her and he shook hands with mr foker most cordially and gratefully and said that gentleman had done him the very greatest service  all right said mr foker and they parted with mutual esteem  on his return to fairoaks the next day major pendennis did not say what had happened to him on the previous night or allude to the company in which he had passed it but he engaged mr smirke to stop to dinner and any person accustomed to watch his manner might have remarked that there was something constrained in his hilarity and talkativeness and that he was unusually gracious and watchful in his communications with his nephew he gave pen an emphatic godblessyou when the lad went to bed and as they were about to part for the night he seemed as if he was going to say something to mrs pendennis but he bethought him that if he spoke he might spoil her nights rest and allowed her to sleep in peace  the next morning he was down in the breakfastroom earlier than was his custom and saluted everybody there with great cordiality the post used to arrive commonly about the end of this meal when john the old servant entered and discharged the bag of its letters and papers the major looked hard at pen as the lad got hisarthur blushed and put his letter down he knew the hand it was that of old costigan and he did not care to read it in public major pendennis knew the letter too he had put it into the post himself in chatteris the day before  he told little laura to go away which the child did having a thorough dislike to him and as the door closed on her he took mrs pendenniss hand and giving her a look full of meaning pointed to the letter under the newspaper which pen was pretending to read will you come into the drawingroom he said i want to speak to you and she followed him wondering into the hall  what is it she said nervously  the affair is at an end major pendennis said he has a letter there giving him his dismissal i dictated it myself yesterday there are a few lines from the lady too bidding him farewell it is all over  helen ran back to the diningroom her brother following pen had jumped at his letter the instant they were gone he was reading it with a stupefied face it stated what the major had said that mr costigan was most gratified for the kindness with which arthur had treated his daughter but that he was only now made aware of mr pendenniss peecupiary circumstances they were such that marriage was at present out of the question and considering the great disparity in the age of the two a future union was impossible under these circumstances and with the deepest regret and esteem for him mr costigan bade arthur farewell and suggested that he should cease visiting for some time at least at his house  a few lines from miss costigan were enclosed she acquiesced in the decision of her papa she pointed out that she was many years older than arthur and that an engagement was not to be thought of she would always be grateful for his kindness to her and hoped to keep his friendship but at present and until the pain of the separation should be over she entreated they should not meet  pen read costigans letter and its enclosure mechanically hardly knowing what was before his eyes he looked up wildly and saw his mother and uncle regarding him with sad faces helens indeed was full of tender maternal anxiety  whatwhat is this pen said its some joke this is not her writing this is some servants writing whos playing these tricks upon me  it comes under her fathers envelope the major said those letters you had before were not in her hand that is hers  how do you know said pen very fiercely  i saw her write it the uncle answered as the boy started up and his mother coming forward took his hand he put her away  how came you to see her how came you between me and her what have i ever done to you that you shouldoh its not true its not truepen broke out with a wild execration she cant have done it of her own accord she cant mean it shes pledged to me who has told her lies to break her from me  lies are not told in the family arthur major pendennis replied i told her the truth which was that you had no money to maintain her for her foolish father had represented you to be rich and when she knew how poor you were she withdrew at once and without any persuasion of mine she was quite right she is ten years older than you are she is perfectly unfitted to be your wife and knows it look at that handwriting and ask yourself is such a woman fitted to be the companion of your mother  i will know from herself if it is true arthur said crumpling up the paper  wont you take my word of honour her letters were written by a confidant of hers who writes better than she canlook here heres one from the lady to your friend mr foker you have seen her with miss costigan as whose amanuensis she actedthe major said with ever so little of a sneer and laid down a certain billet which mr foker had given to him  its not that said pen burning with shame and rage i suppose what you say is true sir but ill hear it from herself  arthur appealed his mother  i will see her said arthur ill ask her to marry me once more i will no one shall prevent me  what a woman who spells affection with one f nonsense sir be a man and remember that your mother is a lady she was never made to associate with that tipsy old swindler or his daughter be a man and forget her as she does you  be a man and comfort your mother my arthur helen said going and embracing him and seeing that the pair were greatly moved major pendennis went out of the room and shut the door upon them wisely judging that they were best alone  he had won a complete victory he actually had brought away pens letters in his portmanteau from chatteris having complimented mr costigan when he returned them by giving him the little promissory note which had disquieted himself and mr garbetts and for which the major settled with mr tatham  pen rushed wildly off to chatteris that day but in vain attempted to see miss fotheringay for whom he left a letter enclosed to her father the enclosure was returned by mr costigan who begged that all correspondence might end and after one or two further attempts of the lads the indignant general desired that their acquaintance might cease he cut pen in the street as arthur and foker were pacing the castle walk one day they came upon emily on her fathers arm she passed without any nod of recognition foker felt poor pen trembling on his arm  his uncle wanted him to travel to quit the country for a while and his mother urged him too for he was growing very ill and suffered severely but he refused and said pointblank he would not go he would not obey in this instance and his mother was too fond and his uncle too wise to force him whenever miss fotheringay acted he rode over to the chatteris theatre and saw her one night there were so few people in the house that the manager returned the money pen came home and went to bed at eight oclock and had a fever if this continues his mother will be going over and fetching the girl the major thought in despair as for pen he thought he should die we are not going to describe his feelings or give a dreary journal of his despair and passion have not other gentlemen been baulked in love besides mr pen yes indeed but few die of the malady     chapter xiv in which miss fotheringay makes a new engagement   within a short period of the events above narrated mr manager bingley was performing his famous character of rolla in pizarro to a house so exceedingly thin that it would appear as if the part of rolla was by no means such a favourite with the people of chatteris as it was with the accomplished actor himself scarce anybody was in the theatre poor pen had the boxes almost all to himself and sate there lonely with bloodshot eyes leaning over the ledge and gazing haggardly towards the scene when cora came in when she was not on the stage he saw nothing spaniards and peruvians processions and battles priests and virgins of the sun went in and out and had their talk but arthur took no note of any of them and only saw cora whom his soul longed after he said afterwards that he wondered he had not taken a pistol to shoot her so mad was he with love and rage and despair and had it not been for his mother at home to whom he did not speak about his luckless condition but whose silent sympathy and watchfulness greatly comforted the simple half heartbroken fellow who knows but he might have done something desperate and have ended his days prematurely in front of chatteris gaol there he sate then miserable and gazing at her and she took no more notice of him than he did of the rest of the house  the fotheringay was uncommonly handsome in a white raiment and leopard skin with a sun upon her breast and fine tawdry bracelets on her beautiful glancing arms she spouted to admiration the few words of her part and looked it still better the eyes which had overthrown pens soul rolled and gleamed as lustrous as ever but it was not to him that they were directed that night he did not know to whom or remark a couple of gentlemen in the box next to him upon whom miss fotheringays glances were perpetually shining  nor had pen noticed the extraordinary change which had taken place on the stage a short time after the entry of these two gentlemen into the theatre there were so few people in the house that the first act of the play languished entirely and there had been some question of returning the money as upon that other unfortunate night when poor pen had been driven away the actors were perfectly careless about their parts and yawned through the dialogue and talked loud to each other in the intervals even bingley was listless and mrs b in elvira spoke under her breath  how came it that all of a sudden mrs bingley began to raise her voice and bellow like a bull of bashan whence was it that bingley flinging off his apathy darted about the stage and yelled like dean why did garbetts and rowkins and miss rouncy try each of them the force of their charms or graces and act and swagger and scowl and spout their very loudest at the two gentlemen in box no 3  one was a quiet little man in black with a grey head and a jolly shrewd facethe other was in all respects a splendid and remarkable individual he was a tall and portly gentleman with a hooked nose and a profusion of curling brown hair and whiskers his coat was covered with the richest frogsbraiding and velvet he had underwaistcoats many splendid rings jewelled pins and neckchains when he took out his yellow pockethandkerchief with his hand that was cased in white kids a delightful odour of musk and bergamot was shaken through the house he was evidently a personage of rank and it was at him that the little chatteris company was acting  he was in a word no other than mr dolphin the great manager from london accompanied by his faithful friend and secretary mr william minns without whom he never travelled he had not been ten minutes in the theatre before his august presence there was perceived by bingley and the rest and they all began to act their best and try to engage his attention even miss fotheringays dull heart which was disturbed at nothing felt perhaps a flutter when she came in presence of the famous london impresario she had not much to do in her part but to look handsome and stand in picturesque attitudes encircling her child and she did this work to admiration in vain the various actors tried to win the favour of the great stage sultan pizarro never got a hand from him bingley yelled and mrs bingley bellowed and the manager only took snuff out of his great gold box it was only in the last scene when rolla comes in staggering with the infant bingley is not so strong as he was and his fourth son master talma bingley is a monstrous large child for his agewhen rolla comes staggering with the child to cora who rushes forward with a shriek and sayso god theres blood upon himthat the london manager clapped his hands and broke out with an enthusiastic bravo  then having concluded his applause mr dolphin gave his secretary a slap on the shoulder and said by jove billy shell do  who taught her that dodge said old billy who was a sardonic old gentleman i remember her at the olympic and hang me if she could say bo to a goose  it was little mr bows in the orchestra who had taught her the dodge in question all the company heard the applause and as the curtain went down came round her and congratulated and hated miss fotheringay  now mr dolphins appearance in the remote little chatteris theatre may be accounted for in this manner in spite of all his exertions and the perpetual blazes of triumph coruscations of talent victories of good old english comedy which his playbills advertised his theatre which if you please and to injure no present susceptibilities and vested interests we shall call the museum theatre by no means prospered and the famous impresario found himself on the verge of ruin the great hubbard had acted legitimate drama for twenty nights and failed to remunerate anybody but himself the celebrated mr and mrs cawdor had come out in mr rawheads tragedy and in their favourite round of pieces and had not attracted the public herr garbages lions and tigers had drawn for a little time until one of the animals had bitten a piece out of the herrs shoulder when the lord chamberlain interfered and put a stop to this species of performance and the grand lyrical drama though brought out with unexampled splendour and success with monsieur poumons as first tenor and an enormous orchestra had almost crushed poor dolphin in its triumphant progress so that great as his genius and resources were they seemed to be at an end he was dragging on his season wretchedly with half salaries small operas feeble old comedies and his ballet company and everybody was looking out for the day when he should appear in the gazette  one of the illustrious patrons of the museum theatre and occupant of the great prosceniumbox was a gentleman whose name has been mentioned in a previous history that refined patron of the arts and enlightened lover of music and the drama the most noble the marquis of steyne his lordships avocations as a statesman prevented him from attending the playhouse very often or coming very early but he occasionally appeared at the theatre in time for the ballet and was always received with the greatest respect by the manager from whom he sometimes condescended to receive a visit in his box it communicated with the stage and when anything occurred there which particularly pleased him when a new face made its appearance among the coryphees or a fair dancer executed a pas with especial grace or agility mr wenham mr wagg or some other aidedecamp of the noble marquis would be commissioned to go behind the scenes and express the great mans approbation or make the inquiries which were prompted by his lordships curiosity or his interest in the dramatic art he could not be seen by the audience for lord steyne sate modestly behind a curtain and looked only towards the stagebut you could know he was in the house by the glances which all the corpsdeballet and all the principal dancers cast towards his box i have seen many scores of pairs of eyes as in the palm dance in the ballet of cook at otaheite where no less than a hundredandtwenty lovely female savages in palm leaves and feather aprons were made to dance round floridor as captain cook ogling that box as they performed before it and have often wondered to remark the presence of mind of mademoiselle sauterelle or mademoiselle de bondi known as la petite caoutchoue who when actually up in the air quivering like so many shuttlecocks always kept their lovely eyes winking at that box in which the great steyne sate now and then you would hear a harsh voice from behind the curtain cry brava brava or a pair of white gloves wave from it and begin to applaud bondi or sauterelle when they came down to earth curtsied and smiled especially to those hands before they walked up the stage again panting and happy  one night this great prince surrounded by a few choice friends was in his box at the museum and they were making such a noise and laughter that the pit was scandalised and many indignant voices were bawling out silence so loudly that wagg wondered the police did not interfere to take the rascals out wenham was amusing the party in the box with extracts from a private letter which he had received from major pendennis whose absence in the country at the full london season had been remarked and of course deplored by his friends  the secret is out said mr wenham theres a woman in the case  why d it wenham hes your age said the gentleman behind the curtain  pour les ames bien nees lamour ne compte pas le nombre des annees said mr wenham with a gallant air for my part i hope to be a victim till i die and to break my heart every year of my life the meaning of which sentence was my lord you need not talk im three years younger than you and twice as well conserve  wenham you affect me said the great man with one of his usual oaths by  you do i like to see a fellow preserving all the illusions of youth up to our time of lifeand keeping his heart warm as yours is hang it sir its a comfort to meet with such a generous candid creaturewhos that gal in the second row with blue ribbons third from the stagefine gal yes you and i are sentimentalists wagg i dont think so much caresits the stomach rather more than the heart with you eh wagg my boy  i like everything thats good said mr wagg generously beauty and burgundy venus and venison i dont say that venuss turtles are to be despised because they dont cook them at the london tavern butbut tell us about old pendennis mr wenham he abruptly concludedfor his joke flagged just then as he saw that his patron was not listening in fact steynes glasses were up and he was examining some object on the stage  yes ive heard that joke about venuss turtle and the london tavern beforeyou begin to fail my poor wagg if you dont mind i shall be obliged to have a new jester lord steyne said laying down his glass go on wenham about old pendennis  dear wenhamhe begins mr wenham readas you have had my character in your hands for the last three weeks and no doubt have torn me to shreds according to your custom i think you can afford to be goodhumoured by way of variety and to do me a service it is a delicate matter entre nous une affaire de coeur there is a young friend of mine who is gone wild about a certain miss fotheringay an actress at the theatre here and i must own to you as handsome a woman and as it appears to me as good an actress as ever put on rouge she does ophelia lady teazle mrs hallerthat sort of thing upon my word she is as splendid as georges in her best days and as far as i know utterly superior to anything we have on our scene i want a london engagement for her cant you get your friend dolphin to come and see herto engage herto take her out of this place a word from a noble friend of ours you understand would be invaluable and if you could get the gaunt house interest for mei will promise anything i can in return for your servicewhich i shall consider one of the greatest that can be done to me do do this now as a good fellow which i always said you were and in return command yours truly a pendennis  its a clear case said mr wenham having read this letter old pendennis is in love  and wants to get the woman up to londonevidently continued mr wagg  i should like to see pendennis on his knees with the rheumatism said mr wenham  or accommodating the beloved object with a lock of his hair said wagg  stuff said the great man he has relations in the country hasnt he he said something about a nephew whose interest could return a member it is the nephews affair depend on it the young one is in a scrape i was myselfwhen i was in the fifth form at etona marketgardeners daughterand swore id marry her i was mad about herpoor pollyhere he made a pause and perhaps the past rose up to lord steyne and george gaunt was a boy again not altogether lostbut i say she must be a fine woman from pendenniss account have in dolphin and let us hear if he knows anything of her  at this wenham sprang out of the box passed the servitor who waited at the door communicating with the stage and who saluted mr wenham with profound respect and the latter emissary pushing on and familiar with the place had no difficulty in finding out the manager who was employed as he not unfrequently was in swearing and cursing the ladies of the corpsdeballet for not doing their duty  the oaths died away on mr dolphins lips as soon as he saw mr wenham and he drew off the hand which was clenched in the face of one of the offending coryphees to grasp that of the newcomer how do mr wenham hows his lordship tonight looks uncommonly well said the manager smiling as if he had never been out of temper in his life and he was only too delighted to follow lord steynes ambassador and pay his personal respects to that great man  the visit to chatteris was the result of their conversation and mr dolphin wrote to his lordship from that place and did himself the honour to inform the marquess of steyne that he had seen the lady about whom his lordship had spoken that he was as much struck by her talents as he was by her personal appearance and that he had made an engagement with miss fotheringay who would soon have the honour of appearing before a london audience and his noble and enlightened patron the marquess of steyne  pen read the announcement of miss fotheringays engagement in the chatteris paper where he had so often praised her charms the editor made very handsome mention of her talent and beauty and prophesied her success in the metropolis bingley the manager began to advertise the last night of miss fotheringays engagement poor pen and sir derby oaks were very constant at the play sir derby in the stagebox throwing bouquets and getting glancespen in the almost deserted boxes haggard wretched and lonely nobody cared whether miss fotheringay was going or staying except those twoand perhaps one more which was mr bows of the orchestra  he came out of his place one night and went into the house to the box where pen was and he held out his hand to him and asked him to come and walk they walked down the street together and went and sate upon chatteris bridge in the moonlight and talked about her we may sit on the same bridge said he we have been in the same boat for a long time you are not the only man who has made a fool of himself about that woman and i have less excuse than you because i am older and know her better she has no more heart than the stone you are leaning on and it or you or i might fall into the water and never come up again and she wouldnt care yesshe would care for me because she wants me to teach her and she wont be able to get on without me and will be forced to send for me from london but she wouldnt if she didnt want me she has no heart and no head and no sense and no feelings and no griefs or cares whatever i was going to say no pleasuresbut the fact is she does like her dinner and she is pleased when people admire her  and you do said pen interested out of himself and wondering at the crabbed homely little old man  its a habit like taking snuff or drinking drams said the other ive been taking her these five years and cant do without her it was i made her if she doesnt send for me i shall follow her but i know shell send for me she wants me some day shell marry and fling me over as i do the end of this cigar  the little flaming spark dropped into the water below and disappeared and pen as he rode home that night actually thought about somebody but himself     chapter xv the happy village   until the enemy had retired altogether from before the place major pendennis was resolved to keep his garrison in fairoaks he did not appear to watch pens behaviour or to put any restraint on his nephews actions but he managed nevertheless to keep the lad constantly under his eye or those of his agents and young arthurs comings and goings were quite well known to his vigilant guardian  i suppose there is scarcely any man who reads this or any other novel but has been baulked in love some time or the other by fate and circumstance by falsehood of women or his own fault let that worthy friend recall his own sensations under the circumstances and apply them as illustrative of mr pens anguish ah what weary nights and sickening fevers ah what mad desires dashing up against some rock of obstruction or indifference and flung back again from the unimpressionable granite if a list could be made this very night in london of the groans thoughts imprecations of tossing lovers what a catalogue it would be i wonder what a percentage of the male population of the metropolis will be lying awake at two or three oclock tomorrow morning counting the hours as they go by knelling drearily and rolling from left to right restless yearning and heartsick what a pang it is i never knew a man die of love certainly but i have known a twelvestone man go down to ninestone five under a disappointed passion so that pretty nearly quarter of him may be said to have perished and that is no small portion he has come back to his old size subsequently perhaps is bigger than ever very likely some new affection has closed round his heart and ribs and made them comfortable and young pen is a man who will console himself like the rest of us we say this lest the ladies should be disposed to deplore him prematurely or be seriously uneasy with regard to his complaint his mother was but what will not a maternal fondness fear or invent depend on it my dear creature major pendennis would say gallantly to her the boy will recover as soon as we get her out of the country we will take him somewhere and show him a little life meantime make yourself easy about him half a fellows pangs at losing a woman result from vanity more than affection to be left by a woman is the deuce and all to be sure but look how easily we leave em  mrs pendennis did not know this sort of knowledge had by no means come within the simple ladys scope indeed she did not like the subject or to talk of it her heart had had its own little private misadventure and she had borne up against it and cured it and perhaps she had not much patience with other folks passions except of course arthurs whose sufferings she made her own feeling indeed very likely in many of the boys illnesses and pains a great deal more than pen himself endured and she watched him through this present grief with a jealous silent sympathy although as we have said he did not talk to her of his unfortunate condition  the major must be allowed to have had not a little merit and forbearance and to have exhibited a highly creditable degree of family affection the life at fairoaks was uncommonly dull to a man who had the entree of half the houses in london and was in the habit of making his bow in three or four drawingrooms of a night a dinner with doctor portman or a neighbouring squire now and then a dreary rubber at backgammon with the widow who did her utmost to amuse him these were the chief of his pleasures he used to long for the arrival of the bag with the letters and he read every word of the evening paper he doctored himself too assiduouslya course of quiet living would suit him well he thought after the london banquets he dressed himself laboriously every morning and afternoon he took regular exercise up and down the terrace walk thus with his cane his toilet his medicinechest his backgammonbox and his newspaper this worthy and worldly philosopher fenced himself against ennui and if he did not improve each shining hour like the bees by the widows garden wall major pendennis made one hour after another pass as he could and rendered his captivity just tolerable after this period it was remarked that he was fond of bringing round the conversation to the american war the massacre of wyoming and the brilliant actions of saint lucie the fact being that he had a couple of volumes of the annual register in his bedroom which he sedulously studied it is thus a wellregulated man will accommodate himself to circumstances and show himself calmly superior to fortune  pen sometimes took the box at backgammon of a night or would listen to his mothers simple music of summer eveningsbut he was very restless and wretched in spite of all and has been known to be up before the early daylight even and down at a carppond in clavering park a dreary pool with innumerable whispering rushes and green alders where a milkmaid drowned herself in the baronets grandfathers time and her ghost was said to walk still but pen did not drown himself as perhaps his mother fancied might be his intention he liked to go and fish there and think and think at leisure as the float quivered in the little eddies of the pond and the fish flapped about him if he got a bite he was excited enough and in this way occasionally brought home carps tenches and eels which the major cooked in the continental fashion  by this pond and under a tree which was his favourite resort pen composed a number of poems suitable to his circumstances over which verses he blushed in after days wondering how he could ever have invented such rubbish and as for the tree why it is in a hollow of this very tree where he used to put his tinbox of groundbait and other fishing commodities that he afterwardsbut we are advancing matters suffice it to say he wrote poems and relieved himself very much when a mans grief or passion is at this point it may be loud but it is not very severe when a gentleman is cudgelling his brain to find any rhyme for sorrow besides borrow and tomorrow his woes are nearer at an end than he thinks for so were pens he had his hot and cold fits his days of sullenness and peevishness and of blank resignation and despondency and occasional mad paroxysms of rage and longing in which fits rebecca would be saddled and galloped fiercely about the country or into chatteris her rider gesticulating wildly on her back and astonishing carters and turnpikemen as he passed crying out the name of the false one  mr foker became a very frequent and welcome visitor at fairoaks during this period where his good spirits and oddities always amused the major and pendennis while they astonished the widow and little laura not a little his tandem made a great sensation in clavering marketplace where he upset a market stall and cut mrs pybuss poodle over the shaven quarters and drank a glass of raspberry bitters at the clavering arms all the society in the little place heard who he was and looked out his name in their peerages he was so young and their books so old that his name did not appear in many of their volumes and his mamma now quite an antiquated lady figured amongst the progeny of the earl of rosherville as lady agnes milton still but his name wealth and honourable lineage were speedily known about clavering where you may be sure that poor pens little transaction with the chatteris actress was also pretty freely discussed  looking at the little old town of clavering st mary from the london road as it runs by the lodge at fairoaks and seeing the rapid and shining brawl winding down from the town and skirting the woods of clavering park and the ancient church tower and peaked roofs of the houses rising up amongst trees and old walls behind which swells a fair background of sunshiny hills that stretch from clavering westwards towards the seathe place looks so cheery and comfortable that many a travellers heart must have yearned towards it from the coachtop and he must have thought that it was in such a calm friendly nook he would like to shelter at the end of lifes struggle tom smith who used to drive the alacrity coach would often point to a tree near the river from which a fine view of the church and town was commanded and inform his companion on the box that artises come and take hoff the church from that there treeit was a habby once sirand indeed a pretty view it is which i recommend to mr stanfield or mr roberts for their next tour  like constantinople seen from the bosphorus like mrs rougemont viewed in her box from the opposite side of the house like many an object which we pursue in life and admire before we have attained it clavering is rather prettier at a distance than it is on a closer acquaintance the town so cheerful of aspect a few furlongs off looks very blank and dreary except on market days there is nobody in the streets the clack of a pair of pattens echoes through half the place and you may hear the creaking of the rusty old ensign at the clavering arms without being disturbed by any other noise there has not been a ball in the assembly rooms since the clavering volunteers gave one to their colonel the old sir francis clavering and the stables which once held a great part of that brilliant but defunct regiment are now cheerless and empty except on thursdays when the farmers put up there and their tilted carts and gigs make a feeble show of liveliness in the place or on petty sessions when the magistrates attend in what used to be the old cardroom  on the south side of the market rises up the church with its great grey towers of which the sun illuminates the delicate carving deepening the shadows of the huge buttresses and gilding the glittering windows and flaming vanes the image of the patroness of the church was wrenched out of the porch centuries ago such of the statues of saints as were within reach of stones and hammer at that period of pious demolition are maimed and headless and of those who were out of fire only doctor portman knows the names and history for his curate smirke is not much of an antiquarian and mr simcoe husband of the honourable mrs simcoe incumbent and architect of the chapel of ease in the lower town thinks them the abomination of desolation  the rectory is a stout broadshouldered brick house of the reign of anne it communicates with the church and market by different gates and stands at the opening of yewtree lane where the grammar school rev  wapshot is yewtree cottage miss flather the butchers slaughteringhouse an old barn or brewhouse of the abbey times and the misses finucanes establishment for young ladies the two schools had their pews in the loft on each side of the organ until the abbey church getting rather empty through the fallingoff of the congregation who were inveigled to the heresyshop in the lower town the doctor induced the misses finucane to bring their pretty little flock downstairs and the young ladies bonnets make a tolerable show in the rather vacant aisles nobody is in the great pew of the clavering family except the statues of defunct baronets and their ladies there is sir poyntz clavering knight and baronet kneeling in a square beard opposite his wife in a ruff a very fat lady the dame rebecca clavering in altorelievo is borne up to heaven by two little blueveined angels who seem to have a severe taskand so forth how well in after life pen remembered those effigies and how often in youth he scanned them as the doctor was grumbling the sermon from the pulpit and smirkes mild head and forehead curl peered over the great prayerbook in the desk  the fairoaks folks were constant at the old church their servants had a pew so had the doctors so had wapshots and those of misses finucanes establishment three maids and a very nicelooking young man in a livery the wapshot family were numerous and faithful glanders and his children regularly came to church so did one of the apothecaries mrs pybus went turn and turn about to the low town church and to the abbey the charity school and their families of course came wapshots boys made a good cheerful noise scuffling with their feet as they marched into church and up the organloft stair and blowing their noses a good deal during the service to be brief the congregation looked as decent as might be in these bad times the abbey church was furnished with a magnificent screen and many hatchments and heraldic tombstones the doctor spent a great part of his income in beautifying his darling place he had endowed it with a superb painted window bought in the netherlands and an organ grand enough for a cathedral  but in spite of organ and window in consequence of the latter very likely which had come out of a papistical place of worship and was blazoned all over with idolatry clavering new church prospered scandalously in the teeth of orthodoxy and many of the doctors congregation deserted to mr simcoe and the honourable woman his wife their efforts had thinned the very ebenezer hard by them which building before simcoes advent used to be so full that you could see the backs of the congregation squeezing out of the arched windows thereof mr simcoes tracts fluttered into the doors of all the doctors cottages and were taken as greedily as honest mrs portmans soup with the quality of which the graceless people found fault with the folks at the ribbon factory situated by the weir on the brawl side and round which the low town had grown orthodoxy could make no way at all quiet miss myra was put out of court by impetuous mrs simcoe and her female aidesdecamp ah it was a hard burthen for the doctors lady to bear to behold her husbands congregation dwindling away to give the precedence on the few occasions when they met to a notorious lowchurchmans wife who was the daughter of an irish peer to know that there was a party in clavering their own town of clavering on which her doctor spent a great deal more than his professional income who held him up to odium because he played a rubber at whist and pronounced him to be a heathen because he went to the play in her grief she besought him to give up the play and the rubberindeed they could scarcely get a table now so dreadful was the outcry against the sportbut the doctor declared that he would do what he thought right and what the great and good george the third did whose chaplain he had been and as for giving up whist because those silly folks cried out against it he would play dummy to the end of his days with his wife and myra rather than yield to their despicable persecutions  of the two families owners of the factory which had spoiled the brawl as a troutstream and brought all the mischief into the town the senior partner mr rolt went to ebenezer the junior mr barker to the new church in a word people quarrelled in this little place a great deal more than neighbours do in london and in the book club which the prudent and conciliating pendennis had set up and which ought to have been a neutral territory they bickered so much that nobody scarcely was ever seen in the readingroom except smirke who though he kept up a faint amity with the simcoe faction had still a taste for magazines and light worldly literature and old glanders whose white head and grizzly moustache might be seen at the window and of course little mrs pybus who looked at everybodys letters as the post brought them for the clavering readingroom as every one knows used to be held at bakers library london street formerly hog lane and read every advertisement in the paper  it may be imagined how great a sensation was created in this amiable little community when the news reached it of mr pens lovepassages at chatteris it was carried from house to house and formed the subject of talk at highchurch lowchurch and nochurch tables it was canvassed by the misses finucane and their teachers and very likely debated by the young ladies in the dormitories for what we know wapshots big boys had their version of the story and eyed pen curiously as he sate in his pew at church or raised the finger of scorn at him as he passed through chatteris they always hated him and called him lord pendennis because he did not wear corduroys as they did and rode a horse and gave himself the airs of a buck  and if the truth must be told it was mrs portman herself who was the chief narrator of the story of pens loves whatever tales this candid woman heard she was sure to impart them to her neighbours and after she had been put into possession of pens secret by the little scandal at chatteris poor doctor portman knew that it would next day be about the parish of which he was the rector and so indeed it was the whole society there had the legendat the newsroom at the milliners at the shoeshop and the general warehouse at the corner of the market at mrs pybuss at the glanderss at the honourable mrs simcoes soiree at the factory nay through the mill itself the tale was current in a few hours and young arthur pendenniss madness was in every mouth  all dr portmans acquaintances barked out upon him when he walked the street the next day the poor divine knew that his betsy was the author of the rumour and groaned in spirit well wellit must have come in a day or two and it was as well that the town should have the real story what the clavering folks thought of mrs pendennis for spoiling her son and of that precocious young rascal of an arthur for daring to propose to a playactress need not be told here if pride exists amongst any folks in our country and assuredly we have enough of it there is no pride more deepseated than that of twopenny old gentlewomen in small towns gracious goodness the cry was how infatuated the mother is about that pert and headstrong boy who gives himself the airs of a lord on his bloodhorse and for whom our society is not good enough and who would marry an odious painted actress off a booth where very likely he wants to rant himself if dear good mr pendennis had been alive this scandal would never have happened  no more it would very likely nor should we have been occupied in narrating pens history it was true that he gave himself airs to the clavering folks naturally haughty and frank their cackle and small talk and small dignities bored him and he showed a contempt which he could not conceal the doctor and the curate were the only people pen cared for in the placeeven mrs portman shared in the general distrust of him and of his mother the widow who kept herself aloof from the village society and was sneered at accordingly because she tried forsooth to keep her head up with the great county families she indeed mrs barker at the factory has four times the butchers meat that goes up to fairoaks with all their fine airs  etc etc etc let the reader fill up these details according to his liking and experience of village scandal they will suffice to show how it was that a good woman occupied solely in doing her duty to her neighbour and her children and an honest brave lad impetuous and full of good and wishing well to every mortal alive found enemies and detractors amongst people to whom they were superior and to whom they had never done anything like harm the clavering curs were yelping all round the house of fairoaks and delighted to pull pen down  doctor portman and smirke were both cautious of informing the widow of the constant outbreak of calumny which was pursuing poor pen though glanders who was a friend of the house kept him au courant it may be imagined what his indignation was was there any man in the village whom he could call to account presently some wags began to chalk up fotheringay for ever and other sarcastic allusions to late transactions at fairoaks gate another brought a large playbill from chatteris and wafered it there one night on one occasion pen riding through the lower town fancied he heard the factory boys jeer him and finally going through the doctors gate into the churchyard where some of wapshots boys were lounging the biggest of them a young gentleman about twenty years of age son of a neighbouring small squire who lived in the doubtful capacity of parlourboarder with mr wapshot flung himself into a theatrical attitude near a newlymade grave and began repeating hamlets verses over ophelia with a hideous leer at pen the young fellow was so enraged that he rushed at hobnell major with a shriek very much resembling an oath cut him furiously across the face with the ridingwhip which he carried flung it away calling upon the cowardly villain to defend himself and in another minute knocked the bewildered young ruffian into the grave which was just waiting for a different lodger  then with his fists clenched and his face quivering with passion and indignation he roared out to mr hobnells gaping companions to know if any of the blackguards would come on but they held back with a growl and retreated as doctor portman came up to his wicket and mr hobnell with his nose and lip bleeding piteously emerged from the grave  pen looking death and defiance at the lads who retreated towards their side of the churchyard walked back again through the doctors wicket and was interrogated by that gentleman the young fellow was so agitated he could scarcely speak his voice broke into a sob as he answered the  coward insulted me sir he said and the doctor passed over the oath and respected the emotion of the honest suffering young heart  pendennis the elder who like a real man of the world had a proper and constant dread of the opinion of his neighbour was prodigiously annoyed by the absurd little tempest which was blowing in chatteris and tossing about master pens reputation doctor portman and captain glanders had to support the charges of the whole chatteris society against the young reprobate who was looked upon as a monster of crime pen did not say anything about the churchyard scuffle at home but went over to baymouth and took counsel with his friend harry foker esq who drove over his drag presently to the clavering arms whence he sent stoopid with a note to thomas hobnell esq at the rev j wapshots and a civil message to ask when he should wait upon that gentleman  stoopid brought back word that the note had been opened by mr hobnell and read to half a dozen of the big boys on whom it seemed to make a great impression and that after consulting together and laughing mr hobnell said he would send an answer arter arternoon school which the bell was aringing and mr wapshot he came out in his masters gownd stoopid was learned in academical costume having attended mr foker at st boniface  mr foker went out to see the curiosities of clavering meanwhile but not having a taste for architecture doctor portmans fine church did not engage his attention much and he pronounced the tower to be as mouldy as an old stilton cheese he walked down the street and looked at the few shops there he saw captain glanders at the window of the readingroom and having taken a good stare at that gentleman he wagged his head at him in token of satisfaction he inquired the price of meat at the butchers with an air of the greatest interest and asked when was next killing day he flattened his little nose against madame fribsbys window to see if haply there was a pretty workwoman in her premises but there was no face more comely than the dolls or dummys wearing the french cap in the window only that of madame fribsby herself dimly visible in the parlour reading a novel that object was not of sufficient interest to keep mr foker very long in contemplation and so having exhausted the town and the inn stables in which there were no cattle save the single old pair of posters that earned a scanty livelihood by transporting the gentry round about to the county dinners mr foker was giving himself up to ennui entirely when a messenger from mr hobnell was at length announced  it was no other than mr wapshot himself who came with an air of great indignation and holding pens missive in his hand asked mr foker how dared he bring such an unchristian message as a challenge to a boy of his school  in fact pen had written a note to his adversary of the day before telling him that if after the chastisement which his insolence richly deserved he felt inclined to ask the reparation which was usually given amongst gentlemen mr arthur pendenniss friend mr henry foker was empowered to make any arrangements for the satisfaction of mr hobnell  and so he sent you with the answerdid he sir mr foker said surveying the schoolmaster in his black coat and clerical costume  if he had accepted this wicked challenge i should have flogged him mr wapshot said and gave mr foker a glance which seemed to say and i should like very much to flog you too  uncommon kind of you sir im sure said pens emissary i told my principal that i didnt think the other man would fight he continued with a great air of dignity he prefers being flogged to fighting sir i dare say may i offer you any refreshment mr i havent the advantage of your name  my name is wapshot sir and i am master of the grammar school of this town sir cried the other and i want no refreshment sir i thank you and have no desire to make your acquaintance sir  i didnt seek yours sir im sure replied mr foker in affairs of this sort you see i think it is a pity that the clergy should be called in but theres no accounting for tastes sir  i think its a pity that boys should talk about committing murder sir as lightly as you do roared the schoolmaster and if i had you in my school  i dare say you would teach me better sir mr foker said with a bow thank you sir ive finished my education sir and aint agoing back to school sirwhen i do ill remember your kind offer sir john show this gentleman downstairsand of course as mr hobnell likes being thrashed we can have no objection sir and we shall be very happy to accommodate him whenever he comes our way  and with this the young fellow bowed the elder gentleman out of the room and sate down and wrote a note off to pen in which he informed the latter that mr hobnell was not disposed to fight and proposed to put up with the caning which pen had administered to him     chapter xvi more storms in the puddle   pens conduct in this business of course was soon made public and angered his friend doctor portman not a little while it only amused major pendennis as for the good mrs pendennis she was almost distracted when she heard of the squabble and of pens unchristian behaviour all sorts of wretchedness discomfort crime annoyance seemed to come out of this transaction in which the luckless boy had engaged and she longed more than ever to see him out of chatteris for a whileanywhere removed from the woman who had brought him into so much trouble  pen when remonstrated with by this fond parent and angrily rebuked by the doctor for his violence and ferocious intentions took the matter au grand serieux with the happy conceit and gravity of youth said that he himself was very sorry for the affair that the insult had come upon him without the slightest provocation on his part that he would permit no man to insult him upon this head without vindicating his own honour and appealing with great dignity to his uncle asked whether he could have acted otherwise as a gentleman than as he did in resenting the outrage offered to him and in offering satisfaction to the person chastised  vous allez trop vite my good sir said the uncle rather puzzled for he had been indoctrinating his nephew with some of his own notions upon the point of honouroldworld notions savouring of the camp and pistol a great deal more than our soberer opinions of the present daybetween men of the world i dont say but between two schoolboys this sort of thing is ridiculous my dear boyperfectly ridiculous  it is extremely wicked and unlike my son said mrs pendennis with tears in her eyes and bewildered with the obstinacy of the boy  pen kissed her and said with great pomposity women dear mother dont understand these mattersi put myself into fokers handsi had no other course to pursue  major pendennis grinned and shrugged his shoulders the young ones were certainly making great progress he thought mrs pendennis declared that that foker was a wicked horrid little wretch and was sure that he would lead her dear boy into mischief if pen went to the same college with him i have a great mind not to let him go at all she said and only that she remembered that the lads father had always destined him for the college in which he had had his own brief education very likely the fond mother would have put a veto upon his going to the university  that he was to go and at the next october term had been arranged between all the authorities who presided over the lads welfare foker had promised to introduce him to the right set and major pendennis laid great store upon pens introduction into college life and society by this admirable young gentleman mr foker knows the very best young men now at the university the major said and pen will form acquaintances there who will be of the greatest advantage through life to him the young marquis of plinlimmon is there eldest son of the duke of saint davidslord magnus charters is there lord runnymedes son and a first cousin of mr foker lady runnymede my dear was lady agatha milton you of course remember lady agnes will certainly invite him to logwood and far from being alarmed at his intimacy with her son who is a singular and humorous but most prudent and amiable young man to whom i am sure we are under every obligation for his admirable conduct in the affair of the fotheringay marriage i look upon it as one of the very luckiest things which could have happened to pen that he should have formed an intimacy with this most amusing young gentleman  helen sighed she supposed the major knew best mr foker had been very kind in the wretched business with miss costigan certainly and she was grateful to him but she could not feel otherwise than a dim presentiment of evil and all these quarrels and riots and worldliness scared her about the fate of her boy  doctor portman was decidedly of opinion that pen should go to college he hoped the lad would read and have a moderate indulgence of the best society too he was of opinion that pen would distinguish himself smirke spoke very highly of his proficiency the doctor himself had heard him construe and thought he acquitted himself remarkably well that he should go out of chatteris was a great point at any rate and pen who was distracted from his private grief by the various rows and troubles which had risen round about him gloomily said he would obey  there were assizes races and the entertainments and the flux of company consequent upon them at chatteris during a part of the months of august and september and miss fotheringay still continued to act and take farewell of the audiences at the chatteris theatre during that time nobody seemed to be particularly affected by her presence or her announced departure except those persons whom we have named nor could the polite county folks who had houses in london and very likely admired the fotheringay prodigiously in the capital when they had been taught to do so by the fashion which set in in her favour find anything remarkable in the actress performing on the little chatteris boards many genius and many a quack for that matter has met with a similar fate before and since miss costigans time this honest woman meanwhile bore up against the public neglect and any other crosses or vexations which she might have in life with her usual equanimity and ate drank acted slept with that regularity and comfort which belongs to people of her temperament what a deal of grief care and other harmful excitement does a healthy dulness and cheerful insensibility avoid nor do i mean to say that virtue is not virtue because it is never tempted to go astray only that dulness is a much finer gift than we give it credit for being and that some people are very lucky whom nature has endowed with a good store of that great anodyne  pen used to go drearily in and out from the play at chatteris during this season and pretty much according to his fancy his proceedings tortured his mother not a little and her anxiety would have led her often to interfere had not the major constantly checked and at the same time encouraged her for the wily man of the world fancied he saw that a favourable turn had occurred in pens malady it was the violent efflux of versification among other symptoms which gave pens guardian and physician satisfaction he might be heard spouting verses in the shrubbery walks or muttering them between his teeth as he sat with the home party of evenings one day prowling about the house in pens absence the major found a great book full of verses in the lads study they were in english and in latin quotations from the classic authors were given in the scholastic manner in the footnotes he cant be very bad wisely thought the pallmall philosopher and he made pens mother remark not perhaps without a secret feeling of disappointment for she loved romance like other soft women that the young gentleman during the last fortnight came home quite hungry to dinner at night and also showed a very decent appetite at the breakfasttable in the morning gad i wish i could said the major thinking ruefully of his dinner pills the boy begins to sleep well depend upon that it was cruel but it was true  having no other soul to confide infor he could not speak to his mother of his loves and disappointmentshis uncle treated them in a scornful and worldly tone which though carefully guarded and polite yet jarred greatly on the feelings of mr penand foker was much too coarse to appreciate those refined sentimental secretsthe lads friendship for the curate redoubled or rather he was never tired of having smirke for a listener on that one subject what is a lovee without a confidant pen employed mr smirke as corydon does the elmtree to cut out his mistresss name upon he made him echo with the name of the beautiful amaryllis when men have left off playing the tune they do not care much for the pipe but pen thought he had a great friendship for smirke because he could sigh out his loves and griefs into his tutors ears and smirke had his own reasons for always being ready at the lads call  pens affection gushed out in a multitude of sonnets to the friend of his heart as he styled the curate which the other received with great sympathy he plied smirke with latin sapphics and alcaics the lovesongs multiplied under his fluent pen and smirke declared and believed that they were beautiful on the other hand pen expressed a boundless gratitude to think that heaven should have sent him such a friend at such a moment he presented his tutor with his bestbound books and his gold guardchain and wanted him to take his doublebarrelled gun he went into chatteris and got a gold pencilcase on credit for he had no money and indeed was still in debt to smirke for some of the fotheringay presents which he presented to smirke with an inscription indicative of his unalterable and eternal regard for the curate who of course was pleased with every mark of the boys attachment  the poor curate was naturally very much dismayed at the contemplated departure of his pupil when arthur should go smirkes occupation and delight would go too what pretext could he find for a daily visit to fairoaks and that kind word or glance from the lady there which was as necessary to the curate as the frugal dinner which madame fribsby served him arthur gone he would only be allowed to make visits like any other acquaintance little laura could not accommodate him by learning the catechism more than once a week he had curled himself like ivy round fairoaks he pined at the thought that he must lose his hold of the place should he speak his mind and go down on his knees to the widow he thought over any indications in her behaviour which flattered his hopes she had praised his sermons three weeks before she had thanked him exceedingly for his present of a melon for a small dinnerparty which mrs pendennis gave she said she should always be grateful to him for his kindness to arthur and when he declared that there were no bounds to his love and affection for that dear boy she had certainly replied in a romantic manner indicating her own strong gratitude and regard to all her sons friends should he speak outor should he delay if he spoke and she refused him it was awful to think that the gate of fairoaks might be shut upon him for everand within that door lay all the world for mr smirke  thus oh friendly readers we see how every man in the world has his own private griefs and business by which he is more cast down or occupied than by the affairs or sorrows of any other person while mrs pendennis is disquieting herself about losing her son and that anxious hold she has had of him as long as he has remained in the mothers nest whence he is about to take flight into the great world beyondwhile the majors great soul chafes and frets inwardly vexed as he thinks what great parties are going on in london and that he might be sunning himself in the glances of dukes and duchesses but for those cursed affairs which keep him in a wretched little country holewhile pen is tossing between his passion and a more agreeable sensation unacknowledged yet but swaying him considerably namely his longing to see the worldmr smirke has a private care watching at his bedside and sitting behind him on his pony and is no more satisfied than the rest of us how lonely we are in the world how selfish and secret everybody you and your wife have pressed the same pillow for forty years and fancy yourselves united psha does she cry out when you have the gout or do you lie awake when she has the toothache your artless daughter seemingly all innocence and devoted to her mamma and her pianolesson is thinking of neither but of the young lieutenant with whom she danced at the last ballthe honest frank boy just returned from school is secretly speculating upon the money you will give him and the debts he owes the tartman the old grandmother crooning in the corner and bound to another world within a few months has some business or cares which are quite private and her ownvery likely she is thinking of fifty years back and that night when she made such an impression and danced a cotillon with the captain before your father proposed for her or what a silly little overrated creature your wife is and how absurdly you are infatuated about herand as for your wifeo philosophic reader answer and saydo you tell her all ah sira distinct universe walks about under your hat and under mineall things in nature are different to eachthe woman we look at has not the same features the dish we eat from has not the same taste to the one and the otheryou and i are but a pair of infinite isolations with some fellowislands a little more or less near to us let us return however to the solitary smirke  smirke had one confidante for his passionthat most injudicious woman madame fribsby how she became madame fribsby nobody knows she had left clavering to go to a milliners in london as miss fribsbyshe pretended that she had got the rank in paris during her residence in that city but how could the french king were he ever so much disposed give her any such title we shall not inquire into this mystery however suffice to say she went away from home a bouncing young lass she returned a rather elderly character with a madonna front and a melancholy countenancebought the late mrs harbottles business for a songtook her elderly mother to live with her was very good to the poor was constant at church and had the best of characters but there was no one in all clavering not mrs portman herself who read so many novels as madame fribsby she had plenty of time for this amusement for in truth very few people besides the folks at the rectory and fairoaks employed her and by a perpetual perusal of such works which were by no means so moral or edifying in the days of which we write as they are at present she had got to be so absurdly sentimental that in her eyes life was nothing but an immense lovematch and she never could see two people together but she fancied they were dying for one another  on the day after mrs pendenniss visit to the curate which we have recorded many pages back madame fribsby settled in her mind that mr smirke must be in love with the widow and did everything in her power to encourage this passion on both sides mrs pendennis she very seldom saw indeed except in public and in her pew at church that lady had very little need of millinery or made most of her own dresses and caps but on the rare occasions when madame fribsby received visits from mrs pendennis or paid her respects at fairoaks she never failed to entertain the widow with praises of the curate pointing out what an angelical man he was how gentle how studious how lonely and she would wonder that no lady would take pity upon him  helen laughed at these sentimental remarks and wondered that madame herself did not compassionate her lodger and console him madame fribsby shook her madonna front mong cure a boco souffare she said laying her hand on the part she designated as her cure it est more en espang madame she said with a sigh she was proud of her intimacy with the french language and spoke it with more volubility than correctness mrs pendennis did not care to penetrate the secrets of this wounded heart except to her few intimates she was a reserved and it may be a very proud woman she looked upon her sons tutor merely as an attendant on that young prince to be treated with respect as a clergyman certainly but with proper dignity as a dependant on the house of pendennis nor were madames constant allusions to the curate particularly agreeable to her it required a very ingenious sentimental turn indeed to find out that the widow had a secret regard for mr smirke to which pernicious error however madame fribsby persisted in holding  her lodger was very much more willing to talk on this subject with his softhearted landlady every time after that she praised the curate to mrs pendennis she came away from the latter with the notion that the widow herself had been praising him etre soul au monde est bien ouneeyoung she would say glancing up at a print of a french carbineer in a green coat and brass cuirass which decorated her apartmentdepend upon it when master pendennis goes to college his ma will find herself very lonely she is quite young yetyou wouldnt suppose her to be fiveandtwenty monsieur le cury song cure est touchyjang suis sureje conny cela biangally monsieur smirke  he softly blushed he sighed he hoped he feared he doubted he sometimes yielded to the delightful ideahis pleasure was to sit in madame fribsbys apartment and talk upon the subject where as the greater part of the conversation was carried on in french by the milliner and her old mother was deaf that retired old individual who had once been a housekeeper wife and widow of a butler in the clavering family could understand scarce one syllable of their talk  thus it was that when major pendennis announced to his nephews tutor that the young fellow would go to college in october and that mr smirkes valuable services would no longer be needful to his pupil for which services the major who spoke as grandly as a lord professed himself exceedingly grateful and besought mr smirke to command his interests in any waythus it was that the curate felt that the critical moment was come for him and was racked and tortured by those severe pangs which the occasion warranted  madame fribsby had of course taken the strongest interest in the progress of mr pens love affair with miss fotheringay she had been over to chatteris and having seen that actress perform had pronounced that she was old and overrated and had talked over master pens passion in her shop many and many a time to the halfdozen old maids and old women in male clothes who are to be found in little country towns and who formed the genteel population of clavering captain glanders hp had pronounced that pen was going to be a devil of a fellow and had begun early mrs glanders had told him to check his horrid observations and to respect his own wife if he pleased she said it would be a lesson to helen for her pride and absurd infatuation about that boy mrs pybus said many people were proud of very small things and for her part she didnt know why an apothecarys wife should give herself such airs mrs wapshot called her daughters away from that side of the street one day when pen on rebecca was stopping at the saddlers to get a new lash to his whipone and all of these people had made visits of curiosity to fairoaks and had tried to condole with the widow or bring the subject of the fotheringay affair on the tapis and had been severally checked by the haughty reserve of mrs pendennis supported by the frigid politeness of the major her brother  these rebuffs however did not put an end to the gossip and slander went on increasing about the unlucky fairoaks family glanders hp a retired cavalry officer whose halfpay and large family compelled him to fuddle himself with brandyandwater instead of claret after he quitted the dragoons had the occasional entree at fairoaks and kept his friend the major there informed of all the stories which were current at clavering mrs pybus had taken an inside place by the coach to chatteris and gone to the george on purpose to get the particulars mrs speerss man had treated mr fokers servant to drink at baymouth for a similar purpose it was said that pen had hanged himself for despair in the orchard and that his uncle had cut him down that on the contrary it was miss costigan who was jilted and not young arthur and that the affair had only been hushed up by the payment of a large sum of money the exact amount of which there were several people in clavering could testifythe sum of course varying according to the calculation of the individual narrator of the story  pen shook his mane and raged like a furious lion when these scandals affecting miss costigans honour and his own came to his ears why was not pybus a man she had whiskers enough that he might call her out and shoot her seeing simcoe pass by pen glared at him so from his saddle on rebecca and clutched his whip in a manner so menacing that that clergyman went home and wrote a sermon or thought over a sermon for he delivered oral testimony at great length in which he spoke of jezebel theatrical entertainments a double cut thisfor doctor portman the rector of the old church was known to frequent such and of youth going to perdition in a manner which made it clear to every capacity that pen was the individual meant and on the road alluded to what stories more were there not against young pendennis whilst he sate sulking achilleslike in his tent for the loss of his ravished briseis  after the affair with hobnell pen was pronounced to be a murderer as well as a profligate and his name became a name of terror and a byword in clavering but this was not all he was not the only one of the family about whom the village began to chatter and his unlucky mother was the next to become a victim to their gossip  it is all settled said mrs pybus to mrs speers the boy is to go to college and then the widow is to console herself  hes been there every day in the most open manner my dear continued mrs speers  enough to make poor mr pendennis turn in his grave said mrs wapshot  she never liked him that we know says no 1  married him for his money everybody knows that was a penniless hangeron of lady pontypools says no 2  its rather too open though to encourage a lover under pretence of having a tutor for your son cried no 3  hush here comes mrs portman some one said as the good rectors wife entered madame fribsbys shop to inspect her monthly book of fashions just arrived from london and the fact is that madame fribsby had been able to hold out no longer and one day after she and her lodger had been talking of pens approaching departure and the curate had gone off to give one of his last lessons to that gentleman madame fribsby had communicated to mrs pybus who happened to step in with mrs speers her strong suspicion her certainty almost that there was an attachment between a certain clerical gentleman and a certain lady whose naughty son was growing quite unmanageable and that a certain marriage would take place pretty soon  mrs portman saw it all of course when the matter was mentioned what a sly fox that curate was he was lowchurch and she never liked him and to think of mrs pendennis taking a fancy to him after she had been married to such a man as mr pendennis she could hardly stay five minutes at madame fribsbys so eager was she to run to the rectory and give doctor portman the news  when doctor portman heard this piece of intelligence he was in such a rage with his curate that his first movement was to break with mr smirke and to beg him to transfer his services to some other parish that milksop of a creature pretend to be worthy of such a woman as mrs pendennis broke out the doctor where will impudence stop next  she is much too old for mr smirke mrs portman remarked why poor dear mrs pendennis might be his mother almost  you always choose the most charitable reason betsy cried the rector a matron with a son grown upshe would never think of marrying again  you only think men should marry again doctor portman answered his lady bridling up  you stupid old woman said the doctor when i am gone you shall marry whomsoever you like i will leave orders in my will my dear to that effect and ill bequeath a ring to my successor and my ghost shall come and dance at your wedding  it is cruel for a clergyman to talk so the lady answered with a ready whimper but these little breezes used to pass very rapidly over the surface of the doctors domestic bliss and were followed by a great calm and sunshine the doctor adopted a plan for soothing mrs portmans ruffled countenance which has a great effect when it is tried between a worthy couple who are sincerely fond of one another and which i think becomes john anderson at threescore just as much as it used to do when he was a blackhaired young jo of fiveandtwenty  hadnt you better speak to mr smirke john mrs portman asked  when pen goes to college cadit quaestio replied the rector smirkes visits at fairoaks will cease of themselves and there will be no need to bother the widow she has trouble enough on her hands with the affairs of that silly young scapegrace without being pestered by the tittletattle of this place it is all an invention of that fool fribsby  against whom i always warned youyou know i did my dear john interposed mrs portman  that you did you very often do my love the doctor answered with a laugh it is not for want of warning on your part i am sure that i have formed my opinion of most women with whom we are acquainted madame fribsby is a fool and fond of gossip and so are some other folks but she is good to the poor she takes care of her mother and she comes to church twice every sunday and as for smirke my dear here the doctors face assumed for one moment a comical expression which mrs portman did not perceive for she was looking out of the drawingroom window and wondering what mrs pybus could want cheapening fowls again in the market when she had bad poultry from livermores two days beforeand as for mr smirke my dear betsy will you promise me that you will never breathe to any mortal what i am going to tell you as a profound secret  what is it my dear johnof course i wont answered the rectors lady  well theni cannot say it is a fact mindbut if you find that smirke is at this momentay and has been for yearsengaged to a young lady a missa miss thompson if you will have the name who lives on clapham commonyes on clapham common not far from mrs smirkes house what becomes of your story then about smirke and mrs pendennis  why did you not tell me this before asked the doctors wifehow long have you known ithow we all of us have been deceived in that man  why should i meddle in other folks business my dear the doctor answered i know how to keep a secretand perhaps this is only an invention like that other absurd story at least madame portman i should never have told you this but for the other which i beg you to contradict whenever you hear it and so saying the doctor went away to his study and mrs portman seeing that the day was a remarkably fine one thought she would take advantage of the weather and pay a few visits  the doctor looking out of his study window saw the wife of his bosom presently issue forth attired in her best she crossed the marketplace saluting the marketwomen right and left and giving a glance at the grocery and general emporium at the corner then entering london street formerly hog lane she stopped for a minute at madame fribsbys window and looking at the fashions which hung up thereseemed hesitating whether she should enter but she passed on and never stopped again until she came to mrs pybuss little green gate and garden through which she went to that ladys cottage  there of course her husband lost sight of mrs portman oh what a long bow i have pulled he said inwardlygoodness forgive me and shot my own flesh and blood there must be no more tattling and scandal about that house i must stop it and speak to smirke ill ask him to dinner this very day  having a sermon to compose the doctor sat down to that work and was so engaged in the composition that he had not concluded it until near five oclock in the afternoon when he stepped over to mr smirkes lodgings to put his hospitable intentions regarding that gentleman into effect he reached madame fribsbys door just as the curate issued from it  mr smirke was magnificently dressed and as he turned out his toes he showed a pair of elegant openworked silk stockings and glossy pumps his white cravat was arranged in a splendid stiff tie and his gold shirt studs shone on his spotless linen his hair was curled round his fair temples had he borrowed madame fribsbys irons to give that curly grace his white cambric pockethandkerchief was scented with the most delicious eaudecologne  o gracilis puercried the doctorwhither are you bound i wanted you to come home to dinner  i am engaged to dine atat fairoaks said mr smirke blushing faintly and whisking the scented pockethandkerchief and his pony being in waiting he mounted and rode away simpering down the street no accident befell him that day and he arrived with his tie in the very best order at mrs pendenniss house     chapter xvii which concludes the first part of this history   the curate had gone on his daily errand to fairoaks and was upstairs in pens study pretending to read with his pupil in the early part of that very afternoon when mrs portman after transacting business with mrs pybus had found the weather so exceedingly fine that she pursued her walk as far as fairoaks in order to pay a visit to her dear friend there in the course of their conversation the rectors lady told mrs pendennis and the major a very great secret about the curate mr smirke which was no less than that he had an attachment a very old attachment which he had long kept quite private  and on whom is it that mr smirke has bestowed his heart asked mrs pendennis with a superb air but rather an inward alarm  why my dear the other lady answered when he first came and used to dine at the rectory people said we wanted him for myra and we were forced to give up asking him then they used to say he was smitten in another quarter but i always contradicted it for my part and said that you  that i cried mrs pendennis people are very impertinent i am sure mr smirke came here as arthurs tutor and i am surprised that anybody should dare to speak so  pon my soul it is a little too much the major said laying down the newspaper and the double eyeglass  ive no patience with that mrs pybus helen continued indignantly  i told her there was no truth in it mrs portman said i always said so my dear and now it comes out that my demure gentleman has been engaged to a young ladymiss thompson of clapham common ever so long and i am delighted for my part and on myras account too for an unmarried curate is always objectionable about ones house and of course it is strictly private but i thought i would tell you as it might remove unpleasantnesses but mind not one word if you please about the story  mrs pendennis said with perfect sincerity that she was exceedingly glad to hear the news and hoped mr smirke who was a very kind and amiable man would have a deserving wife and when her visitor went away helen and her brother talked of the matter with great satisfaction the kind lady rebuking herself for her haughty behaviour to mr smirke whom she had avoided of late instead of being grateful to him for his constant attention to arthur  gratitude to this kind of people the major said is very well but familiarity is out of the question this gentleman gives his lessons and receives his money like any other master you are too humble my good soul there must be distinctions in ranks and that sort of thing i told you before you were too kind to mr smirke  but helen did not think so and now that arthur was going away and she bethought her how very polite mr smirke had been how he had gone on messages for her how he had brought books and copied music how he had taught laura so many things and given her so many kind presents her heart smote her on account of her ingratitude towards the curateso much so that when he came down from study with pen and was hankering about the hall previous to his departure she went out and shook hands with him with rather a blushing face and begged him to come into her drawingroom where she said they now never saw him and as there was to be rather a good dinner that day she invited mr smirke to partake of it and we may be sure that he was too happy to accept such a delightful summons  eased by the above report of all her former doubts and misgivings regarding the curate helen was exceedingly kind and gracious to mr smirke during dinner redoubling her attentions perhaps because major pendennis was very high and reserved with his nephews tutor when pendennis asked smirke to drink wine he addressed him as if he was a sovereign speaking to a petty retainer in a manner so condescending that even pen laughed at it although quite ready for his part to be as conceited as most young men are  but smirke did not care for the impertinences of the major so long as he had his hostesss kind behaviour and he passed a delightful time by her side at table exerting all his powers of conversation to please her talking in a manner both clerical and worldly about the fancy bazaar and the great missionary meeting about the last new novel and the bishops excellent sermon about the fashionable parties in london an account of which he read in the newspapersin fine he neglected no art by which a college divine who has both sprightly and serious talents a taste for the genteel an irreproachable conduct and a susceptible heart will try and make himself agreeable to the person on whom he has fixed his affections  major pendennis came yawning out of the diningroom very soon after his sister and little laura had left the apartment what an unsufferable bore that man is and how he did talk the major said  he has been very good to arthur who is very fond of him mrs pendennis saidi wonder who the miss thompson is whom he is going to marry  i always thought the fellow was looking in another direction said the major  and in what asked mrs pendennis quite innocentlytowards myra portman  towards helen pendennis if you must know answered her brotherinlaw  towards me impossible helen said who knew perfectly well that such had been the case his marriage will be a very happy thing i hope arthur will not take too much wine  now arthur flushed with a good deal of pride at the privilege of having the keys of the cellar and remembering that a very few more dinners would probably take place which he and his dear friend smirke could share had brought up a liberal supply of claret for the companys drinking and when the elders with little laura left him he and the curate began to pass the wine very freely  one bottle speedily yielded up the ghost another shed more than half its blood before the two topers had been much more than half an hour togetherpen with a hollow laugh and voice had drunk off one bumper to the falsehood of women and had said sardonically that wine at any rate was a mistress who never deceived and was sure to give a man a welcome  smirke gently said that he knew for his part some women who were all truth and tenderness and casting up his eyes towards the ceiling and heaving a sigh as if evoking some being dear and unmentionable he took up his glass and drained it and the rosy liquor began to suffuse his face  pen trolled over some verses he had been making that morning in which he informed himself that the woman who had slighted his passion could not be worthy to win it that he was awaking from loves mad fever and of course under these circumstances proceeded to leave her and to quit a heartless deceiver that a name which had one day been famous in the land might again be heard in it and that though he never should be the happy and careless boy he was but a few months since or his heart be what it had been ere passion had filled it and grief had wellnigh killed it that though to him personally death was as welcome as life and that he would not hesitate to part with the latter but for the love of one kind being whose happiness depended on his ownyet he hoped to show he was a man worthy of his race and that one day the false one should be brought to know how great was the treasure and noble the heart which she had flung away  pen we say who was a very excitable person rolled out these verses in his rich sweet voice which trembled with emotion whilst our young poet spoke he had a trick of blushing when in this excited state and his large and honest grey eyes also exhibited proofs of a sensibility so genuine hearty and manly that miss costigan if she had a heart must needs have softened towards him and very likely she was as he said altogether unworthy of the affection which he lavished upon her  the sentimental smirke was caught by the emotion which agitated his young friend he grasped pens hand over the dessert dishes and wineglasses he said the verses were beautiful that pen was a poet a great poet and likely by heavens permission to run a great career in the world go on and prosper dear arthur he cried the wounds under which at present you suffer are only temporary and the very grief you endure will cleanse and strengthen your heart i have always prophesied the greatest and brightest things of you as soon as you have corrected some failings and weaknesses of character which at present belong to you but you will get over these my boy you will get over these and when you are famous and celebrated as i know you will be will you remember your old tutor and the happy early days of your youth  pen swore he would with another shake of the hand across the glasses and apricots i shall never forget how kind you have been to me smirke he said i dont know what i should have done without you you are my best friend  am i really arthur said smirke looking through his spectacles and his heart began to beat so that he thought pen must almost hear it throbbing  my best friend my friend for ever pen said god bless you old boy and he drank up the last glass of the second bottle of the famous wine which his father had laid in which his uncle had bought which lord levant had imported and which now like a slave indifferent was ministering pleasure to its present owner and giving its young master delectation  well have another bottle old boy pen said by jove we will hurrayclaret goes for nothing my uncle was telling me that he saw sheridan drink five bottles at brookess besides a bottle of maraschino this is some of the finest wine in england he says so it is by jove theres nothing like it nunc vino pellite curascras ingens iterabimus aeqfill your glass old smirke a hogshead of it wont do you any harm and mr pen began to sing the drinking song out of der freischuetz the diningroom windows were open and his mother was softly pacing on the lawn outside while little laura was looking at the sunset the sweet fresh notes of the boys voice came to the widow it cheered her kind heart to hear him sing  youyou are taking too much wine arthur mr smirke said softlyyou are exciting yourself  no said pen women give headaches but this dont fill your glass old fellow and lets drinki say smirke my boylets drink to heryour her i mean not mine for whom i swear ill care no moreno not a pennyno not a figno not a glass of wine tell us about the lady smirke ive often seen you sighing about her  oh said smirkeand his beautiful cambric shirt front and glistening studs heaved with the emotion which agitated his gentle and suffering bosom  ohwhat a sigh pen cried growing very hilarious fill my boy and drink the toast you cant refuse a toast no gentleman refuses a toast heres her health and good luck to you and may she soon be mrs smirke  do you say so smirke said all of a tremble do you really say so arthur  say so of course i say so down with it heres mrs smirkes good health hip hip hurray  smirke convulsively gulped down his glass of wine and pen waved his over his head cheering so as to make his mother and laura wonder on the lawn and his uncle who was dozing over the paper in the drawingroom start and say to himself that boys drinking too much smirke put down the glass  i accept the omen gasped out the blushing curate oh my dear arthur youyou know her  whatmyra portman i wish you joy shes got a devlish large waist but i wish you joy old fellow  oh arthur groaned the curate again and nodded his head speechless  beg your pardonsorry i offended youbut she has got a large waist you knowdevilish large waist pen continuedthe third bottle evidently beginning to act upon the young gentleman  its not miss portman the other said in a voice of agony  is it anybody at chatteris or at clapham somebody here noit aint old pybus it cant be miss rolt at the factoryshes only fourteen  its somebody rather older than i am pen the curate cried looking up at his friend and then guiltily casting his eyes down into his plate  pen burst out laughing its madame fribsby by jove its madame fribsby madame frib by the immortal gods  the curate could contain no more o pen he cried how can you suppose that any of thoseof those more than ordinary beings you have named could have an influence upon this heart when i have been daily in the habit of contemplating perfection i may be insane i may be madly ambitious i may be presumptuousbut for two years my heart has been filled by one image and has known no other idol havent i loved you as a son arthursay hasnt charles smirke loved you as a son  yes old boy youve been very good to me pen said whose liking however for his tutor was not by any means of the filial kind  my means rushed on smirke are at present limited i own and my mother is not so liberal as might be desired but what she has will be mine at her death were she to hear of my marrying a lady of rank and good fortune my mother would be liberal i am sure she would be liberal whatever i have or subsequently inheritand its five hundred a year at the very leastwould be settled upon her andandand you at my deaththat is  what the deuce do you meanand what have i to do with your money cried out pen in a puzzle  arthur arthur exclaimed the other wildly you say i am your dearest friendlet me be more oh cant you see that the angelic being i lovethe purest the best of womenis no other than your dear dear angel of amother  my mother cried out arthur jumping up and sober in a minute pooh damn it smirke you must be madshes seven or eight years older than you are  did you find that any objection cried smirke piteously and alluding of course to the elderly subject of pens own passion  the lad felt the hint and blushed quite red the cases are not similar smirke he said and the allusion might have been spared a man may forget his own rank and elevate any woman to it but allow me to say our positions are very different  how do you mean dear arthur the curate interposed sadly cowering as he felt that his sentence was about to be read  mean said arthur i mean what i say my tutor i say my tutor has no right to ask a lady of my mothers rank of life to marry him its a breach of confidence i say its a liberty you take smirkeits a liberty mean indeed  o arthur the curate began to cry with clasped hands and a scared face but arthur gave another stamp with his foot and began to pull at the bell dont lets have any more of this well have some coffee if you please he said with a majestic air and the old butler entering at the summons arthur bade him to serve that refreshment  john said he had just carried coffee into the drawingroom where his uncle was asking for master arthur and the old man gave a glance of wonder at the three empty claretbottles smirke said he thought hedhed rather not go into the drawingroom on which arthur haughtily said as you please and called for mr smirkes horse to be brought round the poor fellow said he knew the way to the stable and would get his pony himself and he went into the hall and sadly put on his coat and hat  pen followed him out uncovered helen was still walking up and down the soft lawn as the sun was setting and the curate took off his hat and bowed by way of farewell and passed on to the door leading to the stable court by which the pair disappeared smirke knew the way to the stable as he said well enough he fumbled at the girths of the saddle which pen fastened for him and put on the bridle and led the pony into the yard the boy was touched by the grief which appeared in the others face as he mounted pen held out his hand and smirke wrung it silently  i say smirke he said in an agitated voice forgive me if i have said anything harshfor you have always been very very kind to me but it cant be old fellow it cant be be a man god bless you  smirke nodded his head silently and rode out of the lodgegate and pen looked after him for a couple of minutes until he disappeared down the road and the clatter of the ponys hoofs died away helen was still lingering on the lawn waiting until the boy came backshe put his hair off his forehead and kissed it fondly she was afraid he had been drinking too much wine why had mr smirke gone away without any tea  he looked at her with a kind humour beaming in his eyes smirke is unwell he said with a laugh for a long while hele had not seen the boy looking so cheerful he put his arm round her waist and walked her up and down the walk in front of the house laura began to drub on the drawingroom window and nod and laugh from it come along you two people cried on major pendennis your coffee is getting quite cold  when laura was gone to bed pen who was big with his secret burst out with it and described the dismal but ludicrous scene which had occurred helen heard of it with many blushes which became her pale face very well and a perplexity which arthur roguishly enjoyed  confound the fellows impudence major pendennis said as he took his candle where will the assurance of these people stop pen and his mother had a long talk that night full of love confidence and laughter and the boy somehow slept more soundly and woke up more easily than he had done for many months before  before the great mr dolphin quitted chatteris he not only made an advantageous engagement with miss fotheringay but he liberally left with her a sum of money to pay off any debts which the little family might have contracted during their stay in the place and which mainly through the ladys own economy and management were not considerable the small account with the spirit merchant which major pendennis had settled was the chief of captain costigans debts and though the captain at one time talked about repaying every farthing of the money it never appears that he executed his menace nor did the laws of honour in the least call upon him to accomplish that threat  when miss costigan had seen all the outstanding bills paid to the uttermost shilling she handed over the balance to her father who broke out into hospitalities to all his friends gave the little creeds more apples and gingerbread than he had ever bestowed upon them so that the widow creed ever after held the memory of her lodger in veneration and the young ones wept bitterly when he went away and in a word managed the money so cleverly that it was entirely expended before many days and that he was compelled to draw upon mr dolphin for a sum to pay for travelling expenses when the time of their departure arrived  there was held at an inn in that county town a weekly meeting of a festive almost a riotous character of a society of gentlemen who called themselves the buccaneers some of the choice spirits of chatteris belonged to this cheerful club graves the apothecary than whom a better fellow never put a pipe in his mouth and smoked it smart the talented and humorous portraitpainter of high street croker an excellent auctioneer and the uncompromising hicks the able editor for twentythree years of the county chronicle and chatteris champion were amongst the crew of the buccaneers whom also bingley the manager liked to join of a saturday evening whenever he received permission from his lady  costigan had been also an occasional buccaneer but a want of punctuality of payments had of late somewhat excluded him from the society where he was subject to disagreeable remarks from the landlord who said that a buccaneer who didnt pay his shot was utterly unworthy to be a marine bandit but when it became known to the ears as the clubbists called themselves familiarly that miss fotheringay had made a splendid engagement a great revolution of feeling took place in the club regarding captain costigan solly mine host of the grapes and i need not say as worthy a fellow as ever stood behind a bar told the gents in the buccaneers room one night how noble the captain had behaved having been round and paid off all his ticks in chatteris including his score of three pound fourteen hereand pronounced that cos was a good feller a gentleman at bottom and he solly had always said so and finally worked upon the feelings of the buccaneers to give the captain a dinner  the banquet took place on the last night of costigans stay at chatteris and was served in sollys accustomed manner as good a plain dinner of old english fare as ever smoked on a table was prepared by mrs solly and about eighteen gentlemen sate down to the festive board mr jubber the eminent draper of high street was in the chair having the distinguished guest of the club on his right the able and consistent hicks officiated as croupier on the occasion most of the gentlemen of the club were present and h foker esq and spavin esq friends of captain costigan were also participators in the entertainment the cloth having been drawn the chairman said costigan there is wine if you like but the captain preferring punch that liquor was voted by acclamation and non nobis having been sung in admirable style by messrs bingley hicks and bullby of the cathedral choir than whom a more jovial spirit neer tossed off a bumper or emptied a bowl the chairman gave the health of the king which was drunk with the loyalty of chatteris men and then without further circumlocution proposed their friend captain costigan  after the enthusiastic cheering which rang through old chatteris had subsided captain costigan rose in reply and made a speech of twenty minutes in which he was repeatedly overcome by his emotions  the gallant captain said he must be pardoned for incoherence if his heart was too full to speak he was quitting a city celebrated for its antiquitee its hospitalitee the beautee of its women the manly fidelitee generositee and jovialitee of its men cheers he was going from that ancient and venerable city of which while mimoree held her sayt he should never think without the fondest emotion to a methrawpolis where the talents of his daughther were about to have full play and where he would watch over her like a guardian angel he should never forget that it was at chatteris she had acquired the skill which she was about to exercise in another sphere and in her name and his own jack costigan thanked and blessed them the gallant officers speech was received with tremendous cheers  mr hicks croupier in a brilliant and energetic manner proposed miss fotheringays health  captain costigan returned thanks in a speech full of feeling and eloquence  mr jubber proposed the drama and the chatteris theatre and mr bingley was about to rise but was prevented by captain costigan who as long connected with the chatteris theatre and on behalf of his daughter thanked the company he informed them that he had been in garrison at gibraltar and at malta and had been at the taking of flushing the duke of york was a patron of the drama he had the honour of dining with his royal highness and the duke of kent many times and the former had justly been named the friend of the soldier cheers  the army was then proposed and captain costigan returned thanks in the course of the night he sang his wellknown songs the deserter the shan van voght the little pig under the bed and the vale of avoca the evening was a great triumph for himit ended all triumphs and all evenings end and the next day miss costigan having taken leave of all her friends having been reconciled to miss rouncy to whom she left a necklace and a white satin gownthe next day he and miss costigan had places in the competitor coach rolling by the gates of fairoaks lodgeand pendennis never saw them  tom smith the coachman pointed out fairoaks to mr costigan who sate on the box smelling of rumandwaterand the captain said it was a poor placeand added ye should see castle costigan county mayo me boywhich tom said he should like very much to see  they were gone and pen had never seen them he only knew of their departure by its announcement in the county paper the next day and straight galloped over to chatteris to hear the truth of this news they were gone indeed a card of lodgings to let was placed in the dear little familiar window he rushed up into the room and viewed it over he sate ever so long in the old windowseat looking into the deans garden whence he and emily had so often looked out together he walked with a sort of terror into her little empty bedroom it was swept out and prepared for newcomers the glass which had reflected her fair face was shining ready for her successor the curtains lay square folded on the little bed he flung himself down and buried his head on the vacant pillow  laura had netted a purse into which his mother had put some sovereigns and pen had found it on his dressingtable that very morning he gave one to the little servant who had been used to wait upon the costigans and another to the children because they said they were very fond of her it was but a few months back yet what years ago it seemed since he had first entered that room he felt that it was all done the very missing her at the coach had something fatal in it blank weary utterly wretched and lonely the poor lad felt  his mother saw she was gone by his look when he came home he was eager to fly too now as were other folks round about chatteris poor smirke wanted to go away from the sight of the syren widow foker began to think he had had enough of baymouth and that a few supperparties at saint boniface would not be unpleasant and major pendennis longed to be off and have a little pheasantshooting at stillbrook and get rid of all annoyances and tracasseries of the village the widow and laura nervously set about the preparation for pens kit and filled trunks with his books and linen helen wrote cards with the name of arthur pendennis esq which were duly nailed on the boxes and at which both she and laura looked with tearful wistful eyes it was not until long long after he was gone that pen remembered how constant and tender the affection of these women had been and how selfish his own conduct was  a night soon comes when the mail with echoing horn and blazing lamps stops at the lodgegate of fairoaks and pens trunks and his uncles are placed on the roof of the carriage into which the pair presently afterwards enter helen and laura are standing by the evergreens of the shrubbery their figures lighted up by the coach lamps the guard cries all right in another instant the carriage whirls onward the lights disappear and helens heart and prayers go with them her sainted benedictions follow the departing boy he has left the homenest in which he has been chafing and whither after his very first flight he returned bleeding and wounded he is eager to go forth again and try his restless wings  how lonely the house looks without him the corded trunks and bookboxes are there in his empty study laura asks leave to come and sleep in helens room and when she has cried herself to sleep there the mother goes softly into pens vacant chamber and kneels down by the bed on which the moon is shining and there prays for her boy as mothers only know how to plead he knows that her pure blessings are following him as he is carried miles away     chapter xviii alma mater  every man however brief or inglorious may have been his academical career must remember with kindness and tenderness the old university comrades and days the young mans life is just

which mortal may attain when he shall become such a glum philosopher as not to be pleased by the sight of happy youth coming back a few weeks since from a brief visit to the old university of oxbridge where my friend mr arthur pendennis passed some period of his life i made the journey in the railroad by the side of a young fellow at present a student of saint boniface he had got an exeat somehow and was bent on a days lark in london he never stopped rattling and talking from the commencement of the journey until its close which was a great deal too soon for me for i never was tired of listening to the honest young fellows jokes and cheery laughter and when we arrived at the terminus nothing would satisfy him but a hansom cab so that he might get into town the quicker and plunge into the pleasures awaiting him there away the young lad went whirling with joy lighting up his honest face and as for the readers humble servant having but a small carpetbag i got up on the outside of the omnibus and sate there very contentedly between a jewpedlar smoking bad cigars and a gentlemans servant taking care of a poodledog until we got our fated complement of passengers and boxes when the coachman drove leisurely away we werent in a hurry to get to town neither one of us was particularly eager about rushing into that near smoking babylon or thought of dining at the club that night or dancing at the casino yet a few years more and my young friend of the railroad will be not a whit more eager  there were no railroads made when arthur pendennis went to the famous university of oxbridge but he drove thither in a wellappointed coach filled inside and out with dons gownsmen young freshmen about to enter and their guardians who were conducting them to the university a fat old gentleman in grey stockings from the city who sate by major pendennis inside the coach having his palefaced son opposite was frightened beyond measure when he heard that the coach had been driven for a couple of stages by young mr foker of saint boniface college who was the friend of all men including coachmen and could drive as well as tom hicks himself pen sate on the roof examining coach passengers and country with great delight and curiosity his heart jumped with pleasure as the famous university came in view and the magnificent prospect of venerable towers and pinnacles tall elms and shining river spread before him  pen had passed a few days with his uncle at the majors lodgings in bury street before they set out for oxbridge major pendennis thought that the lads wardrobe wanted renewal and arthur was by no means averse to any plan which was to bring him new coats and waistcoats there was no end to the sacrifices which the selfdenying uncle made in the youths behalf london was awfully lonely the pall mall pavement was deserted the very red jackets had gone out of town there was scarce a face to be seen in the bowwindows of the clubs the major conducted his nephew into one or two of those desert mansions and wrote down the lads name on the candidatelist of one of them and arthurs pleasure at this compliment on his guardians part was excessive he read in the parchment volume his name and titles as arthur pendennis esquire of fairoaks lodge shire and saint boniface college oxbridge proposed by major pendennis and seconded by viscount colchicum with a thrill of intense gratification you will come in for ballot in about three years by which time you will have taken your degree the guardian said pen longed for the three years to be over and surveyed the stuccohalls and vast libraries and drawingrooms as already his own property the major laughed slyly to see the pompous airs of the simple young fellow as he strutted out of the building he and foker drove down in the latters cab one day to the grey friars and renewed acquaintance with some of their old comrades there the boys came crowding up to the cab as it stood by the grey friars gates where they were entering and admired the chestnut horse and the tights and livery and gravity of stoopid the tiger the bell for afternoonschool rang as they were swaggering about the playground talking to their old cronies the awful doctor passed into school with his grammar in his hand foker slunk away uneasily at his presence but pen went up blushing and shook the dignitary by the hand he laughed as he thought that wellremembered latin grammar had boxed his ears many a time he was generous goodnatured and in a word perfectly conceited and satisfied with himself  then they drove to the parental brewhouse fokers entire is composed in an enormous pile of buildings not far from the grey friars and the name of that wellknown firm is gilded upon innumerable publichouse signs tenanted by its vassals in the neighbourhood and the venerable junior partner and manager did honour to the young lord of the vats and his friend and served them with silver flagons of brownstout so strong that you would have thought not only the young men but the very horse mr harry foker drove was affected by the potency of the drink for he rushed home to the westend of the town at a rapid pace which endangered the piestalls and the women on the crossings and brought the cabsteps into collision with the posts at the street corners and caused stoopid to swing fearfully on his board behind  the major was quite pleased when pen was with his young acquaintance listened to mr fokers artless stories with the greatest interest gave the two boys a fine dinner at a covent garden coffeehouse whence they proceeded to the play but was above all happy when mr and lady agnes foker who happened to be in london requested the pleasure of major pendennis and mr arthur pendenniss company at dinner in grosvenor street having obtained the entree into lady agnes fokers house he said to pen with an affectionate solemnity which befitted the importance of the occasion it behoves you my dear boy to keep it you must mind and never neglect to call in grosvenor street when you come to london i recommend you to read up carefully in debrett the alliances and genealogy of the earls of rosherville and if you can to make some trifling allusions to the family something historical neat and complimentary and that sort of thing which you who have a poetic fancy can do pretty well mr foker himself is a worthy man though not of high extraction or indeed much education he always makes a point of having some of the family porter served round after dinner which you will on no account refuse and which i shall drink myself though all beer disagrees with me confoundedly and the heroic martyr did actually sacrifice himself as he said he would on the day when the dinner took place and old mr foker at the head of his table made his usual joke about fokers entire we should all of us i am sure have liked to see the majors grin when the worthy old gentleman made his timehonoured joke  lady agnes who wrapped up in harry was the fondest of mothers and one of the most goodnatured though not the wisest of women received her sons friend with great cordiality and astonished pen by accounts of the severe course of studies which her darling boy was pursuing and which she feared might injure his dear health foker the elder burst into a horselaugh at some of these speeches and the heir of the house winked his eye very knowingly at his friend and lady agnes then going through her sons history from the earliest time and recounting his miraculous sufferings in the measles and hoopingcough his escape from drowning the shocking tyrannies practised upon him at that horrid school whither mr foker would send him because he had been brought up there himself and she never would forgive that disagreeable doctor no neverlady agnes we say having prattled away for an hour incessantly about her son voted the two messieurs pendennis most agreeable men and when pheasants came with the second course which the major praised as the very finest birds he ever saw her ladyship said they came from logwood as the major knew perfectly well and hoped that they would both pay her a visit thereat christmas or when dear harry was at home for the vacations  god bless you my dear boy pendennis said to arthur as they were lighting their candles in bury street afterwards to go to bed you made that little allusion to agincourt where one of the roshervilles distinguished himself very neatly and well although lady agnes did not quite understand it but it was exceedingly well for a beginnerthough you oughtnt to blush so by the wayand i beseech you my dear arthur to remember through life that with an entreewith a good entree mindit is just as easy for you to have good society as bad and that it costs a man when properly introduced no more trouble or soins to keep a good footing in the best houses in london than to dine with a lawyer in bedford square mind this when you are at oxbridge pursuing your studies and for heavens sake be very particular in the acquaintances which you make the premier pas in life is the most important of alldid you write to your mother todaynowell do before you go and call and ask mr foker for a frankthey like itgood night god bless you  pen wrote a droll account of his doings in london and the play and the visit to the old friars and the brewery and the party at mr fokers to his dearest mother who was saying her prayers at home in the lonely house at fairoaks her heart full of love and tenderness unutterable for the boy and she and laura read that letter and those which followed many many times and brooded over them as women do it was the first step in life that pen was makingah what a dangerous journey it is and how the bravest may stumble and the strongest fail brother wayfarer may you have a kind arm to support yours on the path and a friendly hand to succour those who fall beside you may truth guide mercy forgive at the end and love accompany always without that lamp how blind the traveller would be and how black and cheerless the journey  so the coach drove up to that ancient and comfortable inn the trencher which stands in main street oxbridge and pen with delight and eagerness remarked for the first time gownsmen going about chapel bells clinking bells in oxbridge are ringing from morningtide till evensongtowers and pinnacles rising calm and stately over the gables and antique houseroofs of the homely busy city previous communications had taken place between dr portman on pens part and mr buck tutor of boniface on whose side pen was entered and as soon as major pendennis had arranged his personal appearance so that it should make a satisfactory impression upon pens tutor the pair walked down main street and passed the great gate and belfrytower of saint georges college and so came as they were directed to saint boniface where again pens heart began to beat as they entered at the wicket of the venerable ivymantled gate of the college it is surmounted with an ancient dome almost covered with creepers and adorned with the effigy of the saint from whom the house takes its name and many coatsofarms of its royal and noble benefactors  the porter pointed out a queer old tower at the corner of the quadrangle by which mr bucks rooms were approached and the two gentlemen walked acrosse the square the main features of which were at once and for ever stamped in pens mindthe pretty fountain playing in the centre of the fair grass plats the tall chapel windows and buttresses rising to the right the hall with its tapering lantern and oriel window the lodge from the doors of which the master issued with rustling silks the lines of the surrounding rooms pleasantly broken by carved chimneys grey turrets and quaint gablesall these mr pens eyes drank in with an eagerness which belongs to first impressions and major pendennis surveyed with that calmness which belongs to a gentleman who does not care for the picturesque and whose eyes have been somewhat dimmed by the constant glare of the pavement of pall mall  saint georges is the great college of the university of oxbridge with its four vast quadrangles and its beautiful hall and gardens and the georgians as the men are called wear gowns of a peculiar cut and give themselves no small airs of superiority over all other young men little saint boniface is but a petty hermitage in comparison of the huge consecrated pile alongside of which it lies but considering its size it has always kept an excellent name in the university its ton is very good the best families of certain counties have time out of mind sent up their young men to saint boniface the college livings are remarkably good the fellowships easy the boniface men had had more than their fair share of university honours their boat was third upon the river their chapelchoir is not inferior to saint georges itself and the boniface ale the best in oxbridge in the comfortable old wainscoted collegehall and round about roubilliacs statue of saint boniface who stands in an attitude of seraphic benediction over the uncommonly good cheer of the fellows table there are portraits of many most eminent bonifacians there is the learned doctor griddle who suffered in henry viiis time and archbishop bush who roasted himthere is lord chief justice hicksthe duke of st davids kg chancellor of the university and member of this collegesprott the poet of whose fame the college is justly prouddoctor blogg the late master and friend of doctor johnson who visited him at saint bonifaceand other lawyers scholars and divines whose portraitures look from the walls or whose coatsofarms shine in emerald and ruby gold and azure in the tall windows of the refectory the venerable cook of the college is one of the best artists in oxbridge his son took the highest honours in the other university of camford and the wine in the fellows room has long been famed for its excellence and abundance  into this certainly not the least snugly sheltered arbour amongst the groves of academe pen now found his way leaning on his uncles arm and they speedily reached mr bucks rooms and were conducted into the apartment of that courteous gentleman  he had received previous information from dr portman regarding pen with respect to whose family fortune and personal merits the honest doctor had spoken with no small enthusiasm indeed portman had described arthur to the tutor as a young gentleman of some fortune and landed estate of one of the most ancient families in the kingdom and possessing such a character and genius as were sure under the proper guidance to make him a credit to the college and the university under such recommendations the tutor was of course most cordial to the young freshman and his guardian invited the latter to dine in hall where he would have the satisfaction of seeing his nephew wear his gown and eat his dinner for the first time and requested the pair to take wine at his rooms after hall and in consequence of the highly favourable report he had received of mr arthur pendennis said he should be happy to give him the best set of rooms to be had in collegea gentlemanpensioners set indeed which were just luckily vacant so they parted until dinnertime which was very near at hand and major pendennis pronounced mr buck to be uncommonly civil indeed indeed when a college magnate takes the trouble to be polite there is no man more splendidly courteous immersed in their books and excluded from the world by the gravity of their occupations these reverend men assume a solemn magnificence of compliment in which they rustle and swell as in their grand robes of state those silks and brocades are not put on for all comers or every day  when the two gentlemen had taken leave of the tutor in his study and had returned to mr bucks anteroom or lectureroom a very handsome apartment turkeycarpeted and hung with excellent prints and richly framed pictures they found the tutors servant already in waiting there accompanied by a man with a bag full of caps and a number of gowns from which pen might select a cap and gown for himself and the servant no doubt would get a commission proportionable to the service done by him mr pen was all in a tremor of pleasure as the bustling tailor tried on a gown and pronounced that it was an excellent fit and then he put the pretty college cap on in rather a dandified manner and somewhat on one side as he had seen fiddicombe the youngest master at grey friars wear it and he inspected the entire costume with a great deal of satisfaction in one of the great gilt mirrors which ornamented mr bucks lectureroom for some of these college divines are no more above lookingglasses than a lady is and look to the set of their gowns and caps quite as anxiously as folks do of the lovelier sex the major smiled as he saw the boy dandifying himself in the glass the old gentleman was not displeased with the appearance of the comely lad  then davis the skip or attendant led the way keys in hand across the quadrangle the major and pen following him the latter blushing and pleased with his new academical habiliments across the quadrangle to the rooms which were destined for the freshman and which were vacated by the retreat of the gentlemanpensioner mr spicer the rooms were very comfortable with large cross beams high wainscots and small windows in deep embrasures mr spicers furniture was there and to be sold at a valuation and major pendennis agreed on his nephews behalf to take the available part of it laughingly however declining as indeed pen did for his own part six sporting prints and four groups of operadancers with gauze draperies which formed the late occupants pictorial collection  then they went to hall where pen sate down and ate his commons with his brother freshmen and the major took his place at the hightable along with the college dignitaries and other fathers or guardians of youth who had come up with their sons to oxbridge and after hall they went to mr bucks to take wine and after wine to chapel where the major sate with great gravity in the upper place having a fine view of the master in his carved throne or stall under the organloft where that gentleman the learned doctor donne sate magnificent with his great prayerbook before him an image of statuesque piety and rigid devotion all the young freshmen behaved with gravity and decorum but pen was shocked to see that atrocious little foker who came in very late and half a dozen of his comrades in the gentlemenpensioners seats giggling and talking as if they had been in so many stalls at the opera but these circumstances it must be remembered took place some years back when william the fourth was king young men are much better behaved now and besides saint boniface was rather a fast college  pen could hardly sleep at night in his bedroom at the trencher so anxious was he to begin his college life and to get into his own apartments what did he think about as he lay tossing and awake was it about his mother at home the pious soul whose life was bound up in his yes let us hope he thought of her a little was it about miss fotheringay and his eternal passion which had kept him awake so many nights and created such wretchedness and such longing he had a trick of blushing and if you had been in the room and the candle had not been out you might have seen the youths countenance redden more than once as he broke out into passionate incoherent exclamations regarding that luckless event of his life his uncles lessons had not been thrown away upon him the mist of passion had passed from his eyes now and he saw her as she was to think that he pendennis had been enslaved by such a woman and then jilted by her that he should have stooped so low to be trampled on the mire that there was a time in his life and that but a few months back when he was willing to take costigan for his fatherinlaw  poor old smirke pen presently laughed outwell ill write and try and console the poor old boy he wont die of his passion ha ha the major had he been awake might have heard a score of such ejaculations uttered by pen as he lay awake and restless through the first night of his residence at oxbridge  it would perhaps have been better for a youth the battle of whose life was going to begin on the morrow to have passed the eve in a fferent sort of vigil but the world had got hold of pen in the shape of his selfish old mentor and those who have any interest in his character must have perceived ere now that this lad was very weak as well as very impetuous very vain as well as very frank and if of a generous disposition not a little selfish in the midst of his profuseness and also rather fickle as all eager pursuers of selfgratification are  the six months passion had aged him very considerably there was an immense gulf between pen the victim of love and pen the innocent boy of eighteen sighing after it and so arthur pendennis had all the experience and superiority besides that command which afterwards conceit and imperiousness of disposition gave him over the young men with whom he now began to live  he and his uncle passed the morning with great satisfaction in making purchases for the better comfort of the apartments which the lad was about to occupy mr spicers china and glass was in a dreadfully dismantled condition his lamps smashed and his bookcases by no means so spacious as those shelves which would be requisite to receive the contents of the boxes which were lying in the hall at fairoaks and which were addressed to arthur in the hand of poor helen  the boxes arrived in a few days that his mother had packed with so much care pen was touched as he read the superscriptions in the dear wellknown hand and he arranged in their proper places all the books his old friends and all the linen and tablecloths which helen had selected from the family stock and all the jampots which little laura had bound in straw and the hundred simple gifts of home pen had another alma mater now but it is not all children who take to her kindly     chapter xix pendennis of boniface   our friend pen was not sorry when his mentor took leave of the young gentleman on the second day after the arrival of the pair in oxbridge and we may be sure that the major on his part was very glad to have discharged his duty and to have the duty over more than three months of precious time had that martyr of a major given up to his nephewwas ever selfish man called upon to make a greater sacrifice do you know many men or majors who would do as much a man will lay down his head or peril his life for his honour but let us be shy how we ask him to give up his ease or his hearts desire very few of us can bear that trial say worthy reader if thou hast peradventure a beard wouldst thou do as much i will not say that a woman will not they are used to it we take care to accustom them to sacrifices but my good sir the amount of selfdenial which you have probably exerted through life when put down to your account elsewhere will not probably swell the balance on the credit side much well well there is no use in speaking of such ugly matters and you are too polite to use a vulgar to quoque but i wish to state once for all that i greatly admire the major for his conduct during the past quarter and think that he has quite a right to be pleased at getting a holiday foker and pen saw him off in the coach and the former young gentleman gave particular orders to the coachman to take care of that gentleman inside it pleased the elder pendennis to have his nephew in the company of a young fellow who would introduce him to the best set of the university the major rushed off to london and thence to cheltenham from which wateringplace he descended upon some neighbouring great houses whereof the families were not gone abroad and where good shooting and company was to be had  a quarter of the space which custom has awarded to works styled the serial nature has been assigned to the account of one passage in pens career and it is manifest that the whole of his adventures cannot be treated at a similar length unless some descendant of the chronicler of pens history should take up the pen at his decease and continue the narrative for the successors of the present generation of readers we are not about to go through the young fellows academical career with by any means a similar minuteness alas the life of such boys does not bear telling altogether i wish it did i ask you does yours as long as what we call our honour is clear i suppose your mind is pretty easy women are pure but not men women are unselfish but not men and i would not wish to say of poor arthur pendennis that he was worse than his neighbours only that his neighbours are bad for the most part let us have the candour to own as much at least can you point out ten spotless men of your acquaintance mine is pretty large but i cant find ten saints in the list  during the first term of mr pens academical life he attended classical and mathematical lectures with tolerable assiduity but discovering before very long time that he had little taste or genius for the pursuing of the exact sciences and being perhaps rather annoyed that one or two very vulgar young men who did not even use straps to their trousers so as to cover the abominably thick and coarse shoes and stockings which they wore beat him completely in the lectureroom he gave up his attendance at that course and announced to his fond parent that he proposed to devote himself exclusively to the cultivation of greek and roman literature  mrs pendennis was for her part quite satisfied that her darling boy should pursue that branch of learning for which he had the greatest inclination and only besought him not to ruin his health by too much study for she had heard the most melancholy stories of young students who by overfatigue had brought on brainfevers and perished untimely in the midst of their university career and pens health which was always delicate was to be regarded as she justly said beyond all considerations or vain honours pen although not aware of any lurking disease which was likely to end his life yet kindly promised his mamma not to sit up reading too late of nights and stuck to his word in this respect with a great deal more tenacity of resolution than he exhibited upon some other occasions when perhaps he was a little remiss  presently he began too to find that he learned little good in the classical lecture his fellowstudents there were too dull as in mathematics they were too learned for him mr buck the tutor was no better a scholar than many a fifthform boy at grey friars might have some stupid humdrum notions about the metre and grammatical construction of a passage of aeschylus or aristophanes but had no more notion of the poetry than mrs binge his bedmaker and pen grew weary of hearing the dull students and tutor blunder through a few lines of a play which he could read in a tenth part of the time which they gave to it after all private reading as he began to perceive was the only study which was really profitable to a man and he announced to his mamma that he should read by himself a great deal more and in public a great deal less that excellent woman knew no more about homer than she did about algebra but she was quite contented with pens arrangements regarding his course of studies and felt perfectly confident that her dear boy would get the place which he merited  pen did not come home until after christmas a little to the fond mothers disappointment and lauras who was longing for him to make a fine snow fortification such as he had made three winters before but he was invited to logwood lady agnes fokers where there were private theatricals and a gay christmas party of very fine folks some of them whom major pendennis would on no account have his nephew neglect however he stayed at home for the last three weeks of the vacation and laura had the opportunity of remarking what a quantity of fine new clothes he brought with him and his mother admired his improved appearance and manly and decided tone  he did not come home at easter but when he arrived for the long vacation he brought more smart clothes appearing in the morning in wonderful shooting jackets with remarkable buttons and in the evening in gorgeous velvet waistcoats with richlyembroidered cravats and curious linen and as she pried about his room she saw oh such a beautiful dressingcase with silver mountings and a quantity of lovely rings and jewellery and he had a new french watch and gold chain in place of the big old chronometer with its bunch of jingling seals which had hung from the fob of john pendennis and by the secondhand of which the defunct doctor had felt many a patients pulse in his time it was but a few months back pen had longed for this watch which he thought the most splendid and august timepiece in the world and just before he went to college helen had taken it out of her trinketbox where it had remained unwound since the death of her husband and given it to pen with a solemn and appropriate little speech respecting his fathers virtues and the proper use of time this portly and valuable chronometer pen now pronounced to be out of date and indeed made some comparisons between it and a warmingpan which laura thought disrespectful and he left the watch in a drawer in the company of soiled primrose gloves cravats which had gone out of favour and of that other school watch which has once before been mentioned in this history our old friend rebecca pen pronounced to be no long up to his weight and swapped her away for another and more powerful horse for which he had to pay rather a heavy figure mr pendennis gave the boy the money for the new horse and laura cried when rebecca was fetched away  also pen brought a large box of cigars branded colorados afrancesados telescopios fudson oxford street or by some such strange titles and began to consume these not only about the stables and greenhouses where they were very good for helens plants but in his own study of which practice his mother did not at first approve but he was at work upon a prizepoem he said and could not compose without his cigar and quoted the late lamented it lord byrons lines in favour of the custom of smoking as he was smoking to such good purpose his mother could not of course refuse permission in fact the good soul coming into the room one day in the midst of pens labours he was consulting a novel which had recently appeared for the cultivation of the light literature of his own country as well as of foreign nations became every studenthelen we say coming into the room and finding pen on the sofa at this work rather than disturb him went for a lightbox and his cigarcase to his bedroom which was adjacent and actually put the cigar into his mouth and lighted the match at which he kindled it pen laughed and kissed his mothers hand as it hung fondly over the back of the sofa dear old mother he said if i were to tell you to burn the house down i think you would do it and it is very likely that mr pen was right and that the foolish woman would have done almost as much for him as he said  besides the works of english light literature which this diligent student devoured he brought down boxes of the light literature of the neighbouring country of france into the leaves of which when helen dipped she read such things as caused her to open her eyes with wonder but pen showed her that it was not he who made the books though it was absolutely necessary that he should keep up his french by an acquaintance with the most celebrated writers of the day and that it was as clearly his duty to read the eminent paul de kock as to study swift or moliere and mrs pendennis yielded with a sigh of perplexity but miss laura was warned off the books both by his anxious mother and that rigid moralist mr arthur pendennis himself who however he might be called upon to study every branch of literature in order to form his mind and to perfect his style would by no means prescribe such a course of reading to a young lady whose business in life was very different  in the course of this long vacation mr pen drank up the bin of claret which his father had laid in and of which we have heard the son remark that there was not a headache in a hogshead and this wine being exhausted he wrote for a further supply to his wine merchants messrs binney and latham of mark lane london from whom indeed old doctor portman had recommended pen to get a supply of port and sherry on going to college you will have no doubt to entertain your young friends at boniface with wineparties the honest rector had remarked to the lad they used to be customary at college in my time and i would advise you to employ an honest and respectable house in london for your small stock of wine rather than to have recourse to the oxbridge tradesmen whose liquor if i remember rightly was both deleterious in quality and exorbitant in price and the obedient young gentleman took the doctors advice and patronised messrs binney and latham at the rectors suggestion  so when he wrote orders for a stock of wine to be sent down to the cellars at fairoaks he hinted that messrs b and l might send in his university account for wine at the same time with the fairoaks bill the poor widow was frightened at the amount but pen laughed at her oldfashioned views said that the bill was moderate that everybody drank claret and champagne now and finally the widow paid feeling dimly that the expenses of her household were increasing considerably and that her narrow income would scarce suffice to meet them but they were only occasional pen merely came home for a few weeks at the vacation laura and she might pinch when he was gone in the brief time he was with them ought they not to make him happy  arthurs own allowances were liberal all this time indeed much more so than those of the sons of far more wealthy men years before the thrifty and affectionate john pendennis whose darling project it had ever been to give his son a university education and those advantages of which his own fathers extravagance had deprived him had begun laying by a store of money which he called arthurs education fund year after year in his book his executors found entries of sums vested as a e f and during the period subsequent to her husbands decease and before pens entry at college the widow had added sundry sums to this fund so that when arthur went up to oxbridge it reached no inconsiderable amount let him be liberally allowanced was major pendenniss maxim let him make his first entree into the world as a gentleman and take his place with men of good rank and station after giving it to him it will be his own duty to hold it there is no such bad policy as stinting a boyor putting him on a lower allowance than his fellows arthur will have to face the world and fight for himself presently meanwhile we shall have procured for him good friends gentlemanly habits and have him well backed and well trained against the time when the real struggle comes and these liberal opinions the major probably advanced both because they were just and because he was not dealing with his own money  thus young pen the only son of an estated country gentleman with a good allowance and a gentlemanlike bearing and person looked to be a lad of much more consequence than he was really and was held by the oxbridge authorities tradesmen and undergraduates as quite a young buck and member of the aristocracy his manner was frank brave and perhaps a little impertinent as becomes a highspirited youth he was perfectly generous and freehanded with his money which seemed pretty plentiful he loved joviality and had a good voice for a song boatracing had not risen in pens time to the fureur which as we are given to understand it has since attained in the university and riding and tandemdriving were the fashions of the ingenuous youth pen rode well to hounds appeared in pink as became a young buck and not particularly extravagant in equestrian or any other amusement yet managed to run up a fine bill at niles the liverystable keeper and in a number of other quarters in fact this lucky young gentleman had almost every taste to a considerable degree he was very fond of books of all sorts doctor portman had taught him to like rare editions and his own taste led him to like beautiful bindings it was marvellous what tall copies and gilding and marbling and blindtooling the booksellers and binders put upon pens bookshelves he had a very fair taste in matters of art and a keen relish for prints of a high schoolnone of your french opera dancers or tawdry racing prints such as had delighted the simple eyes of mr spicer his predecessorbut your stranges and rembrandt etchings and wilkies before the letter with which his apartments were furnished presently in the most perfect good taste as was allowed in the university where this young fellow got no small reputation we have mentioned that he exhibited a certain partiality for rings jewellery and fine raiment of all sorts and it must be owned that mr pen during his time at the university was rather a dressy man and loved to array himself in splendour he and his polite friends would dress themselves out with as much care in order to go and dine at each others rooms as other folks would who were going to enslave a mistress they said he used to wear rings over his kid gloves which he always denies but what follies will not youth perpetrate with its own admirable gravity and simplicity that he took perfumed baths is a truth and he used to say that he took them after meeting certain men of a very low set in hall  in pens second year when miss fotheringay made her chief hit in london and scores of prints were published of her pen had one of these hung in his bedroom and confided to the men of his set how awfully how wildly how madly how passionately he had loved that woman he showed them in confidence the verses that he had written to her and his brow would darken his eyes roll his chest heave with emotion as he recalled that fatal period of his life and described the woes and agonies which he had suffered the verses were copied out handed about sneered at admired passed from coterie to coterie there are few things which elevate a lad in the estimation of his brother boys more than to have a character for a great and romantic passion perhaps there is something noble in it at all timesamong very young men it is considered heroicpen was pronounced a tremendous fellow they said he had almost committed suicide that he had fought a duel with a baronet about her freshmen pointed him out to each other as at the promenade time at two oclock he swaggered out of college surrounded by his cronies he was famous to behold he was elaborately attired he would ogle the ladies who came to lionise the university and passed before him on the arms of happy gownsmen and give his opinion upon their personal charms or their toilettes with the gravity of a critic whose experience entitled him to speak with authority men used to say that they had been walking with pendennis and were as pleased to be seen in his company as some of us would be if we walked with a duke down pall mall he and the proctor capped each other as they met as if they were rival powers and the men hardly knew which was the greater  in fact in the course of his second year arthur pendennis had become one of the men of fashion in the university it is curious to watch that facile admiration and simple fidelity of youth they hang round a leader and wonder at him and love him and imitate him no generous boy ever lived i suppose that has not had some wonderment of admiration for another boy and monsieur pen at oxbridge had his school his faithful band of friends and his rivals when the young men heard at the haberdashers shops that mr pendennis of boniface had just ordered a crimson satincravat you would see a couple of dozen crimson satin cravats in main street in the course of the weekand simon the jeweller was known to sell no less than two gross of pendennis pins from a pattern which the young gentleman had selected in his shop  now if any person with an arithmetical turn of mind will take the trouble to calculate what a sum of money it would cost a young man to indulge freely in all the above propensities which we have said mr pen possessed it will be seen that a young fellow with such liberal tastes and amusements must needs in the course of two or three years spend or owe a very handsome sum of money we have said our friend pen had not a calculating turn no one propensity of his was outrageously extravagant and it is certain that paddingtons tailors account guttleburys cooks bill for dinners dillon tandys bill with finn the print seller for raphaelmorgheus and landseer proofs and wormalls dealings with parkton the great bookseller for aldine editions blackletter folios and richly illuminated missals of the xvi century and snaffles or fokers score with nile the horsedealer were each and all of them incomparably greater than any little bills which mr pen might run up with the abovementioned tradesmen but pendennis of boniface had the advantage over all these young gentlemen his friends and associates of a universality of taste and whereas young lord paddington did not care twopence for the most beautiful print or to look into any gilt frame that had not a mirror within it and guttlebury did not mind in the least how he was dressed and had an aversion for horse exercise nay a terror of it and snaffle never read any printed works but the racing calendar or bells life or cared for any manuscript except his greasy little scrawl of a bettingbookour catholicminded young friend occupied himself in every one of the branches of science or pleasure abovementioned and distinguished himself tolerably in each  hence young pen got a prodigious reputation in the university and was hailed as a sort of crichton and as for the english verse prize in competition for which we have seen him busily engaged at fairoaks jones of jesus carried it that year certainly but the undergraduates thought pens a much finer poem and he had his verses printed at his own expense and distributed in gilt morocco covers amongst his acquaintance i found a copy of it lately in a dusty corner of mr pens bookcases and have it before me this minute bound up in a collection of old oxbridge tracts university statutes prizepoems by successful and unsuccessful candidates declamations recited in the college chapel speeches delivered at the union debating society and inscribed by arthur with his name and college pendennisboniface or presented to him by his affectionate friend thompson or jackson the author how strange the epigraphs look in those halfboyish hands and what a thrill the sight of the documents gives one after the lapse of a few lustres how fate since that time has removed some estranged others dealt awfully with all many a hand is cold that wrote those kindly memorials and that we pressed in the confident and generous grasp of youthful friendship what passions our friendships were in those old days how artless and void of doubt how the arm you were never tired of having linked in yours under the fair college avenues or by the river side where it washes magdalen gardens or christ church meadows or winds by trinity and kings was withdrawn of necessity when you entered presently the world and each parted to push and struggle for himself through the great mob on the way through life are we the same men now that wrote those

with these grave parodies and boyish exercises which are at once so frank and false and mirthful yet somehow so mournful by youthful hands that shall never write more fate has interposed darkly and the young voices are silent and the eager brains have ceased to work this one had genius and a great descent and seemed to be destined for honours which now are of little worth to him that had virtue learning geniusevery faculty and endowment which might secure love admiration and worldly fame an obscure and solitary churchyard contains the grave of many fond hopes and the pathetic stone which bids them farewelli saw the sun shining on it in the fall of last year and heard the sweet village choir raising anthems round about what boots whether it be westminster or a little country spire which covers your ashes or if a few days sooner or later the world forgets you  amidst these friends then and a host more pen passed more than two brilliant and happy years of his life he had his fill of pleasure and popularity no dinner or supperparty was complete without him and pens jovial wit and pens songs and dashing courage and frank and manly bearing charmed all the undergraduates and even disarmed the tutors who cried out at his idleness and murmured about his extravagant way of life though he became the favourite and leader of young men who were much his superiors in wealth and station he was much too generous to endeavour to propitiate them by any meanness or cringing on his own part and would not neglect the humblest man of his acquaintance in order to curry favour with the richest young grandee in the university his name is still remembered at the union debating club as one of the brilliant orators of his day by the way from having been an ardent tory in his freshmans year his principles took a sudden turn afterwards and he became a liberal of the most violent order he avowed himself a dantonist and asserted that louis the sixteenth was served right and as for charles the first he vowed that he would chop off that monarchs head with his own right hand were he then in the room at the union debating club and had cromwell no other executioner for the traitor he and lord magnus charters the marquis of runnymedes son beforementioned were the most truculent republicans of their day  there are reputations of this sort made quite independent of the collegiate hierarchy in the republic of gownsmen a man may be famous in the honourlists and entirely unknown to the undergraduates who elect kings and chieftains of their own whom they admire and obey as negrogangs have private black sovereigns in their own body to whom they pay an occult obedience besides that which they publicly profess for their owners and drivers among the young ones pen became famous and popular not that he did much but there was a general determination that he could do a great deal if he chose ah if pendennis of boniface would but try the men said he might do anything he was backed for the greek ode won by smith of trinity everybody was sure he would have the latin hexameter prize which brown of st johns however carried off and in this way one university honour after another was lost by him until after two or three failures mr pen ceased to compete but he got a declamation prize in his own college and brought home to his mother and laura at fairoaks a set of prizebooks begilt with the college arms and so big wellbound and magnificent that these ladies thought there had been no such prize ever given in a college before as this of pens and that he had won the very largest honour which oxbridge was capable of awarding  as vacation after vacation and term after term passed away without the desired news that pen had sate for any scholarship or won any honour doctor portman grew mightily gloomy in his behaviour towards arthur and adopted a sulky grandeur of deportment towards him which the lad returned by a similar haughtiness one vacation he did not call upon the doctor at all much to his mothers annoyance who thought that it was a privilege to enter the rectoryhouse at clavering and listened to dr portmans antique jokes and stories though ever so often repeated with unfailing veneration i cannot stand the doctors patronising air pen said hes too kind to me a great deal fatherly i have seen in the world better men than him and am not going to bore myself by listening to his dull old stories and drinking his stupid old port wine the tacit feud between pen and the doctor made the widow nervous so that she too avoided portman and was afraid to go to the rectory when arthur was at home  one sunday in the last long vacation the wretched boy pushed his rebellious spirit so far as not to go to church and he was seen at the gate of the clavering arms smoking a cigar in the face of the congregation as it issued from st marys there was an awful sensation in the village society portman prophesied pens ruin after that and groaned in spirit over the rebellious young prodigal  so did helen tremble in her heart and little lauralaura had grown to be a fine young stripling by this time graceful and fair clinging round helen and worshipping her with a passionate affection both of these women felt that their boy was changed he was no longer the artless pen of old days so brave so artless so impetuous and tender his face looked careworn and haggard his voice had a deeper sound and tones more sarcastic care seemed to be pursuing him but he only laughed when his mother questioned him and parried her anxious queries with some scornful jest nor did he spend much of his vacations at home he went on visits to one great friend or another and scared the quiet pair at fairoaks by stories of great houses whither he had been invited and by talking of lords without their titles  honest harry foker who had been the means of introducing arthur pendennis to that set of young men at the university from whose society and connexions arthurs uncle expected that the lad would get so much benefit who had called for arthurs first song at his first supperparty and who had presented him at the barmecide club where none but the very best men of oxbridge were admitted it consisted in pens time of six noblemen eight gentlemenpensioners and twelve of the most select commoners of the university soon found himself left far behind by the young freshman in the fashionable world of oxbridge and being a generous and worthy fellow without a spark of envy in his composition was exceedingly pleased at the success of his young protege and admired pen quite as much as any of the other youth did i was he who followed pen now and quoted his sayings learned his songs and retailed them at minor supperparties and was never weary of hearing them from the gifted young poets own mouthfor a good deal of the time which mr pen might have employed much more advantageously in the pursuit of the regular scholastic studies was given up to the composition of secular ballads which he sang about at parties according to university wont  it had been as well for arthur if the honest foker had remained for some time at college for with all his vivacity he was a prudent young man and often curbed pens propensity to extravagance but fokers collegiate career did not last very long after arthurs entrance at boniface repeated differences with the university authorities caused mr foker to quit oxbridge in an untimely manner he would persist in attending races on the neighbouring hungerford heath in spite of the injunctions of his academic superiors he never could be got to frequent the chapel of the college with that regularity of piety which alma mater demands from her children tandems which are abominations in the eyes of the heads and tutors were fokers greatest delight and so reckless was his driving and frequent the accidents and upsets out of his drag that pen called taking a drive with him taking the diversions of purley finally having a dinnerparty at his rooms to entertain some friends from london nothing would satisfy mr foker but painting mr bucks door vermilion in which freak he was caught by the proctors and although young black strap the celebrated negro fighter who was one of mr fokers distinguished guests and was holding the can of paint while the young artist operated on the door knocked down two of the proctors attendants and performed prodigies of valour yet these feats rather injured than served foker whom the proctor knew very well and who was taken with the brush in his hand and who was summarily convened and sent down from the university  the tutor wrote a very kind and feeling letter to lady agnes on the subject stating that everybody was fond of the youth that he never meant harm to any mortal creature that he for his own part would have been delighted to pardon the harmless little boyish frolic had not its unhappy publicity rendered it impossible to look the freak over and breathing the most fervent wishes for the young fellows welfarewishes no doubt sincere for foker as we know came of a noble family on his mothers side and on the other was heir to a great number of thousand pounds a year  it dont matter said foker talking over the matter with pena little sooner or a little later what is the odds i should have been plucked for my littlego again i know i shouldthat latin i cannot screw into my head and my mammas anguish would have broke out next term the governor will blow like an old grampus i know he willwell we must stop till he gets his wind again i shall probably go abroad and improve my mind with foreign travel yes parlyvoos the ticket itly and that sort of thing ill go to paris and learn to dance and complete my education but its not me im anxious about pen as long as people drink beer i dont careits about you im doubtful my boy youre going too fast and cant keep up the pace i tell you its not the fifty you owe mepay it or not when you likebut its the everyday pace and i tell you it will kill you youre livin as if there was no end to the money in the stockin at home you oughtnt to give dinners you ought to eat em fellows are glad to have you you oughtnt to owe horse bills you ought to ride other chaps nags you know no more about betting than i do about algebra the chaps will win your money as sure as you sport it hang me if you are not trying everything i saw you sit down to ecarte last week at trumpingtons and taking your turn with the bones after ringwoods supper theyll beat you at it pen my boy even if they play on the square which i dont say they dont nor which i dont say they do mind but i wont play with em youre no match for em you aint up to their weight its like little black strap standing up to tom springthe blacks a pretty fighter but law bless you his arm aint long enough to touch tomand i tell you youre going it with fellers beyond your weight look hereif youll promise me never to bet nor touch a box nor a card ill let you off the two ponies  but pen laughingly said that though it wasnt convenient to him to pay the two ponies at that moment he by no means wished to be let off any just debts he owed and he and foker parted not without many dark forebodings on the latters part with regard to his friend who harry thought was travelling speedily on the road to ruin  one must do at rome as rome does pen said in a dandified manner jingling some sovereigns in his waistcoatpocket a little quiet play at ecarte cant hurt a man who plays pretty welli came away fourteen sovereigns richer from ringwoods supper and gad i wanted the moneyand he walked off after having taken leave of poor foker who went away without any beat of drum or offer to drive the coach out of oxbridge to superintend a little dinner which he was going to give at his own rooms in boniface about which dinners the cook of the college who had a great respect for mr pendennis always took especial pains for his young favourite     chapter xx rakes progress   some short time before mr fokers departure from oxbridge there had come up to boniface a gentleman who had once as it turned out belonged to the other university of camford which he had quitted on account of some differences with the tutors and authorities there this gentleman whose name was horace bloundell was of the ancient suffolk family of bloundellbloundell of bloundellbloundell hall bloundellbloundellshire as the young wags used to call it and no doubt it was on account of his descent and because dr donne the master of boniface was a suffolk man and related perhaps to the family that mr horace bloundell was taken in at boniface after st georges and one or two other colleges had refused to receive him there was a living in the family which it was important for mr bloundell to hold and being in a dragoon regiment at the time when his third brother for whom the living was originally intended sickened and died mr bloundell determined upon quitting crimson pantaloons and sable shakos for the black coat and white neckcloth of the english divine the misfortunes which occurred at camford occasioned some slight disturbance to mr bloundells plans but although defeated upon one occasion the resolute exdragoon was not dismayed and set to work to win a victory elsewhere  in pens second year major pendennis paid a brief visit to his nephew and was introduced to several of pens university friendsthe gentle and polite lord plinlimmon the gallant and openhearted magnus charters the sly and witty harland the intrepid ringwood who was called rupert in the union debating club from his opinions and the bravery of his blunders broadbent styled barebones broadbent from the republican nature of his opinions he was of a dissenting family from bristol and a perfect boanerges of debate mr bloundellbloundell finally who had at once taken his place among the select of the university  major pendennis though he did not understand harlands greek quotations or quite appreciate broadbents thick shoes and dingy hands was nevertheless delighted with the company assembled round his nephew and highly approved of all the young men with the exception of that one who gave himself the greatest airs in the society and affected most to have the manners of a man of the world  as he and pen sate at breakfast on the morning after the party in the rooms of the latter the major gave his opinions regarding the young men with whom he was in the greatest goodhumour he had regaled them with some of his stories which though not quite so fresh in london where people have a diseased appetite for novelty in the way of anecdotes were entirely new at oxbridge and the lads heard them with that honest sympathy that eager pleasure that boisterous laughter or that profound respect so rare in the metropolis and which must be so delightful to the professed raconteur only once or twice during the telling of the anecdote mr bloundells face wore a look of scorn or betrayed by its expression that he was acquainted with the tales narrated once he had the audacity to question the accuracy of one of the particulars of a tale as given by major pendennis and gave his own version of the anecdote about which he knew he was right for he heard it openly talked of at the club by soandso and tother who were present at the business the youngsters present looked up with wonder at their associate who dared to interrupt the majorfew of them could appreciate that melancholy grace and politeness with which major pendennis at once acceded to mr bloundells version of the story and thanked him for correcting his own error they stared on the next occasion of meeting when bloundell spoke in contemptuous terms of old pen said everybody knew old pen regular old trencherman at gaunt house notorious old bore regular old fogy  major pendennis on his side liked mr bloundell not a whit these sympathies are pretty sure to be mutual amongst men and women and if for my part some kind friend tells me that such and such a man has been abusing me i am almost sure on my own side that i have a misliking to such and such a man we like or dislike each other as folks like or dislike the odour of certain flowers or the taste of certain dishes or wines or certain books we cant tell whybut as a general rule all the reasons in the world will not make us love dr fell and as sure as we dislike him we may be sure that he dislikes us  so the major said pen my boy your dinner went off a merveille you did the honours very nicelyyou carved welli am glad you learned to carveit is done on the sideboard now in most good houses but is still an important point and may aid you in middlelifeyoung lord plinlimmon is a very amiable young man quite the image of his dear mother whom i knew as lady aquila brownbill and lord magnuss republicanism will wear offit sits prettily enough on a young patrician in early life though nothing is so loathsome among persons of our rankmr broadbent seems to have much eloquence and considerable reading your friend foker is always delightful but your acquaintance mr bloundell struck me as in all respects a most ineligible young man  bless my soul sir bloundellbloundell cried pen laughing why sir hes the most popular man of the university we elected him of the barmecides the first week he came uphad a special meeting on purposehes of an excellent familysuffolk bloundells descended from richards blondel bear a harp in chiefand motto o mong roy  a man may have a very good coatofarms and be a tiger my boy the major said chipping his egg that man is a tiger mark my worda low man i will lay a wager that he left his regiment which was a good one for a more respectable man than my friend lord martingale never sate in a saddle in bad odour there is the unmistakable look of slang and bad habits about this mr bloundell he frequents low gamblinghouses and billiardhells sirhe haunts thirdrate clubsi know he does i know by his style i never was mistaken in my man yet did you remark the quantity of rings and jewellery he wore that person has scamp written on his countenance if any man ever had mark my words and avoid him let us turn the conversation the dinner was a leetle too fine but i dont object to your making a few extra frais when you receive friends of course you dont do it often and only those whom it is your interest to feter the cutlets were excellent and the souffle uncommonly light and good the third bottle of champagne was not necessary but you have a good income and as long as you keep within it i shall not quarrel with you my dear boy  poor pen the worthy uncle little knew how often those dinners took place while the reckless young amphitryon delighted to show his hospitality and skill in gourmandise there is no art than that so long to learn so difficult to acquire so impossible and beyond the means of many unhappy people about which boys are more anxious to have an air of knowingness a taste and knowledge of wines and cookery appears to them to be the sign of an accomplished roue and manly gentleman i like to see them wink at a glass of claret as if they had an intimate acquaintance with it and discuss a salmipoor boysit is only when they grow old that they know they know nothing of the science when perhaps their conscience whispers them that the science is in itself little worth and that a leg of mutton and content is as good as the dinners of pontiffs but little pen in his character of admirable crichton thought it necessary to be a great judge and practitioner of dinners we have just said how the college cook respected him and shall soon have to deplore that that worthy man so blindly trusted our pen in the third year of the lads residence at oxbridge his staircase was by no means encumbered with dishcovers and desserts and waiters carrying in dishes and skips opening iced champagne crowds of different sorts of attendants with faces sulky or piteous hung about the outer oak and assailed the unfortunate lad as he issued out of his den  nor did his guardians advice take any effect or induce mr pen to avoid the society of the disreputable mr bloundell what young men like in their companions is what had got pen a great part of his own repute and popularity a real or supposed knowledge of life a man who has seen the world or can speak of it with a knowing aira roue or lovelace who has his adventures to relate is sure of an admiring audience among boys it is hard to confess but so it is we respect that sort of prowess from our schooldays we have been taught to admire it are there five in the hundred out of the hundreds and hundreds of english schoolboys brought up at our great schools and colleges that must not own at one time of their lives to having read and liked don juan awful propagation of evilthe idea of it should make the man tremble who holds the pen lest untruth or impurity or unjust anger or unjust praise escape it  one such diseased creature as this is enough to infect a whole colony and the tutors of boniface began to find the moral tone of their college lowered and their young men growing unruly and almost ungentlemanlike soon after mr bloundells arrival at oxbridge the young magnates of the neighbouring great college of st georges who regarded pen and in whose society he lived were not taken in by bloundells flashy graces and rakish airs of fashion broadbent called him captain macheath and said he would live to be hanged foker during his brief stay at the university with macheath with characteristic caution declined to say anything in the captains disfavour but hinted to pen that he had better have him for a partner at whist than play against him and better back him at ecarte than bet on the other side you see he plays better than you do pen was the astute young gentlemans remark he plays uncommon well the captain doesand pen i wouldnt take the odds too freely from him if i was you i dont think hes too flush of money the captain aint but beyond these dark suggestions and generalities the cautious foker could not be got to speak  not that his advice would have had more weight with a headstrong young man than advice commonly has with a lad who is determined on pursuing his own way pens appetite for pleasure was insatiable and he rushed at it wherever it presented itself with an eagerness which bespoke his fiery constitution and youthful health he called taking pleasure seeing life and quoted wellknown maxims from terence from horace from shakspeare to show that one should do all that might become a man he bade fair to be utterly used up and a roue in a few years if he were to continue at the pace at which he was going  one night after a supperparty in college at which pen and macheath had been present and at which a little quiet vingtetun had been played an amusement much pleasanter to men in their second and third year than the boisterous custom of singing songs which bring the proctors about the rooms and which have grown quite stale by this time every man having expended his budgetas the men had taken their caps and were going away after no great losses or winnings on any side mr bloundell playfully took up a green wineglass from the suppertable which had been destined to contain iced cup but into which he inserted something still more pernicious namely a pair of dice which the gentleman took out of his waistcoatpocket and put into the glass then giving the glass a graceful wave which showed that his hand was quite experienced in the throwing of dice he called sevens the main and whisking the ivory cubes gently on the table swept them up lightly again from the cloth and repeated this process two or three times the other men looked on pen of course among the number who had never used the dice as yet except to play a humdrum game of backgammon at home  mr bloundell who had a good voice began to troll out the chorus from robert the devil an opera then in great vogue in which chorus many of the men joined especially pen who was in very high spirits having won a good number of shillings and halfcrowns at the vingtetunand presently instead of going home most of the party were seated round the table playing at dice the green glass going round from hand to hand until pen finally shivered it after throwing six mains  from that night pen plunged into the delights of the game of hazard as eagerly as it was his custom to pursue any new pleasure dice can be played of mornings as well as after dinner or supper bloundell would come into pens rooms after breakfast and it was astonishing how quick the time passed as the bones were rattling they had little quiet parties with closed doors and bloundell devised a box lined with felt so that the dice should make no noise and their telltale rattle not bring the sharpeared tutors up to the rooms bloundell ringwood and pen were once very nearly caught by mr buck who passing in the quadrangle thought he heard the words two to one on the caster through pens open window but when the tutor got into arthurs rooms he found the lads with three homers before them and pen said he was trying to coach the two other men and asked mr buck with great gravity what was the present condition of the river scamander and whether it was navigable or no  mr arthur pendennis did not win much money in these transactions with mr bloundell or indeed gain good of any kind except a knowledge of the odds at hazard which he might have learned out of books  captain macheath had other accomplishments which he exercised for pens benefit the captains stories had a great and unfortunate charm for arthur who was never tired of hearing bloundells histories of garrison conquests and of his feats in countryquartershe had been at paris and had plenty of legends about the palais royal and the salon and frascatis he had gone to the salon one night after a dinner at the cafe de paris when we were all devilishly cut by jove and on waking in the morning in my own rooms i found myself with twelve thousand francs under my pillow and a hundred and fortynine napoleons in one of my boots wasnt that a coup hay the captain said pens eyes glistened with excitement as he heard this story he respected the man who could win such a sum of money he sighed and said it would set him all right macheath laughed and told him to drink another drop of maraschino i could tell you stories much more wonderful than that he added and so indeed the captain could have done without any further trouble than that of invention with which portion of the poetic faculty nature had copiously endowed him  he laughed to scorn pens love for miss fotheringay when he came to hear of that amour from arthur as he pretty soon did for we have said pen was not averse to telling the story now to his confidential friends and he and they were rather proud of the transaction but macheath took away all pens conceit on this head not by demonstrating the folly of the lads passion for an uneducated woman much his senior in years but by exposing his absurd desire of gratifying his passion in a legitimate way marry her said he you might as well marry  and he named one of the most notorious actresses on the stage  she hadnt a shred of a character he knew twenty men who were openly admirers of her and named them and the sums each had spent upon her i know no kind of calumny more frightful or frequent than this which takes away the character of women no men more reckless and mischievous than those who lightly use it and no kind of cowards more despicable than the people who invent these slanders  is it or not a misfortune that a man himself of a candid disposition and disposed like our friend pen to blurt out the truth on all occasions begins life by believing all that is said to him would it be better for a lad to be less trustful and so less honest it requires no small experience of the world to know that a man who has no especial reason thereto is telling you lies i am not sure whether it is not best to go on being duped for a certain time at all events our honest pen had a natural credulity which enabled him to accept all statements which were made to him and he took every one of captain macheaths figments as if they had been the most unquestioned facts of history  so bloundells account about miss fotheringay pained and mortified pen exceedingly if he had been ashamed of his passion beforewhat were his feelings regarding it now when the object of so much pure flame and adoration turned out to be only a worthless impostor an impostor detected by all but him it never occurred to pen to doubt the fact or to question whether the stories of a man who like his new friend never spoke well of any woman were likely to be true  one easter vacation when pen had announced to his mother and uncle his intention not to go down but stay at oxbridge and read mr pen was nevertheless induced to take a brief visit to london in company with his friend mr bloundell they put up at a hotel in covent garden where bloundell had a tick as he called it and took the pleasures of the town very freely after the wont of young university men bloundell still belonged to a military club whither he took pen to dine once or twice the young men would drive thither in a cab trembling lest they should meet major pendennis on his beat in pall mall and here pen was introduced to a number of gallant young fellows with spurs and mustachios with whom he drank paleale of mornings and beat the town of a night here he saw a deal of life indeed nor in his career about the theatres and singinghouses which these roaring young blades frequented was he very likely to meet his guardian one night nevertheless they were very near to each other a plank only separating pen who was in the boxes of the museum theatre from the major who was in lord steynes box along with that venerated nobleman the fotheringay was in the pride of her glory shad made a hit that is she had drawn very good houses for nearly a year had starred the provinces with great eclat had come back to shine in london with somewhat diminished lustre and now was acting with ever increasing attraction etc triumph of the good old british drama as the playbills avowed to houses in which there was plenty of room for anybody who wanted to see her  it was not the first time pen had seen her since that memorable day when the two had parted in chatteris in the previous year when the town was making much of her and the press lauded her beauty pen had found a pretext for coming to london in termtime and had rushed off to the theatre to see his old flame he recollected it rather than renewed it he remembered how ardently he used to be on the lookout at chatteris when the speech before ophelias or mrs hallers entrance on the stage was made by the proper actor now as the actor spoke he had a sort of feeble thrill as the house began to thunder with applause and ophelia entered with her old bow and sweeping curtsey pen felt a slight shock and blushed very much as he looked at her and could not help thinking that all the house was regarding him he hardly heard her for the first part of the play and he thought with such rage of the humiliation to which she had subjected him that he began to fancy he was jealous and in love with her still but that illusion did not last very long he ran round to the stagedoor of the theatre to see her if possible but he did not succeed she passed indeed under his nose with a female companion but he did not know hernor did she recognise him the next night he came in late and stayed very quietly for the afterpiece and on the third and last night of his stay in londonwhy taglioni was going to dance at the operataglioni and there was to be don giovanni which he admired of all things in the world so mr pen went to don giovanni and taglioni  this time the illusion about her was quite gone she was not less handsome but she was not the same somehow the light was gone out of her eyes which used to flash there or pens no longer were dazzled by it the rich voice spoke as of old yet it did not make pens bosom thrill as formerly he thought he could recognise the brogue underneath the accents seemed to him coarse and false it annoyed him to hear the same emphasis on the same words only uttered a little louder worse than this it annoyed him to think that he should ever have mistaken that loud imitation for genius or melted at those mechanical sobs and sighs he felt that it was in another life almost that it was another man who had so madly loved her he was ashamed and bitterly humiliated and very lonely ah poor pen the delusion is better than the truth sometimes and fine dreams than dismal waking  they went and had an uproarious supper that night and mr pen had a fine headache the next morning with which he went back to oxbridge having spent all his ready money  as all this narrative is taken from pens own confessions so that the reader may be assured of the truth of every word of it and as pen himself never had any accurate notion of the manner in which he spent his money and plunged himself in much deeper pecuniary difficulties during his luckless residence at oxbridge university it is of course impossible for me to give any accurate account of his involvements beyond that general notion of his way of life which has been sketched a few pages back he does not speak too hardly of the roguery of the university tradesmen or of those in london whom he honoured with his patronage at the outset of his career even finch the moneylender to whom bloundell introduced him and with whom he had various transactions in which the young rascals signature appeared upon stamped paper treated him according to pens own account with forbearance and never mulcted him of more than a hundred per cent the old collegecook his fervent admirer made him a private bill offered to send him in dinners up to the very last and never would have pressed his account to his dying day there was that kindness and frankness about arthur pendennis which won most people who came in contact with him and which if it rendered him an easy prey to rogues got him perhaps more goodwill than he merited from many honest men it was impossible to resist his goodnature or in his worst moments not to hope for his rescue from utter ruin  at the time of his full career of university pleasure he would leave the gayest party to go and sit with a sick friend he never knew the difference between small and great in the treatment of his acquaintances however much the unlucky lads tastes which were of the sumptuous order led him to prefer good society he was only too ready to share his guinea with a poor friend and when he got money had an irresistible propensity for paying which he never could conquer through life  in his third year at college the duns began to gather awfully round about him and there was a levee at his oak which scandalised the tutors and would have scared many a stouter heart with some of these he used to battle some he would bully under mr bloundells directions who was a master in this art though he took a degree in no other and some deprecate and it is reported of him that little mary frodsham the daughter of a certain poor gilder and framemaker whom mr pen had thought fit to employ and who had made a number of beautiful frames for his fine prints coming to pendennis with a piteous tale that her father was ill with ague and that there was an execution in their house pen in an anguish of remorse rushed away pawned his grand watch and every single article of jewellery except two old gold sleevebuttons which had belonged to his father and rushed with the proceeds to frodshams shop where with tears in his eyes and the deepest repentance and humility he asked the poor tradesmans pardon  this young gentlemen is not told as an instance of pens virtue but rather of his weakness it would have been much more virtuous to have had no prints at all he still stood for the baubles which he sold in order to pay frodshams bill and his mother had cruelly to pinch herself in order to discharge the jewellers account so that she was in the end the sufferer by the lads impertinent fancies and follies we are not presenting pen to you as a hero or a model only as a lad who in the midst of a thousand vanities and weaknesses has as yet some generous impulses and is not altogether dishonest  we have said it was to the scandal of mr buck the tutor that pens extravagances became known from the manner in which he entered college the associates he kept and the introductions of doctor portman and the major buck for a long time thought that his pupil was a man of large property and wondered rather that he only wore a plain gown once on going up to london to the levee with an address from his majestys loyal university of oxbridge buck had seen major pendennis at st jamess in conversation with two knights of the garter in the carriage of one of whom the dazzled tutor saw the major whisked away after the levee he asked pen to wine the instant he came back let him off from chapels and lectures more than ever and felt perfectly sure that he was a young gentleman of large estate  thus he was thunderstruck when he heard the truth and received a dismal confession from pen his university debts were large and the tutor had nothing to do and of course pen did not acquaint him with his london debts what man ever does tell all when pressed by his friends about his liabilities the tutor learned enough to know that pen was poor that he had spent a handsome almost a magnificent allowance and had raised around him such a fine crop of debts as it would be very hard work for any man to mow down for there is no plant that grows so rapidly when once it has taken root  perhaps it was because she was so tender and good that pen was terrified lest his mother should know of his sins i cant bear to break it to her he said to the tutor in an agony of grief o sir ive been a villain to herand he repented and he wished he had the time to come over again and he asked himself why why did his uncle insist upon the necessity of living with great people and in how much did all his grand acquaintance profit him  they were not shy but pen thought they were and slunk from them during his last terms at college he was as gloomy as a deathshead at parties which he avoided of his own part or to which his young friends soon ceased to invite him everybody knew that pendennis was hard up that man bloundell who could pay nobody and who was obliged to go down after three terms was his ruin the men said his melancholy figure might be seen shirking about the lonely quadrangles in his battered old cap and torn gown and he who had been the pride of the university but a year before the man whom all the young ones loved to look at was now the object of conversation at freshmens wineparties and they spoke of him with wonder and awe  at last came the degree examinations many a young man of his year whose hobnailed shoes pen had derided and whose face or coat he had caricaturedmany a man whom he had treated with scorn in the lectureroom or crushed with his eloquence in the debatingclubmany of his own set who had not half his brains but a little regularity and constancy of occupation took high places in the honours or passed with decent credit and where in the list was pen the superb pen the wit and dandy pen the poet and orator ah where was pen the widows darling and sole pride let us hide our heads and shut up the page the lists came out and a dreadful rumour rushed through the university that pendennis of boniface was plucked     chapter xxi flight after defeat   everybody who has the least knowledge of heraldry and the peerage must be aware that the noble family of which as we know helen pendennis was a member bears for a crest a nest full of little pelicans pecking at the ensanguined bosom of a big maternal bird which plentifully supplies the little wretches with the nutriment on which according to the heraldic legend they are supposed to be brought up very likely female pelicans like so to bleed under the selfish little beaks of their young ones it is certain that women do there must be some sort of pleasure which we men dont understand which accompanies the pain of being scarified and indeed i believe some women would rather actually so suffer than not they like sacrificing themselves in behalf of the object which their instinct teaches them to love be it for a reckless husband a dissipated son a darling scapegrace of a brother how ready their hearts are to pour out their best treasures for the benefit of the cherished person and what a deal of this sort of enjoyment are we on one side ready to give the soft creatures there is scarce a man that reads this but has administered pleasure in this fashion to his womankind and has treated them to the luxury of forgiving him they dont mind how they live themselves but when the prodigal comes home they make a rejoicing and kill the fatted calf for him and at the very first hint that the sinner is returning the kind angels prepare their festival and mercy and forgiveness go smiling out to welcome him i hope it may be so always for all if we have only justice to look to heaven help us  during the latter part of pens residence at the university of oxbridge his uncles partiality had greatly increased for the lad the major was proud of arthur who had high spirits frank manners a good person and high gentlemanlike bearing it pleased the old london bachelor to see pen walking with the young patricians of his university and he who was never known to entertain his friends and whose stinginess had passed into a sort of byword among some wags at the club who envied his many engagements and did not choose to consider his poverty was charmed to give his nephew and the young lords snug little dinners at his lodgings and to regale them with good claret and his very best bons mots and stories some of which would be injured by the repetition for the majors manner of telling them was incomparably neat and careful and others whereof the repetition would do good to nobody he paid his court to their parents through the young men and to himself as it were by their company he made more than one visit to oxbridge where the young fellows were amused by entertaining the old gentleman and gave parties and breakfasts and fetes partly to joke him and partly to do him honour he plied them with his stories he made himself juvenile and hilarious in the company of the young lords he went to hear pen at a grand debate at the union crowed and cheered and rapped his stick in chorus with the cheers of the men and was astounded at the boys eloquence and fire he thought he had got a young pitt for a nephew he had an almost paternal fondness for pen he wrote to the lad letters with playful advice and the news of the town he bragged about arthur at his clubs and introduced him with pleasure into his conversation saying that egad the young fellows were putting the old ones to the wall that the lads who were coming up young lord plinlimmon a friend of my boy young lord magnus charters a chum of my scapegrace etc would make a greater figure in the world than even their fathers had done before them he asked permission to bring arthur to a grand fete at gaunt house saw him with ineffable satisfaction dancing with the sisters of the young noblemen before mentioned and gave himself as much trouble to procure cards of invitation for the lad to some good houses as if he had been a mamma with a daughter to marry and not an old halfpay officer in a wig and he boasted everywhere of the boys great talents and remarkable oratorical powers and of the brilliant degree he was going to take lord runnymede would take him on his embassy or the duke would bring him in for one of his boroughs he wrote over and over again to helen who for her part was too ready to believe anything that anybody chose to say in favour of her son  and all this pride and affection of uncle and mother had been trampled down by pens wicked extravagance and idleness i dont envy pens feelings as the phrase is as he thought of what he had done he had slept and the tortoise had won the race he had marred at its outset what might have been a brilliant career he had dipped ungenerously into a generous mothers purse basely and recklessly spilt her little cruse o it was a coward hand that could strike and rob a creature so tender and if pen felt the wrong which he had done to others are we to suppose that a young gentleman of his vanity did not feel still more keenly the shame he had brought upon himself let us be assured that there is no more cruel remorse than that and no groans more piteous than those of wounded selflove like joel millers friend the senior wrangler who bowed to the audience from his box at the play because he and the king happened to enter the theatre at the same time only with a fatuity by no means so agreeable to himself poor arthur pendennis felt perfectly convinced that all england would remark the absence of his name from the examinationlists and talk about his misfortune his wounded tutor his many duns the skip and bedmaker who waited upon him the undergraduates of his own time and the years below him whom he had patronised or scornedhow could he bear to look any of them in the face now he rushed to his rooms into which he shut himself and there he penned a letter to his tutor full of thanks regards remorse and despair requesting that his name might be taken off the college books and intimating a wish and expectation that death would speedily end the woes of the disgraced arthur pendennis  then he slunk out scarcely knowing whither he went but mechanically taking the unfrequented little lanes by the backs of the colleges until he cleared the university precincts and got down to the banks of the camisis river now deserted but so often alive with the boatraces and the crowds of cheering gownsmen he wandered on and on until he found himself at some miles distance from oxbridge or rather was found by some acquaintances leaving that city  as pen went up a hill a drizzling january rain beating in his face and his ragged gown flying behind himfor he had not divested himself of his academical garments since the morninga postchaise came rattling up the road on the box of which a servant was seated whilst within or rather half out of the carriage window sate a young gentleman smoking a cigar and loudly encouraging the postboy it was our young acquaintance of baymouth mr spavin who had got his degree and was driving homewards in triumph in his yellow postchaise he caught a sight of the figure madly gesticulating as he worked up the hill and of poor pens pale and ghastly face as the chaise whirled by him  wo roared mr spavin to the postboy and the horses stopped in their mad career and the carriage pulled up some fifty yards before pen he presently heard his own name shouted and beheld the upper half of the body of mr spavin thrust out of the sidewindow of the vehicle and beckoning pen vehemently towards it  pen stopped hesitatednodded his head fiercely and pointed onwards as if desirous that the postillion should proceed he did not speak but his countenance must have looked very desperate for young spavin having stared at him with an expression of blank alarm jumped out of the carriage presently ran towards pen holding out his hand and grasping pens said i sayhullo old boy where are you going and whats the row now  im going where i deserve to go said pen with an imprecation  this aint the way said mr spavin smiling this is the fenbury road i say pen dont take on because you are plucked its nothing when you are used to it ive been plucked three times old boyand after the first time i didnt care glad its over though youll have better luck next time  pen looked at his early acquaintancewho had been plucked who had been rusticated who had only after repeated failures learned to read and write correctly and who in spite of all these drawbacks had attained the honour of a degree this man has passed he thought and i have failed it was almost too much for him to bear  goodbye spavin said he im very glad you are through dont let me keep you im in a hurryim going to town tonight  gammon said mr spavin this aint the way to town this is the fenbury road i tell you  i was just going to turn back pen said  all the coaches are full with the men going down spavin said pen winced youd not get a place for a tenpound note get into my yellow ill drop you at mudford where you have a chance of the fenbury mail ill lend you a hat and a coat ive got lots come along jump in old boygo it leathersand in this way pen found himself in mr spavins postchaise and rode with that gentleman as far as the ram inn at mudford fifteen miles from oxbridge where the fenbury mail changed horses and where pen got a place on to london  the next day there was an immense excitement in boniface college oxbridge where for some time a rumour prevailed to the terror of pens tutor and tradesmen that pendennis maddened at losing his degree had made away with himselfa battered cap in which his name was almost discernible together with a seal bearing his crest of an eagle looking at a now extinct sun had been found three miles on the fenbury road near a millstream and for fourandtwenty hours it was supposed that poor pen had flung himself into the stream until letters arrived from him bearing the london postmark  the mail reached london at the dreary hour of five and he hastened to the inn at covent garden at which he was accustomed to put up where the everwakeful porter admitted him and showed him to a bed pen looked hard at the man and wondered whether boots knew he was plucked when in bed he could not sleep there he tossed about until the appearance of the dismal london daylight when he sprang up desperately and walked off to his uncles lodgings in bury street where the maid who was scouring the steps looked up suspiciously at him as he came with an unshaven face and yesterdays linen he thought she knew of his mishap too  good evens mr harthur what as appened sir mr morgan the valet asked who had just arranged the wellbrushed clothes and shiny boots at the door of his masters bedroom and was carrying in his wig to the major  i want to see my uncle he cried in a ghastly voice and flung himself down on a chair  morgan backed before the pale and desperatelooking young man with terrified and wondering glances and disappeared in his masters apartment  the major put his head out of the bedroom door as soon as he had his wig on  what examination over senior wrangler double first class hay said the old gentlemanill come directly and the head disappeared  they dont know what has happened groaned pen what will they say when they know all  pen had been standing with his back to the window and to such a dubious light as bury street enjoys of a foggy january morning so that his uncle could not see the expression of the young mans countenance or the looks of gloom and despair which even mr morgan had remarked  but when the major came out of his dressingroom neat and radiant and preceded by faint odours from delcroixs shop from which emporium major pendenniss wig and his pockethandkerchief got their perfume he held out one of his hands to pen and was about addressing him in his cheery hightoned voice when he caught sight of the boys face at length and dropping his hand said good god pen whats the matter  youll see it in the papers at breakfast sir pen said  see what  my name isnt there sir  hang it why should it be asked the major more perplexed  i have lost everything sir pen groaned out my honours gone im ruined irretrievably i cant go back to oxbridge  lost your honour screamed out the major heaven alive you dont mean to say you have shown the white feather  pen laughed bitterly at the word feather and repeated it no it isnt that sir im not afraid of being shot i wish to god anybody would i have not got my degree iim plucked sir  the major had heard of plucking but in a very vague and cursory way and concluded that it was some ceremony performed corporally upon rebellious university youth i wonder you can look me in the face after such a disgrace sir he said i wonder you submitted to it as a gentleman  i couldnt help it sir i did my classical papers well enough it was those infernal mathematics which i have always neglected  was itwas it done in public sir the major said  what  thethe plucking asked the guardian looking pen anxiously in the face  pen perceived the error under which his guardian was labouring and in the midst of his misery the blunder caused the poor wretch a faint smile and served to bring down the conversation from the tragedykey in which pen had been disposed to carry it on he explained to his uncle that he had gone in to pass his examination and failed on which the major said that though he had expected far better things of his nephew there was no great misfortune in this and no dishonour as far as he saw and that pen must try again  me again at oxbridge pen thought after such a humiliation as that he felt that except he went down to burn the place he could not enter it  but it was when he came to tell his uncle of his debts that the other felt surprise and anger most keenly and broke out in speeches most severe upon pen which the lad bore as best might without flinching he had determined to make a clean breast and had formed a full true and complete list of all his bills and liabilities at the university and in london they consisted of various items such as     london tailor                      oxbridge do    oxbridge do                        bill for horses    haberdasher for shirts and gloves printseller    jeweller                           books    college cook                       binding    grump for desserts                hairdresser and perfumery    bootmaker                          hotel bill in london    wine merchant in london            sundries  all which items the reader may fill in at his pleasuresuch accounts have been inspected by the parents of many university youthand it appeared that mr pens bills in all amounted to about seven hundred pounds and furthermore it was calculated that he had had more than twice that sum of ready money during his stay at oxbridge this sum he had spent and for it had to showwhat  you need not press a man who is down sir pen said to his uncle gloomily i know very well sir how wicked and idle i have been my mother wont like to see me dishonoured sir he continued with his voice failing and i know she will pay these accounts but i shall ask her for no more money  as you like sir the major said you are of age and my hands are washed of your affairs but you cant live without money and have no means of making it that i see though you have a fine talent in spending it and it is my belief that you will proceed as you have begun and ruin your mother before you are five years oldergood morning it is time for me to go to breakfast my engagements wont permit me to see you much during the time that you stay in london i presume that you will acquaint your mother with the news which you have just conveyed to me  and pulling on his hat and trembling in his limbs somewhat major pendennis walked out of his lodgings before his nephew and went ruefully off to take his accustomed corner at the club he saw the oxbridge examinationlists in the morning papers and read over the names not understanding the business with mournful accuracy he consulted various old fogies of his acquaintance in the course of the day at his clubs wenham a dean various civilians and as it is called took their opinion showing to some of them the amount of his nephews debts which he had dotted down on the back of a card and asking what was to be done and whether such debts were not monstrous preposterous what was to be donethere was nothing for it but to pay wenham and the others told the major of young men who owed twice as muchfive times as muchas arthur and with no means at all to pay the consultations and calculations and opinions comforted the major somewhat after all he was not to pay  but he thought bitterly of the many plans he had formed to make a man of his nephew of the sacrifices which he had made and of the manner in which he was disappointed and he wrote off a letter to doctor portman informing him of the direful events which had taken place and begging the doctor to break them to helen for the orthodox old gentleman preserved the regular routine in all things and was of opinion that it was more correct to break a piece of bad news to a person by means of a possibly maladroit and unfeeling messenger than to convey it simply to its destination by a note so the major wrote to doctor portman and then went out to dinner one of the saddest men in any london diningroom that day  pen too wrote his letter and skulked about london streets for the rest of the day fancying that everybody was looking at him and whispering to his neighbour that is pendennis of boniface who was plucked yesterday his letter to his mother was full of tenderness and remorse he wept the bitterest tears over itand the repentance and passion soothed him to some degree  he saw a party of roaring young blades from oxbridge in the coffeeroom of his hotel and slunk away from them and paced the streets he remembers he says the prints which he saw hanging up at ackermanns window in the rain and a book which he read at a stall near the temple at night he went to the pit of the play and saw miss fotheringay but he doesnt in the least recollect in what piece  on the second day there came a kind letter from his tutor containing many grave and appropriate remarks upon the event which had befallen him but strongly urging pen not to take his name off the university books and to retrieve a disaster which everybody knew was owing to his own carelessness alone and which he might repair by a months application he said he had ordered pens skip to pack up some trunks of the young gentlemans wardrobe which duly arrived with fresh copies of all pens bills laid on the top  on the third day there arrived a letter from home which pen read in his bedroom and the result of which was that he fell down on his knees with his head in the bedclothes and then prayed out his heart and humbled himself and having gone downstairs and eaten an immense breakfast he sallied forth and took his place at the bull and mouth piccadilly by the chatteris coach for that evening     chapter xxii prodigals return   such a letter as the major wrote of course sent doctor portman to fairoaks and he went off with that alacrity which a good man shows when he has disagreeable news to commit he wishes the deed were done and done quickly he is sorry but que voulezvous the tooth must be taken out and he has you in the chair and it is surprising with what courage and vigour of wrist he applies the forceps perhaps he would not be quite so active or eager if it were his tooth but in fine it is your duty to have it out so the doctor having read the epistle out to myra and mrs portman with many damnatory comments upon the young scapegrace who was goin deeper and deeper into perdition left those ladies to spread the news through the clavering society which they did with their accustomed accuracy and despatch and strode over to fairoaks to break the intelligence to the widow  she had the news already she had read pens letter and it had relieved her somehow a gloomy presentiment of evil had been hanging over her for many many months past she knew the worst now and her darling boy was come back to her repentant and tenderhearted did she want more all that the rector could say and his remarks were both dictated by commonsense and made respectable by antiquity could not bring helen to feel any indignation or particular unhappiness except that the boy should be unhappy what was this degree that they made such an outcry about and what good would it do pen why did doctor portman and his uncle insist upon sending the boy to a place where there was so much temptation to be risked and so little good to be won why didnt they leave him at home with his mother as for his debts of course they must be paidhis debtswasnt his fathers money all his and hadnt he a right to spend it in this way the widow met the virtuous doctor and all the arrows of his indignation somehow took no effect upon her gentle bosom  for some time past an agreeable practice known since times ever so ancient by which brothers and sisters are wont to exhibit their affection towards one another and in which pen and his little sister laura had been accustomed to indulge pretty frequently in their childish days had been given up by the mutual consent of those two individuals coming back from college after an absence from home of some months in place of the simple girl whom he had left behind him mr arthur found a tall slim handsome young lady to whom he could not somehow proffer the kiss which he had been in the habit of administering previously and who received him with a gracious curtsey and a proffered hand and with a great blush which rose up to the cheek just upon the very spot which young pen had been used to salute  i am not good at descriptions of female beauty and indeed do not care for it in the least thinking that goodness and virtue are of course far more advantageous to a young lady than any mere fleeting charms of person and face and so shall not attempt any particular delineation of miss laura bell at the age of sixteen years at that age she had attained her present altitude of five feet four inches so that she was called tall and gawky by some and a maypole by others of her own sex who prefer littler women but if she was a maypole she had beautiful roses about her head and it is a fact that many swains were disposed to dance round her she was ordinarily pale with a faint rose tinge in her cheeks but they flushed up in a minute when occasion called and continued so blushing ever so long the roses remaining after the emotion had passed away which had summoned those pretty flowers into existence her eyes have been described as very large from her earliest childhood and retained that characteristic in later life goodnatured critics always females said that she was in the habit of making play with those eyes and ogling the gentlemen and ladies in her company but the fact is that nature had made them so to shine and to look and they could no more help so looking and shining than one star can help being brighter than another it was doubtless to mitigate their brightness that miss lauras eyes were provided with two pairs of veils in the shape of the longest and finest black eyelashes so that when she closed her eyes the same people who found fault with those orbs said that she wanted to show her eyelashes off and indeed i daresay that to see her asleep would have been a pretty sight  as for her complexion that was nearly as brilliant as lady mantraps and without the powder which her ladyship uses her nose must be left to the readers imaginaton if her mouth was rather large as miss piminy avers who but for her known appetite one would think could not swallow anything larger than a button everybody allowed that her smile was charming and showed off a set of pearly teeth whilst her voice was so low and sweet that to hear it was like listening to sweet music because she is in the habit of wearing very long dresses people of course say that her feet are not small but it may be that they are of the size becoming her figure and it does not follow because mrs pincher is always putting her foot out that all other ladies should be perpetually bringing theirs on the tapis in fine miss laura bell at the age of sixteen was a sweet young lady many thousands of such are to be found let us hope in this country where there is no lack of goodness and modesty and purity and beauty  now miss laura since she had learned to think for herself and in the past two years her mind and her person had both developed themselves considerably had only been half pleased with pens general conduct and bearing his letters to his mother at home had become of late very rare and short it was in vain that the fond widow urged how constant arthurs occupations and studies were and how many his engagements it is better that he should lose a prize laura said than forget his mother and indeed mamma i dont see that he gets many prizes why doesnt he come home and stay with you instead of passing his vacations at his great friends fine houses there is nobody there will love him half so much asas you do as i do only laura sighed out mrs pendennis laura declared stoutly that she did not love pen a bit when he did not do his duty to his mother nor would she be convinced by any of helens fond arguments that the boy must make his way in the world that his uncle was most desirous that pen should cultivate the acquaintance of persons who were likely to befriend him in life that men had a thousand ties and calls which women could not understand and so forth perhaps helen no more believed in these excuses than her adopted daughter did but she tried to believe that she believed them and comforted herself with the maternal infatuation and that is a point whereon i suppose many a gentleman has reflected that do what we will we are pretty sure of the womans love that once has been ours and that that untiring tenderness and forgiveness never fail us  also there had been that freedom not to say audacity in arthurs latter talk and ways which had shocked and displeased laura not that he ever offended her by rudeness or addressed to her a word which she ought not to hear for mr pen was a gentleman and by nature and education polite to every woman high and low but he spoke lightly and laxly of women in general was less courteous in his actions than in his wordsneglectful in sundry ways and in many of the little offices of life it offended miss laura that he should smoke his horrid pipes in the house that he should refuse to go to church with his mother or on walks or visits with her and be found yawning over his novel in his dressinggown when the gentle widow returned from those duties the hero of lauras early infancy about whom she had passed so many many nights talking with helen who recited endless stories of the boys virtues and love and bravery when he was away at school was a very different person from the young man whom now she knew bold and brilliant sarcastic and defiant seeming to scorn the simple occupations or pleasures or even devotions of the women with whom he lived and whom he quitted on such light pretexts  the fotheringay affair too when laura came to hear of it which she did first by some sarcastic allusions of major pendennis when on a visit to fairoaks and then from their neighbours at clavering who had plenty of information to give her on this head vastly shocked and outraged miss laura a pendennis fling himself away on such a woman as that helens boy galloping away from home day after day to fall on his knees to an actress and drink with her horrid father a good son want to bring such a man and such a woman into his house and set her over his mother i would have run away mamma i would if i had had to walk barefoot through the snow laura said  and you would have left me too then helen answered on which of course laura withdrew her previous observation and the two women rushed into each others embraces with that warmth which belonged to both their natures and which characterises not a few of their sex whence came all whence came all the indignation of miss laura about arthurs passion perhaps she did not know that if men throw themselves away upon women women throw themselves away upon men too and that there is no more accounting for love than for any other physical liking or antipathy perhaps she had been misinformed by the clavering people and old mrs portman who was vastly bitter against pen especially since his impertinent behaviour to the doctor and since the wretch had smoked cigars in churchtime perhaps finally she was jealous but this is a vice in which it is said the ladies very seldom indulge  albeit she was angry with pen against his mother she had no such feeling but devoted herself to helen with the utmost force of her girlish affectionsuch affection as women whose hearts are disengaged are apt to bestow upon the near female friend it was devotionit was passionit was all sorts of fondness and folly it was a profusion of caresses tender epithets and endearments such as it does not become sober historians with beards to narrate do not let us men despise these instincts because we cannot feel them these women were made for our comfort and delectation gentlemenwith all the rest of the minor animals  but as soon as miss laura heard that pen was unfortunate and unhappy all her wrath against him straightway vanished and gave place to the most tender and unreasonable compassion he was the pen of old days once more restored to her the frank and affectionate the generous and tenderhearted she at once took side with helen against doctor portman when he outcried at the enormity of pens transgressions debts what were his debts they were a trifle he had been thrown into expensive society by his uncles order and of course was obliged to live in the same manner as the young gentlemen whose company he frequented disgraced by not getting his degree the poor boy was ill when he went in for the examinations he couldnt think of his mathematics and stuff on account of those very debts which oppressed him very likely some of the odious tutors and masters were jealous of him and had favourites of their own whom they wanted to put over his head other people disliked him and were cruel to him and were unfair to him she was very sure and so with flushing cheeks and eyes bright with anger this young creature reasoned and she went up and seized helens hand and kissed her in the doctors presence and her looks braved the doctor and seemed to ask how he dared to say a word against her darling mothers pen  when that divine took his leave not a little discomfited and amazed at the pertinacious obstinacy of the women laura repeated her embraces and arguments with tenfold fervour to helen who felt that there was a great deal of cogency in most of the latter there must be some jealousy against pen she felt quite sure that he had offended some of the examiners who had taken a mean revenge of himnothing more likely altogether the announcement of the misfortune vexed these two ladies very little indeed pen who was plunged in his shame and grief in london and torn with great remorse for thinking of his mothers sorrow would have wondered had he seen how easily she bore the calamity indeed calamity is welcome to women if they think it will bring truant affection home again and if you have reduced your mistress to a crust depend upon it that she wont repine and only take a very little bit of it for herself provided you will eat the remainder in her company  and directly the doctor was gone laura ordered fires to be lighted in mr arthurs rooms and his bedding to be aired and had these preparations completed by the time helen had finished a most tender and affectionate letter to pen when the girl smiling fondly took her mamma by the hand and led her into those apartments where the fires were blazing so cheerfully and there the two kind creatures sate down on the bed and talked about pen ever so long laura added a postscript to helens letter in which she called him her dearest pen and bade him come home instantly with two of the handsomest dashes under the word and be happy with his mother and his affectionate sister laura  in the middle of the nightas these two ladies after reading their bibles a great deal during the evening and after taking just a look into pens room as they passed to their ownin the middle of the night i say laura whose head not unfrequently chose to occupy that pillow which the nightcap of the late pendennis had been accustomed to press cried out suddenly mamma are you awake  helen stirred and said yes im awake the truth is though she had been lying quite still and silent she had not been asleep one instant but had been looking at the nightlamp in the chimney and had been thinking of pen for hours and hours  then miss laura who had been acting with similar hypocrisy and lying occupied with her own thoughts as motionless as helens brooch with pens and lauras hair in it on the frilled white pincushion on the dressingtable began to tell mrs pendennis of a notable plan which she had been forming in her busy little brains and by which all pens embarrassments would be made to vanish in a moment and without the least trouble to anybody  you know mamma this young lady said that i have been living with you for ten years during which time you have never taken any of my money and have been treating me just as if i was a charity girl now this obligation has offended me very much because i am proud and do not like to be beholden to people and as if i had gone to schoolonly i wouldntit must have cost me at least fifty pounds a year it is clear that i owe you fifty times ten pounds which i know you have put in the bank at chatteris for me and which doesnt belong to me a bit now tomorrow we will go to chatteris and see that nice old mr rowdy with the bald head and ask him for itnot for his head but for the five hundred pounds and i dare say he will send you two more which we will save and pay back and we will send the money to pen who can pay all his debts without hurting anybody and then we will live happy ever after  what helen replied to this speech need not be repeated as the widows answer was made up of a great number of incoherent ejaculations embraces and other irrelative matter but the two women slept well after that talk and when the nightlamp went out with a splutter and the sun rose gloriously over the purple hills and the birds began to sing and pipe cheerfully amidst the leafless trees and glistening evergreens on fairoaks lawn helen woke too and as she looked at the sweet face of the girl sleeping beside her her lips parted with a smile blushes on her cheeks her spotless bosom heaving and falling with gentle undulations as if happy dreams were sweeping over itpens mother felt happy and grateful beyond all power of words save such as pious women offer up to the beneficent dispenser of love and mercyin whose honour a chorus of such praises is constantly rising up all round the world  although it was january and rather cold weather so sincere was mr pens remorse and so determined his plans of economy that he would not take an inside place in the coach but sate up behind with his friend the guard who remembered his former liberality and lent him plenty of greatcoats perhaps it was the cold that made his knees tremble as he got down at the lodgegate or it may be that he was agitated at the notion of seeing the kind creature for whose love he had made so selfish a return old john was in waiting to receive his masters baggage but he appeared in a fustian jacket and no longer wore his livery of drab and blue ise garner and stable man and lives in the ladge now this worthy man remarked with a grin of welcome to pen and something of a blush but instantly as pen turned the corner of the shrubbery and was out of eyeshot of the coach helen made her appearance her face beaming with love and forgivenessfor forgiving is what some women love best of all  we may be sure that the widow having a certain other object in view had lost no time in writing off to pen an account of the noble the magnanimous the magnificent offer of laura filling up her letter with a profusion of benedictions upon both her children it was probably the knowledge of this moneyobligation which caused pen to blush very much when he saw laura who was in waiting in the hall and who this time and for this time only broke through the little arrangement of which we have spoken as having subsisted between her and arthur for the last few years but the truth is there has been a great deal too much said about kissing in the present chapter  so the prodigal came home and the fatted calf was killed for him and he was made as happy as two simple women could make him no allusions were made to the oxbridge mishap or questions asked as to his farther proceedings for some time but pen debated these anxiously in his own mind and up in his own room where he passed much time in cogitation  a few days after he came home he rode to chatteris on his horse and came back on the top of the coach he then informed his mother that he had left the horse to be sold and when that operation was effected he handed her over the cheque which she and possibly pen himself thought was an act of uncommon virtue and selfdenial but which laura pronounced to be only strict justice  he rarely mentioned the loan which she had made and which indeed had been accepted by the widow with certain modifications but once or twice and with great hesitation and stammering he alluded to it and thanked her but it evidently pained his vanity to be beholden to the orphan for succour he was wild to find some means of repaying her  he left off drinking wine and betook himself but with great moderation to the refreshment of whiskyandwater he gave up cigarsmoking but it must be confessed that of late years he had liked pipes and tobacco as well or even better so that this sacrifice was not a very severe one  he fell asleep a great deal after dinner when he joined the ladies in the drawingroom and was certainly very moody and melancholy he watched the coaches with great interest walked in to read the papers at clavering assiduously dined with anybody who would ask him and the widow was glad that he should have any entertainment in their solitary place and played a good deal at cribbage with captain glanders  he avoided dr portman who in his turn whenever pen passed gave him very severe looks from under his shovelhat he went to church with his mother however very regularly and read prayers for her at home to the little household always humble it was greatly diminished now a couple of maids did the work of the house of fairoaks the silver dishcovers never saw the light at all  john put on his livery to go to church and assert his dignity on sundays but it was only for forms sake he was gardener and outdoor man vice upton resigned there was but little fire in fairoaks kitchen and john and the maids drank their evening beer there by the light of a single candle all this was mr pens doing and the state of things did not increas his cheerfulness  for some time pen said no power on earth could induce him to go back to oxbridge again after his failure there but one day laura said to him with many blushes that she thought as some sort of reparation of punishment on himself for hisfor his idleness he ought to go back and get his degree if he could fetch it by doing so and so back mr pen went  a plucked man is a dismal being in a university belonging to no set of men there and owned by no one pen felt himself plucked indeed of all the fine feathers which he had won during his brilliant years and rarely appeared out of his college regularly going to morning chapel and shutting himself up in his rooms of nights away from the noise and suppers of the undergraduates there were no duns about his door they were all paidscarcely any cards were left there the men of his year had taken their degrees and were gone he went into a second examination and passed with perfect ease he was somewhat more easy in his mind when he appeared in his bachelors gown  on his way back from oxbridge he paid a visit to his uncle in london but the old gentleman received him with very cold looks and would scarcely give him his forefinger to shake he called a second time but morgan the valet said his master was from home  pen came back to fairoaks and to his books and to his idleness and loneliness and despair he commenced several tragedies and wrote many copies of verses of a gloomy cast he formed plans of reading and broke them he thought about enlistingabout the spanish legionabout a profession he chafed against his captivity and cursed the idleness which had caused it helen said he was breaking his heart and was sad to see his prostration as soon as they could afford it he should go abroadhe should go to londonhe should be freed from the dull society of two poor women it was dullvery certainly the tender widows habitual melancholy seemed to deepen into a sadder gloom and laura saw with alarm that the dear friend became every year more languid and weary and that her pale cheek grew more wan     chapter xxiii new faces   the inmates of fairoaks were drowsily pursuing this humdrum existence while the great house upon the hill on the other side of the river brawl was shaking off the slumber in which it had lain during the lives of two generations of masters and giving extraordinary signs of renewed liveliness  just about the time of pens little mishap and when he was so absorbed in the grief occasioned by that calamity as to take no notice of events which befell persons less interesting to himself than arthur pendennis an announcement appeared in the provincial journals which caused no small sensation in the county at least and in all the towns villages halls and mansions and parsonages for many miles round clavering park at clavering market at cackleby fair at chatteris sessions on gooseberry green as the squires carriage met the vicars onehorse contrivance and the inmates of both vehicles stopped on the road to talk at tinkleton church gate as the bell was tolling in the sunshine and the white smocks and scarlet cloaks came trooping over the green common to sunday worship in a hundred societies round aboutthe word was that clavering park was to be inhabited again  some five years before the county papers had advertised the marriage at florence at the british legation of francis clavering esq only son of sir francis clavering bart of clavering park with jemima augusta daughter of samuel snell of calcutta esq and widow of the late j amory esq at that time the legend in the county was that clavering who had been ruined for many a year had married a widow from india with some money some of the county folks caught a sight of the newlymarried pair the kickleburys travelling in italy had seen them clavering occupied the poggi palace at florence gave parties and lived comfortablybut could never come to england another yearyoung peregrine of cackleby making a long vacation tour had fallen in with the claverings occupying schloss schinkenstein on the mummel see at rome at lucca at nice at the baths and gambling places of the rhine and belgium this worthy couple might occasionally be heard of by the curious and rumours of them came as it were by gusts to claverings ancestral place  their last place of abode was paris where they appear to have lived in great fashion and splendour after the news of the death of samuel snell esq of calcutta reached his orphan daughter in europe  of sir francis claverings antecedents little can be said that would be advantageous to that respected baronet the son of an outlaw living in a dismal old chateau near bruges this gentleman had made a feeble attempt to start in life with a commission in a dragoon regiment and had broken down almost at the outset transactions at the gamblingtable had speedily effected his ruin after a couple of years in the army he had been forced to sell out had passed some time in her majestys prison of the fleet and had then shipped over to ostend to join the gouty exile his father and in belgium france and germany for some years this decayed and abortive prodigal might be seen lurking about billiardrooms and wateringplaces punting at gamblinghouses dancing at boardinghouse balls and riding steeplechases on other folks horses  it was at a boardinghouse at lausanne that francis clavering made what he called the lucky coup of marrying the widow amory very lately returned from calcutta his father died soon after by consequence of whose demise his wife became lady clavering the title so delighted mr snell of calcutta that he doubled his daughters allowance and dying himself soon after left a fortune to her and her children the amount of which was if not magnified by rumour something very splendid indeed  before this time there had been not rumours unfavourable to lady claverings reputation but unpleasant impressions regarding her ladyship the best english people abroad were shy of making her acquaintance her manners were not the most refined her origin was lamentably low and doubtful the retired east indians who are to be found in considerable force in most of the continental towns frequented by english spoke with much scorn of the disreputable old lawyer and indigosmuggler her father and of amory her first husband who had been mate of the indiaman in which miss snell came out to join her father at calcutta neither father nor daughter were in society at calcutta or had ever been heard of at government house old sir jasper rogers who had been chief justice of calcutta had once said to his wife that he could tell a queer story about lady claverings first husband but greatly to lady rogerss disappointment and that of the young ladies his daughters the old judge could never be got to reveal that mystery  they were all however glad enough to go to lady claverings parties when her ladyship took the hotel bouilli in the rue grenelle at paris and blazed out in the polite world there in the winter of 183 the faubourg st germain took her up viscount bagwig our excellent ambassador paid her marked attention the princes of the family frequented her salons the most rigid and noted of the english ladies resident in the french capital acknowledged and countenanced her the virtuous lady elderbury the severe lady rockminster the venerable countess of southdownpeople in a word renowned for austerity and of quite a dazzling moral purityso great and beneficent an influence had the possession of ten some said twenty thousand a year exercised upon lady claverings character and reputation and her munificence and goodwill were unbounded anybody in society who had a scheme of charity was sure to find her purse open the french ladies of piety got money from her to support their schools and convents she subscribed indifferently for the armenian patriarch for father barbarossa who came to europe to collect funds for his monastery on mount athos for the baptist mission to quashyboo and the orthodox settlement in feefawfoo the largest and most savage of the cannibal islands and it is on record of her that on the same day on which madame de cricri got five napoleons from her in support of the poor persecuted jesuits who were at that time in very bad odour in france lady budelight put her down in her subscriptionlist for the rev j ramshorn who had had a vision which ordered him to convert the pope of rome and more than this and for the benefit of the worldly her ladyship gave the best dinners and the grandest balls and suppers which were known at paris during that season  and it was during this time that the goodnatured lady must have arranged matters with her husbands creditors in england for sir francis reappeared in his native country without fear of arrest was announced in the morning post and the county paper as having taken up his residence at mivarts hotel and one day the anxious old housekeeper at clavering house beheld a carriage and four horses drive up the long avenue and stop before the mossgrown steps in front of the vast melancholy portico  three gentlemen were in the carriagean open one on the back seat was our old acquaintance mr tatham of chatteris whilst in the places of honour sate a handsome and portly gentleman enveloped in mustachios whiskers fur collars and braiding and by him a pale languid man who descended feebly from the carriage when the little lawyer and the gentleman in fur nimbly jumped out of it  they walked up the great mossgrown steps to the halldoor and a foreign attendant with earrings and a goldlaced cap pulled strenuously at the great bellhandle at the cracked and sculptured gate the bell was heard clanging loudly through the vast gloomy mansion steps resounded presently upon the marble pavement of the hall within and the doors opened and finally mrs blenkinsop the housekeeper polly her aidedecamp and smart the keeper appeared bowing humbly  smart the keeper pulled the wisp of haycoloured hair which adorned his sunburnt forehead kicked out his left heel as if there were a dog biting at his calves and brought down his head to a bow old mrs blenkinsop dropped a curtsey little polly her aidedecamp made a curtsey and several rapid bows likewise and mrs blenkinsop with a great deal of emotion quavered out welcome to clavering sir francis it du my poor eyes good to see one of the family once more  the speech and the greetings were all addressed to the grand gentleman in fur and braiding who wore his hat so magnificently on one side and twirled his mustachios so royally but he burst out laughing and said youve saddled the wrong horse old ladyim not sir francis clavering whats come to revisit the halls of my ancestors friends and vassals behold your rightful lord  and he pointed his hand towards the pale languid gentleman who said dont be an ass ned  yes mrs blenkinsop im sir francis clavering i recollect you quite well forgot me i supposehow dy do and he took the old ladys trembling hand and nodded in her astonished face in a not unkind manner  mrs blenkinsop declared upon her conscience that she would have known sir francis anywhere that he was the very image of sir francis his father and of sir john who had gone before  o yesthankyof coursevery much obligedand that sort of thing sir francis said looking vacantly about the hall dismal old place aint it ned never saw it but once when my governor quarrelled with gwandfather in the year twentythwee  dismalbeautifulthe castle of otrantothe mysteries of udolpho by jove said the individual addressed as ned what a fireplace you might roast an elephant in it splendid carved gallery inigo jones by jove id lay five to two its inigo

baronet gad ned you know everything  i know a few things frank ned answered i know thats not a snyders over the mantelpiecebet you three to one its a copy well restore it my boy a lick of varnish and it will come out wonderfully sir that old fellow in the red gown i suppose is sir richard  sheriff of the county and sate in parliament in the reign of queen anne said the housekeeper wondering at the strangers knowledge that on the right is theodosia wife of harbottle second baronet by lely represented in the character of venus the goddess of beautyher son gregory the third baronet by her side as cupid god of love with a bow and arrows that on the next panel is sir rupert made a knight banneret by charles the first and whose property was confuscated by oliver cromwell  thank youneednt go on mrs blenkinsop said the baronet well walk about the place ourselves frosch give me a cigar have a cigar mr tatham  little mr tatham tried a cigar which sir franciss courier handed to him and over which the lawyer spluttered fearfully neednt come with us mrs blenkinsop whatshisnameyousmartfeed the horses and wash their mouths shant stay long come along strongi know the way i was here in twentythwee at the end of my gwandfathers time and sir francis and captain strong for such was the style and title of sir franciss friend passed out of the hall into the receptionrooms leaving the discomfited mrs blenkinsop to disappear by a sidedoor which led to her apartments now the only habitable rooms in the longuninhabited mansion  it was a place so big that no tenant could afford to live in it and sir francis and his friend walked through room after room admiring their vastness and dreary and deserted grandeur on the right of the halldoor were the saloons and drawingrooms and on the other side the oak room the parlour the grand diningroom the library where pen had found books in old days round three sides of the hall ran a gallery by which and corresponding passages the chief bedrooms were approached and of which many were of stately proportions and exhibited marks of splendour on the second story was a labyrinth of little discomfortable garrets destined for the attendants of the great folks who inhabited the mansion in the days when it was first built and i do not know any more cheering mark of the increased philanthropy of our own times than to contrast our domestic architecture with that of our ancestors and to see how much better servants and poor are cared for now than in times when my lord and my lady slept under gold canopies and their servants lay above them in quarters not so airy or so clean as stables are now  up and down the house the two gentlemen wandered the owner of the mansion being very silent and resigned about the pleasure of possessing it whereas the captain his friend examined the premises with so much interest and eagerness that you would have thought he was the master and the other the indifferent spectator of the place i see capabilities in itcapabilities in it sir cried the captain gad sir leave it to me and ill make it the pride of the country at a small expense what a theatre we can have in the library here the curtains between the columns which divide the room what a famous room for a galopit will hold the whole shire well hang the morning parlour with the tapestry in your second salon in the rue de grenelle and furnish the oak room with the moyenage cabinets and the armour armour looks splendid against black oak and theres a venice glass in the quai voltaire which will suit that high mantelpiece to an inch sir the long saloon white and crimson of course the drawingroom yellow satin and the little drawingroom light blue with lace overhay  i recollect my old governor caning me in that little room sir francis said sententiously he always hated me my old governor  chintz is the dodge i suppose for my ladys roomsthe suite in the landing to the south the bedroom the sittingroom and the dressingroom well throw a conservatory out over the balcony where will you have your rooms  put mine in the north wing said the baronet with a yawn and out of the reach of miss amorys confounded piano i cant bear it shes scweeching from morning till night  the captain burst out laughing he settled the whole further arrangements of the house in the course of their walk through it and the promenade ended they went into the stewards room now inhabited by mrs blenkinsop and where mr tatham was sitting poring over a plan of the estate and the old housekeeper had prepared a collation in honour of her lord and master  then they inspected the kitchen and stables about both of which sir francis was rather interested and captain strong was for examining the gardens but the baronet said d the gardens and that sort of thing and finally he drove away from the house as unconcernedly as he had entered it and that night the people of clavering learned that sir francis clavering had paid a visit to the park and was coming to live in the county  when this fact came to be known at chatteris all the folks in the place were set in commotion high church and low church halfpay captains and old maids and dowagers sporting squireens of the viciniage farmers tradesmen and factory peopleall the population in and round about the little place the news was brought to fairoaks and received by the ladies there and by mr pen with some excitement mrs pybus says there is a very pretty girl in the family arthur laura said who was as kind and thoughtful upon this point as women generally are a miss amory lady claverings daughter by her first marriage of course you will fall in love with her as soon as she arrives  helen cried out dont talk nonsense laura pen laughed and said well there is the young sir francis for you  he is but four years old miss laura replied but i shall console myself with that handsome officer sir franciss friend he was at church last sunday in the clavering pew and his mustachios were beautiful  indeed the number of sir franciss family whereof the members have all been mentioned in the above paragraphs was pretty soon known in his town and everything else as nearly as human industry and ingenuity could calculate regarding his household the park avenue and grounds were dotted now with town folks of the summer evenings who made their way up to the great house peered about the premises and criticised the improvements which were taking place there loads upon loads of furniture arrived in numberless vans from chatteris and london and numerous as the vans are there was not one but captain glanders knew what it contained and escorted the baggage up to the park house  he and captain edward strong had formed an intimate acquaintance by this time the younger captain occupied those very lodgings at clavering which the peaceful smirke had previously tenanted and was deep in the good graces of madame fribsby his landlady and of the whole town indeed the captain was splendid in person and raiment freshcoloured blueeyed blackwhiskered broadchested athletica slight tendency to fulness did not take away from the comeliness of his jolly figurea braver soldier never presented a broader chest to the enemy as he strode down clavering high street his hat on one side his cane clanking on the pavement or waving round him in the execution of military cuts and soldatesque manoeuvreshis jolly laughter ringing through the otherwise silent streethe was as welcome as sunshine to the place and a comfort to every inhabitant in it  on the first marketday he knew every pretty girl in the market he joked with all the women had a word with the farmers about their stock and dined at the agricultural ordinary at the clavering arms where he set them all dying with laughing by his fun and jokes tu be sure he be a vine veller tu be sure that he be was the universal opinion of the gentlemen in topboots he shook hands with a score of them as they rode out of the innyard on their old nags waving his hat to them splendidly as he smoked his cigar in the inngate in the course of the evening he was free of the landladys bar knew what rent the landlord paid how many acres he farmed how much malt he put in his strong beer and whether he ever ran in a little brandy unexcised by kings from baymouth or the fishing villages along the coast  he had tried to live at the great house first but it was so dull he couldnt stand it i am a creature born for society he told captain glanders im down here to see claverings house set in order for between ourselves frank has no energy sir no energy hes not the chest for it sir and he threw out his own trunk as he spoke but i must have social intercourse old mrs blenkinsop goes to bed at seven and takes polly with her there was nobody but me and the ghost for the first two nights at the great house and i own it sir i like company most old soldiers do  glanders asked strong where he had served captain strong curled his mustache and said with a laugh that the other might almost ask where he had not served i began sir as cadet of hungarian uhlans and when the war of greek independence broke out quitted that service in consequence of a quarrel with my governor and was one of seven who escaped from missolonghi and was blown up in one of botzariss fireships at the age of seventeen ill show you my cross of the redeemer if youll come over to my lodgings and take a glass of grog with me captain this evening ive a few of those baubles in my desk ive the white eagle of poland skrzynecki gave it me he pronounced skrzyneckis name with wonderful accuracy and gusto upon the field of ostrolenka i was a lieutenant of the fourth regiment sir and we marched through diebitschs linesbang thro em into prussia sir without firing a shot ah captain that was a mismanaged business i received this wound by the side of the king before oportowhere he would have pounded the stockjobbing pedroites had bourmont followed my advice and i served in spain with the kings troops until the death of my dear friend zumalacarreguy when i saw the game was over and hung up my toasting iron captain alava offered me a regiment the queens muleteros but i couldntdamme i couldntand now sir you know ned strongthe chevalier strong they call me abroadas well as he knows himself  in this way almost everybody in clavering came to know ned strong he told madame fribsby he told the landlord of the george he told baker at the readingrooms he told mrs glanders and the young ones at dinner and finally he told mr arthur pendennis who yawning into clavering one day found the chevalier strong in company with captain glanders and who was delighted with his new acquaintance  before many days were over captain strong was as much at home in helens drawingroom as he was in madame fribsbys first floor and made the lonely house very gay with his goodhumour and ceaseless flow of talk the two women had never before seen such a man he had a thousand stories about battles and dangers to interest themabout greek captives polish beauties and spanish nuns he could sing scores of songs in half a dozen languages and would sit down to the piano and troll them off in a rich manly voice both the ladies pronounced him to be delightfuland so he was though indeed they had not had much choice of mans society as yet having seen in the course of their lives but few persons except old portman and the major and mr pen who was a genius to be sure but then your geniuses are somewhat flat and moody at home  and captain strong acquainted his new friends at fairoaks not only with his own biography but with the whole history of the family now coming to clavering it was he who had made the marriage between his friend frank and the widow amory she wanted rank and he wanted money what match could be more suitable he organised it he made those two people happy there was no particular romantic attachment between them the widow was not of an age or a person for romance and sir francis if he had his game at billiards and his dinner cared for little besides but they were as happy as people could be clavering would return to his native place and country his wifes fortune would pay his encumbrances off and his son and heir would be one of the first men in the county  and miss amory laura asked laura was uncommonly curious about miss amory  strong laughed oh miss amory is a musemiss amory is a mysterymiss amory is a femme incomprise what is that asked simple mrs pendennisbut the chevalier gave her no answer perhaps could not give her one miss amory paints miss amory writes poems miss amory composes music miss amory rides like diana vernon miss amory is a paragon in a word  i hate clever women said pen  thank you said laura for her part she was sure she should be charmed with miss amory and quite longed to have such a friend and with this she looked pen full in the face as if every word the little hypocrite said was gospel truth  thus an intimacy was arranged and prepared beforehand between the fairoaks family and their wealthy neighbours at the park and pen and laura were to the full as eager for their arrival as even the most curious of the clavering folks a londoner who sees fresh faces and yawns at them every day may smile at the eagerness with which country people expect a visitor a cockney comes amongst them and is remembered by his rural entertainers for years after he has left them and forgotten them very likelyfloated far away from them on the vast london sea but the islanders remember long after the mariner has sailed away and can tell you what he said and what he wore and how he looked and how he laughed in fine a new arrival is an event in the country not to be understood by us who dont and had rather not know who lives next door  when the painters and upholsterers had done their work in the house and so beautified it under captain strongs superintendence that he might well be proud of his taste that gentleman announced that he should go to london where the whole family had arrived by this time and should speedily return to establish them in their renovated mansion  detachments of domestics preceded them carriages came down by sea and were brought over from baymouth by horses which had previously arrived under the care of grooms and coachmen one day the alacrity coach brought down on its roof two large and melancholy men who were dropped at the park lodge with their trunks and who were messieurs frederic and james metropolitan footmen who had no objection to the country and brought with them state and other suits of the clavering uniform  on another day the mail deposited at the gate a foreign gentleman adorned with many ringlets and chains he made a great riot at the lodgegate to the keepers wife who being a westcountry woman did not understand his english or his gascon french because there was no carriage in waiting to drive him to the house a mile off and because he could not walk entire leagues in his fatigued state and varnished boots this was monsieur alcide mirobolant formerly chef of his highness the duc de borodino of h eminence cardinal beccafico and at present chef of the bouche of sir clavering baronetmonsieur mirobolants library pictures and piano had arrived previously in charge of the intelligent young englishman his aidedecamp he was moreover aided by a professed female cook likewise from london who had inferior females under her orders  he did not dine in the stewards room but took his nutriment in solitude in his own apartments where a female servant was affected to his private use it was a grand sight to behold him in his dressinggown composing a menu he always sate down and played the piano for some time before that if interrupted he remonstrated pathetically with his little maid every great artist he said had need of solitude to perfectionate his works  but we are advancing matters in the fulness of our love and respect for monsieur mirobolant and bringing him prematurely on the stage  the chevalier strong had a hand in the engagement of all the london domestics and indeed seemed to be the master of the house there were those among them who said he was the housesteward only he dined with the family howbeit he knew how to make himself respected and two of by no means the least comfortable rooms of the house were assigned to his particular use  he was walking upon the terrace finally upon the eventful day when amidst an immense jangling of bells from clavering church where the flag was flying an open carriage and one of those travelling chariots or family arks which only english philoprogenitiveness could invent drove rapidly with foaming horses through the park gates and up to the steps of the hall the two battans of the sculptured door flew open the superior officers in black the large and melancholy gentlemen now in livery with their hair in powder the country menials engaged to aid them were in waiting in the hall and bowed like elms when autumn winds wail in the park through this avenue passed sir francis clavering with a most unmoved face lady clavering with a pair of bright black eyes and a goodhumoured countenance which waggled and nodded very graciously master francis clavering who was holding his mammas skirt and who stopped the procession to look at the largest footman whose appearance seemed to strike the young gentleman and miss blandy governess to master francis and miss amory her ladyships daughter giving her arm to captain strong it was summer but fires of welcome were crackling in the great hall chimney and in the rooms which the family were to occupy  monsieur mirobolant had looked at the procession from one of the limetrees in the avenue elle est la he said laying his jewelled hand on his richlyembroidered velvet glass buttons je tai vue je te benis o ma sylphide o mon ange and he dived into the thicket and made his way back to his furnaces and saucepans  the next sunday the same party which had just made its appearance at clavering park came and publicly took possession of the ancient pew in the church where so many of the baronets ancestors had prayed and were now kneeling in effigy there was such a run to see the new folks that the low church was deserted to the disgust of its pastor and as the state barouche with the greys and coachman in silver wig and solemn footmen drew up at the old churchyardgate there was such a crowd assembled there as had not been seen for many a long day captain strong knew everybody and saluted for all the companythe country people vowed my lady was not handsome to be sure but pronounced her to be uncommon fine dressed as indeed she waswith the finest of shawls the finest of pelisses the brilliantest of bonnets and wreaths and a power of rings cameos brooches chains bangles and other nameless gimcracks and ribbons of every breadth and colour of the rainbow flaming on her person miss amory appeared meek in dovecolour like a vestal virginwhile master francis was in the costume then prevalent of rob roy macgregor a celebrated highland outlaw the baronet was not more animated than ordinarilythere was a happy vacuity about him which enabled him to face a dinner a death a church a marriage with the same indifferent ease  a pew for the clavering servants was filled by these domestics and the enraptured congregation saw the gentlemen from london with vlower on their heeds and the miraculous coachman with his silver wig take their places in that pew so soon as his horses were put up at the clavering arms  in the course of the service master francis began to make such a yelling in the pew that frederic the tallest of the footmen was beckoned by his master and rose and went and carried out master francis who roared and beat him on the head so that the powder flew round about like clouds of incense nor was he pacified until placed on the box of the carriage where he played at horses with johns whip  you see the little beggars never been to church before miss bell the baronet drawled out to a young lady who was visiting him no wonder he should make a row i dont go in town neither but i think its right in the country to give a good exampleand that sort of thing  miss bell laughed and said the little boy had not given a particularly good example  gad i dont know and that sort of thing said the baronet it aint so bad neither whenever he wants a thing frank always cwies and whenever he cwies he gets it  here the child in question began to howl for a dish of sweetmeats on the luncheontable and making a lunge across the tablecloth upset a glass of wine over the best waistcoat of one of the guests present mr arthur pendennis who was greatly annoyed at being made to look foolish and at having his spotless cambric shirt front blotched with wine  we do spoil him so said lady clavering to mrs pendennis finally gazing at the cherub whose hands and face were now frothed over with the species of lather which is inserted in the confection called meringues a la creme  it is very wrong said mrs pendennis as if she had never done such a thing herself as spoil a child  mamma says she spoils my brotherdo you think anything could miss bell look at himisnt he like a little angel  gad i was quite wight said the baronet he has cwied and he has got it you see go it fwank old boy  sir francis is a very judicious parent miss amory whispered dont you think so miss bell i shant call you miss belli shall call you laura i admired you so at church your robe was not well made nor your bonnet very fresh but you have such beautiful grey eyes and such a lovely tint  thank you said miss bell laughing  your cousin is handsome and thinks so he is uneasy de sa personne he has not seen the world yet has he genius has he suffered a lady a little woman in a rumpled satin and velvet shoesa miss pybuscame here and said he has suffered i too have sufferedand you laura has your heart ever been touched  laura said no but perhaps blushed a little at the idea or the question so that the other said  ah laura i see it all it is the beau cousin tell me everything i already love you as a sister  you are very kind said miss bell smiling andand it must be owned that it is a very sudden attachment  all attachments are so it is electricityspontaneity it is instantaneous i knew i should love you from the moment i saw you do you not feel it yourself  not yet said laura buti daresay i shall if i try  call me by my name then  but i dont know it laura cried out  my name is blancheisnt it a pretty name call me by it  blancheit is very pretty indeed  and while mamma talks with that kindlooking ladywhat relation is she to you she must have been pretty once but is rather passee she is not well gantee but she has a pretty handand while mamma talks to her come with me to my own roommy own own room its a darling room though that horrid creature captain strong did arrange it are you eprise of him he says you are but i know better it is the beau cousin yesil a de beaux yeux je naime pas les blonds ordinairement car je suis blonde moije suis blanche et blondeand she looked at her face and made a moue in the glass and never stopped for lauras answer to the questions which she had put  blanche was fair and like a sylph she had fair hair with green reflections in it but she had dark eyebrows she had long black eyelashes which veiled beautiful brown eyes she had such a slim waist that it was a wonder to behold and such a slim little feet that you would have thought the grass would hardly bend under them her lips were of the colour of faint rosebuds and her voice warbled limpidly over a set of the sweetest little pearly teeth ever seen she showed them very often for they were very pretty she was very goodnatured and a smile not only showed her teeth wonderfully but likewise exhibited two lovely little pink dimples that nestled in either cheek  she showed laura her drawings which the other thought charming she played her some of her waltzes with a rapid and brilliant finger and laura was still more charmed and she then read her some poems in french and english likewise of her own composition and which she kept locked in her own bookher own dear little book it was bound in blue velvet with a gilt lock and on it was printed in gold the title of mes larmes  mes larmesisnt it a pretty name the young lady continued who was pleased with everything that she did and did everything very well laura owned that it was she had never seen anything like it before anything so lovely so accomplished so fragile and pretty warbling so prettily and tripping about such a pretty room with such a number of pretty books pictures flowers round about her the honest and generous country girl forgot even jealousy in her admiration indeed blanche she said everything in the room is pretty and you are the prettiest of all the other smiled looked in the glass went up and took both of lauras hands and kissed them and sat down to the piano and shook out a little song as if she had been a nightingale  this was the first visit paid by fairoaks to clavering park in return for clavering parks visit to fairoaks in reply to fairoakss cards left a few days after the arrival of sir franciss family the intimacy between the young ladies sprang up like jacks beanstalk to the skies in a single night the large footmen were perpetually walking with little rosecoloured pink notes to fairoaks where there was a pretty housemaid in the kitchen who might possibly tempt those gentlemen to so humble a place miss amory sent music or miss amory sent a new novel or a picture from the journal des modes to laura or my ladys compliments arrived with flowers and fruit or miss amory begged and prayed miss bell to come to dinner and dear mrs pendennis if she was strong enough and mr arthur if a humdrum party were not too stupid for him and would send a ponycarriage for mrs pendennis and would take no denial  neither arthur nor laura wished to refuse and helen who was indeed somewhat ailing was glad that the two should have their pleasure and would look at them fondly as they set forth and ask in her heart that she might not be called away until those two beings whom she loved best in the world should be joined together as they went out and crossed over the bridge she remembered summer evenings fiveandtwenty years ago when she too had bloomed in her brief prime of love and happiness it was all over now the moon was looking from the purpling sky and the stars glittering there just as they used in the early wellremembered evenings he was lying dead far away with the billows rolling between them good god how well she remembered the last look of his face as they parted it looked out at her through the vista of long years as sad and as clear as then  so mr pen and miss laura found the society at clavering park an uncommonly agreeable resort of summer evenings blanche vowed that she raffoled of laura and very likely mr pen was pleased with blanche his spirits came back he laughed and rattled till laura wondered to hear him it was not the same pen yawning in a shooting jacket in the fairoaks parlour who appeared alert and brisk and smiling and well dressed in lady claverings drawingroom sometimes they had music laura had a sweet contralto voice and sang with blanche who had had the best continental instruction and was charmed to be her friends mistress sometimes mr pen joined in these concerts or oftener looked sweet upon miss blanche as she sang sometimes they had glees when captain strongs chest was of vast service and he boomed out in a prodigious bass of which he was not a little proud  good fellow strongaint he miss bell sir francis would say to her plays at ecarte with lady claveringplays anything pitchandtoss pianoforty cwibbage if you like how long do you think hes been staying with me he came for a week with a carpetbag and gad hes been staying here thwee years good fellow aint he dont know how he gets a shillin though begad i dont miss lauwa  and yet the chevalier if he lost his money to lady clavering always paid it and if he lived with his friend for three years paid for that tooin goodhumour in kindness and joviality in a thousand little services by which he made himself agreeable what gentleman could want a better friend than a man who was always in spirits never in the way or out of it and was ready to execute any commission for his patron whether it was to sing a song or meet a lawyer to fight a duel or to carve a capon  although laura and pen commonly went to clavering park together yet sometimes mr pen took walks there unattended by her and about which he did not tell her he took to fishing the brawl which runs through the park and passes not very far from the gardenwall and by the oddest coincidence miss amory would walk out having been to look at her flowers and would be quite surprised to see mr pendennis fishing  i wonder what trout pen caught while the young lady was looking on or whether miss blanche was the pretty little fish which played round his fly and which mr pen was endeavouring to hook it must be owned he became very fond of that healthful and invigorating pursuit of angling and was whipping the brawl continually with his fly  as for miss blanche she had a kind heart and having as she owned herself suffered a good deal in the course of her brief life and experiencewhy she could compassionate other susceptible beings like pen who had suffered too her love for laura and that dear mrs pendennis redoubled if they were not at the park she was not easy unless she herself was at fairoaks she played with laura she read french and german with laura and mr pen read french and german along with them he turned sentimental ballads of schiller and goethe into english verse for the ladies and blanche unlocked mes larmes for him and imparted to him some of the plaintive outpourings of her own tender muse  it appeared from these poems that this young creature had indeed suffered prodigiously she was familiar with the idea of suicide death she repeatedly longed for a faded rose inspired her with such grief that you would have thought she must die in pain of it it was a wonder how a young creature who had had a snug home or been at a comfortable boardingschool and had no outward grief or hardship to complain of should have suffered so muchshould have found the means of getting at such an ocean of despair and passion as a runaway boy who will get to sea and having embarked on it should survive it what a talent she must have had for weeping to be able to pour out so many of mes larmes  they were not particularly briny miss blanches tears that is the truth but pen who read her verses thought them very well for a ladyand wrote some verses himself for her his were very violent and passionate very hot sweet and strong and he not only wrote verses buto the villain o the deceiver he altered and adapted former poems in his possession and which had been composed for a certain emily fotheringay for the use and to the christian name of miss blanche amory     chapter xxiv a little innocent   every house has its skeleton in it somewhere and it may be a comfort to some unhappy folks to think that the luckier and most wealthy of their neighbours have their miseries and causes of disquiet our little innocent muse of blanche who sang so nicely and talked so sweetly you would have thought she must have made sunshine where ever she went was the skeleton or the misery or the bore or the nemesis of clavering house and of most of the inhabitants thereof as one little stone in your own shoe or your horses suffices to put either to torture and to make your journey miserable so in life a little obstacle is sufficient to obstruct your entire progress and subject you to endless annoyance and disquiet who would have guessed that such a smiling little fairy as blanche amory could be the cause of discord in any family  i say strong one day the baronet said as the pair were conversing after dinner over the billiardtable and that great unbosomer of secrets a cigar i say strong i wish to the doose your wife was dead  so do i thats a cannon by jove but she wont shell live for everyou see if she dont why do you wish her off the hooks frank my boy asked captain strong  because then you might marry missy she aint badlooking shell have ten thousand and thats a good bit of money for such a poor old devil as you drawled out the other gentleman  and gad strong i hate her worse and worse every day i cant stand her strong by gad i cant  i wouldnt take her at twice the figure captain strong said laughing i never saw such a little devil in my life  i should like to poison her said the sententious baronet by jove i should  why what has she been at now asked his friend  nothing particular answered sir francis only her old tricks that girl has such a knack of making everybody miserable that hang me its quite surprising last night she sent the governess crying away from the dinnertable afterwards as i was passing franks room i heard the poor little beggar howling in the dark and found his sister had been frightening his soul out of his body by telling him stories about the ghost thats in the house at lunch she gave my lady a turn and though my wifes a fool shes a good soulim hanged if she aint  what did missy do to her strong asked  why hang me if she didnt begin talking about the late amory my predecessor the baronet said with a grin she got some picture out of the keepsake and said she was sure it was like her dear father she wanted to know where her fathers grave was hang her father whenever miss amory talks about him lady clavering always bursts out crying and the little devil will talk about him in order to spite her mother today when she began i got in a confounded rage said i was her father andand that sort of thing and then sir she took a shy at me  and what did she say about you frank mr strong still laughing inquired of his friend and patron  gad she said i wasnt her father that i wasnt fit to comprehend her that her father must have been a man of genius and fine feelings and that sort of thing whereas i had married her mother for money  well didnt you asked strong  it dont make it any the pleasanter to hear because its true dont you know sir francis clavering answered i aint a literary man and that but i aint such a fool as she makes me out i dont know how it is but she always manages to put me in the hole dont you understand she turns all the house round her in her quiet way and with her confounded sentimental airs i wish she was dead ned  it was my wife whom you wanted dead just now strong said always in perfect goodhumour upon which the baron with his accustomed candour said well when people bore my life out i do wish they were dead and i wish missy were down a well with all my heart  thus it will be seen from the above report of this candid conversation that our accomplished little friend had some peculiarities or defects of character which rendered her not very popular she was a young lady of some genius exquisite sympathies and considerable literary attainments living like many another genius with relatives who could not comprehend her neither her mother nor her stepfather were persons of a literary turn bells life and the racing calendar were the extent of the baronets reading and lady clavering still wrote like a schoolgirl of thirteen and with an extraordinary disregard to grammar and spelling and as miss amory felt very keenly that she was not appreciated and that she lived with persons who were not her equals in intellect or conversational power she lost no opportunity to acquaint her family circle with their inferiority to herself and not only was a martyr but took care to let everybody know that she was so if she suffered as she said and thought she did severely are we to wonder that a young creature of such delicate sensibilities should shriek and cry out a good deal without sympathy life is nothing and would it not have been a want of candour on her part to affect a cheerfulness which she did not feel or pretend a respect for those towards whom it was quite impossible she should entertain any reverence if a poetess may not bemoan her lot of what earthly use is her lyre blanche struck hers only to the saddest of tunes and sang elegies over her dead hopes dirges over her early frostnipt buds of affection as became such a melancholy fate and muse  her actual distresses as we have said had not been up to the present time very considerable but her griefs lay like those of most of us in her own soulthat being sad and habitually dissatisfied what wonder that she should weep so mes larmes dribbled out of her eyes any day at command she could furnish an unlimited supply of tears and her faculty of shedding them increased by practice for sentiment is like another complaint mentioned by horace as increasing by selfindulgence i am sorry to say ladies that the complaint in question is called the dropsy and the more you cry the more you will be able and desirous to do so  missy had begun to gush at a very early age lamartine was her favourite bard from the period when she first could feel and she had subsequently improved her mind by a sedulous study of novels of the great modern authors of the french language there was not a romance of balzac and george sand which the indefatigable little creature had not devouredby the time she was sixteen and however little she sympathised with her relatives at home she had friends as she said in the spiritworld meaning the tender indiana the passionate and poetic lelia the amiable trenmor that highsouled convict that angel of the galleysthe fiery stenioand the other numberless heroes of the french romances she had been in love with prince rodolph and prince djalma while she was yet at school and had settled the divorce question and the rights of woman with indiana before she had left off pinafores the impetuous little lady played at love with these imaginary worthies as a little while before she had played at maternity with her doll pretty little poetical spirits it is curious to watch them with those playthings today the blueeyed one is the favourite and the blackeyed one is pushed behind the drawers tomorrow blueeyes may take its turn of neglect and it may be an odious little wretch with a burnt nose or torn bead of hair and no eyes at all that takes the first place in misss affection and is dandled and caressed in her arms  as novelists are supposed to know everything even the secrets of female hearts which the owners themselves do not perhaps know we may state that at eleven years of age mademoiselle betsi as miss amory was then called had felt tender emotions towards a young savoyard organgrinder at paris whom she persisted in believing to be a prince carried off from his parents that at twelve an old and hideous drawingmaster but ah what age or personal defects are proof against womans love had agitated her young heart and that at thirteen being at madame de caramels boardingschool in the champs elysees which as everybody knows is next door to monsieur rogrons chevalier of the legion of honour pension for young gentlemen a correspondence by letter took place between the seduisante miss betsi and two young gentlemen of the college of charlemagne who were pensioners of the chevalier rogron  in the above paragraph our young friend has been called by a christian name different to that under which we were lately presented to her the fact is that miss amory called missy at home had really at the first been christened betsybut assumed the name of blanche of her own will and fantasy and crowned herself with it and the weapon which the baronet her stepfather held in terror over her was the threat to call her publicly by her name of betsy by which menace he sometimes managed to keep the young rebel in order  we have spoken just now of childrens dolls and of the manner in which those little people take up and neglect their darling toys and very likely this history will show that miss blanche assumed and put away her live dolls with a similar girlish inconstancy she had had hosts of dear dear darling friends ere now and had quite a little museum of locks of hair in her treasurechest which she had gathered in the course of her sentimental progress some dear friends had married some had gone to other schools one beloved sister she had lost from the pension and found again o horror her darling her leocadie keeping the books in her fathers shop a grocer in the rue du bac in fact she had met with a number of disappointments estrangements disillusionments as she called them in her pretty french jargon and had seen and suffered a great deal for so young a woman but it is the lot of sensibility to suffer and of confiding tenderness to be deceived and she felt that she was only undergoing the penalties of genius in these pangs and disappointments of her young career  meanwhile she managed to make the honest lady her mother as uncomfortable as circumstances would permit and caused her worthy stepfather to wish she was dead with the exception of captain strong whose invincible goodhumour was proof against her sarcasms the little lady ruled the whole house with he tongue if lady clavering talked about sparrowgrass instead of asparagus or called an object a hobject as this unfortunate lady would sometimes do missy calmly corrected her and frightened the good soul her mother into errors only the more frequent as she grew more nervous under her daughters eye  it is not to be supposed considering the vast interest which the arrival of the family at clavering park inspired in the inhabitants of the little town that madame fribsby alone of all the folks in clavering should have remained unmoved and incurious at the first appearance of the park family in church madame noted every article of toilette which the ladies wore from their bonnets to their brodequins and took a survey of the attire of the ladies maids in the pew allotted to them we fear that doctor portmans sermon though it was one of his oldest and most valued compositions had little effect upon madame fribsby on that day  in a very few days afterwards she had managed for herself an interview with lady claverings confidential attendant in the housekeepers room at the park and her cards in french and english stating that she received the newest fashions from paris from her correspondent madame victorine and that she was in the custom of making court and ball dresses for the nobility and gentry of the shire were in the possession of lady clavering and miss amory and favourably received as she was happy to hear by those ladies  mrs bonner lady claverings lady became soon a great frequenter of madame fribsbys drawingroom and partook of many entertainments at the milliners expense a meal of green tea scandal hot sallylunn cakes and a little novel reading were always at the service of mrs bonner whenever she was free to pass an evening in the town and she found much more time for these pleasures than her junior officer miss amorys maid who seldom could be spared for a holiday and was worked as hard as any factorygirl by that inexorable little muse her mistress  the muse loved to be dressed becomingly and having a lively fancy and a poetic desire for change was for altering her attire every day her maid having a taste in dressmakingto which art she had been an apprentice at paris before she entered into miss blanches service therewas kept from morning till night altering and remodelling miss amorys habiliments and rose very early and went to bed very late in obedience to the untiring caprices of her little taskmistress the girl was of respectable english parents there are many of our people colonists of paris who have seen better days who are not quite ruined who do not quite live upon charity and yet cannot get on without it and as her father was a cripple incapable of work and her return home would only increase the burthen and add to the misery of the family poor pincott was fain to stay where she could maintain herself and spare a little relief to her parents  our muse with the candour which distinguished her never failed to remind her attendant of the real state of matters i should send you away pincott for you are a great deal too weak and your eyes are failing you and you are always crying and snivelling and wanting the doctor but i wish that your parents at home should be supported and i go on enduring you for their sake mind the dear blanche would say to her timid little attendant or pincott your wretched appearance and slavish manner and red eyes positively give me the migraine and i think i shall make you wear rouge so that you may look a little cheerful or pincott i cant bear even for the sake of your starving parents that you should tear my hair out of my head in that manner and i will thank you to write to them and say that i dispense with your services after which sort of speeches and after keeping her for an hour trembling over her hair which the young lady loved to have combed as she perused one of her favourite french novels she would go to bed at one oclock and say pincott you may kiss me good night i should like you to have the pink dress ready for the morning and so with blessing upon her attendant she would turn round and go to sleep  the muse might lie in bed as long as she chose of a morning and availed herself of that privilege but pincott had to rise very early indeed to get her mistresss task done and had to appear next day with the same red eyes and the same wan face which displeased miss amory by their want of gaiety and caused the mistress to be so angry because the servant persisted in being and looking unwell and unhappy not that blanche ever thought she was a hard mistress indeed she made quite a friend of pincott at times and wrote some very pretty verses about the lonely little tiringmaid whose heart was far away our beloved blanche was a superior being and expected to be waited upon as such and i do not know whether there are any other ladies in this world who treat their servants or dependants so but it may be that there are such and that the tyranny which they exercise over their subordinates and the pangs which they can manage to inflict with a soft voice and a wellbred simper are as cruel as those which a slavedriver administers with an oath and a whip  but blanche was a musea delicate little creature quite tremulous with excitability whose eyes filled with tears at the smallest emotion and who knows but that it was the very fineness of her feelings which caused them to be froissed so easily you crush a butterfly by merely touching it vulgar people have no idea of the sensibility of a muse  so little pincott being occupied all day and night in stitching hemming ripping combing ironing crimping for her mistress reading to her when in bedfor the girl was mistress of the two languages and had a sweet voice and mannercould take no share in madame fribsbys soirees nor indeed was she much missed or considered of sufficient consequence to appear at their entertainments  but there was another person connected with the clavering establishment who became a constant guest of our friend the milliner this was the chief of the kitchen monsieur mirobolant with whom madame fribsby soon formed an intimacy  not having been accustomed to the appearance or society of persons of the french nation the rustic inhabitants of clavering were not so favourably impressed by monsieur alcides manners and appearance as that gentleman might have desired that they should be he walked among them quite unsuspiciously upon the afternoon of a summer day when his services were not required at the house in his usual favourite costume namely his light green frock or paletot his crimson velvet waistcoat with blue glass buttons his pantalon ecossais of a very large and decided check pattern his orange satin neckcloth and his jeanboots with tips of shiny leatherthese with a goldembroidered cap and a richly gilt cane or other varieties of ornament of a similar tendency formed his usual holiday costume in which he flattered himself there was nothing remarkable unless indeed the beauty of his person should attract observation and in which he considered that he exhibited the appearance of a gentleman of good parisian ton  he walked then down the street grinning and ogling every woman he met with glances which he meant should kill them outright and peered over the railings and in at the windows where females were in the tranquil summer evening but betsy mrs pybuss maid shrank back with a lor bless us as alcide ogled her over the laurelbush the miss bakers and their mamma stared with wonder and presently a crowd began to follow the interesting foreigner of ragged urchins and children who left their dirtpies in the street to pursue him  for some time he thought that admiration was the cause which led these persons in his wake and walked on pleased himself that he could so easily confer on others so much harmless pleasure but the little children and dirtpie manufacturers were presently succeeded by followers of a larger growth and a number of lads and girls from the factory being let loose at this hour joined the mob and began laughing jeering hooting and calling opprobrious names at the frenchman some cried out frenchy frenchy some exclaimed frogs one asked for a lock of his hair which was long and in richlyflowing ringlets and at length the poor artist began to perceive that he was an object of derision rather than of respect to the rude grinning mob  it was at this juncture that madame fribsby spied the unlucky gentleman with the train at his heels and heard the scornful shouts with which they assailed him she ran out of her room and across the street to the persecuted foreigner she held out her hand and addressing him in his own language invited him into her abode and when she had housed him fairly within her door she stood bravely at the threshold before the gibing factory girls and boys and said they were a pack of cowards to insult a poor man who could not speak their language and was alone and without protection the little crowd with some ironical cheers and hootings nevertheless felt the force of madame fribsbys vigorous allocution and retreated before her for the old lady was rather respected in the place and her oddity and her kindness had made her many friends there  poor mirobolant was grateful indeed to hear the language of his country ever so ill spoken frenchmen pardon our faults in their language much more readily than we excuse their bad english and will face our blunders throughout a long conversation without the least propensity to grin the rescued artist vowed that madame fribsby was his guardian angel and that he had not as yet met with such suavity and politeness among les anglaises he was as courteous and complimentary to her as if it was the fairest and noblest of ladies whom he was addressing for alcide mirobolant paid homage after his fashion to all womankind and never dreamed of a distinction of ranks in the realms of beauty as his phrase was  a cream flavoured with pineapplea mayonnaise of lobster which he flattered himself was not unworthy of his hand or of her to whom he had the honour to offer it as an homage and a box of preserved fruits of provence were brought by one of the chefs aidesdecamp in a basket the next day to the milliners and were accompanied with a gallant note to the amiable madame fribsbi her kindness alcide said had made a green place in the desert of his existenceher suavity would ever contrast in memory with the grossierete of the rustic population who were not worthy to possess such a jewel an intimacy of the most confidential nature thus sprang up between the milliner and the chief of the kitchen but i do not know whether it was with pleasure or mortification that madame received the declarations of friendship which the young alcides proffered to her for he persisted in calling her la respectable fribsbi la vertueuse fribsbiand in stating that he should consider her as his mother while he hoped she would regard him as her son ah it was not very long ago fribsby thought that words had been addressed to her in that dear french language indicating a different sort of attachment and she sighed as she looked up at the picture of her carabineer for it is surprising how young some peoples hearts remain when their heads have need of a front or a little hairdyeand at this moment madame fribsby as she told young alcide felt as romantic as a girl of eighteen  when the conversation took this turnand at their first intimacy madame fribsby was rather inclined so to lead italcide always politely diverged to another subject it was as his mother that he persisted in considering the good milliner he would recognise her in no other capacity and with that relationship the gentle lady was forced to content herself when she found how deeply the artists heart was engaged elsewhere  he was not long before he described to her the subject and origin of his passion  i declared myself to her said alcide laying his hand on his heart in a manner which was as novel as i am charmed to think it was agreeable where cannot love penetrate respectable madame fribsbi cupid is the father of inventioni inquired of the domestics what were the plats of which mademoiselle partook with most pleasure and built up my little battery accordingly on a day when her parents had gone to dine in the world and i am grieved to say that a grossier dinner at a restaurateur in the boulevard or in the palais royal seemed to form the delights of these unrefined persons the charming miss entertained some comrades of the pension and i advised myself to send up a little repast suitable to so delicate young palates her lovely name is blanche the name of the maiden is white the wreath of roses which she wears is white i determined that my dinner should be as spotless as the snow at her accustomed hour and instead of the rude gigot a leau which was ordinarily served at her too simple table i sent her up a little potage a la reinea la reine blanche i called itas white as her own tintand confectioned with the most fragrant cream and almonds i then offered up at her shrine a filet de merlan a lgnes and a delicate plat which i designated as eperlan a la saintetherese and of which my charming miss partook with pleasure i followed this by two little entrees of sweetbread and chicken and the only brown thing which i permitted myself in the entertainment was a little roast of lamb which i lay in a meadow of spinaches surrounded with croustillons representing sheep and ornamented with daisies and other savage flowers after this came my second service a pudding a la reine elizabeth who madame fribsbi knows was a maiden princess a dish of opalcoloured plovers eggs which i called nid de tourtereaux a la roucoule placing in the midst of them two of those tender volatiles billing each other and confectioned with butter a basket containing little gateaux of apricots which i know all young ladies adore and a jelly of marasquin bland insinuating intoxicating as the glance of beauty this i designated ambroisie de calypso a la souveraine de mon coeur and when the ice was brought inan ice of plombiere and cherrieshow do you think i had shaped them madame fribsbi in the form of two hearts united with an arrow on which i had laid before it entered a bridal veil in cutpaper surmounted by a wreath of virginal orangeflowers i stood at the door to watch the effect of this entry it was but one cry of admiration the three young ladies filled their glasses with the sparkling ay and carried me in a toast i heard iti heard miss speak of mei heard her say tell monsieur mirobolant that we thank himwe admire himwe love him my feet almost failed me as she spoke  since that can i have any reason to doubt that the young artist has made some progress in the heart of the english miss i am modest but my glass informs me that i am not illlooking other victories have convinced me of the fact  dangerous man cried the milliner  the blond misses of albion see nothing in the dull inhabitants of their brumous isle which can compare with the ardour and vivacity of the children of the south we bring our sunshine with us we are frenchmen and accustomed to conquer were it not for this affair of the heart and my determination to marry an anglaise do you think i would stop in this island which is not altogether ungrateful since i have found here a tender mother in the respectable madame fribsbi in this island in this family my genius would use itself in the company of these rusticsthe poesy of my art cannot be understood by these carnivorous insularies nothe men are odious but the womenthe women i own dear fribsbi are seducing i have vowed to marry one and as i cannot go into your markets and purchase according to the custom of the country i am resolved to adopt another custom and fly with one to gretna grin the blonde miss will go she is fascinated her eyes have told me so the white dove wants but the signal to fly  have you any correspondence with her asked fribsby in amazement and not knowing whether the young lady or the lover might be labouring under a romantic delusion  i correspond with her by means of my art she partakes of dishes which i make expressly for her i insinuate to her thus a thousand hints which as she is perfectly spiritual she receives but i want other intelligences near her  there is pincott her maid said madame fribsby who by aptitude or education seemed to have some knowledge of affairs of the heart but the great artists brow darkened at this suggestion  madame he said there are points upon which a gallant man ought to silence himself though if he break the secret he may do so with the least impropriety to his best friendhis adopted mother know then that there is a cause why miss pincott should be hostile to mea cause not uncommon with your sexjealousy  perfidious monster said the confidante  ah no said the artist with a deep bass voice and a tragic accent worthy of the port st martin and his favourite melodrames not perfidious but fatal yes i am a fatal man madame fribsbi to inspire hopeless passion is my destiny i cannot help it that women love me is it my fault that that young woman deperishes and languishes to the view of the eye consumed by a flame which i cannot return listen there are others in this family who are similarly unhappy the governess of the young milor has encountered me in my walks and looked at me in a way which can bear but one interpretation and milady herself who is of mature age but who has oriental blood has once or twice addressed compliments to the lonely artist which can admit of no mistake i avoid the household i seek solitude i undergo my destiny i can marry but one and am resolved it shall be to a lady of your nation and if her fortune is sufficient i think miss would be the person who would be most suitable i wish to ascertain what her means are before i lead her to gretna grin  whether alcides was as irresistible a conqueror as his namesake or whether he was simply crazy is a point which must be left to the readers judgment but the latter if he had had the benefit of much french acquaintance has perhaps met with men amongst them who fancied themselves almost as invincible and who if you credit them have made equal havoc in the hearts of les anglaises     chapter xxv contains both love and jealousy   our readers have already heard sir francis claverings candid opinion of the lady who had given him her fortune and restored him to his native country and home and it must be owned that the baronet was not far wrong in his estimate of his wife and that lady clavering was not the wisest or the best educated of women she had had a couple of years education in europe in a suburb of london which she persisted in calling ackney to her dying day whence she had been summoned to join her father at calcutta at the age of fifteen and it was on her voyage thither on board the ramchunder east indiaman captain bragg in which ship she had two years previously made her journey to europe that she formed the acquaintance of her first husband mr amory who was third mate of the vessel in question  we are not going to enter into the early part of lady claverings history but captain bragg under whose charge miss snell went out to her father who was one of the captains consignees and part owner of the ramchunder and many other vessels found reason to put the rebellious rascal of a mate in irons until they reached the cape where the captain left his officer behind and finally delivered his ward to her father at calcutta after a stormy and perilous voyage in which the ramchunder and the cargo and passengers incurred no small danger and damage  some months afterwards amory made his appearance at calcutta having worked his way out before the mast from the capemarried the rich attorneys daughter in spite of that old speculatorset up as indigoplanter and failedset up as agent and failed againset up as editor of the sunderbund pilot and failed againquarrelling ceaselessly with his fatherinlaw and his wife during the progress of all these mercantile transactions and disasters and ending his career finally with a crash which compelled him to leave calcutta and go to new south wales it was in the course of these luckless proceedings that mr amory probably made the acquaintance of sir jasper rogers the respected judge of the supreme court of calcutta who has been mentioned before and as the truth must out it was by making an improper use of his fatherinlaws name who could write perfectly well and had no need of an amanuensis that fortune finally forsook mr amory and caused him to abandon all further struggles with her  not being in the habit of reading the calcutta lawreports very assiduously the european public did not know of these facts as well as people did in bengal and mrs amory and her father finding her residence in india not a comfortable one it was agreed that the lady should return to europe whither she came with her little daughter betsy or blanche then four years old they were accompanied by betsys nurse who has been presented to the reader in the last chapter as the confidential maid of lady clavering mrs bonner and captain bragg took a house for them in the near neighbourhood of his residence in pocklington street  it was a very hard bitter summer and the rain it rained every day for some time after mrs amorys arrival bragg was very pompous and disagreeable perhaps ashamed perhaps anxious to get rid of the indian lady she believed that all the world in london was talking about her husbands disaster and that the king and queen and the court of directors were aware of her unlucky history she had a good allowance from her father she had no call to live in england and she determined to go abroad away she went then glad to escape the gloomy surveillance of the odious bully captain bragg people had no objection to receive her at the continental towns where she stopped and at the various boardinghouses where she royally paid her way she called hackney ackney to be sure though otherwise she spoke english with a little foreign twang very curious and not unpleasant she dressed amazingly she was conspicuous for her love of eating and drinking and prepared curries and pillaws at every boardinghouse which she frequented but her singularities of language and behaviour only gave a zest to her society and mrs amory was deservedly popular she was the most goodnatured jovial and generous of women she was up to any party of pleasure by whomsoever proposed she brought three times more champagne and fowl and ham to the picnics than anyone else she took endless boxes for the play and tickets for the masked balls and gave them away to everybody she paid the boardinghouse people months beforehand she helped poor shabby mustachiod bucks and dowagers whose remittances had not arrived with constant supplies from her purse and in this way she tramped through europe and appeared at brussels at paris at milan at naples at rome as her fancy led her news of amorys death reached her at the latter place where captain clavering was then staying unable to pay his hotel bill as indeed was his friend the chevalier strong and the goodnatured widow married the descendant of the ancient house of claveringprofessing indeed no particular grief for the scapegrace of a husband whom she had lost we have brought her thus up to the present time when she was mistress of clavering park in the midst of which mr pinckney the celebrated painter pourtrayed her with her little boy by her side  missy followed her mamma in most of her peregrinations and so learned a deal of life she had a governess for some time and after her mothers second marriage the benefit of madame de caramels select pension in the champs elysees when the claverings came to england she of course came with them it was only within a few years after the death of her grandfather and the birth of her little brother that she began to understand that her position in life was altered and that miss amory nobodys daughter was a very small personage in a house compared with master francis clavering heir to an ancient baronetcy and a noble estate but for little frank she would have been an heiress in spite of her father and though she knew and cared not much about money of which she never had any stint and though she was a romantic little muse as we have seen yet she could not reasonably be grateful to the persons who had so contributed to change her condition nor indeed did she understand what the latter really was until she had made some further progress and acquired more accurate knowledge in the world  but this was clear that her stepfather was dull and weak that mamma dropped her hs and was not refined in manners or appearance and that little frank was a spoiled quarrelsome urchin always having his way always treading upon her feet always upsetting his dinner on her dresses and keeping her out of her inheritance none of these as she felt could comprehend her and her solitary heart naturally pined for other attachments and she sought around her where to bestow the precious boon of her unoccupied affection  this dear girl then from want of sympathy or other cause made herself so disagreeable at home and frightened her mother and bored her stepfather so much that they were quite as anxious as she could be that she should settle for herself in life and hence sir francis claverings desire expressed to his friend in the last chapter that mrs strong should die and that he would take blanche to himself as a second mrs strong  but as this could not be any other person was welcome to win her and a smart young fellow welllooking and well educated like our friend arthur pendennis was quite free to propose for her if he had a mind and would have been received with open arms by lady clavering as a soninlaw had he had the courage to come forward as a competitor for miss amorys hand  mr pen however besides other drawbacks chose to entertain an extreme diffidence about himself he was ashamed of his late failures of his idle and nameless condition of the poverty which he had brought on his mother by his folly and there was as much of vanity as remorse in his present state of doubt and distrust how could he ever hope for such a prize as this brilliant blanche amory who lived in a fine park and mansion and was waited on by a score of grand domestics whilst a maidservant brought in their meagre meal at fairoaks and his mother was obliged to pinch and manage to make both ends meet obstacles seemed for him insurmountable which would have vanished had he marched manfully upon them and he preferred despairing or dallying with his wishesor perhaps he had not positively shaped them as yetto attempting to win gallantly the object of his desire many a young man fails by that species of vanity called shyness who might for the asking have his will  but we do not pretend to say that pen had as yet ascertained his or that he was doing much more than thinking about falling in love miss amory was charming and lively she fascinated and cajoled him by a thousand arts or natural graces or flatteries but there were lurking reasons and doubts besides shyness and vanity withholding him in spite of her cleverness and her protestations and her fascinations pens mother had divined the girl and did not trust her mrs pendennis saw blanche lightminded and frivolous detected many wants in her which offended the pure and piousminded lady a want of reverence for her parents and for things more sacred helen thought worldliness and selfishness couched under pretty words and tender expressions laura and pen battled these points strongly at first with the widowlaura being as yet enthusiastic about her new friend and pen not fargone enough in love to attempt any concealment of his feelings he would laugh at these objections of helens and say psha mother you are jealous about lauraall women are jealous  but when in the course of a month or two and by watching the pair with that anxiety with which brooding women watch over their sons affectionsand in acknowledging which i have no doubt there is a sexual jealousy on the mothers part and a secret pangwhen helen saw that the intimacy appeared to make progress that the two young people were perpetually finding pretexts to meet and that miss blanche was at fairoaks or mr pen at the park every day the poor widows heart began to fail herher darling project seemed to vanish before her and giving way to her weakness she fairly told pen one day what her views and longings were that she felt herself breaking and not long for this world and that she hoped and prayed before she went that she might see her two children one the late events pens life and career and former passion for the actress had broken the spirit of this tender lady she felt that he had escaped her and was in the maternal nest no more and she clung with a sickening fondness to laura laura who had been left to her by francis in heaven  pen kissed and soothed her in his grand patronising way he had seen something of this he had long thought his mother wanted to make this marriagedid laura know anything of it not shemrs pendennis saidnot for worlds would she have breathed a word of it to laurawell well there was time enough his mother wouldnt die pen said laughingly he wouldnt hear of any such thing and as for the muse she is too grand a lady to think about poor little meand as for laura who knows that she would have me she would do anything you told her to be sure but am i worthy of her  o pen you might be was the widows reply not that mr pen ever doubted that he was and a feeling of indefinable pleasure and selfcomplacency came over him as he thought over this proposal and imaged laura to himself as his memory remembered her for years past always fair and open kindly and pious cheerful tender and true he looked at her with brightening eyes as she came in from the garden at the end of this talk her cheeks rather flushed her looks frank and smilinga basket of roses in her hand  she took the finest of them and brought it to mrs pendennis who was refreshed by the odour and colour of these flowers and hung over her fondly and gave it to her  and i might have this prize for the asking pen thought with a thrill of triumph as he looked at the kindly girl why she is as beautiful and as generous as her roses the image of the two women remained for ever after in his mind and he never recalled it but the tears came into his eyes  before very many weeks intimacy with her new acquaintance however miss laura was obliged to give in to helens opinion and own that the muse was selfish unkind and inconstant of course blanche confided to her bosom friend all the little griefs and domestic annoyances how the family could not comprehend her and she moved among them an isolated being how her poor mammas education had been neglected and she was forced to blush for her blunders how sir francis was a weak person deplorably unintellectual and only happy when smoking his odious cigars how since the birth of her little brother she had seen her mothers precious affection which she valued more than anything in life estranged from her once darling daughter how she was alone alone alone in the world  but these griefs real and heartrending though they might be to a young lady of exquisite sensibility did not convince laura of the propriety of blanches conduct in many small incidents of little frank for instance life might be very provoking and might have deprived blanche of her mammas affection but this was no reason why blanche should box the childs ears because he upset a glass of water over her drawing and why she should call him many opprobrious names in the english and french language and the preference accorded to little frank was certainly no reason why blanche should give herself imperial airs of command towards the boys governess and send that young lady upon messages through the house to bring her book or to fetch her pockethandkerchief when a domestic performed an errand for honest laura she was always thankful and pleased whereas she could not but perceive that the little muse had not the slightest scruple in giving her commands to all the world round about her and in disturbing anybodys ease or comfort in order to administer to her own it was lauras first experience in friendship and it pained the kind creatures heart to be obliged to give up as delusions one by one those charms and brilliant qualities in which her fancy had dressed her new friend and to find that the fascinating little fairy was but a mortal and not a very amiable mortal after all what generous person is there that has not been so deceived in his timewhat person perhaps that has not so disappointed others in his turn  after the scene with little frank in which that refractory son and heir of the house of clavering had received the compliments in french and english and the accompanying box on the ear from his sister miss laura who had plenty of humour could not help calling to mind some very touching and tender verses which the muse had read to her out of mes larmes and which began my pretty baby brother may angels guard thy rest in which the muse after complimenting the baby upon the station in life which it was about to occupy and contrasting it with her own lonely condition vowed nevertheless that the angel boy would never enjoy such affection as hers was or find in the false world before him anything so constant and tender as a sisters heart it may be the forlorn one said it may be you will slight it my pretty baby sweet you will spurn me from your bosom ill cling around your feet o let me let me love you the world will prove to you as false as tis to others but i am ever true and behold the muse was boxing the darling brothers ears instead of kneeling at his feet and giving miss laura her first lesson in the cynical philosophynot quite her first howeversomething like this selfishness and waywardness something like this contrast between practice and poetry between grand versified aspirations and everyday life she had witnessed at home in the person of our young friend mr pen  but then pen was different pen was a man it seemed natural somehow that he should be selfwilled and should have his own way and under his waywardness and selfishness indeed there was a kind and generous heart o it was hard that such a diamond should be changed away against such a false stone as this in a word laura began to be tired of her admired blanche she had assayed her and found her not true and her former admiration and delight which she had expressed with her accustomed generous artlessness gave way to a feeling which we shall not call contempt but which was very near it and which caused laura to adopt towards miss amory a grave and tranquil tone of superiority which was at first by no means to the muses liking nobody likes to be found out or having held a high place to submit to step down  the consciousness that this event was impending did not serve to increase miss blanches goodhumour and as it made her peevish and dissatisfied with herself it probably rendered her even less agreeable to the persons round about her so there arose one fatal day a battleroyal between dearest blanche and dearest laura in which the friendship between them was all but slain outright dearest blanche had been unusually capricious and wicked on this day she had been insolent to her mother savage with little frank odiously impertinent in her behaviour to the boys governess and intolerably cruel to pincott her attendant not venturing to attack her friend for the little tyrant was of a timid feline nature and only used her claws upon those who were weaker than herself she maltreated all these and especially poor pincott who was menial confidante companion slave always according to the caprice of her young mistress  this girl who had been sitting in the room with the young ladies being driven thence in tears occasioned by the cruelty of her mistress and raked with a parting sarcasm as she went sobbing from the door laura fairly broke out into a loud and indignant invectivewondered how one so young could forget the deference owing to her elders as well as to her inferiors in station and professing so much sensibility of her own could torture the feelings of others so wantonly laura told her friend that her conduct was absolutely wicked and that she ought to ask pardon of heaven on her knees for it and having delivered herself of a hot and voluble speech whereof the delivery astonished the speaker as much almost as her auditor she ran to her bonnet and shawl and went home across the park in a great flurry and perturbation and to the surprise of mrs pendennis who had not expected her until night  alone with helen laura gave an account of the scene and gave up her friend henceforth o mamma she said you were right blanche who seems so soft and so kind is as you have said selfish and cruel she who is always speaking of her affections can have no heart no honest girl would afflict a mother so or torture a dependant andand i give her up from this day and i will have no other friend but you  on this the two ladies went through the osculatory ceremony which they were in the habit of performing and mrs pendennis got a great secret comfort from the little quarrelfor lauras confession seemed to say that girl can never be a wife for pen for she is lightminded and heartless and quite unworthy of our noble hero he will be sure to find out her unworthiness for his own part and then he will be saved from this flighty creature and awake out of his delusion  but miss laura did not tell mrs pendennis perhaps did not acknowledge to herself what had been the real cause of the days quarrel being in a very wicked mood and bent upon mischief everywhere the little wicked muse of a blanche had very soon begun her tricks her darling laura had come to pass a long day and as they were sitting in her own room together had chosen to bring the conversation round to the subject of mr pen  i am afraid he is sadly fickle miss blanche observed mrs pybus and many more clavering people have told us all about the actress  i was quite a child when it happened and i dont know anything about it laura answered blushing very much  he used her very ill blanche said wagging her little head he was false to her  i am sure he was not laura cried out he acted most generously by her he wanted to give up everything to marry her it was she that was false to him he nearly broke his heart about it he  i thought you didnt know anything about the story dearest interposed miss blanche  mamma has said so said laura  well he is very clever continued the other little dear what a sweet poet he is have you ever read his poems  only the fisherman and the diver which he translated for us and his prize poem which didnt get the prize and indeed i thought it very pompous and prosy laura said laughing  has he never written you any poems then love asked miss amory  no my dear said miss bell  blanche ran up to her friend kissed her fondly called her my dearest laura at least three times looked her archly in the face nodded her head and said promise to tell noobody and i will show you something  and tripping across the room daintily to a little motherofpearl inlaid desk she opened it with a silver key and took out two or three papers crumpled and rather stained with green which she submitted to her friend laura took them and read them they were loveverses sure enoughsomething about undineabout a naiadabout a river she looked at them for a long time but in truth the lines were not very distinct before her eyes  and you have answered them blanche she asked putting them back  o no not for worlds dearest the other said and when her dearest laura had quite done with the verses she tripped back and popped them again into the pretty desk  then she went to her piano and sang two or three songs of rossini whose flourishes of music her flexible little voice could execute to perfection and laura sate by vaguely listening as she performed these pieces what was miss bell thinking about the while she hardly knew but sate there silent as the songs rolled by after this concert the young ladies were summoned to the room where luncheon was served and whither they of course went with their arms round each others waists  and it could not have been jealousy or anger on lauras part which had made her silent for after they had tripped along the corridor and descended the steps and were about to open the door which leads into the hall laura paused and looking her friend kindly and frankly in the face kissed her with a sisterly warmth  something occurred after thismaster franks manner of eating probably or mammas blunders or sir francis smelling of cigarswhich vexed miss blanche and she gave way to that series of naughtinesses whereof we have spoken and which ended in the above little quarrel     chapter xxvi a house full of visitors   the difference between the girls did not last long laura was always too eager to forgive and be forgiven and as for miss blanche her hostilities never very long or durable had not been provoked by the above scene nobody cares about being accused of wickedness no vanity is hurt by that sort of charge blanche was rather pleased than provoked by her friends indignation which never would have been raised but for a cause which both knew though neither spoke of  and so laura with a sigh was obliged to confess that the romantic part of her first friendship was at an end and that the object of it was only worthy of a very ordinary sort of regard  as for blanche she instantly composed a copy of touching verses setting forth her desertion and disenchantment it was only the old story she wrote of love meeting with coldness and fidelity returned by neglect and some new neighbours arriving from london about this time in whose family there were daughters miss amory had the advantage of selecting an eternal friend from one of these young ladies and imparting her sorrows and disappointments to this new sister the tall footmen came but seldom now with notes to the sweet laura the ponycarriage was but rarely despatched to fairoaks to be at the orders of the ladies there blanche adopted a sweet look of suffering martyrdom when laura came to see her the other laughed at her friends sentimental mood and treated it with a goodhumour that was by no means respectful  but if miss blanche found new female friends to console her the faithful historian is also bound to say that she discovered some acquaintances of the other sex who seemed to give her consolation too if ever this artless young creature met a young man and had ten minutes conversation with him in a garden walk in a drawingroom window or in the intervals of a waltz she confided in him so to speakmade play with her beautiful eyesspoke in a tone of tender interest and simple and touching appeal and left him to perform the same pretty little drama in behalf of his successor  when the claverings first came down to the park there were very few audiences before whom miss blanche could perform hence pen had all the benefits of her glances and confidences and the drawingroom window or the garden walk all to himself in the town of clavering it has been said there were actually young men in the near surrounding country only a curate or two or a rustic young squire with large feet and illmade clothes to the dragoons quartered at chatteris the baronet made no overtures it was unluckily his own regiment he had left it on bad terms with some officers of the corpsan ugly business about a horse bargaina disputed play accountblindhookeya white featherwho need askit is not our business to inquire too closely into the bygones of our characters except in so far as their previous history appertains to the development of this present story  but the autumn and the end of the parliamentary session and the london season brought one or two county families down to their houses and filled tolerably the neighbouring little wateringplace of baymouth and opened our friend mr bingleys theatre royal at chatteris and collected the usual company at the assizes and raceballs there up to this time the old county families had been rather shy of our friends of clavering park the fogeys of drummington the squares of tozely park the welbores of the barrow etc all sorts of stories were current among these folks regarding the family at claveringindeed nobody ought to say that people in the country have no imagination who heard them talk about new neighbours about sir francis and his lady and her birth and parentage about miss amory about captain strong there had been endless histories which need not be recapitulated and the family of the park had been three months in the county before the great people around began to call  but at the end of the season the earl of trehawk lord lieutenant of the county coming to eyrie castle and the countess dowager of rockminster whose son was also a magnate of the land to occupy a mansion on the marine parade at baymouththese great folks came publicly immediately and in state to call upon the family of clavering park and the carriages of the county families speedily followed in the track which had been left in the avenue by their lordly wheels  it was then that mirobolant began to have an opportunity of exercising that skill which he possessed and of forgetting in the occupations of his art the pangs of love it was then that the large footmen were too much employed at clavering park to be able to bring messages or dally over the cup of small beer with the poor little maids at fairoaks it was then that blanche found other dear friends than laura and other places to walk in besides the riverside where pen was fishing he came day after day and whipped the stream but the fish fish wouldnt do their duty nor the peri appear and here though in strict confidence and with a request that the matter go no further we may as well allude to a delicate business of which previous hint has been given mention has been made in a former page of a certain hollow tree at which pen used to take his station when engaged in his passion for miss fotheringay and the cavity of which he afterwards used for other purposes than to insert his baits and fishingcans in the truth is be converted this tree into a postoffice under a piece of moss and a stone he used to put little poems or letters equally poetical which were addressed to a certain undine or naiad who frequented the stream and which once or twice were replaced by a receipt in the shape of a flower or by a modest little word or two of acknowledgment written in a delicate hand in french or english and on pink scented paper certainly miss amory used to walk by this stream as we have seen and it is a fact that she used pink scented paper for her correspondence but after the great folks had invaded clavering park and the family coach passed out of the lodgegates evening after evening on their way to the other great country houses nobody came to fetch pens letters at the postoffice the white paper was not exchanged for the pink but lay undisturbed under its stone and its moss whilst the tree was reflected into the stream and the brawl went rolling by there was not much in the letters certainly in the pink notes scarcely anythingmerely a little word or two half jocular half sympathetic such as might be written by any young lady but oh you silly pendennis if you wanted this one why did you not speak perhaps neither party was in earnest you were only playing at being in love and the sportive little undine was humouring you at the same play  but if a man is baulked at this game he not unfrequently loses his temper and when nobody came any more for pens poems he began to look upon those compositions in a very serious light he felt almost tragical and romantic again as in his first affair of the heartat any rate he was bent upon having an explanation one day he went to the hall and there was a roomful of visitors on another miss amory was not to be seen she was going to a ball that night and was lying down to take a little sleep pen cursed balls and the narrowness of his means and the humility of his position in the country that caused him to be passed over by the givers of these entertainments on a third occasion miss amory was in the garden and he ran thither she was walking there in state with no less personages than the bishop and bishopess of chatteris and the episcopal family who scowled at him and drew up in great dignity when he was presented to them and they heard his name the right reverend prelate had heard it before and also of the little transaction in the deans garden  the bishop says youre a sad young man goodnatured lady clavering whispered to him what have you been a doing of nothink i hope to vex such a dear mar as yours how is your dear mar why dont she come and me we ant seen her this ever such a time were a goin about a gaddin so that we dont see no neighbours now give my love to her and laurar and come all to dinner tomorrow  mrs pendennis was too unwell to come out but laura and pen came and there was a great party and pen only got an opportunity of a hurried word with miss amory you never come to the river now he said  i cant said blanche the house is full of people  undine has left the stream mr pen went on choosing to be poetical  she never ought to have gone there miss amory answered she wont go again it was very foolish very wrong it was only play besides you have other consolations at home she added looking him full in the face an instant and dropping her eyes  if he wanted her why did he not speak then she might have said yes even then but as she spoke of other consolations at home he thought of laura so affectionate and so pure and of his mother at home who had bent her fond heart upon uniting him with her adopted daughter blanche he began in a vexed tonemiss amory  laura is looking at us mr pendennis the young lady said i must go back to the company and she ran off leaving mr pendennis to bite his nails in perplexity and to look out into the moonlight in the garden  laura indeed was looking at pen she was talking with or appearing to listen to the talk of mr pynsent lord rockminsters son and grandson of the dowager lady who was seated in state in the place of honour gravely receiving lady claverings bad grammar and patronising the vacuous sir francis whose interest in the county she was desirous to secure pynsent and pen had been at oxbridge together where the latter during his heyday of good fortune and fashion had been the superior of the young patrician and perhaps rather supercilious towards him they had met for the first time since they parted at the university at the table today and given each other that exceedingly impertinent and amusing deminod of recognition which is practised in england only and only to perfection by university menand which seems to say confound youwhat do you do here  i knew that man at oxbridge mr pynsent said to miss bella mr pendennis i think  yes said miss bell  he seems rather sweet upon miss amory the gentleman went on laura looked at them and perhaps thought so too but said nothing  a man of large property in the county aint he he used to talk about representing it he used to speak at the union whereabouts do his estates lie  laura smiled his estates lie on the other side of the river near the lodgegate he is my cousin and i live there  where asked mr pynsent with a laugh  why on the other side of the river at fairoaks answered miss bell  many pheasants there cover looks rather good said the simple gentleman  laura smiled again we have nine hens and a cock a pig and an old pointer  pendennis dont preserve then continued mr pynsent  you should come and see him the girl said laughing and greatly amused at the notion that her pen was a great county gentleman and perhaps had given himself out to be such  indeed i quite long to renew our acquaintance mr pynsent said gallantly and with a look which fairly said it is you that i would like to come and seeto which look and speech miss laura vouchsafed a smile and made a little bow  here blanche came stepping up with her most fascinating smile and ogle and begged dear laura to come and take the second in a song laura was ready to do anything goodnatured and went to the piano by which mr pynsent listened as long as the duet lasted and until miss amory began for herself when he strode away  what a nice frank amiable wellbred girl that is wagg said mr pynsent to a gentleman who had come over with him from baymouththe tall one i mean with the ringlets and red lipsmonstrous red aint they  what do you think of the girl of the house asked wagg  i think shes a lean scraggy humbug said mr pynsent with great candour she drags her shoulders out of her dress she never lets her eyes alone and she goes simpering and ogling about like a french waitingmaid  pynsent be civil cried the other somebody can hear  oh its pendennis of boniface mr pynsent said fine evening mr pendennis we were just talking of your charming cousin  any relation to my old friend major pendennis asked mr wagg  his nephew had the pleasure of meeting you at gaunt house mr pen said with his very best airthe acquaintance between the gentlemen was made in an instant  in the afternoon of the next day the two gentlemen who were staying at clavering park were found by mr pen on his return from a fishing excursion in which he had no sport seated in his mothers drawingroom in comfortable conversation with the widow and her ward mr pynsent tall and gaunt with large red whiskers and an imposing tuft to his chin was striding over a chair in the intimate neighbourhood of miss laura she was amused by his talk which was simple straightforward rather humorous and keen and interspersed with homely expressions of a style which is sometimes called slang it was the first specimen of a young london dandy that laura had seen or heard for she had been but a chit at the time of mr fokers introduction at fairoaks nor indeed was that ingenuous gentleman much more than a boy and his refinement was only that of a school and college  mr wagg as he entered the fairoaks premises with his companion eyed and noted everything old gardener he said seeing mr john at the lodgeold red livery waistcoatclothes hanging out to dry on the gooseberrybushesblue aprons white ducksgad they must be young pendenniss white ducksnobody else wears em in the family rather a shy place for a sucking county member ay pynsent  snug little crib said mr pynsent pretty cosy little lawn  mr pendennis at home old gentleman mr wagg said to the old domestic john answered no master pendennis was agone out  are the ladies at home asked the younger visitor mr john answered yes they be and as the pair walked over the trim gravel and by the neat shrubberies up the steps to the halldoor which old john opened mr wagg noted everything that he saw the barometer and the letterbag the umbrellas and the ladies clogs pens hats and tartan wrapper and old john opening the drawingroom door to introduce the newcomers such minutiae attracted wagg instinctively he seized them in spite of himself  old fellow does all the work he whispered to pynsent caleb balderstone shouldnt wonder if hes the housemaid the next minute the pair were in the presence of the fairoaks ladies in whom pynsent could not help recognising two perfectly wellbred ladies and to whom mr wagg made his obeisance with florid bows and extra courtesy accompanied with an occasional knowing leer at his companion mr pynsent did not choose to acknowledge these signals except by extreme haughtiness towards mr wagg and particular deference to the ladies if there was one thing laughable in mr waggs eyes it was poverty he had the soul of a butler who had been brought from his pantry to make fun in the drawingroom his jokes were plenty and his goodnature thoroughly genuine but he did not seem to understand that a gentleman could wear an old coat or that a lady could be respectable unless she had her carriage or employed a french milliner  charming place maam said he bowing to the widow noble prospectdelightful to us cocknies who seldom see anything but pall mall the widow said simply she had never been in london but once in her lifebefore her son was born  fine village maam fine village said mr wagg and increasing every day itll be quite a large town soon its not a bad place to live in for those who cant get the country and will repay a visit when you honour it  my brother major pendennis has often mentioned your name to us the widow said and we have been very much amused by some of your droll books sir helen continued who never could be brought to like mr waggs books and detested their tone most thoroughly  he is my very good friend mr wagg said with a low bow and one of the best known men about town and where known maam appreciatedi assure you appreciated he is with our friend steyne at aixlachapelle steyne has a touch of the gout and so between ourselves has your brother i am going to stillbrook for the pheasantshooting and afterwards to bareacres where pendennis and i shall probably meet and he poured out a flood of fashionable talk introducing the names of a score of peers and rattling on with breathless spirits whilst the simple widow listened in silent wonder what a man she thought are all the men of fashion in london like this i am sure pen will never like him  mr pynsent was in the meanwhile engaged with miss laura he named some of the houses in the neighbourhood whither he was going and hoped very much that he should see miss bell at some of them he hoped that her aunt would give her a season in london he said that in the next parliament it was probable that he should canvass the county and he hoped to get pendenniss interest here he spoke of pens triumph as an orator at oxbridge and asked was he coming into parliament too he talked on very pleasantly and greatly to lauras satisfaction until pen himself appeared and as has been said found these gentlemen  pen behaved very courteously to the pair now that they have found their way into his quarters and though he recollected with some twinges a conversation at oxbridge when pynsent was present and in which after a great debate at the union and in the midst of considerable excitement produced by a supper and champagnecuphe had announced his intention of coming in for his native county and had absolutely returned thanks in a fine speech as the future member yet mr pynsents manner was so frank and cordial that pen hoped pynsent might have forgotten his little fanfaronnade and any other braggadocio speeches or actions which he might have made he suited himself to the tone of the visitors then and talked about plinlimmon and magnus charters and the old set at oxbridge with careless familiarity and highbred ease as if he lived with marquises every day and a duke was no more to him than a village curate  but at this juncture and it being then six oclock in the evening betsy the maid who did not know of the advent of strangers walked into the room without any preliminary but that of flinging the door wide open before her and bearing in her arms a tray containing three teacups a teapot and a plate of thick breadandbutter all pens splendour and magnificence vanished away at thisand he faltered and became quite abashed what will they think of us he thought and indeed wagg thrust his tongue in his cheek thought the tea infinitely contemptible and leered and winked at pynsent to that effect  but to mr pynsent the transaction appeared perfectly simplethere was no reason present to his mind why people should not drink tea at six if they were minded as well as at any other hour and he asked of mr wagg when they went away what the devil he was grinning and winking at and what amused him  didnt you see how the cub was ashamed of the thick breadandbutter i dare say theyre going to have treacle if they are good ill take an opportunity of telling old pendennis when we get back to town mr wagg chuckled out  dont see the fun said mr pynsent  never thought you did growled wagg between his teeth they walked home rather sulkily  wagg told the story at dinner very smartly with wonderful accuracy of observation he described old john the clothes that were drying the clogs in the hall the drawingroom and its furniture and picturesold man with a beak and bald headfeu pendennis i bet two to one stickingplaster fulllength of a youth in a cap and gownthe present marquis of fairoaks of course the widow when young in a miniature mrs mee she had the gown on when we came or a dress made the year after and the tips cut off the fingers of her gloves which she stitches her sons collars with and then the sarving maid came in with their teas so we left the earl and the countess to their breadandbutter  blanche near whom he sate as he told this story and who adored les hommes desprit burst out laughing and called him such an odd droll creature but pynsent who began to be utterly disgusted with him broke out in a loud voice and said i dont know mr wagg what sort of ladies you are accustomed to meet in your own family but by gad as far as a first acquaintance can show i never met two betterbred women in my life and i hope maam youll call upon em he added addressing lady rockminster who was seated at sir francis claverings right hand  sir francis turned to the guest on his left and whispered thats what i call a sticker for wagg and lady clavering giving the young gentleman a delighted tap with her fan winked her black eyes at him and said mr pynsent youre a good feller  after the affair with blanche a difference ever so slight a tone of melancholy perhaps a little bitter might be perceived in lauras converse with her cousin she seemed to weigh him and find him wanting too the widow saw the girls clear and honest eyes watching the young man at times and a look of almost scorn pass over her face as he lounged in the room with the women or lazily sauntered smoking upon the lawn or lolled under a tree there over a book which he was too listless to read  what has happened between you eagersighted helen asked of the girl something has happened has that wicked little blanche been making mischief tell me laura  nothing has happened at all laura said  then why do you look at pen so asked his mother quickly  look at him dear mother said the girl we two women are no society for him we dont interest him we are not clever enough for such a genius as pen he wastes his life and energies away among us tied to our apronstrings he interests himself in nothing he scarcely cares to go beyond the gardengate even captain glanders and captain strong pall upon him she added with a bitter laugh and they are men you know and our superiors he will never be happy while he is here why is he not facing the world and without a profession  we have got enough with great economy said the widow her heart beginning to beat violently pen has spent nothing for months im sure he is very good i am sure he might be very happy with us  dont agitate yourself so dear mother the girl answered i dont like to see you so you should not be sad because pen is unhappy here all men are so they must work they must make themselves names and a place in the world look the two captains have fought and seen battles that mr pynsent who came here and who will be very rich is in a public office he works very hard he aspires to a name and a reputation he says pen was one of the best speakers at oxbridge and had as great a character for talent as any of the young gentlemen there pen himself laughs at mr waggs celebrity and indeed he is a horrid person and says he is a dunce and that anybody could write his books  i am sure they are odious and vulgar interposed the widow  yet he has a reputationyou see the county chronicle says the celebrated mr wagg has been sojourning at baymouthlet our fashionables and eccentrics look out for something from his caustic pen if pen can write better than this gentleman and speak better than mr pynsent why doesnt he mamma he cant make speeches to us or distinguish himself here he ought to go away indeed he ought  dear laura said helen taking the girls hand is it kind of you to hurry him so i have been waiting i have been saving up money these many monthstoto pay back your advance to us  hush mother laura cried embracing her friend hastily it was your money not mine never speak about that again how much money have you saved  helen said there were more than two hundred pounds at the bank and that she would be enabled to pay off all lauras money by the end of the next year  give it himlet him have the two hundred pounds let him go to london and be a lawyer be something be worthy of his motherand of mine dearest mamma said the good girl upon which and with her usual tenderness and emotion the fond widow declared that laura was a blessing to her and the best of girlsand i hope no one in this instance will be disposed to contradict her  the widow and her daughter had more than one conversation on this subject and the elder gave way to the superior reason of the honest and strongerminded girl and indeed whenever there was a sacrifice to be made on her part this kind lady was only too eager to make it but she took her own way and did not loose sight of the end she had in view in imparting these new plans to pen one day she told him of these projects and it who that had formed them how it was laura who insisted upon his going to london and studying how it was laura who would not hear of thethe money arrangements when he came back from oxbridgebeing settled just then how it was laura whom he had to thank if indeed he thought that he had to go  at that news pens countenance blazed up with pleasure and he hugged his mother to his heart with an ardour that i fear disappointed the fond lady but she rallied when he said by heaven she is a noble girl and may god almighty bless her mother i have been wearing myself away for months here longing to work and not knowing how ive been fretting over the thoughts of my shame and my debts and my past cursed extravagance and follies ive suffered infernally my heart has been half brokennever mind about that if i can get a chance to redeem the past and to do my duty to myself and the best mother in the world indeed indeed i will ill be worthy of you yet heaven bless you god bless laura why isnt she here that i may go and thank her pen went on with more incoherent phrases paced up and down the room drank glasses of water jumped about his mother with a thousand embracesbegan to laughbegan to singwas happier than she had seen him since he was a boysince he had tasted of the fruit of that awful tree of life which from the beginning has tempted all mankind  laura was not at home laura was on a visit to the stately lady rockminster daughter to my lord bareacres sister to the late lady pontypool and by consequence a distant kinswoman of helens as her ladyship who was deeply versed in genealogy was graciously to point out to the modest country lady mr pen was greatly delighted at the relationship being acknowledged though perhaps not over well pleased that lady rockminster took miss bell home with her for a couple of days to baymouth and did not make the slightest invitation to mr arthur pendennis there was to be a ball at baymouth and it was to be miss lauras first appearance the dowager came to fetch her in her carriage and she went off with a white dress in her box happy and blushing like the rose to which pen compared her  this was the night of the balla public entertainment at the baymouth hotel by jove said pen ill ride overno i wont ride but ill go too his mother was charmed that he should do so and as he was debating about the conveyance in which he should start for baymouth captain strong called opportunely said he was going himself and that he would put his horse the butcher boy into the gig and drive pen over  when the grand company began to fill the house at clavering park the chevalier strong who as his patron said was never in the way or out of it seldom intruded himself upon its society but went elsewhere to seek his relaxation ive seen plenty of grand dinners in my time he said and dined by jove in a company where there was a king and royal duke at top and bottom and every man along the table had six stars on his coat but dammy glanders this finery dont suit me and the english ladies with their confounded buckram airs and the squires with their politics after dinner send me to sleepsink me dead if they dont i like a place where i can blow my cigar when the cloth is removed and when im thirsty have my beer in its native pewter so on a galaday at clavering park the chevalier would content himself with superintending the arrangements of the table and drilling the majordomo and servants and having looked over the billoffare with monsieur mirobolant would not care to take the least part in the banquet send me up a cutlet and a bottle of claret to my room this philosopher would say and from the windows of that apartment which commanded the terrace and avenue he would survey the company as they arrived in their carriages or take a peep at the ladies in the hall through an oeildeboeuf which commanded it from his corridor and the guests being seated strong would cross the park to captain glanderss cottage at clavering or to pay the landlady a visit at the clavering arms or to drop in upon madame fribsby over her novel and tea wherever the chevalier went he was welcome and whenever he came away a smell of hot brandyandwater lingered behind him  the butcher boynot the worst horse in sir franciss stablewas appropriated to captain strongs express use and the old campaigner saddled him or brought him home at all hours of the day or night and drove or rode him up and down the country where there was a publichouse with a good tap of beerwhere there was a tenant with a pretty daughter who played on the pianoto chatteris to the play or the barracksto baymouth if any fun was on foot there to the rural fairs or races the chevalier and his brown horse made their way continually and this worthy gentleman lived at free quarters in a friendly country the butcher boy soon took pen and the chevalier to baymouth the latter was as familiar with the hotel and landlord there as with every other inn round about and having been accommodated with a bedroom to dress they entered the ballroom the chevalier was splendid he wore three little gold crosses in a brochette on the portly breast of his blue coat and looked like a foreign fieldmarshal  the ball was public and all sorts of persons were admitted and encouraged to come young pynsent having views upon the county and lady rockminster being patroness of the ball there was a quadrille for the aristocracy at one end and select benches for the people of fashion towards this end the chevalier did not care to penetrate far as he said he did not care for the nobs but in the other part of the room he knew everybodythe winemerchants innkeepers tradesmens solicitors squirefarmers daughters their sires and brothers and plunged about shaking hands  who is that man with the blue ribbon and the threepointed star asked pen a gentleman in black with ringlets and a tuft stood gazing fiercely about him with one hand in the armhole of his waistcoat and the other holding his claque  by jupiter its mirobolant cried strong bursting out laughing bon jour chefbon jour chevalier  de la croix de juillet chevalier said the chef laying his hand on his decoration  by jove heres some more ribbon said pen amused  a man with very black hair and whiskers dyed evidently with the purple of tyre with twinkling eyes and white eyelashes and a thousand wrinkles in his face which was of a strange red colour with two undervests and large gloves and hands and a profusion of diamonds and jewels in his waistcoat and stock with coarse feet crumpled into immense shiny boots and a piece of particoloured ribbon in his buttonhole here came up and nodded familiarly to the chevalier  the chevalier shook hands my friend mr pendennis strong said colonel altamont of the bodyguard of his highness the nawaub of lucknow that officer bowed to the salute of pen who was now looking out eagerly to see if the person wanted had entered the room  not yet but the band began presently performing see the conquering hero comes and a host of fashionablesdowager countess of rockminster mr pynsent and miss bell sir francis clavering bart of clavering park lady clavering and miss amory sir horace fogey bart lady fogey colonel and mrs higgs wagg esq as the county paper afterwards described them entered the room  pen rushed by blanche ran up to laura and seized her hand god bless you he said i want to speak to youi must speak to youlet me dance with you not for three dances dear pen she said smiling and he fell back biting his nails with vexation and forgetting to salute pynsent  after lady rockminsters party lady claverings followed in the procession  colonel altamont eyed it hard holding a most musky pockethandkerchief up to his face and bursting with laughter behind it  whos the gal in green along with em capn he asked of strong  thats miss amory lady claverings daughter replied the chevalier  the colonel could hardly contain himself for laughing     chapter xxvii contains some ballpractising   under some calico draperies in the shady embrasure of a window arthur pendennis chose to assume a very gloomy and frowning countenance and to watch miss bell dance her first quadrille with mr pynsent for a partner that gentleman was as solemn and severe as englishmen are upon such occasions and walked through the dance as he would have walked up to his pew in church without a smile upon his face or allowing any outward circumstance to interfere with his attention to the grave duty in which he was engaged but miss lauras face was beaming with pleasure and goodnature the lights and the crowd and music excited her as she spread out her white robes and performed her part of the dance smiling and happy her brown ringlets flowing back over her fair shoulders from her honest rosy face more than one gentleman in the room admired and looked after her and lady fogey who had a house in london and gave herself no small airs of fashion when in the country asked of lady rockminster who the young person was mentioned a reigning beauty in london whom in her ladyships opinion laura was rather like and pronounced that she would do  lady rockminster would have been very much surprised if any protegee of hers would not do and wondered at lady fogeys impudence in judging upon the point at all she surveyed laura with majestic glances through her eyeglass she was pleased with the girls artless looks and gay innocent manner her manner is very good her ladyship thought her arms are rather red but that is a defect of her youth her tone is far better than that of the little pert miss amory who is dancing opposite to her  miss blanche was indeed the visavis of miss laura and smiled most killingly upon her dearest friend and nodded to her and talked to her when they met during the quadrille evolutions and patronised her a great deal her shoulders were the whitest in the whole room and they were never easy in her frock for one single instant nor were her eyes which rolled about incessantly nor was her little figureit seemed to say to all the people come and look at menot at that pink healthy bouncing country lass miss bell who scarcely knew how to dance till i taught her this is the true parisian mannerthis is the prettiest little foot in the room and the prettiest little chaussure too look at it mr pynsent look at it mr pendennis you who are scowling behind the curtaini know you are longing to dance with me  laura went on dancing and keeping an attentive eye upon mr pen in the embrasure of the window he did not quit that retirement during the first quadrille nor until the second when the goodnatured lady clavering beckoned to him to come up to her to the dais or place of honour where the dowagers wereand whither pen went blushing and exceedingly awkward as most conceited young fellows are he performed a haughty salutation to lady rockminster who hardly acknowledged his bow and then went and paid his respects to the widow of the late amory who was splendid in diamonds velvet lace feathers and all sorts of millinery and goldsmiths ware  young mr fogey then in the fifth form at eton and ardently expecting his beard and his commission in a dragoon regiment was the second partner who was honoured with miss bells hand he was rapt in admiration of that young lady he thought he had never seen so charming a creature i like you much better than the french girl for this young gentleman had been dancing with miss amory before he candidly said to her laura laughed and looked more goodhumoured than ever and in the midst of her laughter caught a sight of pen and continued to laugh as he on his side continued to look absurdly pompous and sulky the next dance was a waltz and young fogey thought with a sigh that he did not know how to waltz and vowed he would have a master the next holidays  mr pynsent again claimed miss bells hand for this dance and pen beheld her in a fury twirling round the room her waist encircled by the arm of that gentleman he never used to be angry before when on summer evenings the chairs and tables being removed and the governess called downstairs to play the piano he and the chevalier strong who was a splendid performer and could dance a british hornpipe a german waltz or a spanish fandango if need were and the two young ladies blanche and laura improvised little balls at clavering park laura enjoyed this dancing so much and was so animated that she even animated mr pynsent blanche who could dance beautifully had an unlucky partner captain broadfoot of the dragoons then stationed at chatteris for captain broadfoot though devoting himself with great energy to the object in view could not get round in time and not having the least ear for music was unaware that his movements were too slow  so in the waltz as in the quadrille miss blanche saw that her dear friend laura had the honours of the dance and was by no means pleased with the latters success after a couple of turns with the heavy dragoon she pleaded fatigue and requested to be led back to her place near her mamma to whom pen was talking and she asked him why he had not asked her to waltz and had left her for the mercies of that great odious man in spurs and a red coat  i thought spurs and scarlet were the most fascinating objects in the world to young ladies pen answered i never should have dared to put my black coat in competition with that splendid red jacket  you are very unkind and cruel and sulky and naughty said miss amory with another shrug of the shoulders you had better go away your cousin is looking at us over mr pynsents shoulder  will you waltz with me said pen  not this waltz i cant having just sent away that good captain broadfoot look at mr pynsent did you ever see such a creature but i will dance the next waltz with you and the quadrille too i am promised but i will tell mr poole that i had forgotten my engagement to you  women forget very readily pendennis said  but they always come back and are very repentant and sorry for what theyve done blanche said see here comes the foker and dear laura leaning on him how pretty she looks  laura came up and put out her hand to pen to whom pynsent made a sort of bow appearing to be not much more graceful than that domestic instrument to which miss amory compared him  but lauras face was full of kindness i am so glad to have come dear pen she said i can speak to you now how is mamma the three dances are over and i am engaged to you for the next pen  i have just engaged myself to miss amory said pen and miss amory nodded her head and made her usual little curtsey i dont intend to give him up dearest laura she said  well then hell waltz with me dear blanche said the other wont you pen  i promised to waltz with miss amory  provoking said laura and making a curtsey in her turn she went and placed herself under the ample wing of lady rockminster  pen was delighted with his mischief the two prettiest girls in the room were quarrelling about him he flattered himself he had punished miss laura he leaned in a dandified air with his elbow over the wall and talked to blanche he quizzed unmercifully all the men in the roomthe heavy dragoons in their tight jacketsthe country dandies in their queer attirethe strange toilettes of the ladies one seemed to have a birds nest in her head another had six pounds of grapes in her hair besides her false pearls its a coiffure of almonds and raisins said pen and might be served up for dessert in a word he was exceedingly satirical and amusing  during the quadrille he carried on this kind of conversation with unflinching bitterness and vivacity and kept blanche continually laughing both at his wickedness and jokes which were good and also because laura was again their visavis and could see and hear how merry and confidential they were  arthur is charming tonight she whispered to laura across cornet perchs shelljacket as pen was performing cavalier seul before them drawling through that figure with a thumb in the pocket of each waistcoat  who said laura  arthur answered blanche in french oh its such a pretty name and now the young ladies went over to pens side and cornet perch performed a pas seul in his turn he had no waistcoat pocket to put his hands into and they looked large and swollen as they hung before him depending from the tight arms in the jacket  during the interval between the quadrille and the succeeding waltz pen did not take any notice of laura except to ask her whether her partner cornet perch was an amusing youth and whether she liked him so well as her other partner mr pynsent having planted which two daggers in lauras gentle bosom mr pendennis proceeded to rattle on with blanche amory and to make jokes good or bad but which were always loud laura was at a loss to account for her cousins sulky behaviour and ignorant in what she had offended him however she was not angry in her turn at pens splenetic mood for she was the most goodnatured and forgiving of women and besides an exhibition of jealousy on a mans part is not always disagreeable to a lady  as pen would not dance with her she was glad to take up with the active chevalier strong who was a still better performer than pen and being very fond of dancing as every brisk and innocent young girl should be when the waltz music began she set off and chose to enjoy herself with all her heart captain broadfoot on this occasion occupied the floor in conjunction with a lady of proportions scarcely inferior to his own miss roundle a large young woman in a strawberryice coloured crape dress the daughter of the lady with the grapes in her head whose bunches pen had admired  and now taking his time and with his fair partner blanche hanging lovingly on the arm which encircled her mr arthur pendennis set out upon his waltzing career and felt as he whirled round to the music that he and blanche were performing very brilliantly indeed very likely he looked to see if miss bell thought so too but she did not or would not see him and was always engaged with her partner captain strong but pens triumph was not destined to last long and it was doomed that poor blanche was to have yet another discomfiture on that unfortunate night while she and pen were whirling round as light and brisk as a couple of operadancers honest captain broadfoot and the lady round whose large waist he was clinging were twisting round very leisurely according to their natures and indeed were in everybodys way but they were more in pendenniss way than in anybodys else for he and blanche whilst executing their rapid gyrations came bolt up against the heavy dragoon and his lady and with such force that the centre of gravity was lost by all four of the circumvolving bodies captain broadfoot and miss roundle were fairly upset as was pen himself who was less lucky than his partner miss amory who was only thrown upon a bench against a wall  but pendennis came fairly down upon the floor sprawling in the general ruin with broadfoot and miss roundle the captain though heavy was goodnatured and was the first to burst out into a loud laugh at his own misfortune which nobody therefore heeded but miss amory was savage at her mishap miss roundle placed on her seant and looking pitifully round presented an object which very few people could see without laughing and pen was furious when he heard the people giggling about him he was one of those sarcastic young fellows that did not bear a laugh at his own expense and of all things in the world feared ridicule most  as he got up laura and strong were laughing at him everybody was laughing pynsent and his partner were laughing and pen boiled with wrath against the pair and could have stabbed them both on the spot he turned away in a fury from them and began blundering out apologies to miss amory it was the other couples faultthe woman in pink had done itpen hoped miss amory was not hurtwould she not have the courage to take another turn  miss amory in a pet said she was very much hurt indeed and she would not take another turn and she accepted with great thanks a glass of water which a cavalier who wore a blue ribbon and a threepointed star rushed to fetch for her when he had seen the deplorable accident she drank the water smiled upon the bringer gracefully and turning her white shoulder at mr pen in the most marked and haughty manner besought the gentleman with the star to conduct her to her mamma and she held out her hand in order to take his arm  the man with the star trembled with delight at this mark of her favour he bowed over her hand pressed it to his coat fervidly and looked round him with triumph  it was no other than the happy mirobolant whom blanche had selected as an escort but the truth is that the young lady had never fairly looked in the artists face since he had been employed in her mothers family and had no idea but it was a foreign nobleman on whose arm she was leaning as she went off pen forgot his humiliation in his surprise and cried out by jove its the cook  the instant he had uttered the words he was sorry for having spoken themfor it was blanche who had herself invited mirobolant to escort her nor could the artist do otherwise than comply with a ladys command blanche in her flutter did not hear what arthur said but mirobolant heard him and cast a furious glance at him over his shoulder which rather amused mr pen he was in a mischievous and sulky humour wanting perhaps to pick a quarrel with somebody but the idea of having insulted a cook or that such an individual should have any feeling of honour at all did not much enter into the mind of this lofty young aristocrat the apothecarys son  it had never entered that poor artists head that he as a man was not equal to any other mortal or that there was anything in his position so degrading as to prevent him from giving his arm to a lady who asked for it he had seen in the fetes in his own country fine ladies not certainly demoiselles but the demoiselle anglaise he knew was a great deal more free than the spinster in france join in the dance with blaise or pierre and he would have taken blanche up to lady clavering and possibly have asked her to dance too but he heard pens exclamation which struck him as if it had shot him and cruelly humiliated and angered him she did not know what caused him to start and to grind a gascon oath between his teeth  but strong who was acquainted with the poor fellows state of mind having had the interesting information from our friend madame fribsby was luckily in the way when wanted and saying something rapidly in spanish which the other understood the chevalier begged miss amory to come and take an ice before she went back to lady clavering upon which the unhappy mirobolant relinquished the arm which he had held for a minute and with a most profound and piteous bow fell back dont you know who it is strong asked of miss amory as he led her away it is the chef mirobolant  how should i know asked blanche he has a croix he is very distingue he has beautiful eyes  the poor fellow is mad for your beaux yeux i believe strong said he is a very good cook but he is not quite right in the head  what did you say to him in the unknown tongue asked miss blanche  he is a gascon and comes from the borders of spain strong answered i told him he would lose his place if he walked with you  poor monsieur mirobolant said blanche  did you see the look he gave pendennisstrong asked enjoying the idea of the mischiefi think he would like to run little pen through with one of his spits  he is an odious conceited clumsy creature that mr pen said blanche  broadfoot looked as if he would like to kill him too so did pynsent strong said what ice will you havewater ice or cream ice  water ice who is that odd man staring at mehe is decore too  that is my friend colonel altamont a very queer character in the service of the nawaub of lucknow hallo whats that noise ill be back in an instant said the chevalier and sprang out of the room to the ballroom where a scuffle and a noise of high voices was heard  the refreshmentroom in which miss amory now found herself was a room set apart for the purposes of supper which mr rincer the landlord had provided for those who chose to partake at the rate of five shillings per head also refreshments of a superior class were here ready for the ladies and gentlemen of the county families who came to the ball but the commoner sort of persons were kept out of the room by a waiter who stood at the portal and who said that was a select room for lady clavering and lady rockminsters parties and not to be opened to the public till suppertime which was not to be until past midnight pynsent who danced with his constituents daughters took them and their mammas in for their refreshment there strong who was manager and master of the revels wherever he went had of course the entreeand the only person who was now occupying the room was the gentleman with the black wig and the orders in his buttonhole the officer in the service of his highness the nawaub of lucknow  this gentleman had established himself very early in the evening in this apartment where saying he was confoundedly thirsty he called for a bottle of champagne at this order the waiter instantly supposed that he had to do with a grandee and the colonel sate down and began to eat his supper and absorb his drink and enter affably into conversation with anybody who entered the room  sir francis clavering and mr wagg found him there when they left the ballroom which they did pretty earlysir francis to go and smoke a cigar and look at the people gathered outside the ballroom on the shore which he declared was much better fun than to remain within mr wagg to hang on to a baronets arm as he was always pleased to do on the arm of the greatest man in the company colonel altamont had stared at these gentlemen in so odd a manner as they passed through the select room that clavering made inquiries of the landlord who he was and hinted a strong opinion that the officer of the nawaubs service was drunk  mr pynsent too had had the honour of a conversation with the servant of the indian potentate it was pynsents cue to speak to everybody which he did to do him justice in the most ungracious manner and he took the gentleman in the black wig for some constituent some merchant captain or other outlandish man of the place mr pynsent then coming into the refreshmentroom with a lady the wife of a constituent on his arm the colonel asked him if he would try a glass of sham pynsent took it with great gravity bowed tasted the wine and pronounced it excellent and with the utmost politeness retreated before colonel altamont this gravity and decorum routed and surprised the colonel more than any other kind of behaviour probably would he stared after pynsent stupidly and pronounced to the landlord over the counter that he was a rum one mr rincer blushed and hardly knew what to say mr pynsent was a county earls grandson going to set up as a parliament man colonel altamont on the other hand wore orders and diamonds jingled sovereigns constantly in his pocket and paid his way like a man so not knowing what to say mr rincer said yes colonelyes maam did you say tea cup a tea for mr jones mrs r and so got off that discussion regarding mr pynsents qualities into which the nizams officer appeared inclined to enter  in fact if the truth must be told mr altamont having remained at the buffet almost all night and employed himself very actively whilst there had considerably flushed his brain by drinking and he was still going on drinking when mr strong and miss amory entered the room  when the chevalier ran out of the apartment attracted by the noise in the dancingroom the colonel rose from his chair with his little red eyes glowing like coals and with rather an unsteady gait advanced towards blanche who was sipping her ice she was absorbed in absorbing it for it was very fresh and good or she was not curious to know what was going on in the adjoining room although the waiters were who ran after chevalier strong so that when she looked up from her glass she beheld this strange man staring at her out of his little red eyes who was he it was quite exciting  and so youre betsy amory said he after gazing at her betsy amory by jove  whowho speaks to me said betsy alias blanche  but the noise in the ballroom is really becoming so loud that we must rush back thither and see what is the cause of the disturbance     chapter xxviii which is both quarrelsome and sentimental   civil war was raging high words passing people pushing and squeezing together in an unseemly manner round a window in the corner of the ballroom close by the door through which the chevalier strong shouldered his way through the opened window the crowd in the street below was sending up sarcastic remarks such as pitch into him wheres the police and the like and a ring of individuals amongst whom madame fribsby was conspicuous was gathered round monsieur alcide mirobolant on the one side whilst several gentlemen and ladies surrounded our friend arthur pendennis on the other strong penetrated into this assembly elbowing by madame fribsby who was charmed at the chevaliers appearance and cried save him save him in frantic and pathetic accents  the cause of the disturbance it appeared was the angry little chef of sir francis claverings culinary establishment shortly after strong had quitted the room and whilst mr pen greatly irate at his downfall in the waltz which had made him look ridiculous in the eyes of the nation and by miss amorys behaviour to him which had still further insulted his dignity was endeavouring to get some coolness of body and temper by looking out of window towards the sea which was sparkling in the distance and murmuring in a wonderful calmwhilst he was really trying to compose himself and owning to himself perhaps that he had acted in a very absurd and peevish manner during the nighthe felt a hand upon his shoulder and on looking round beheld to his utter surprise and horror that the hand in question belonged to monsieur mirobolant whose eyes were glaring out of his pale face and ringlets at mr pen to be tapped on the shoulder by a french cook was a piece of familiarity which made the blood of the pendennises to boil up in the veins of their descendant and he was astounded almost more than enraged at such an indignity  you speak french mirobolant said in his own language to pen  what is that to you pray said pen in english  at any rate you understand it continued the other with a bow  yes sir said pen with a stamp of his foot i understand it pretty well  vous me comprendrez alors monsieur pendennis replied the other rolling out his r with gascon force quand je vous dis que vous etes un lache monsieur pendennisun lache entendezvous  what said pen starting round on him  you understand the meaning of the word and its consequences among men of honour the artist said putting his hand on his hip and staring at pen  the consequences are that i will fling you out of window you impudent scoundrel bawled out mr pen and darting upon the frenchman he would very likely have put his threat into execution for the window was at hand and the artist by no means a match for the young gentlemanhad not captain broadfoot and another heavy officer flung themselves between the combatantshad not the ladies begun to screamhad not the fiddles stopped had not the crowd of people come running in that directionhad not laura with a face of great alarm looked over their heads and asked for heavens sake what was wronghad not the opportune strong made his appearance from the refreshmentroom and found alcides grinding his teeth and jabbering oaths in his galleon french and pen looking uncommonly wicked although trying to appear as calm as possible when the ladies and the crowd came up  what has happened strong asked of the chef in spanish  i am chevalier de juillet said the other slapping his breast and he has insulted me  what has he said to you asked strong  il ma appelecuisinier hissed out the little frenchman  strong could hardly help laughing come away with me poor chevalier he said we must not quarrel before ladies come away i will carry your message to mr pendennisthe poor fellow is not right in his head he whispered to one or two people about himand others and anxious lauras face visible amongst these gathered round pen and asked the cause of the disturbance  pen did not know the man was going to give his arm to a young lady on which i said that he was a cook and the man called me a coward and challenged me to fight i own i was so surprised and indignant that if you gentlemen had not stopped me i should have thrown him out of window pen said  d him serve him right toothe impudent foreign scoundrel the gentlemen said  iim very sorry if i hurt his feelings though pen added and laura was glad to hear him say that although some of the young bucks said no hang the fellowhang those impudent foreignerslittle thrashing would do them good  you will go and shake hands with him before you go to sleepwont you pen said laura coming up to him foreigners may be more susceptible than we are and have different manners if you hurt a poor mans feelings i am sure you would be the first to ask his pardon wouldnt you dear pen  she looked all forgiveness and gentleness like an angel as she spoke and pen took both her hands and looked into her kind face and said indeed he would  how fond that girl is of me he thought as she stood gazing at him shall i speak to her now nonot now i must have this absurd business with the frenchman over  laura askedwouldnt he stop and dance with her she was as anxious to keep him in the room as he to quit it wont you stop and waltz with me pen im not afraid to waltz with you  this was an affectionate but an unlucky speech pen saw himself prostrate on the ground having tumbled over miss roundle and the dragoon and flung blanche up against the wallsaw himself on the ground and all the people laughing at him laura and pynsent amongst them  i shall never dance again he replied with a dark and determined face never im surprised you should ask me  is it because you cant get blanche for a partner asked laura with a wicked unlucky captiousness  because i dont wish to make a fool of myself for other people to laugh at me pen answeredfor you to laugh at me laura i saw you and pynsent by jove no man shall laugh at me  pen pen dont be so wicked cried out the poor girl hurt at the morbid perverseness and savage vanity of pen he was glaring round in the direction of mr pynsent as if he would have liked to engage that gentleman as he had done the cook who thinks the worse of you for stumbling in a waltz if laura does we dont why are you so sensitive and ready to think evil  here again by ill luck mr pynsent came up to laura and said i have it in command from lady rockminster to ask whether i may take you in to supper  ii was going in with my cousin laura said  opray no said pen you are in such good hands that i cant do better than leave you and im going home  goodnight mr pendennis pynsent said drilyto which speech which in fact meant go to the deuce for an insolent jealous impertinent jackanapes whose ears i should like to box mr pendennis did not vouchsafe any reply except a bow and in spite of lauras imploring looks he left the room  how beautifully calm and bright the night outside is said mr pynsent and what a murmur the sea is making it would be pleasanter to be walking on the beach than in this hot room  very said laura  what a strange congregation of people continued pynsent i have had to go up and perform the agreeable to most of themthe attorneys daughtersthe apothecarys wifei scarcely know whom there was a man in the refreshmentroom who insisted upon treating me to champagnea seafaringlooking manextraordinarily dressed and seeming half tipsy as a public man one is bound to conciliate all these people but it is a hard taskespecially when one would so very much like to be elsewhereand he blushed rather as he spoke  i beg your pardon said lauraii was not listening indeedi was frightened about that quarrel between my cousin and thatthatfrench person  your cousin has been rather unlucky tonight pynsent said there are three or four persons whom he has not succeeded in pleasingcaptain broadwood what is his namethe officerand the young lady in red with whom he dancedand miss blancheand the poor chefand i dont think he seemed to be particularly pleased with me  didnt he leave me in charge to you laura said looking up into mr pynsents face and dropping her eyes instantly like a guilty little storytelling coquette  indeed i can forgive him a good deal for that pynsent eagerly cried out and she took his arm and he led off his little prize in the direction of the supperroom  she had no great desire for that repast though it was served in rincers wellknown style as the county paper said giving an account of the entertainment afterwards indeed she was very distraite and exceedingly pained and unhappy about pen captious and quarrelsome jealous and selfish fickle and violent and unjust when his anger led him astray how could her mother as indeed helen had by a thousand words and hints ask her to give her heart to such a man and suppose she were to do so would it make him happy  but she got some relief at length when at the end of half an houra long halfhour it had seemed to hera waiter brought her a little note in pencil from pen who said i met cooky below ready to fight me and i asked his pardon im glad i did it i wanted to speak to you tonight but will keep what i had to say till you come home god bless you dance away all night with pynsent and be very happypen laura was very thankful for this letter and to think that there was goodness and forgiveness still in her mothers boy  pen went downstairs his heart reproaching him for his absurd behaviour to laura whose gentle and imploring looks followed and rebuked him and he was scarcely out of the ballroom door but he longed to turn back and ask her pardon but he remembered that he had left her with that confounded pynsent he could not apologise before him he would compromise and forget his wrath and make his peace with the frenchman  the chevalier was pacing down below in the hall of the inn when pen descended from the ballroom and he came up to pen with all sorts of fun and mischief lighting up his jolly face  i have got him in the coffeeroom he said with a brace of pistols and a candle or would you like swords on the beach mirobolant is a dead hand with the foils and killed four gardesducorps with his own point in the barricades of july  confound it said pen in a fury i cant fight a cook  he is a chevalier of july replied the other they present arms to him in his own country  and do you ask me captain strong to go out with a servant pen asked fiercely ill call a policeman him butbut  youll invite me to hair triggers cried strong with a laugh thank you for nothing i was but joking i came to settle quarrels not to fight them i have been soothing down mirobolant i have told him that you did not apply the word cook to him in an offensive sense that it was contrary to all the customs of the country that a hired officer of a household as i called it should give his arm to the daughter of the house and then he told pen the grand secret which he had had from madame fribsby of the violent passion under which the poor artist was labouring  when arthur heard this tale he broke out into a hearty laugh in which strong joined and his rage against the poor cook vanished at once he had been absurdly jealous himself all the evening and had longed for a pretext to insult pynsent he remembered how jealous he had been of oaks in his first affair he was ready to pardon anything to a man under a passion like that and he went into the coffeeroom where mirobolant was waiting with an outstretched hand and made him a speech in french in which he declared that he was sincerement fache davoir use une expression qui avoit pu blesser monsieur mirobolant et quil donnoit sa parole comme un gentilhomme quil ne lavoit jamais jamaisintende said pen who made a shot at a french word for intended and was secretly much pleased with his own fluency and correctness in speaking that language  bravo bravo cried strong as much amused with pens speech as pleased by his kind manner and the chevalier mirobolant of course withdraws and sincerely regrets the expression of which he made use  monsieur pendennis has disproved my words himself said alcide with great politeness he has shown that he is a galant homme  and so they shook hands and parted arthur in the first place despatching his note to laura before he and strong committed themselves to the butcher boy  as they drove along strong complimented pen upon his behaviour as well as upon his skill in french youre a good fellow pendennis and you speak french like chateaubriand by jove  ive been accustomed to it from my youth upwards said pen and strong had the grace not to laugh for five minutes when he exploded into fits of hilarity which pendennis has never perhaps understood up to this day  it was daybreak when they got to the brawl where they separated by that time the ball at baymouth was over too madame fribsby and mirobolant were on their way home in the clavering fly laura was in bed with an easy heart and asleep at lady rockminsters and the claverings at rest at the inn at baymouth where they had quarters for the night a short time after the disturbance between pen and the chef blanche had come out of the refreshmentroom looking as pale as a lemonice she told her maid having no other confidante at hand that she had met with the most romantic adventurethe most singular manone who had known the author of her beingher persecutedher unhappyher heroicher murdered father and she began a sonnet to his manes before she went to sleep  so pen returned to fairoaks in company with his friend the chevalier without having uttered a word of the message which he had been so anxious to deliver to laura at baymouth he could wait however until her return home which was to take place on the succeeding day he was not seriously jealous of the progress made by mr pynsent in her favour and he felt pretty certain that in this as in any other family arrangement he had but to ask and have and laura like his mother could refuse him nothing  when helens anxious looks inquired of him what had happened at baymouth and whether her darling project was fulfilled pen in a gay tone told of the calamity which had befallen laughingly said that no man could think about declarations under such a mishap and made light of the matter there will be plenty of time for sentiment dear mother when laura comes back he said and he looked in the glass with a killing air and his mother put his hair off his forehead and kissed him and of course thought for her part that no woman could resist him and was exceedingly happy that day  when he was not with her mr pen occupied himself in packing books and portmanteaus burning and arranging papers cleaning his gun and putting it into its case in fact in making dispositions for departure for though he was ready to marry this gentleman was eager to go to london too rightly considering that at threeandtwenty it was quite time for him to begin upon the serious business of life and to set about making a fortune as quickly as possible  the means to this end he had already shaped out for himself i shall take chambers he said and enter myself at an inn of court with a couple of hundred pounds i shall be able to carry through the first year very well after that i have little doubt my pen will support me as it is doing with several oxbridge men now in town i have a tragedy a comedy and a novel all nearly finished and for which i cant fail to get a price and so i shall be able to live pretty well without drawing upon my poor mother until i have made my way at the bar then some day i will come back and make her dear soul happy by marrying laura she is as good and as sweettempered a girl as ever lived besides being really very goodlooking and the engagement will serve to steady mewont it ponto thus smoking his pipe and talking to his dog as he sauntered through the gardens and orchards of the little domain of fairoaks this young daydreamer built castles in the air for himself yes shell steady me wont she and youll miss me when ive gone wont you old boy he asked of ponto who quivered his tail and thrust his brown nose into his masters fist ponto licked his hand and shoe as they all did in that house and mr pen received their homage as other folks do the flattery which they get  laura came home rather late in the evening of the second day and mr pynsent as ill luck would have it drove her from clavering the poor girl could not refuse his offer but his appearance brought a dark cloud upon the brow of arthur pendennis laura saw this and was pained by it the eager widow however was aware of nothing and being anxious doubtless that the delicate question should be asked at once was for going to bed very soon after lauras arrival and rose for that purpose to leave the sofa where she now generally lay and where laura would come and sit and work or read by her but when helen rose laura said with a blush and rather an alarmed voice that she was also very tired and wanted to go to bed so that the widow was disappointed in her scheme for that night at least and mr pen was left another day in suspense regarding his fate  his dignity was offended at being thus obliged to remain in the antechamber when he wanted an audience such a sultan as he could not afford to be kept waiting however he went to bed and slept upon his disappointment pretty comfortably and did not wake until the early morning when he looked up and saw his mother standing in his room  dear pen rouse up said this lady do not be lazy it is the most beautiful morning in the world i have not been able to sleep since daybreak and laura has been out for an hour she is in the garden everybody ought to be in the garden and out on such a morning as this  pen laughed he saw what thoughts were uppermost in the simple womans heart his goodnatured laughter cheered the widow oh you profound dissembler he said kissing his mother oh you artful creature can nobody escape from your wicked tricks and will you make your only son your victim helen too laughed she blushed she fluttered and was agitated she was as happy as she could bea good tender matchmaking woman the dearest project of whose heart was about to be accomplished  so after exchanging some knowing looks and hasty words helen left arthur and this young hero rising from his bed proceeded to decorate his beautiful person and shave his ambrosial chin and in half an hour he issued out from his apartment into the garden in quest of laura his reflections as he made his toilette were rather dismal i am going to tie myself for life he thought to please my mother laura is the best of women andand she has given me her money i wish to heaven i had not received it i wish i had not this duty to perform just yet but as both the women have set their hearts on the match why i suppose i must satisfy themand now for it a man may do worse than make happy two of the best creatures in the world so pen now he was actually come to the point felt very grave and by no means elated and indeed thought it was a great sacrifice he was going to perform  it was miss lauras custom upon her garden excursions to wear a sort of uniform which though homely was thought by many people to be not unbecoming she had a large straw hat with a streamer of broad ribbon which was useless probably but the hat sufficiently protected the owners pretty face from the sun over her accustomed gown she wore a blouse or pinafore which being fastened round her little waist by a smart belt looked extremely well and her bands were guaranteed from the thorns of her favourite rosebushes by a pair of gauntlets which gave this young lady a military and resolute air  somehow she had the very same smile with which she had laughed at him on the night previous and the recollection of his disaster again offended pen but laura though she saw him coming down the walk looking so gloomy and full of care accorded to him a smile of the most perfect and provoking goodhumour and went to meet him holding one of the gauntlets to him so that he might shake it if he likedand mr pen condescended to do so his face however did not lose its tragic expression in consequence of this favour and he continued to regard her with a dismal and solemn air  excuse my glove said laura with a laugh pressing pens hand kindly with it we are not angry again are we pen  why do you laugh at me said pen you did the other night and made a fool of me to the people at baymouth  my dear arthur i meant you no wrong the girl answered you and miss roundle looked so droll as youas you met with your little accident that i could not make a tragedy of it dear pen it wasnt a serious fall and besides it was miss roundle who was the most unfortunate  confound miss roundle bellowed out pen  im sure she looked so said laura archly you were up in an instant but that poor lady sitting on the ground in her red crape dress and looking about her with that piteous facecan i ever forget herand laura began to make a face in imitation of miss roundles under the disaster but she checked herself repentantly saying well we must not laugh at her but i am sure we ought to laugh at you pen if you were angry about such a trifle  you should not laugh at me laura said pen with some bitterness not you of all people  and why not are you such a great man asked laura  ah no laura im such a poor one pen answered havent you baited me enough already  my dear pen and how cried laura indeed indeed i didnt think to vex you by such a trifle i thought such a clever man as you could bear a harmless little joke from his sister she said holding her hand out again dear arthur if i have hurt you i beg your pardon  it is your kindness that humiliates me more even than your laughter laura pen said you are always my superior  what superior to the great arthur pendennis how can it be possible said miss laura who may have had a little wickedness as well as a great deal of kindness in her composition you cant mean that any woman is your equal  those who confer benefits should not sneer said pen i dont like my benefactor to laugh at me laura it makes the obligation very hard to bear you scorn me because i have taken your money and i am worthy to be scorned but the blow is hard coming from you  money obligation for shame pen this is ungenerous laura said flushing red may not our mother claim everything that belongs to us dont i owe her all my happiness in this world arthur what matters about a few paltry guineas if we can set her tender heart at rest and ease her mind regarding you i would dig in the fields i would go out and be a servanti would die for her you know i would said miss laura kindling up and you call this paltry money an obligation oh pen its cruelits unworthy of you to take it so if my brother may not share with me my superfluity who mayminei tell you it was not mine it was all mammas to do with as she chose and so is everything i have said laura my life is hers and the enthusiastic girl looked towards the windows of the widows room and blessed in her heart the kind creature within  helen was looking unseen out of that window towards which lauras eyes and heart were turned as she spoke and was watching her two children with the deepest interest and emotion longing and hoping that the prayer of her life might be fulfilled and if laura had spoken as helen hoped who knows what temptations arthur pendennis might have been spared or what different trials he would have had to undergo he might have remained at fairoaks all his days and died a country gentleman but would he have escaped then temptation is an obsequious servant that has no objection to the country and we know that it takes up its lodging in hermitages as well as in cities and that in the most remote and inaccessible desert it keeps company with the fugitive solitary  is your life my mothers said pen beginning to tremble and speak in a very agitated manner you know laura what the great object of hers is and he took her hand once more  what arthur she said dropping it and looking at him at the window again and then dropping her eyes to the ground so that they avoided pens gaze she too trembled for she felt that the crisis for which she had been secretly preparing was come  our mother has one wish above all others in the world laura pen said and i think you know it i own to you that she has spoken to me of it and if you will fulfil it dear sister i am ready i am but very young as yet but i have had so many pains and disappointments that i am old and weary i think i have hardly got a heart to offer before i have almost begun the race in life i am a tired man my career has been a failure i have been protected by those whom i by right should have protected i own that your nobleness and generosity dear laura shame me whilst they render me grateful when i heard from our mother what you had done for me that it was you who armed me and bade me go out for one struggle more i longed to go and throw myself at your feet and say laura will you come and share the contest with me your sympathy will cheer me while it lasts i shall have one of the tenderest and most generous creatures under heaven to aid and bear me company will you take me dear laura and make our mother happy  do you think mamma would be happy if you were otherwise arthur laura said in a low sad voice  and why should i not be asked pen eagerly with so dear a creature as you by my side i have not my first love to give you i am a broken man but indeed i would love you fondly and truly i have lost many an illusion and ambition but i am not without hope still talents i know i have wretchedly as i have misapplied them they may serve me yet they would had i a motive for action let me go away and think that i am pledged to return to you let me go and work and hope that you will share my success if i gain it you have given me so much laura dear will you take from me nothing  what have you got to give arthur laura said with a grave sadness of tone which made pen start and see that his words had committed him indeed his declaration had not been such as he would have made it two days earlier when full of hope and gratitude he had run over to laura his liberatress to thank her for his recovered freedom had he been permitted to speak then he had spoken and she perhaps had listened differently it would have been a grateful heart asking for hers not a weary one offered to her to take or to leave laura was offended with the terms in which pen offered himself to her he had in fact said that he had no love and yet would take no denial i give myself to you to please my mother he had said take me as she wishes that i should make this sacrifice the girls spirit would brook a husband under no such conditions she was not minded to run forward because pen chose to hold out the handkerchief and her tone in reply to arthur showed her determination to be independent  no arthur she said our marriage would not make mamma happy as she fancies for it would not content you very long i too have known what her wishes were for she is too open to conceal anything she has at heart and once perhaps i thoughtbut that is over nowthat i could have made youthat it might have been as she wished  you have seen somebody else said pen angry at her tone and recalling the incidents of the past days  that allusion might have been spared laura replied flinging up her head a heart which has worn out love at threeandtwenty as yours has you say should have survived jealousy too i do not condescend to say whether i have seen or encouraged any other person i shall neither admit the charge nor deny it and beg you also to allude to it no more  i ask your pardon laura if i have offended you but if i am jealous does it not prove that i have a heart  not for me arthur perhaps you think you love me now but it is only for an instant and because you are foiled were there no obstacle you would feel no ardour to overcome it no arthur you dont love me you would weary of me in three months asas you do of most things and mamma seeing you tired of me would be more unhappy than at my refusal to be yours let us be brother and sister arthur as heretoforebut no more you will get over this little disappointment  i will try said arthur in a great indignation  have you not tried before laura said with some anger for she had been angry with arthur for a very long time and was now determined i suppose to speak her mind and the next time arthur when you offer yourself to a woman do not say as you have done to me i have no hearti do not love you but i am ready to marry you because my mother wishes for the match we require more than this in return for our lovethat is i think so i have had no experience hitherto and have not had thethe practice which you supposed me to have when you spoke but now of my having seen somebody else did you tell your first love that you had no heart arthur or your second that you did not love her but that she might have you if she liked  whatwhat do you mean asked arthur blushing and still in great wrath  i mean blanche amory arthur pendennis laura said proudly it is but two months since you were sighing at her feetmaking poems to herplacing them in hollow trees by the riverside i knew all i watched youthat is she showed them to me neither one nor the other were in earnest perhaps but it is too soon now arthur to begin a new attachment go through the time of youryour widowhood at least and do not think of marrying until you are out of mourninghere the girls eyes filled with tears and she passed her hand across them i am angry and hurt and i have no right to be so and i ask your pardon in my turn now dear arthur you had a right to love blanche she was a thousand times prettier and more accomplished thanthan any girl near us here and you not could know that she had no heart and so you were right to leave her too i ought not to rebuke you about blanche amory and because she deceived you pardon me penand she held the kind hand out to pen once more  we were both jealous said pen dear laura let us both forgiveand he seized her band and would have drawn her towards him he thought that she was relenting and already assumed the airs of a victor  but she shrank back and her tears passed away and she fixed on him a look so melancholy and severe that the young man in his turn shrank before it do not mistake me arthur she said it cannot be you do not know what you ask and do not be too angry with me for saying that i think you do not deserve it what do you offer in exchange to a woman for her love honour and obedience if ever i say these words dear pen i hope to say them in earnest and by the blessing of god to keep my vow but youwhat tie binds you you do not care about many things which we poor women hold sacred i do not like to think or ask how far your incredulity leads you you offer to marry to please our mother and own that you have no heart to give away oh arthur what is it you offer me what a rash compact would you enter into so lightly a month ago and you would have given yourself to another i pray you do not trifle with your own or others hearts so recklessly go and work go and mend dear arthur for i see your faults and dare speak of them now go and get fame as you say that you can and i will pray for my brother and watch our dearest mother at home  is that your final decision laura arthur cried  yes said laura bowing her head and once more giving him her hand she went away he saw her pass under the creepers of the little porch and disappear into the house the curtains of his mothers window fell at the same minute but he did not mark that or suspect that helen had been witnessing the scene  was he pleased or was he angry at its termination he had asked her and a secret triumph filled his heart to think that he was still free she had refused him but did she not love him that avowal of jealousy made him still think that her heart was his own whatever her lips might utter  and now we ought perhaps to describe another scene which took place at fairoaks between the widow and laura when the latter had to tell helen that she had refused arthur pendennis perhaps it was the hardest task of all which laura had to go through in this matter and the one which gave her the most pain but as we do not like to see a good woman unjust we shall not say a word more of the quarrel which now befell between helen and her adopted daughter or of the bitter tears which the poor girl was made to shed it was the only difference which she and the widow had ever had as yet and the more cruel from this cause pen left home whilst it was as yet pendingand helen who could pardon almost everything could not pardon an act of justice in laura     chapter xxix babylon   our reader must now please to quit the woods and seashore of the west and the gossip of clavering and the humdrum life of poor little fairoaks and transport himself with arthur pendennis on the alacrity coach to london whither he goes once for all to face the world and to make his fortune as the coach whirls through the night away from the friendly gates of home many a plan does the young man cast in his mind of future life and conduct prudence and peradventure success and fame he knows he is a better man than many who have hitherto been ahead of him in the race his first failure has caused him remorse and brought with it reflection it has not taken away his courage or let us add his good opinion of himself a hundred eager fancies and busy hopes keep him awake how much older his mishaps and a years thought and selfcommunion have made him than when twelve months since he passed on this road on his way to and from oxbridge his thoughts turn in the night with inexpressible fondness and tenderness towards the fond mother who blessed him when parting and who in spite of all his past faults and follies trusts him and loves him still blessings be on her he prays as he looks up to the stars overhead o heaven give him strength to work to endure to be honest to avoid temptation to be worthy of the loving soul who loves him so entirely very likely she is awake too at that moment and sending up to the same father purer prayers than his for the welfare of her boy that womans love is a talisman by which he holds and hopes to get his safety and laurashe would have fain carried her affection with him too but she has denied it as he is not worthy of it he owns as much with shame and remorse confesses how much better and loftier her nature is than his ownconfesses it and yet is glad to be free i am not good enough for such a creature he owns to himself he draws back before her spotless beauty and innocence as from something that scares him he feels he is not fit for such a mate as that as many a wild prodigal who has been pious and guiltless in early days keeps away from a church which he used to frequent onceshunning it but not hostile to itonly feeling that he has no right in that pure place  with these thoughts to occupy him pen did not fall asleep until the nipping dawn of an october morning and woke considerably refreshed when the coach stopped at the old breakfasting place at b where he had had a score of merry meals on his way to and from school and college many times since he was a boy as they left that place the sun broke out brightly the pace was rapid the horn blew the milestones flew by pen smoked and joked with guard and fellowpassengers and people along the familiar road it grew more busy and animated at every instant the last team of greys came out at h and the coach drove into london what young fellow has not felt a thrill as he entered the vast place hundreds of other carriages crowded with their thousands of men were hastening to the great city here is my place thought pen here is my battle beginning in which i must fight and conquer or fall i have been a boy and a dawdler as yet oh i long i long to show that i can be a man and from his place on the coachroof the eager young fellow looked down upon the city with the sort of longing desire which young soldiers feel on the eve of a campaign  as they came along the road pen had formed acquaintance with a cheery fellowpassenger in a shabby cloak who talked a great deal about men of letters with whom he was very familiar and who was in fact the reporter of a london newspaper as whose representative he had been to attend a great wrestlingmatch in the west this gentleman knew intimately as it appeared all the leading men of letters of his day and talked about tom campbell and tom hood and sydney smith and this and the other as if he had been their most intimate friend as they passed by brompton this gentleman pointed out to pen mr hurtle the reviewer walking with his umbrella pen craned over the coach to have a long look at the great hurtle he was a boniface man said pen and mr doolan of the star newspaper for such was the gentlemans name and address upon the card which he handed to pen said faith he was and he knew him very well pen thought it was quite an honour to have seen the great mr hurtle whose works he admired he believed fondly as yet in authors reviewers and editors of newspapers even wagg whose books did not appear to him to be masterpieces of human intellect he yet secretly revered as a successful writer he mentioned that he had met wagg in the country and doolan told him how that famous novelist received three hundther pounds a volume for every one of his novels pen began to calculate instantly whether he might not make five thousand a year  the very first acquaintance of his own whom arthur met as the coach pulled up at the gloster coffeehouse was his old friend harry foker who came prancing down arlington street behind an enormous cabhorse he had white kid gloves and white reins and nature had by this time decorated him with a considerable tuft on the chin a very small cabboy vice stoopid retired swung on behind fokers vehicle knockkneed and in the tightest leather breeches foker looked at the dusty coach and the smoking horses of the alacrity by which he had made journeys in former times what foker cried out pendennishullo pen my boy said the other and he waved his whip by way of amity and salute to arthur who was very glad to see his queer friends kind old face mr doolan had a great respect for pen who had an acquaintance in such a grand cab and pen was greatly excited and pleased to be at liberty and in london he asked doolan to come and dine with him at the covent garden coffeehouse where he put up he called a cab and rattled away thither in the highest spirits he was glad to see the bustling waiter and polite bowing landlord again and asked for the landlady and missed the old boots and would have liked to shake hands with everybody he had a hundred pounds in his pocket he dressed himself in his very best dined in the coffeeroom with a modest pint of sherry for he was determined to be very economical and went to the theatre adjoining  the lights and the music the crowd and the gaiety charmed and exhilarated pen as those sights will do young fellows from college and the country to whom they are tolerably new he laughed at the jokes he applauded the songs to the delight of some of the dreary old habitues of the boxes who had ceased long ago to find the least excitement in their place of nightly resort and were pleased to see any one so fresh and so much amused at the end of the first piece he went and strutted about the lobbies of the theatre as if he was in a resort of the highest fashion what tired frequenter of the london pave is there that cannot remember having had similar early delusions and would not call them back again here was young foker again like an ardent votary of pleasure as he was he was walking with grandy tiptoff of the household brigade lord tiptoffs brother and lord colchicum captain tiptoffs uncle a venerable peer who had been a man of pleasure since the first french revolution foker rushed upon pen with eagerness and insisted that the latter should come into his private box where a lady with the longest ringlets and the fairest shoulders was seated this was miss blenkinsop the eminent actress of high comedy and in the back of the box snoozing in a wig sate old blenkinsop her papa he was described in the theatrical prints as the veteran blenkinsopthe useful blenkinsopthat old favourite of the public blenkinsopthose parts in the drama which are called the heavy fathers were usually assigned to this veteran who indeed acted the heavy father in public as in private life  at this time it being about eleven oclock mrs pendennis was gone to bed at fairoaks and wondering whether her dearest arthur was at rest after his journey at this time laura too was awake and at this time yesterday night as the coach rolled over silent commons where cottage windows twinkled and by darkling woods under calm starlit skies pen was vowing to reform and to resist temptation and his heart was at home meanwhile the farce was going on very successfully and mrs leary in a hussar jacket and braided pantaloons was enchanting the audience with her archness her lovely figure and her delightful ballads  pen being new to the town would have liked to listen to mrs leary but the other people in the box did not care about her song or her pantaloons and kept up an incessant chattering tiptoff knew where her maillots came from colchicum saw her when she came out in 14 miss blenkinsop said she sang out of all tune to the pain and astonishment of pen who thought that she was as beautiful as an angel and that she sang like a nightingale and when hoppus came on as sir harcourt featherby the young man of the piece the gentlemen in the box declared that hoppus was getting too stale and tiptoff was for flinging miss blenkinsops bouquet to him  not for the world cried the daughter of the veteran blenkinsop lord colchicum gave it to me  pen remembered that noblemans name and with a bow and a blush said he believed he had to thank lord colchicum for having proposed him at the megatherium club at the request of his uncle major pendennis  what youre wigsbys nephew are you said the peer i beg your pardon we always call him wigsby pen blushed to hear his venerable uncle called by such a familiar name we balloted you in last week didnt we yes last wednesday night your uncle wasnt there  here was delightful news for pen he professed himself very much obliged indeed to lord colchicum and made him a handsome speech of thanks to which the other listened with his double operaglass up to his eyes pen was full of excitement at the idea of being a member of this polite club  dont be always looking at that box you naughty creature cried miss blenkinsop  shes a devlish fine woman that mirabel said tiptoff though mirabel was a dd fool to marry her  a stupid old spooney said the peer  mirabel cried out pendennis  ha ha laughed out harry foker weve heard of her before havent we pen  it was pens first love it was miss fotheringay the year before she had been led to the altar by sir charles mirabel gcb and formerly envoy to the court of pumpernickel who had taken so active a part in the negotiations before the congress of swammerdam and signed on behalf of hbm the peace of pultusk  emily was always as stupid as an owl said miss blenkinsop  eh eh pas si bete the old peer said  oh for shame cried the actress who did not in the least know what he meant  and pen looked out and beheld his first love once againand wondered how he ever could have loved her  thus on the very first night of his arrival in london mr arthur pendennis found himself introduced to a club to an actress of genteel comedy and a heavy father of the stage and to a dashing society of jovial blades old and young for my lord colchicum though stricken in years bald of head and enfeebled in person was still indefatigable in the pursuit of enjoyment and it was the venerable viscounts boast that he could drink as much claret as the youngest member of the society which he frequented he lived with the youth about town he gave them countless dinners at richmond and greenwich an enlightened patron of the drama in all languages and of the terpsichorean art he received dramatic professors of all nations at his banquetsenglish from the covent garden and strand houses italians from the haymarket french from their own pretty little theatre or the boards of the opera where they danced and at his villa on the thames this pillar of the state gave sumptuous entertainments to scores of young men of fashion who very affably consorted with the ladies and gentlemen of the greenroomwith the former chiefly for viscount colchicum preferred their society as more polished and gay than that of their male brethren  pen went the next day and paid his entrancemoney at the club which operation carried off exactly onethird of his hundred pounds and took possession of the edifice and ate his luncheon there with immense satisfaction he plunged into an easychair in the library and tried to read all the magazines he wondered whether the members were looking at him and that they could dare to keep on their hats in such fine rooms he sate down and wrote a letter to fairoaks on the club paper and said what a comfort this place would be to him after his days work was over he went over to his uncles lodgings in bury street with some considerable tremor and in compliance with his mothers earnest desire that he should instantly call on major pendennis and was not a little relieved to find that the major had not yet returned to town his apartments were blank brown hollands covered his librarytable and bills and letters lay on the mantelpiece grimly awaiting the return of their owner the major was on the continent the landlady of the house said at badnbadn with the marcus of steyne pen left his card upon the shelf with the rest fairoaks was written on it still  when the major returned to london which he did in time for the fogs of november after enjoying which he proposed to spend christmas with some friends in the country he found another card of arthurs on which lamb court temple was engraved and a note from that young gentleman and from his mother stating that he was come to town was entered a member of the upper temple and was reading hard for the bar  lamb court templewhere was it major pendennis remembered that some ladies of fashion used to talk of dining with mr ayliffe the barrister who was in society and who lived there in the kings bench of which prison there was probably a branch in the temple and ayliffe was very likely an officer mr deuceace lord crabss son had also lived there he recollected he despatched morgan to find out where lamb court was and to report upon the lodging selected by mr arthur that alert messenger had little difficulty in discovering mr pens abode discreet morgan had in his time traced people far more difficult to find than arthur  what sort of a place is it morgan asked the major out of the bedcurtains in bury street the next morning as the valet was arranging his toilette in the deep yellow london fog  i should say rayther a shy place said mr morgan the lawyers lives there and has their names on the doors mr harthur lives three pair high sir mr warrington lives there too sir  suffolk warringtons i shouldnt wonder a good family thought the major the cadets of many of our good families follow the robe as a profession comfortable rooms eh  honly saw the outside of the door sir with mr warringtons name and mr arthurs painted up and a piece of paper with back at 6 but i couldnt see no servant sir  economical at any rate said the major  very sir three pair sir nasty black staircase as ever i see wonder how a gentleman can live in such a place  pray who taught you where gentlemen should or should not live morgan mr arthur sir is going to study for the bar sir the major said with much dignity and closed the conversation and began to array himself in the yellow fog  boys will be boys the mollified uncle thought to himself he has written to me a devilish good letter colchicum says he has had him to dine and thinks him a gentlemanlike lad his mother is one of the best creatures in the world if he has sown his wild oats and will stick to his business he may do well yet think of charley mirabel the old fool marrying that flame of his that fotheringay he doesnt like to come here until i give him leave and puts it in a very manly nice way i was deuced angry with him after his oxbridge escapadesand showed it too when he was here beforegad ill go and see him hang me if i dont  and having ascertained from morgan that he could reach the temple without much difficulty and that a city omnibus would put him down at the gate the major one day after breakfast at his clubnot the polyanthus whereof mr pen was just elected a member but another club for the major was too wise to have a nephew as a constant inmate of any house where he was in the habit of passing his timethe major one day entered one of those public vehicles and bade the conductor to put him down at the gate of the upper temple  when major pendennis reached that dingy portal it was about twelve oclock in the day and he was directed by a civil personage with a badge and a white apron through some dark alleys and under various melancholy archways into courts each more dismal than the other until finally he reached lamb court if it was dark in pall mail what was it in lamb court candles were burning in many of the rooms therein the pupilroom of mr hodgeman the special pleader where six pupils were scribbling declarations under the tallow in sir hokey walkers clerks room where the clerk a person far more gentlemanlike and cheerful in appearance than the celebrated counsel his master was conversing in a patronising manner with the managing clerk of an attorney at the door and in curling the wigmakers melancholy shop where from behind the feeble glimmer of a couple of lights large serpents and judges wigs were looming drearily with the blank blocks looking at the lamppost in the court two little clerks were playing at tosshalfpenny under that lamp a laundress in pattens passed in at one door a newspaper boy issued from another a porter whose white apron was faintly visible paced up and down it would be impossible to conceive a place more dismal and the major shuddered to think that any one should select such a residence good ged he said the poor boy mustnt live on here  the feeble and filthy oillamps with which the staircases of the upper temple are lighted of nights were of course not illuminating the stairs by day and major pendennis having read with difficulty his nephews name under mr warringtons on the wall of no 6 found still greater difficulty in climbing the abominable black stairs up the banisters of which which contributed their damp exudations to his gloves he groped painfully until he came to the third story a candle was in the passage of one of the two sets of rooms the doors were open and the names of mr warrington and mr a pendennis were very clearly visible to the major as he went in an irish charwoman with a pail and broom opened the door for the major  is that the beer cried out a great voice give us hold of it  the gentleman who was speaking was seated on a table unshorn and smoking a short pipe in a farther chair sate pen with a cigar and his legs near the fire a little boy who acted as the clerk of these gentlemen was grinning in the majors face at the idea of his being mistaken for beer here upon the third floor the rooms were somewhat lighter and the major could see place  pen my boy its iits your uncle he said choking with the smoke but as most young men of fashion used the weed he pardoned the practice easily enough  mr warrington got up from the table and pen in a very perturbed manner from his chair beg your pardon for mistaking you said warrington in a frank loud voice will you take a cigar sir clear those things off the chair pidgeon and pull it round to the fire  pen flung his cigar into the grate and was pleased with the cordiality with which his uncle shook him by the hand as soon as he could speak for the stairs and the smoke the major began to ask pen very kindly about himself and about his mother for blood is blood and he was pleased once more to see the boy  pen gave his news and then introduced mr warringtonan old boniface manwhose chambers he shared  the major was quite satisfied when he heard that mr warrington was a younger son of sir miles warrington of suffolk he had served with an uncle of his in india and in new south wales years ago  took a sheepfarm there sir made a fortunebetter thing than law or soldiering warrington said think i shall go there too and here the expected beer coming in in a tankard with a glass bottom mr warrington with a laugh said he supposed the major would not have any and took a long deep draught himself after which he wiped his wrist across his beard with great satisfaction the young man was perfectly easy and unembarrassed he was dressed in a ragged old shooting jacket and had a bristly blue beard he was drinking beer like a coalheaver and yet you couldnt but perceive that he was a gentleman  when he had sate for a minute or two after his draught he went out of the room leaving it to pen and his uncle that they might talk over family affairs were they so inclined  rough and ready your chum seems the major said somewhat different from your dandy friends at oxbridge  times are altered arthur replied with a blush warrington is only just called and has no business but he knows law pretty well and until i can afford to read with a pleader i use his books and get his help  is that one of the books the major asked with a smile a french novel was lying at the foot of pens chair  this is not a working day sir the lad said we were out very late at a party last nightat lady whistons pen added knowing his uncles weakness everybody in town was there except you sir counts ambassadors turks stars and gartersi dont know whoits all in the paperand my name too said pen with great glee i met an old flame of mine there sir he added with a laugh you know whom i mean sirlady mirabelto whom i was introduced over again she shook hands and was gracious enough i may thank you for being out of that scrape sir she presented me to the husband tooan old beau in a star and a blonde wig he does not seem very wise she has asked me to call on her sir and i may go now without any fear of losing my heart  what we have had some new loves have we the major asked in high goodhumour  some two or three mr pen said laughing but i dont put on my grand serieux any more sir that goes off after the first flame  very right my dear boy flames and darts and passion and that sort of thing do very well for a lad and you were but a lad when that affair with the fotheringillfotheringaywhats her name came off but a man of the world gives up those follies you still may do very well you have been bit but you may recover you are heir to a little independence which everybody fancies is a doosid deal more you have a good name good wits good manners and a good personand begad i dont see why you shouldnt marry a woman with moneyget into parliamentdistinguish yourself andand in fact that sort of thing remember its as easy to marry a rich woman as a poor woman and a devilish deal pleasanter to sit down to a good dinner than to a scrag of mutton in lodgings make up your mind to that a woman with a good jointure is a doosid deal easier a profession than the law let me tell you that look out i shall be on the watch for you and i shall die content my boy if i can see you with a good ladylike wife and a good carriage and a good pair of horses living in society and seeing your friends like a gentleman would you like to vegetate like your dear good mother at fairoaks dammy sir life without money and the best society isnt worth having it was thus this affectionate uncle spoke and expounded to pen his simple philosophy  what would my mother and laura say to this i wonder thought the lad indeed old pendenniss morals were not their morals nor was his wisdom theirs  this affecting conversation between uncle and nephew had scarcely concluded when warrington came out of his bedroom no longer in rags but dressed like a gentleman straight and tall and perfectly frank and goodhumoured he did the honours of his ragged sittingroom with as much ease as if it had been the finest apartment in london and queer rooms they were in which the major found his nephew the carpet was full of holesthe table stained with many circles of warringtons previous alepots there was a small library of lawbooks books of poetry and of mathematics of which he was very fond he had been one of the hardest livers and hardest readers of his time at oxbridge where the name of stunning warrington was yet famous for beating bargemen pulling matches winning prizes and drinking milkpunch a print of the old college hung up over the mantelpiece and some battered volumes of plato bearing its wellknown arms were on the bookshelves there were two easychairs a standing readingdesk piled with bills a couple of very meagre briefs on a brokenlegged studytable indeed there was scarcely any article of furniture that had not been in the wars and was not wounded look here sir here is pens room he is a dandy and has got curtains to his bed and wears shiny boots and a silver dressingcase indeed pens room was rather coquettishly arranged and a couple of neat prints of operadancers besides a drawing of fairoaks hung on the walls in warringtons room there was scarcely any article of furniture save a great showerbath and a heap of books by the bedside where he lay upon straw like margery daw and smoked his pipe and read half through the night his favourite poetry or mathematics  when he had completed his simple toilette mr warrington came out of this room and proceeded to the cupboard to search for his breakfast  might i offer you a muttonchop sir we cook em ourselves hot and hot and i am teaching pen the first principles of law cooking and morality at the same time hes a lazy beggar sir and too much of a dandy  and so saying mr warrington wiped a gridiron with a piece of paper put it on the fire and on it two muttonchops and took from the cupboard a couple of plates and some knives and silver forks and castors  say but a word major pendennis he said theres another chop in the cupboard or pidgeon shall go out and get you anything you like  major pendennis sate in wonder and amusement but he said he had just breakfasted and wouldnt have any lunch so warrington cooked the chops and popped them hissing hot upon the plates  pen fell to at his chop with a good appetite after looking up at his uncle and seeing that gentleman was still in goodhumour  you see sir warrington said mrs flanagan isnt here to do em and we cant employ the boy for the little beggar is all day occupied cleaning pens boots and now for another swig at the beer pen drinks tea its only fit for old women  and so you were at lady whistons last night the major said not in truth knowing what observation to make to this rough diamond  i at lady whistons not such a flat sir i dont care for female society in fact it bores me i spent my evening philosophically at the back kitchen  the back kitchen indeed said the major  i see you dont know what it means warrington said ask pen he was there after lady whistons tell major pendennis about the back kitchen pendont be ashamed of yourself  so pen said it was a little eccentric society of men of letters and men about town to which he had been presented and the major began to think that the young fellow had seen a good deal of the world since his arrival in london     chapter xxx the knights of the temple   colleges schools and inns of courts still have some respect for antiquity and maintain a great number of the customs and institutions of our ancestors with which those persons who do not particularly regard their forefathers or perhaps are not very well acquainted with them have long since done away a wellordained workhouse or prison si much better provided with the appliances of health comfort and cleanliness than a respectable foundation school a venerable college or a learned inn in the latter place of residence men are contented to sleep in dingy closets and to pay for the sittingroom and the cupboard which is their dormitory the price of a good villa and garden in the suburbs or of a roomy house in the neglected squares of the town the poorest mechanic in spitalfields has a cistern and an unbounded suppy of water at his command but the gentlemen of the inns of court and the gentlemen of the universities have their supply of this cosmetic fetched in jugs by laundresses and bedmakers and live in abodes which were erected long before the custom of cleanliness and decency obtained among us there are individuals still alive who sneer at the people and speak of them with epithets of scorn gentlemen there can be but little doubt that your ancestors were the great unwashed and in the temple especially it is pretty certain that only under the greatest difficulties and restrictions the virtue which has been pronounced to be next to godliness could have been practised at all  old grump of the norfolk circuit who had lived for more than thirty years in the chambers under those occupied by warrington and pendennis and who used to be awakened by the roaring of the showerbaths which those gentlemen had erected in their apartmentsa part of the contents of which occasionally trickled through the roof into mr grumps roomdeclared that the practice was an absurd newfangled dandified folly and daily cursed the laundress who slopped the staircase by which he had to pass grump now much more than half a century old had indeed never used the luxury in question he had done without water very well and so had our fathers before him of all those knights and baronets lords and gentlemen bearing arms whose escutcheons are painted upon the walls of the famous hall of the upper temple was there no philanthropist goodnatured enough to devise a set of hummums for the benefit of the lawyers his fellows and successors the temple historian makes no mention of such a scheme there is pump court and fountain court with their hydraulic apparatus but one never heard of a bencher disporting in the fountain and cant but think how many a counsel learned in the law of old days might have benefited by the pump  nevertheless those venerable inns which have the lamb and flag and the winged horse for their ensigns have attractions for persons who inhabit them and a share of rough comforts and freedom which men always remember with pleasure i dont know whether the student of law permits himself the refreshment of enthusiasm or indulges in poetical reminiscences as he passes by historical chambers and says yonder eldon livedupon this site coke mused upon littletonhere chitty toiledhere barnewall and alderson joined in their famous labourshere byles composed his great work upon bills and smith compiled his immortal leading caseshere gustavus still toils with solomon to aid him but the man of letters cant but love the place which has been inhabited by so many of his brethren or peopled by their creations as real to us at this day as the authors whose children they wereand sir roger de coverley walking in the temple garden and discoursing with mr spectator about the beauties in hoops and patches who are sauntering over the grass is just as lively a figure to me as old samuel johnson rolling through the fog with the scotch gentleman at his heels on their way to dr goldsmiths chambers in brick court or harry fielding with inked ruffles and a wet towel round his head dashing off articles at midnight for the covent garden journal while the printers boy is asleep in the passage  if we could but get the history of a single day as it passed in any one of those fourstoried houses in the dingy court where our friends pen and warrington dwelt some temple asmodeus might furnish us with a queer volume there may be a great parliamentary counsel on the ground floor who drives off to belgravia at dinnertime when his clerk too becomes a gentleman and goes away to entertain his friends and to take his pleasure but a short time since he was hungry and briefless in some garret of the inn lived by stealthy literature hoped and waited and sickened and no clients came exhausted his own means and his friends kindness had to remonstrate humbly with duns and to implore the patience of poor creditors ruin seemed to be staring him in the face when behold a turn of the wheel of fortune and the lucky wretch in possession of one of those prodigious prizes which are sometimes drawn in the great lottery of the bar many a better lawyer than himself does not make a fifth part of the income of his clerk who a few months since could scarcely get credit for blacking for his masters unpaid boots on the first floor perhaps you will have a venerable man whose name is famous who has lived for half a century in the inn whose brains are full of books and whose shelves are stored with classical and legal lore he has lived alone all these fifty years alone and for himself amassing learning and compiling a fortune he comes home now at night alone from the club where he has been dining freely to the lonely chambers where he lives a godless old recluse when he dies his inn will erect a tablet to his honour and his heirs burn a part of his library would you like to have such a prospect for your old age to store up learning and money and end so but we must not linger too long by mr doomsdays door worthy mr grump lives over him who is also an ancient inhabitant of the inn and who when doomsday comes home to read catullus is sitting down with three steady seniors of his standing to a steady rubber at whist after a dinner at which they have consumed their three steady bottles of port you may see the old boys asleep at the temple church of a sunday attorneys seldom trouble them and they have small fortunes of their own on the other side of the third landing where pen and warrington live till long after midnight sits mr paley who took the highest honours and who is a fellow of his college who will sit and read and note cases until two oclock in the morning who will rise at seven and be at the pleaders chambers as soon as they are open where he will work until an hour before dinnertime who will come home from hall and read and note cases again until dawn next day when perhaps mr arthur pendennis and his friend mr warrington are returning from some of their wild expeditions how differently employed mr paley has been he has not been throwing himself away he has only been bringing a great intellect laboriously down to the comprehension of a mean subject and in his fierce grasp of that resolutely excluding from his mind all higher thoughts all better things all the wisdom of philosophers and historians all the thoughts of poets all wit fancy reflection art love truth altogetherso that he may master that enormous legend of the law which he proposes to gain his livelihood by expounding warrington and paley had been competitors for university honours in former days and had run each other hard and everybody said now that the former was wasting his time and energies whilst all people praised paley for his industry there may be doubts however as to which was using his time best the one could afford time to think and the other never could the one could have sympathies and do kindnesses and the other must needs be always selfish he could not cultivate a friendship or do a charity or admire a work of genius or kindle at the sight of beauty or the sound of a sweet songhe had no time and no eyes for anything but his lawbooks all was dark outside his readinglamp love and nature and art which is the expression of our praise and sense of the beautiful world of god were shut out from him and as he turned off his lonely lamp at night he never thought but that he had spent the day profitably and went to sleep alike thankless and remorseless but he shuddered when he met his old companion warrington on the stairs and shunned him as one that was doomed to perdition  it may have been the sight of that cadaverous ambition and selfcomplacent meanness which showed itself in paleys yellow face and twinkled in his narrow eyes or it may have been a natural appetite for pleasure and joviality of which it must be confessed mr pen was exceedingly fond which deterred that luckless youth from pursuing his designs upon the bench or the woolsack with the ardour or rather steadiness which is requisite in gentlemen who would climb to those seats of honour he enjoyed the temple life with a great deal of relish his worthy relatives thought he was reading as became a regular student and his uncle wrote home congratulatory letters to the kind widow at fairoaks announcing that the lad had sown his wild oats and was becoming quite steady the truth is that it was a new sort of excitement to pen the life in which he was now engaged and having given up some of the dandified pretensions and finegentleman airs which he had contracted among his aristocratic college acquaintances of whom he now saw but little the rough pleasures and amusements of a london bachelor were very novel and agreeable to him and he enjoyed them all time was he would have envied the dandies their fine horses in rotten row but he was contented now to walk in the park and look at them he was too young to succeed in london society without a better name and a larger fortune than he had and too lazy to get on without these adjuncts old pendennis fondly thought he was busied with law because he neglected the social advantages presented to him and having been at half a dozen balls and evening parties retreated before their dulness and sameness and whenever anybody made inquiries of the worthy major about his nephew the old gentleman said the young rascal was reformed and could not be got away from his books but the major would have been almost as much horrified as mr paley was had he known what was mr pens real course of life and how much pleasure entered into his law studies  a long mornings reading a walk in the park a pull on the river a stretch up the hill to hampstead and a modest tavern dinner a bachelor night passed here or there in joviality not vice for arthur pendennis admired women so heartily that he never could bear the society of any of them that were not in his fancy at least good and pure a quiet evening at home alone with a friend and a pipe or two and a humble potation of british spirits whereof mrs flanagan the laundress invariably tested the qualitythese were our young gentlemans pursuits and it must be owned that his life was not unpleasant in termtime mr pen showed a most praiseworthy regularity in performing one part of the lawstudents course of duty and eating his dinners in hall indeed that hall of the upper temple is a sight not uninteresting and with the exception of some trifling improvements and anachronisms which have been introduced into the practice there a man may sit down and fancy that he joins in a meal of the seventeenth century the bar have their messes the students their tables apart the benchers sit at the high table on the raised platform surrounded by pictures of judges of the law and portraits of royal personages who have honoured its festivities with their presence and patronage pen looked about on his first introduction not a little amused with the scene which he witnessed among his comrades of the student class there were gentlemen of all ages from sixty to seventeen stout greyheaded attorneys who were proceeding to take the superior dignitydandies and menabout town who wished for some reason to be barristers of seven years standingswarthy blackeyed natives of the colonies who came to be called here before they practised in their own islandsand many gentlemen of the irish nation who make a sojourn in middle temple lane before they return to the green country of their birth there were little squads of reading students who talked law all dinnertime there were rowing men whose discourse was of sculling matches the red house vauxhall and the opera there were others great in politics and orators of the students debating clubs with all of which sets except the first whose talk was an almost unknown and a quite uninteresting language to him mr pen made a gradual acquaintance and had many points of sympathy  the ancient and liberal inn of the upper temple provides in its hall and for a most moderate price an excellent wholesome dinner of soup meat tarts and port wine or sherry for the barristers and students who attend that place of refection the parties are arranged in messes of four each of which quartets has its piece of beef or leg of mutton its sufficient applepie and its bottle of wine but the honest habitues of the hall amongst the lower rank of students who have a taste for good living have many harmless arts by which they improve their banquet and innocent dodges if we may be permitted to use an excellent phrase that has become vernacular since the appearance of the last dictionaries by which they strive to attain for themselves more delicate food than the common everyday roast meat of the students tables  wait a bit said mr lowton one of these temple gourmands wait a bit said mr lowton tugging at pens gownthe sidetables are very full and theres only three benchers to eat ten dishesif we wait perhaps we shall get something from their table and pen looked with some amusement as did mr lowton with eyes of fond desire towards the benchers high table where three old gentlemen were standing up before a dozen silver dishcovers while the clerk was quavering out a grace  lowton was great in the conduct of the dinner his aim was to manage so as to be the first a captain of the mess and to secure for himself the thirteenth glass of the bottle of port wine thus he would have the command of the joint on which he operated his favourite cuts and made rapid dexterous appropriations of gravy which amused pen infinitely poor jack lowton thy pleasures in life were very harmless an eager epicure thy desires did not go beyond eighteen pence  pen was somewhat older than many of his fellowstudents and there was that about his style and appearance which as we have said was rather haughty and impertinent that stamped him as a man of tonvery unlike those pale students who were talking law to one another and those ferocious dandies in rowing shirts and astonishing pins and waistcoats who represented the idle part of the little community the humble and goodnatured lowton had felt attracted by pens superior looks and presenceand had made acquaintance with him at the mess by opening the conversation  this is boiledbeef day i believe sir said lowton to pen  upon my word sir im not aware said pen hardly able to contain his laughter but added im a stranger this is my first term on which lowton began to point out to him the notabilities in the hall  thats boosey the bencher the bald one sitting under the picture and aving soup i wonder whether its turtle they often ave turtle next is balls the kings counsel and swettenhamhodge and swettenham you know thats old grump the senior of the bar they say hes dined here forty years they often send em down their fish from the benchers to the senior table do you see those four fellows seated opposite us those are regular swellstiptop fellows i can tell youmr trail the bishop of ealings son honourable fred ringwood lord cinqbars brother you know hell have a good place i bet any money and bob suckling whos always with hima high fellow too ha ha here lowton burst into a laugh  what is it said pen still amused  i say i like to mess with those chaps lowton said winking his eye knowingly and pouring out his glass of wine  and why asked pen  why they dont come down here to dine you know they only make believe to dine they dine here law bless you they go to some of the swell clubs or else to some grand dinnerparty you see their names in the morning post at all the fine parties in london why i bet anything that ringwood has his cab or trail his brougham hes a devil of a fellow and makes the bishops money spin i can tell you at the corner of essex street at this minute they dine they wont dine these two hours i dare say  but why should you like to mess with them if they dont eat any dinner pen asked still puzzled theres plenty isnt there  how green you are said lowton excuse me but you are green they dont drink any wine dont you see and a fellow gets the bottle to himself if he likes it when he messes with those three chaps thats why corkoran got in with em  ah mr lowton i see you are a sly fellow pen said delighted with his acquaintance on which the other modestly replied that he had lived in london the better part of his life and of course had his eyes about him and went on with his catalogue to pen  theres a lot of irish here he said that corkorans one and i cant say i like him you see that handsome chap with the blue neckcloth and pink shirt and yellow waistcoat thats another thats molloy maloney of ballymaloney and nephew to majorgeneral sir hector odowd he he lowton said trying to imitate the hibernian accent hes always bragging about his uncle and came into hall in silverstriped trousers the day he had been presented that other near him with the long black hair is a tremendous rebel by jove sir to hear him at the forum it makes your blood freeze and the next is an irishman too jack finucane reporter of a newspaper they all stick together those irish its your turn to fill your glass what you wont have any port dont like port with your dinner heres your health and this worthy man found himself not the less attached to pendennis because the latter disliked port wine at dinner  it was while pen was taking his share of one of these dinners with his acquaintance lowton as the captain of his mess that there came to join them a gentleman in a barristers gown who could not find a seat as it appeared amongst the persons of his own degree and who strode over the table and took his place on the bench where pen sate he was dressed in old clothes and a faded gown which hung behind him and he wore a shirt which though clean was extremely ragged and very different to the magnificent pink raiment of mr molloy maloney who occupied a commanding position in the next mess in order to notify their appearance at dinner it is the custom of the gentlemen who eat in the upper temple hall to write down their names upon slips of paper which are provided for that purpose with a pencil for each mess lowton wrote his name first then came arthur pendennis and the next was that of the gentleman in the old clothes he smiled when he saw pens name and looked at him we ought to know each other he said were both boniface men my names warrington  are you st warrington pen said delighted to see this hero  warrington laughedstunning warringtonyes he said i recollect you in your freshmans term but you appear to have quite cut me out  the college talks about you still said pen who had a generous admiration for talent and pluck the bargeman you thrashed bill simes dont you remember wants you up again at oxbridge the miss notleys the haberdashers  hush said warringtonglad to make your acquaintance pendennis heard a good deal about you  the young men were friends immediately and at once deep in collegetalk and pen who had been acting rather the fine gentleman on a previous day when he pretended to lowton that he could not drink port wine at dinner seeing warrington take his share with a great deal of gusto did not scruple about helping himself any more rather to the disappointment of honest lowton when the dinner was over warrington asked arthur where he was going  i thought of going home to dress and hear grisi in norma pen said  are you going to meet anybody there he asked  pen said noonly to hear the music of which he was fond  you had much better come home and smoke a pipe with me said warringtona very short one come i live close by in lamb court and well talk over boniface and old times  they went away lowton sighed after them he knew warrington was a baronets son and he looked up with simple reverence to all the aristocracy pen and warrington became sworn friends from that night warringtons cheerfulness and jovial temper his good sense his rough welcome and his neverfailing pipe of tobacco charmed pen who found it more pleasant to dive into shilling taverns with him than to dine in solitary state amongst the silent and polite frequenters of the polyanthus  ere long pen gave up the lodgings in st jamess to which he had migrated on quitting his hotel and found it was much more economical to take up his abode with warrington in lamb court and furnish and occupy his friends vacant room there for it must be said of pen that no man was more easily led than he to do a thing when it was a novelty or when he had a mind to it and pidgeon the youth and flanagan the laundress divided their allegiance now between warrington and pen     chapter xxxi old and new acquaintances   elated with the idea of seeing life pen went into a hundred queer london haunts he liked to think he was consorting with all sorts of menso he beheld coalheavers in their taprooms boxers in their innparlours honest citizens disporting in the suburbs or on the river and he would have liked to hob and nob with celebrated pickpockets or drink a pot of ale with a company of burglars and cracksmen had chance afforded him an opportunity of making the acquaintance of this class of society it was good to see the gravity with which warrington listened to the tutbury pet or the brighton stunner at the champions arms and behold the interest which he took in the coalheaving company assembled at the foxunderthehill his acquaintance with the publichouses of the metropolis and its neighbourhood and with the frequenters of their various parlours was prodigious he was the personal friend of the landlord and landlady and welcome to the bar as to the clubroom he liked their society he said better than that of his own class whose manners annoyed him and whose conversation bored him in society he used to say everybody is the same wears the same dress eats and drinks and says the same things one young dandy at the club talks and looks just like another one miss at a ball exactly resembles another whereas theres character here i like to talk with the strongest man in england or the man who can drink the most beer in england or with that tremendous republican of a hatter who thinks thistlewood was the greatest character in history i like better ginandwater than claret i like a sanded floor in carnaby market better than a chalked one in mayfair i prefer snobs i own it indeed this gentleman was a social republican and it never entered his head while conversing with jack and tom that he was in any respect their better although perhaps the deference which they paid him might secretly please him  pen followed him then to these various resorts of men with great glee and assiduity but he was considerably younger and therefore much more pompous and stately than warrington in fact a young prince in disguise visiting the poor of his fathers kingdom they respected him as a high chap a fine fellow a regular young swell he had somehow about him an air of imperious goodhumour and a royal frankness and majesty although he was only heirapparent to twopencehalfpenny and but one in descent from a gallypot if these positions are made for us we acquiesce in them very easily and are always pretty ready to assume a superiority over those who are as good as ourselves pens condescension at this time of his life was a fine thing to witness amongst men of ability this assumption and impertinence passes off with extreme youth but it is curious to watch the conceit of a generous and clever ladthere is something almost touching in that early exhibition of simplicity and folly  so after reading pretty hard of a morning and i fear not law merely but politics and general history and literature which were as necessary for the advancement and instruction of a young man as mere dry law after applying with tolerable assiduity to letters to reviews to elemental books of law and above all to the newspaper until the hour of dinner was drawing nigh these young gentlemen would sally out upon the town with great spirits and appetite and bent upon enjoying a merry night as they had passed a pleasant forenoon it was a jovial time that of fourandtwenty when every muscle of mind and body was in healthy action when the world was new as yet and one moved over it spurred onwards by good spirits and the delightful capability to enjoy if ever we feel young afterwards it is with the comrades of that time the tunes we hum in our old age are those we learned then sometimes perhaps the festivity of that period revives in our memory but how dingy the pleasuregarden has grown how tattered the garlands look how scant and old the company and what a number of the lights have gone out since that day grey hairs have come on like daylight streaming indaylight and a headache with it pleasure has gone to bed with the rouge on her cheeks well friend let us walk through the day sober and sad but friendly  i wonder what laura and helen would have said could they have seen as they might not unfrequently have done had they been up and in london in the very early morning when the bridges began to blush in the sunrise and the tranquil streets of the city to shine in the dawn mr pen and mr warrington rattling over the echoing flags towards the temple after one of their wild nights of carousenights wild but not so wicked as such nights sometimes are for warrington was a womanhater and pen as we have said too lofty to stoop to a vulgar intrigue our young prince of fairoaks never could speak to one of the sex but with respectful courtesy and shrank from a coarse word or gesture with instinctive delicacyfor though we have seen him fall in love with a fool as his betters and inferiors have done and as it is probable that he did more than once in his life yet for the time of the delusion it was always as a goddess that he considered her and chose to wait upon her men serve women kneelingwhen they get on their feet they go away  that was what an acquaintance of pens said to him in his hard homely wayan old friend with whom he had fallen in again in londonno other than honest mr bows of the chatteris theatre who was now employed as pianoforte player to accompany the eminent lyrical talent which nightly delighted the public at the fieldings head in covent garden and where was held the little club called the back kitchen  numbers of pens friends frequented this very merry meeting the fieldings head had been a house of entertainment almost since the time when the famous author of tom jones presided as magistrate in the neighbouring bow street his place was pointed out and the chair said to have been his still occupied by the president of the nights entertainment the worthy cutts the landlord of the fieldings head generally occupied this post when not disabled by gout or other illness his jolly appearance and fine voice may be remembered by some of my male readers he used to sing profusely in the course of the harmonic meeting and his songs were of what may be called the british brandyandwater school of songsuch as the good old english gentleman dear tom this brown jug and so forthsongs in which pathos and hospitality are blended and the praises of good liquor and the social affections are chanted in a baritone voice the charms of our women the heroic deeds of our naval and military commanders are often sung in the ballads of this school and many a time in my youth have i admired how cutts the singer after he had worked us all up to patriotic enthusiasm by describing the way in which the brave abercrombie received his deathwound or made us join him in tears which he shed liberally himself as in faltering accents he told how autumns falling leaf proclaimed the old man he must diehow cutts the singer became at once cutts the landlord and before the applause which we were making with our fists on his table in compliment to his heartstirring melody had died awaywas calling now gentlemen give your orders the waiters in the roomjohn a champagne cup for mr green i think sir you said sausages and mashed potatoes john attend on the gentleman  and ill thank ye give me a glass of punch too john and take care the wather boils a voice would cry not unfrequently a wellknown voice to pen which made the lad blush and start when he heard it firstthat of the venerable captain costigan who was now established in london and one of the great pillars of the harmonic meetings at the fieldings head  the captains manners and conversation brought very many young men to the place he was a character and his fame had begun to spread soon after his arrival in the metropolis and especially after his daughters marriage he was great in his conversation to the friend for the time being who was the neighbour drinking by his side about me daughther he told of her marriage and of the events previous and subsequent to that ceremony of the carriages she kept of mirabels adoration for her and for him of the hundther pounds which he was at perfect liberty to draw from his soninlaw whenever necessity urged him and having stated that it was his firm intention to dthraw next sathurday i give ye me secred word and honour next sathurday the fourteenth when yell see the money will be handed over to me at couttss the very instant i present the cheque the captain would not unfrequently propose to borrow a halfcrown of his friend until the arrival of that day of greek calends when on the honour of an officer and gentleman he would repee the thrifling obligetion  sir charles mirabel had not that enthusiastic attachment to his fatherinlaw of which the latter sometimes boasted although in other stages of emotion cos would inveigh with tears in his eyes against the ingratitude of the child of his bosom and the stinginess of the wealthy old man who had married her but the pair had acted not unkindly towards costigan had settled a small pension on him which was paid regularly and forestalled with even more regularity by poor cos and the period of the payments was always well known by his friend at the fieldings head whither the honest captain took care to repair banknotes in hand calling loudly for change in the midst of the full harmonic meeting i think yell find that note wont be refused at the bank of england cutts my boy captain costigan would say bows have a glass ye neednt stint yourself tonight anyhow and a glass of punch will make ye play con spirito for he was lavishly free with his money when it came to him and was scarcely known to button his breeches pocket except when the coin was gone or sometimes indeed when a creditor came by  it was in one of these moments of exultation that pen found his old friend swaggering at the singers table at the back kitchen of the fieldings head and ordering glasses of brandyandwater for any of his acquaintances who made their appearance in the apartment warrington who was on confidential terms with the bass singer made his way up to this quarter of the room and pen walked at his friends heels  pen started and blushed to see costigan he had just come from lady whistons party where he had met and spoken with the captains daughter again for the first time after very old old days he came up with outstretched hand very kindly and warmly to greet the old man still retaining a strong remembrance of the time when costigans daughter had been everything in the world to him for though this young gentleman may have been somewhat capricious in his attachments and occasionally have transferred his affections from one woman to another yet he always respected the place where love had dwelt and like the sultan of turkey desired that honours should be paid to the lady towards whom he had once thrown the royal pockethandkerchief the tipsy captain returning the clasp of pens hand with all the strength of a palm which had become very shaky by the constant lifting up of weights of brandyandwater looked hard in pens face and said grecious heavens is it possible me dear boy me dear fellow me dear friend and then with a look of muddled curiosity fairly broke down with i know your face me dear dear friend but bedad ive forgot your name five years of constant punch had passed since pen and costigan met arthur was a good deal changed and the captain may surly be excused for forgetting him when a man at the actual moment sees things double we may expect that his view of the past will be rather muzzy  pen saw his condition and laughed although perhaps he was somewhat mortified dont you remember me captain he said i am pendennisarthur pendennis of chatteris  the sound of the young mans friendly voice recalled and steadied coss tipsy remembrance and he saluted arthur as soon as he knew him with a loud volley of friendly greetings pen was his dearest boy his gallant young friend his noble collagian whom he had held in his inmost heart ever since they had partedhow was his fawther no his mother and his guardian the general the major i preshoom from your apparance youve come into your prawpertee and bedad yeell spend it like a man of spiritill go bail for that no not yet come into your estete if ye want any thrifle heark ye theres poor old jack costigan has got a guinea or two in his pocketand be heavens you shall never want awthur me dear boy whatll ye have john come hither and look aloive give this gentleman a glass of punch and ill pay fortyour friend ive seen him before permit me to have the honour of making meself known to ye sir and requesting yell take a glass of punch  i dont envy sir charles mirabel his fatherinlaw thought pendennis and how is my old friend mr bows captain have you any news of him and do you see him still  no doubt hes very well said the captain jingling his money and whistling the air of a songthe little doodeenfor the singing of which he was celebrated at the fieldings head me dear boyive forgot your name againbut my names costigan jack costigan and id loike ye to take as many tumblers of punch in my name as ever ye loike ye know my name im not ashamed of it and so the captain went maundering on  its payday with the general said mr hodgen the bass singer with whom warrington was in deep conversation and hes a precious deal more than half seas over he has already tried that little doodeen of his and broke it too just before i sang king death have you heard my new song the body snatcher mr warringtonangcored at saint bartholomews the other nightcomposed expressly for me peraps you or your friend would like a copy of the song sir john just ave the kyndness to and over a body snatcher ere will yertheres a portrait of me sir as i sing itas the snatcherconsidered rather like  thank you said warrington heard it nine timesknow it by heart hodgen  here the gentleman who presided at the pianoforte began to play upon his instrument and pen looking in the direction of the music beheld that very mr bows for whom he had been asking but now and whose existence costigan had momentarily forgotten the little old man sate before the battered piano which had injured its constitution wofully by sitting up so many nights and spoke with a voice as it were at once hoarse and faint and accompanied the singers or played with taste and grace in the intervals of the songs  bows had seen and recollected pen at once when the latter came into the room and had remarked the eager warmth of the young mans recognition of costigan he now began to play an air which pen instantly remembered as one which used to be sung by the chorus of villagers in the stranger just before mrs haller came in it shook pen as he heard it he remembered how his heart used to beat as that air was played and before the divine emily made her entry nobody save arthur too any notice of old bowss playing it was scarcely heard amidst the clatter of knives and forks the calls for poached eggs and kidneys and the tramp of guests and waiters  pen went up and kindly shook the player by the hand at the end of his performance and bows greeted arthur with great respect and cordiality what you havent forgot the old tune mr pendennis he said i thought youd remember it i take it it was the first tune of that sort you ever heard playedwasnt it sir you were quite a young chap then i fear the captains very bad tonight he breaks out on a payday and i shall have the deuces own trouble in getting home we live together we still hang on sir in partnership though miss emthough my lady mirabel has left the firmand so you remember old times do you wasnt she a beauty siryour health and my service to youand he took a sip at the pewter measure of porter which stood by his side as he played  pen had many opportunities of seeing his early acquaintance afterwards and of renewing his relations with costigan and the old musician  as they sate thus in friendly colloquy men of all sorts and conditions entered and quitted the house of entertainment and pen had the pleasure of seeing as many different persons of his race as the most eager observer need desire to inspect healthy country tradesmen and farmers in london for their business came and recreated themselves with the jolly singing and suppers of the back kitchensquads of young apprentices and assistants the shutters being closed over the scene of their labours came hither for fresh air doubtlessrakish young medical students gallant dashing what is called loudly dressed and must it be owned somewhat dirtywere here smoking and drinking and vociferously applauding the songs young university bucks were to be found here too with that indescribable genteel simper which is only learned at the knees of alma materand handsome young guardsmen and florid bucks from the st jamess street clubsnay senators english and irish and even members of the house of peers  the bass singer had made an immense hit with his song of the body snatcher and the town rushed to listen to it the curtain drew aside and mr hodgen appeared in the character of the snatcher sitting on a coffin with a flask of gin before him with a spade and a candle stuck in a skull the song was sung with a really admirable terrific humour the singers voice went down so low that its grumbles rumbled into the hearers awestricken soul and in the chorus he clamped with his spade and gave a demoniac ha ha which caused the very glasses to quiver on the table as with terror none of the other singers not even cutts himself as that highminded man owned could stand up before the snatcher and he commonly used to retire to mrs cuttss private apartments or into the bar before that fatal song extinguished him poor coss ditty the little doodeen which bows accompanied charmingly on the piano was sung but to a few admirers who might choose to remain after the tremendous resurrectionist chant the room was commonly emptied after that or only left in possession of a very few and persevering votaries of pleasure  whilst pen and his friend were sitting here together one night or rather morning two habitues of the house entered almost together mr hoolan and mr doolan whispered warrington to pen saluting these gentlemen and in the latter pen recognised his friend of the alacrity coach who could not dine with pen on the day on which the latter had invited him being compelled by his professional duties to decline dinnerengagements on fridays he had stated with his compliments to mr pendennis  doolans paper the dawn was lying on the table much bestained by porter and cheekbyjowl with hoolans paper which we shall call the day the dawn was liberalthe day was ultraconservative many of our journals are officered by irish gentlemen and their gallant brigade does the penning among us as their ancestors used to transact the fighting in europe and engage under many a flag to be good friends when the battle is over  kidneys john and a glass of stout says hoolan how are you morgan hows mrs doolan  doing pretty well thank ye mick my boyfaith shes accustomed to it said doolan hows the lady that owns ye maybe ill step down sunday and have a glass of punch kilburn way  dont bring patsey with you mick for our georgys got the measles said the friendly morgan and they straightway fell to talk about matters connected with their tradeabout the foreign mailsabout who was correspondent at paris and who wrote from madridabout the expense the morning journal was at in sending couriers about the circulation of the evening star and so forth  warrington laughing took the dawn which was lying before him and pointed to one of the leading articles in that journal which commenced thus  as rogues of note in former days who had some wicked work to performan enemy to be put out of the way a quantity of false coin to be passed a lie to be told or a murder to be doneemployed a professional perjurer or assassin to do the work which they were themselves too notorious or too cowardly to execute our notorious contemporary the day engages smashers out of doors to utter forgeries against individuals and calls in auxiliary cutthroats to murder the reputation of those who offend him a blackvizarded ruffian whom we will unmask who signs the forged name of trefoil is at present one of the chief bravoes and bullies in our contemporarys establishment he is the eunuch who brings the bowstring and strangles at the order of the day we can convict this cowardly slave and propose to do so the charge which he has brought against lord bangbanagher because he is a liberal irish peer and against the board of poor law guardians of the bangbanagher union is etc  how did they like the article at your place mick asked morgan when the captain puts his hand to it hes a tremendous hand at a smasher he wrote the article in two hoursinwhewyou know where while the boy was waiting  our governor thinks the public dont mind a straw about these newspaper rows and has told the docthor to stop answering said the other them two talked it out together in my room the docthor would have liked a turn for he says its such easy writing and requires no reading up of a subject but the governor put a stopper on him  the taste for eloquence is going out mick said morgan  deed then it is morgan said mick that was fine writing when the docthor wrote in the phaynix and he and condy roony blazed away at each other day after day  and with powder and shot too as well as paper says morgan faith the docthor was out twice and condy roony winged his man  they are talking about doctor boyne and captain shandon warrington said who are the two irish controversialists of the dawn and the day dr boyne being the protestant champion and captain shandon the liberal orator they are the best friends in the world i believe in spite of their newspaper controversies and though they cry out against the english for abusing their country by jove they abuse it themselves more in a single article than we should take the pains to do in a dozen volumes how are you doolan  your servant mr warringtonmr pendennis i am delighted to have the honour of seeing ye again the nights journey on the top of the alacrity was one of the most agreeable i ever enjoyed in my life and it was your liveliness and urbanity that made the trip so charming i have often thought over that happy night sir and talked over it to mrs doolan i have seen your elegant young friend mr foker too here sir not unfrequently he is an occasional frequenter of this hostelry and a right good one it is mr pendennis when i saw you i was on the tom and jerry weekly paper i have now the honour to be subeditor of the dawn one of the bestwritten papers of the empireand he bowed very slightly to mr warrington his speech was unctuous and measured his courtesy oriental his tone when talking with the two englishmen quite different to that with which he spoke to his comrade  why the devil will the fellow compliment so growled warrington with a sneer which he hardly took the pains to suppress pshawho comes hereall parnassus is abroad tonight heres archer we shall have some fun well archer house up  havent been there i have been said archer with an air of mystery where i was wanted get me some supper johnsomething substantial i hate your grandees who give you nothing to eat if it had been at apsley house it would have been quite different the duke knows what i like and says to the groom of the chambers martin you will have some cold beef not too much done and a pint bottle of pale ale and some brown sherry ready in my study as usualarcher is coming here this evening the duke doesnt eat supper himself but he likes to see a man enjoy a hearty meal and he knows that i dine early a man cant live upon air be hanged to him  let me introduce you to my friend mr pendennis warrington said with great gravity pen this is mr archer whom you have heard me talk about you must know pens uncle the major archer you who know everybody  dined with him the day before yesterday at gaunt house archer said we were fourthe french ambassador steyne and we two commoners  why my uncle is in scot pen was going to break out but warrington pressed his foot under the table as a signal for him to be quiet  it was about the same business that i have been to the palace tonight archer went on simply and where ive been kept four hours in an anteroom with nothing but yesterdays times which i knew by heart as i wrote three of the leading articles myself and though the lord chamberlain came in four times and once holding the royal teacup and saucer in his hand he did not so much as say to me archer will you have a cup of tea  indeed what is in the wind now asked warringtonand turning to pen added you know i suppose that when there is anything wrong at court they always send for archer  there is something wrong said mr archer and as the story will be all over the town in a day or two i dont mind telling it at the last chantilly races where i rode brian boru for my old friend the duke de saint cloudthe old king said to me archer im uneasy about saint cloud i have arranged his marriage with the princess marie cunegonde the peace of europe depends upon itfor russia will declare war if the marriage does not take place and the young fool is so mad about madame massena marshal massenas wife that he actually refuses to be a party to the marriage well sir i spoke to saint cloud and having got him into pretty good humour by winning the race and a good bit of money into the bargain he said to me archer tell the governor ill think of it  how do you say governor in french asked pen who piqued himself on knowing that language  oh we speak in englishi taught him when we were boys and i saved his life at twickenham when he fell out of a punt archer said i shall never forget the queens looks as i brought him out of the water she gave me this diamond ring and always calls me charles to this day  madame massena must be rather an old woman archer warrington said  devlish oldold enough to be his grandmother i told him so archer answered at once but those attachments for old women are the deuce and all thats what the king feels thats what shocks the poor queen so much they went away from paris last tuesday night and are living at this present moment at jaunays hotel  has there been a private marriage archer asked warrington  whether there has or not i dont know mr archer replied all i know is that i was kept waiting for four hours at the palace that i never saw a man in such a state of agitation as the king of belgium when he came out to speak to me and that im devilish hungryand here comes some supper  he has been pretty well tonight said warrington as the pair went home together but i have known him in much greater force and keeping a whole room in a state of wonder put aside his archery practice that man is both able and honesta good man of business an excellent friend admirable to his family as husband father and son  what is it makes him pull the long bow in that wonderful manner  an amiable insanity answered warrington he never did anybody harm by his talk or said evil of anybody he is a stout politician too and would never write a word or do an act against his party as many of us do  of us who are we asked pen of what profession is mr archer  of the corporation of the goosequillof the press my boy said warrington of the fourth estate  are you too of the craft then pendennis said  we will talk about that another time answered the other they were passing through the strand as they talked and by a newspaper office which was all lighted up and bright reporters were coming out of the place or rushing up to it in cabs there were lamps burning in the editors rooms and above where the compositors were at work the windows of the building were in a blaze of gas  look at that pen warrington said there she isthe great engineshe never sleeps she has her ambassadors in every quarter of the worldher couriers upon every road her officers march along with armies and her envoys walk into statesmens cabinets they are ubiquitous yonder journal has an agent at this minute giving bribes at madrid and another inspecting the price of potatoes in covent garden look here comes the foreign express galloping in they will be able to give news to downing street tomorrow funds will rise or fall fortunes be made or lost lord b will get up and holding the paper in his hand and seeing the noble marquis in his place will make a great speech andand mr doolan will be called away from his supper at the back kitchen for he is foreign subeditor and sees the mail on the newspaper sheet before he goes to his own  and so talking the friends turned into their chambers as the dawn was beginning to peep     chapter xxxii in which the printers devil comes to the door   pen in the midst of his revels and enjoyments humble as they were and moderate in cost if not in kind saw an awful sword hanging over him which must drop down before long and put an end to his frolics and feasting his money was very nearly spent his club subscription had carried away a third part of it he had paid for the chief articles of furniture with which he had supplied his little bedroom in fine he was come to the last fivepound note in his pocketbook and could think of no method of providing a successor for our friend had been bred up like a young prince as yet or as a child in arms whom his mother feeds when it cries out  warrington did not know what his comrades means were an only child with a mother at her country house and an old dandy of an uncle who dined with a great man every day pen might have a large bank at his command for anything that the other knew he had gold chains and a dressingcase fit for a lord his habits were those of an aristocratnot that he was expensive upon any particular point for he dined and laughed over the pint of porter and the plate of beef from the cooks shop with perfect content and good appetitebut he could not adopt the pennywise precautions of life he could not give twopence to a waiter he could not refrain from taking a cab if he had a mind to do so or if it rained and as surely as he took the cab he overpaid the driver he had a scorn for cleaned gloves and minor economies had he been bred to ten thousand a year he could scarcely have been more freehanded and for a beggar with a sad story or a couple of pretty piteousfaced children he never could resist putting his hand into his pocket it was a sumptuous nature perhaps that could not be brought to regard money a natural generosity and kindness and possibly a petty vanity that was pleased with praise even with the praise of waiters and cabmen i doubt whether the wisest of us know what our own motives are and whether some of the actions of which we are the very proudest will not surprise us when we trace them as we shall one day to their source  warrington then did not know and pen had not thought proper to confide to his friend his pecuniary history that pen had been wild and wickedly extravagant at college the other was aware everybody at college was extravagant and wild but how great the sons expenses had been and how small the mothers means were points which had not been as yet submitted to mr warringtons examination  at last the story came out while pen was grimly surveying the change for the last fivepound note as it lay upon the tray from the publichouse by mr warringtons pot of ale  it is the last rose of summer said pen its blooming companions have gone long ago and behold the last one of the garland has shed its leaves and he told warrington the whole story which we know of his mothers means of his own follies of lauras generosity during which time warrington smoked his pipe and listened intent  impecuniosity will do you good pens friend said knocking out the ashes at the end of the narration i dont know anything more wholesome for a manfor an honest man mind youfor another the medicine loses its effectthan a state of tick it is an alterative and a tonic it keeps your moral man in a perpetual state of excitement as a man who is riding at a fence or has his opponents singlestick before him is forced to look his obstacle steadily in the face and braces himself to repulse or overcome it a little necessity brings out your pluck if you have any and nerves you to grapple with fortune you will discover what a number of things you can do without when you have no money to buy them you wont want new gloves and varnished boots eau de cologne and cabs to ride in you have been bred up as a mollycoddle pen and spoilt by the women a single man who has health and brains and cant find a livelihood in the world doesnt deserve to stay there let him pay his last halfpenny and jump over waterloo bridge let him steal a leg of mutton and be transported and get out of the countryhe is not fit to live in it dixi i have spoken give us another pull at the pale ale  you have certainly spoken but how is one to live said pen there is beef and bread in plenty in england but you must pay for it with work or money and who will take my work and what work can i do  warrington burst out laughing suppose we advertise in the times he said for an ushers place at a classical and commercial academya gentleman ba of st boniface college and who was plucked for his degree  confound you cried pen  wishes to give lessons in classics and mathematics and the rudiments of the french language he can cut hair attend to the younger pupils and play a second on the piano with the daughters of the principal address a p lamb court temple  go on said pen growling  men take

otoole with whom i was at school who drives the ballynafad mail now and carries honest jack finucanes own correspondence to that city i know a man sir a doctors son likewell dont be angry i meant nothing offensivea doctors son i say who was walking the hospitals here and quarrelled with his governor on questions of finance and what did he do when he came to his last fivepound note he let his mustachios grow went into a provincial town where he announced himself as professor spineto chiropodist to the emperor of all the russians and by a happy operation on the editor of the country newspaper established himself in practice and lived reputably for three years he has been reconciled to his family and has succeeded to his fathers gallypots  hang gallypots cried pen i cant drive a coach cut corns or cheat at cards theres nothing else you propose  yes theres our own correspondent warrington said every man has his secrets look you before you told me the story of your moneymatters i had no idea but that you were a gentleman of fortune for with your confounded airs and appearance anybody would suppose you to be so from what you tell me about your mothers income it is clear that you must not lay any more hands on it you cant go on spunging upon the women you must pay off that trump of a girl laura is her namehere is your health lauraand carry a hod rather than ask for a shilling from home  but how earn one asked pen  how do i live think you said the other on my younger brothers allowance pendennis i have secrets of my own my boy and here warringtons countenance fell i made away with that allowance five years ago if i had made away with myself a little time before it would have been better i have played off my own bat ever since i dont want much money when my purse is out i go to work and fill it and then lie idle like a serpent or an indian until i have digested the mass look i begin to feel empty warrington said and showed pen a long lean purse with but a few sovereigns at one end of it  but how do you fill it said pen  i write said warrington i dont tell the world that i do so he added with a blush i do not choose that questions should be asked or perhaps i am an ass and dont wish it to be said that george warrington writes for bread but i write in the law reviews look here these articles are mine and he turned over some sheets i write in a newspaper now and then of which a friend of mine is editor and warrington going with pendennis to the club one day called for a file of the dawn and pointed with his finger silently to one or two articles which pen read with delight he had no difficulty in recognising the style afterwardsthe strong thoughts and curt periods the sense the satire and the scholarship  i am not up to this said pen with a genuine admiration of his friends powers i know very little about politics or history warrington and have but a smattering of letters i cant fly upon such a wing as yours  but you can on your own my boy which is lighter and soars higher perhaps the other said goodnaturedly those little scraps and verses which i have seen of yours show me what is rare in these days a natural gift sir you neednt blush you conceited young jackanapes you have thought so yourself any time these ten years you have got the sacred flamea little of the real poetical fire sir i think and all our oillamps are nothing compared to that though ever so well trimmed you are a poet pen my boy and so speaking warrington stretched out his broad hand and clapped pen on the shoulder  arthur was so delighted that the tears came into his eyes how kind you are to me warrington he said  i like you old boy said the other i was devlish lonely in chambers and wanted somebody and the sight of your honest face somehow pleased me i liked the way you laughed at lowtonthat poor good little snob and in fine the reason why i cannot tellbut so it is young un im alone in the world sir and i wanted some one to keep me company and a glance of extreme kindness and melancholy passed out of warringtons dark eyes  pen was too much pleased with his own thoughts to perceive the sadness of the friend who was complimenting him thank you warrington he said thank you for your friendship to me andand what you say about me i have often thought i was a poet i will be onei think i am one as you say so though the world maynt is itis it the ariadne in naxos which you liked i was only eighteen when i wrote it or the prize poem  warrington burst into a roar of laughter why young goose he yelled outof all the miserable weak rubbish i ever tried ariadne in naxos is the most mawkish and disgusting the prize poem is so pompous and feeble that im positively surprised sir it didnt get the medal you dont suppose that you are a serious poet do you and are going to cut out milton and aeschylus are you setting up to be a pindar you absurd little tomtit and fancy you have the strength and pinion which the theban eagle bear sailing with supreme dominion through the azure fields of air no my boy i think you can write a magazine article and turn a pretty copy of verses thats what i think of you  by jove said pen bouncing up and stamping his foot ill show you that i am a better man than you think for  warrington only laughed the more and blew twentyfour puffs rapidly out of his pipe by way of reply to pen  an opportunity for showing his skill presented itself before very long that eminent publisher mr bacon formerly bacon and bungay of paternoster row besides being the proprietor of the legal review in which mr warrington wrote and of other periodicals of note and gravity used to present to the world every year a beautiful gilt volume called the spring annual edited by the lady violet lebas and numbering amongst its contributors not only the most eminent but the most fashionable poets of our time young lord dodos poems first appeared in this miscellanythe honourable percy popjoy whose chivalrous ballads have obtained him such a reputationbedwin sandss eastern ghazuls and many more of the works of our young nobles were fast given to the world in the spring annual which has since shared the fate of other vernal blossoms and perished out of the world the book was daintily illustrated with pictures of reigning beauties or other prints of a tender and voluptuous character and as these plates were prepared long beforehand requiring much time in engraving it was the eminent poets who had to write to the plates and not the painters who illustrated the poems  one day just when this volume was on the eve of publication it chanced that mr warrington called in paternoster row to talk with mr hack mr bacons reader and general manager of publicationsfor mr bacon not having the least taste in poetry or in literature of any kind wisely employed the services of a professional gentleman warrington then going into mr hacks room on business of his own found that gentleman with a bundle of proof plates and sheets of the spring annual before him and glanced at some of them  percy popjoy had written some verses to illustrate one of the pictures which was called the church porch a spanish damsel was hastening to church with a large prayerbook a youth in a cloak was hidden in a niche watching this young woman the picture was pretty but the great genius of percy popjoy had deserted him for he had made the most execrable verses which ever were perpetrated by a young nobleman  warrington burst out laughing as he read the poem and mr hack laughed too but with rather a rueful faceit wont do he said the public wont stand it bungays people are going to bring out a very good book and have set up miss bunyan against lady violet we have most titles to be surebut the verses are too bad lady violet herself owns it shes busy with her own poem whats to be done we cant lose the plate the governor gave sixty pounds for it  i know a fellow who would do some verses i think said warrington let me take the plate home in my pocket and send to my chambers in the morning for the verses youll pay well of course  of course said mr hack and warrington having despatched his own business went home to mr pen plate in hand  now boy heres a chance for you turn me off a copy of verses to this  whats this a church porcha lady entering it and a youth out of a wineshop window ogling herwhat the deuce am i to do with it  try said warrington earn your livelihood for once you who long so to do it  well i will try said pen  and ill go out to dinner said warrington and left mr pen in a brown study  when warrington came home that night at a very late hour the verses were done there they are said pen ive screwed em out at last i think theyll do  i think they will said warrington after reading them they ran as follows          the church porch      although i enter not     yet round about the spot        sometimes i hover     and at the sacred gate     with longing eyes i wait        expectant of her      the minster bell tolls out     above the citys rout        and noise and humming     theyve stoppd the chiming bell     i hear the organs swell        shes coming shes coming      my lady comes at last     timid and stepping fast        and hastening hither     with modest eyes downcast     she comesshes hereshes past        may heaven go with her      kneel undisturbd fair saint     pour out your praise or plaint        meekly and duly     i will not enter there     to sully your pure prayer        with thoughts unruly      but suffer me to pace     round the forbidden place        lingering a minute     like outcast spirits who wait     and see through heavens gate        angels within it  have you got any more young fellow asked warrington we must make them give you a couple of guineas a page and if the verses are liked why youll get an entree into bacons magazines and may turn a decent penny  pen examined his portfolio and found another ballad which he thought might figure with advantage in the spring annual and consigning these two precious documents to warrington the pair walked from the temple to the famous haunt of the muses and their masters paternoster row bacons shop was an ancient lowbrowed building with a few of the books published by the firm displayed in the windows under a bust of my lord of verulam and the name of mr bacon in brass on the private door exactly opposite to bacons house was that of mr bungay which was newly painted and elaborately decorated in the style of the seventeenth century so that you might have fancied stately mr evelyn passing over the threshold or curious mr pepys examining the books in the window warrington went into the shop of mr bacon but pen stayed without it was agreed that his ambassador should act for him entirely and the young fellow paced up and down the street in a very nervous condition until he should learn the result of the negotiation many a poor devil before him has trodden those flags with similar cares and anxieties at his heels his bread and his fame dependent upon the sentence of his magnanimous patrons of the row pen looked at all the wonders of all the shops and the strange variety of literature which they exhibit in this were displayed blackletter volumes and books in the clear pale types of aldus and elzevir in the next you might see the penny horrific register the halfpenny annals of crime and history of the most celebrated murderers of all countries the raffs magazine the larky swell and other publications of the penny press whilst at the next window portraits of illfavoured individuals with facsimiles of the venerated signatures of the reverend grimes wapshot the reverend elias howle and the works written and the sermons preached by them showed the british dissenter where he could find mental pabulum hard by would be a little casement hung with emblems with medals and rosaries with little paltry prints of saints gilt and painted and books of controversial theology by which the faithful of the roman opinion might learn a short way to deal with protestants at a penny apiece or ninepence the dozen for distribution whilst in the very next window you might see come out of rome a sermon preached at the opening of the shepherds bush college by john thomas lord bishop of ealing scarce an opinion but has its expositor and its place of exhibition in this peaceful old paternoster row under the toll of the bells of saint paul  pen looked in at all the windows and shops as a gentleman who is going to have an interview with the dentist examines the books on the waitingroom table he remembered them afterwards it seemed to him that warrington would never come out and indeed the latter was engaged for some time in pleading his friends cause  pens natural conceit would have swollen immensely if he could but have heard the report which warrington gave of him it happened that mr bacon himself had occasion to descend to mr hacks room whilst warrington was talking there and warrington knowing bacons weaknesses acted upon them with great adroitness in his friends behalf in the first place he put on his hat to speak to bacon and addressed him from the table on which he seated himself bacon liked to be treated with rudeness by a gentleman and used to pass it on to his inferiors as boys pass the mark what not know mr pendennis mr bacon warrington said you cant live much in the world or you would know him a man of property in the west of one of the most ancient families in england related to half the nobility in the empirehes cousin to lord pontypoolhe was one of the most distinguished men at oxbridge he dines at gaunt house every week  law bless me you dont say so sir wellreallylaw bless me now said mr bacon  i have just been showing mr hack some of his verses which he sat up last night at my request to write and hack talks about giving him a copy of the bookthe whatdyoucallem  law bless me now does he the whatdyoucallem indeed  the spring annual is its nameas payment for those verses you dont suppose that such a man as mr arthur pendennis gives up a dinner at gaunt house for nothing you know as well as anybody that the men of fashion want to be paid  that they do mr warrington sir said the publisher  i tell you hes a star hell make a name sir hes a new man sir  theyve said that of so many of those young swells mr warrington the publisher interposed with a sigh there was lord viscount dodo now i gave his lordship a good bit of money for his poems and only sold eighty copies mr popjoys hadgincourt sir fell dead  well then ill take my man over to bungay warrington said and rose from the table this threat was too much for mr bacon who was instantly ready to accede to any reasonable proposal of mr warringtons and finally asked his manager what those proposals were when he heard that the negotiation only related as yet to a couple of ballads which mr warrington offered for the spring annual mr bacon said law bless you give him a check directly and with this paper warrington went out to his friend and placed it grinning in pens hands pen was as elated as if somebody had left him a fortune he offered warrington a dinner at richmond instantly what should he go and buy for laura and his mother he must buy something for them  theyll like the book better than anything else said warrington with the young ones name to the verses printed among the swells  thank god thank god cried arthur i neednt be a charge upon the old mother i can pay off laura now i can get my own living i can make my own way  i can marry the grand viziers daughter i can purchase a house in belgrave square i can build a fine castle in the air said warrington pleased with the others exultation well you may get bread and cheese pen and i own it tastes well the bread which you earn yourself  they had a magnum of claret at dinner at the club that day at pens charges it was long since he had indulged in such a luxury but warrington would not baulk him and they drank together to the health of the spring annual  it never rains but it pours according to the proverb so very speedily another chance occurred by which mr pen was to be helped in his scheme of making a livelihood warrington one day threw him a letter across the table which was brought by a printers boy from captain shandon sirthe little emissary said and then went and fell asleep on his accustomed bench in the passage he paid many a subsequent visit there and brought many a message to pen  f p tuesday morning  my dear sirbungay will be here today about the pall mall gazette you would be the very man to help us with a genuine westend articleyou understanddashing trenchant and d aristocratic lady hipshaw will write but shes not much you know and weve two lords but the less they do the better we must have you well give you your own terms and well make a hit with the gazette  shall b come and see you or can you look in upon me hereever yours  c s   some more opposition warrington said when pen had read the note bungay and bacon are at daggers drawn each married the sister of the other and they were for some time the closest friends and partners hack says it was mrs bungay who caused all the mischief between the two whereas shandon who reads for bungay a good deal says mrs bacon did the business but i dont know which is right peachum or lockit but since they have separated it is a furious war between the two publishers and no sooner does one bring out a book of travels or poems a magazine or periodical quarterly or monthly or weekly or annual but the rival is in the field with something similar i have heard poor shandon tell with great glee how he made bungay give a grand dinner at blackwall to all his writers by saying that bacon had invited his corps to an entertainment at greenwich when bungay engaged your celebrated friend mr wagg to edit the londoner bacon straightway rushed off and secured mr grindle to give his name to the westminster magazine when bacon brought out his comic irish novel of barney brallaghan off went bungay to dublin and produced his rollicking hibernian story of looney mactwolter when doctor hicks brought out his wanderings in mesopotamia under bacons auspices bungay produced professor sandimans researches in zahara and bungay is publishing his pall mall gazette as a counterpoise to bacons whitehall review let us go and hear about the gazette there may be a place for you in it pen my boy we will go and see shandon we are sure to find him at home  where does he live asked pen  in the fleet prison warrington said and very much at home he is there too he is the king of the place  pen had never seen this scene of london life and walked with no small interest in at the grim gate of that dismal edifice they went through the anteroom where the officers and janitors of the place were seated and passing in at the wicket entered the prison the noise and the crowd the life and the shouting the shabby bustle of the place struck and excited pen people moved about ceaselessly and restless like caged animals in a menagerie men were playing at fives others pacing and tramping this one in colloquy with his lawyer in dingy blackthat one walking sadly with his wife by his side and a child on his arm some were arrayed in tattered dressinggowns and had a look of rakish fashion everybody seemed to be busy humming and on the move pen felt as if he choked in the place and as if the door being locked upon him they never would let him out  they went through a court up a stone staircase and through passages full of people and noise and cross lights and black doors clapping and bangingpen feeling as one does in a feverish morning dream at last the same little runner who had brought shandons note and had followed them down fleet street munching apples and who showed the way to the two gentlemen through the prison said this is the captains door and mr shandons voice from within bade them enter  the room though bare was not uncheerful the sun was shining in at the windownear which sate a lady at work who had been gay and beautiful once but in whose faded face kindness and tenderness still beamed through all his errors and reckless mishaps and misfortunes this faithful creature adored her husband and thought him the best and cleverest as indeed he was one of the kindest of men nothing ever seemed to disturb the sweetness of his temper not debts not duns not misery not the bottle not his wifes unhappy position or his childrens ruined chances he was perfectly fond of wife and children after his fashion he always had the kindest words and smiles for them and ruined them with the utmost sweetness of temper he never could refuse himself or any man any enjoyment which his money could purchase he would share his last guinea with jack and tom and we may be sure he had a score of such retainers he would sign his name at the back of any mans bill and never pay any debt of his own he would write on any side and attack himself or another man with equal indifference he was one of the wittiest the most amiable and the most incorrigible of irishmen nobody could help liking charley shandon who saw him once and those whom he ruined could scarcely be angry with him  when pen and warrington arrived the captain he had been in an irish militia regiment once and the title remained with him was sitting on his bed in a torn dressinggown with a desk on his knees at which he was scribbling as fast as his rapid pen could write slip after slip of paper fell off the desk wet on to the ground a picture of his children was hung up over his bed and the youngest of them was pattering about the room  opposite the captain sate mr bungay a portly man of stolid countenance with whom the little child had been trying a conversation  papas a very clever man said she mamma says so  oh very said mr bungay  and youre a very rich man mr bundy cried the child who could hardly speak plain  mary said mamma from her work  oh never mind bungay roared out with a great laugh no harm in saying im richhe hei am pretty well off my little dear  if youre rich why dont you take papa out of pizn asked the child  mamma at this began to wipe her eyes with the work on which she was employed the poor lady had hung curtains up in the room had brought the childrens picture and placed it there and had made one or two attempts to ornament it mamma began to cry mr bungay turned red and looked fiercely out of his bloodshot little eyes shandons pen went on and pen and warrington arrived with their knock  captain shandon looked up from his work how do you do mr warrington he said ill speak to you in a minute please sit down gentlemen if you can find places and away went the pen again  warrington pulled forward an old portmanteauthe only available seatand sate down on it with a bow to mrs shandon and a nod to bungay the child came and looked at pen solemnly and in a couple of minutes the swift scribbling ceased and shandon turning the desk over on the bed stooped and picked up the papers  i think this will do said he its the prospectus for the pall mall gazette  and heres the money for it mr bungay said laying down a fivepound note im as good as my word i am when i say ill pay i pay  faith thats more than some of us can say said shandon and he eagerly clapped the note into his pocket     chapter xxxiii which is passed in the neighbourhood of ludgate hill   our imprisoned captain announced in smart and emphatic language in his prospectus that the time had come at last when it was necessary for the gentlemen of england to band together in defence of their common rights and their glorious order menaced on all sides by foreign revolutions by intestine radicalism by the artful calumnies of millowners and cottonlords and the stupid hostility of the masses whom they gulled and led the ancient monarchy was insulted the captain said by a ferocious republican rabble the church was deserted by envious dissent and undermined by stealthy infidelity the good institutions which had made our country glorious and the name of english gentleman the proudest in the world were left without defence and exposed to assault and contumely from men to whom no sanctuary was sacred for they believed in nothing holy no history venerable for they were too ignorant to have heard of the past and no law was binding which they were strong enough to break when their leaders gave the signal for plunder it was because the kings of france mistrusted their gentlemen mr shandon remarked that the monarchy of saint louis went down it was because the people of england still believed in their gentlemen that this country encountered and overcame the greatest enemy a nation ever met it was because we were headed by gentlemen that the eagles retreated before us from the donro to the garonne it was a gentleman who broke the line at trafalgar and swept the plain of waterloo  bungay nodded his head in a knowing manner and winked his eyes when the captain came to the waterloo passage and warrington burst out laughing  you see how our venerable friend bungay is affected shandon said slily looking up from his papersthats your true sort of test i have used the duke of wellington and the battle of waterloo a hundred times and i never knew the duke to fail  the captain then went on to confess with much candour that up to the present time the gentlemen of england confident of their right and careless of those who questioned it had left the political interest of their order as they did the management of their estates or the settlement of their legal affairs to persons affected to each peculiar service and had permitted their interests to be represented in the press by professional proctors and advocates that time shandon professed to consider was now gone by the gentlemen of england must be their own champions the declared enemies of their order were brave strong numerous and uncompromising they must meet their foes in the field they must not be belied and misrepresented by hireling advocates they must not have grub street publishing gazettes from whitehall thats a dig at bacons people mr bungay said shandon turning round to the publisher bungay clapped his stick on the floor hang him pitch into him capting he said with exultation and turning to warrington wagged his dull head more vehemently than ever and said for a slashing article sir theres nobody like the captingnoobody like him  the prospectuswriter went on to say that some gentlemen whose names were for obvious reasons not brought before the public at which mr warrington began to laugh again had determined to bring forward a journal of which the principles were soandso these men are proud of their order and anxious to uphold it cried out captain shandon flourishing his paper with a grin they are loyal to their sovereign by faithful conviction and ancestral allegiance they love their church where they would have their children worship and for which their forefathers bled they love their country and would keep it what the gentlemen of englandyes the gentlemen of england well have that in large caps bungay my boy have made itthe greatest and freest in the world and as the names of some of them are appended to the deed which secured our liberties at runnymede  whats that asked mr bungay  an ancestor of mine sealed it with his swordhilt pen said with great gravity  its the habeas corpus mr bungay warrington said on which the publisher answered all right i dare say and yawned though he said go on capting  at runnymede they are ready to defend that freedom today with sword and pen and now as then to rally round the old laws and liberties of england  bravo cried warrington the little child stood wondering the lady was working silently and looking with fond admiration come here little mary said warrington and patted the childs fair curls with his large hand but she shrank back from his rough caress and preferred to go and take refuge at pens knee and play with his fine watchchain and pen was very much pleased that she came to him for he was very softhearted and simple though he concealed his gentleness under a shy and pompous demeanour so she clambered up on his lap whilst her father continued to read his programme  you were laughing the captain said to warrington about the obvious reasons which i mentioned now ill show ye what they are ye unbelieving heathen we have said he went on that we cannot give the names of the parties engaged in this undertaking and that there were obvious reasons for that concealment we number influential friends in both houses of the senate and have secured allies in every diplomatic circle in europe our sources of intelligence are such as cannot by any possibility be made publicand indeed such as no other london or european journal could by any chance acquire but this we are free to say that the very earliest information connected with the movement of english and continental politics will be found only in the columns of the pall mall gazette the statesman and the capitalist the country gentleman and the divine will be amongst our readers because our writers are amongst them we address ourselves to the higher circles of society we care not to disown itthe pall mall gazette is written by gentlemen for gentlemen its conductors speak to the classes in which they live and were born the fieldpreacher has his journal the radical freethinker has his journal why should the gentlemen of england be unrepresented in the press  mr shandon then went on with much modesty to descant upon the literary and fashionable departments of the pall mall gazette which were to be conducted by gentlemen of acknowledged reputation men famous at the universities at which mr pendennis could scarcely help laughing and blushing known at the clubs and of the society which they described he pointed out delicately to advertisers that there would be no such medium as the pall mall gazette for giving publicity to their sales and he eloquently called upon the nobility of england the baronetage of england the revered clergy of england the bar of england the matrons the daughters the homes and hearths of england to rally round the good old cause and bungay at the conclusion of the reading woke up from a second snooze in which he had indulged himself and again said it was all right  the reading of the prospectus concluded the gentlemen present entered into some details regarding the political and literary management of the paper and mr bungay sate by listening and nodding his head as if he understood what was the subject of their conversation and approved of their opinions bungays opinions in truth were pretty simple he thought the captain could write the best smashing article in england he wanted the opposition house of bacon smashed and it was his opinion that the captain could do that business if the captain had written a letter of junius on a sheet of paper or copied a part of the church catechism mr bungay would have been perfectly contented and have considered that the article was a smashing article and he pocketed the papers with the greatest satisfaction and he not only paid for the ms as we have seen but he called little mary to him and gave her a penny as he went away  the reading of the manuscript over the party engaged in general conversation shandon leading with a jaunty fashionable air in compliment to the two guests who sate with him and and who by their appearance and manner he presumed to be persons of the beau monde he knew very little indeed of the great world but he had seen it and made the most of what he had seen he spoke of the characters of the day and great personages of the fashion with easy familiarity and jocular allusions as if it had been his habit to live amongst them he told anecdotes of their private life and of conversations he had had and entertainments at which he had been present and at which such and such a thing occurred pen was amused to hear the shabby prisoner in a tattered dressinggown talking glibly about the great of the land mrs shandon was always delighted when her husband told these tales and believed in them fondly every one she did not want to mingle in the fashionable world herself she was not clever enough but the great society was the very place for her charles he shone in it he was respected in it indeed shandon had once been asked to dinner by the earl of x his wife treasured the invitationcard in her workbox at that very day  mr bungay presently had enough of this talk and got up to take leave whereupon warrington and pen rose to depart with the publisher though the latter would have liked to stay to make a further acquaintance with this family who interested him and touched him he said something about hoping for permission to repeat his visit upon which shandon with a rueful grin said he was always to be found at home and should be delighted to see mr pennington  ill see you to my parkgate gentlemen said captain shandon seizing his hat in spite of a deprecatory look and a faint cry of charles from mrs shandon and the captain in shabby slippers shuffled out before his guests leading the way through the dismal passages of the prison his hand was already fiddling with his waistcoat pocket where bungays fivepound note was as he took leave of the three gentlemen at the wicket one of them mr arthur pendennis being greatly relieved when he was out of the horrid place and again freely treading the flags of farringdon street  mrs shandon sadly went on with her work at the window looking into the court she saw shandon with a couple of men at his heels run rapidly in the direction of the prison tavern she had hoped to have had him to dinner herself that day there was a piece of meat and some salad in a basin on the ledge outside of the window of their room which she had expected that she and little mary were to share with the childs father but there was no chance of that now he would be in that tavern until the hours for closing it then he would go and play at cards or drink in some other mans room and come back silent with glazed eyes reeling a little on his walk that his wife might nurse him oh what varieties of pain do we not make our women suffer  so mrs shandon went to the cupboard and in lieu of a dinner made herself some tea and in those varieties of pain of which we spoke anon what a part of confidante has that poor teapot played ever since the kindly plant was introduced among us what myriads of women have cried over it to be sure what sickbeds it has smoked by what fevered lips have received refreshment from out of it nature meant very gently by women when she made that teaplant and with a little thought what a series of pictures and groups the fancy may conjure up and assemble round the teapot and cup melissa and sacharissa are talking lovesecrets over it poor polly has it and her lovers letters upon the table his letters who was her lover yesterday and when it was with pleasure not despair she wept over them mary tripping noiselessly comes into her mothers bedroom bearing a cup of the consoler to the widow who will take no other food ruth is busy concocting it for her husband who is coming home from the harvestfieldone could fill a page with hints for such picturesfinally mrs shandon and little mary sit down and drink their tea together while the captain goes out and takes his pleasure she cares for nothing else but that when her husband is away  a gentleman with whom we are already slightly acquainted mr jack finucane a townsman of captain shandons found the captains wife and little mary for whom jack always brought a sweetmeat in his pocket over this meal jack thought shandon the greatest of created geniuses had had one or two helps from the goodnatured prodigal who had always a kind word and sometimes a guinea for any friend in need and never missed a day in seeing his patron he was ready to run shandons errands and transact his moneybusiness with publishers and newspaper editors duns creditors holders of shandons acceptances gentlemen disposed to speculate in those securities and to transact the thousand little affairs of an embarrassed irish gentleman i never knew an embarrassed irish gentleman yet but he had an aidedecamp of his own nation likewise in circumstances of pecuniary discomfort that aidedecamp has subordinates of his own who again may have other insolvent dependentsall through his life our captain marched at the head of a ragged staff who shared in the rough fortunes of their chieftain  he wont have that fivepound note very long i bet a guinea mr bungay said of the captain as he and his two companions walked away from the prison and the publisher judged rightly for when mrs shandon came to empty her husbands pockets she found but a couple of shillings and a few halfpence out of the mornings remittance shandon had given a pound to one follower had sent a leg of mutton and potatoes and beer to an acquaintance in the poor side of the prison had paid an outstanding bill at the tavern where he had changed his fivepound note had had a dinner with two friends there to whom he lost sundry halfcrowns at cards afterwards so that the night left him as poor as the morning had found him  the publisher and the two gentlemen had had some talk together after quitting shandon and warrington reiterated to bungay what he had said to his rival bacon viz that pen was a high fellow of great genius and what was more well with the great world and related to no end of the peerage bungay replied that he should be happy to have dealings with mr pendennis and hoped to have the pleasure of seeing both gents to cut mutton with him before long and so with mutual politeness and protestations they parted  it is hard to see such a man as shandon pen said musing and talking that night over the sight which he had witnessed of accomplishments so multifarious and of such an undoubted talent and humour an inmate of a gaol for half his time and a booksellers hangeron when out of prison  i am a booksellers hangeronyou are going to try your paces as a hack warrington said with a laugh we are all hacks upon some road or other i would rather be myself than paley our neighbour in chambers who has as much enjoyment of his life as a mole a deuced deal of undeserved compassion has been thrown away upon what you call your booksellers drudge  much solitary pipes and ale make a cynic of you said pen you are a diogenes by a beerbarrel warrington no man shall tell me that a man of genius as shandon is ought to be driven by such a vulgar slavedriver as yonder mr bungay whom we have just left who fattens on the profits of the others brains and enriches himself out of his journeymans labour it makes me indignant to see a gentleman the serf of such a creature as that of a man who cant speak the language that he lives by who is not fit to black shandons boots  so you have begun already to gird at the publishers and to take your side amongst our order bravo pen my be boy warrington answered laughing still what have you got to say against bungays relations with shandon was it the publisher think you who sent the author to prison is it bungay who is tippling away the fivepound note which we saw just now or shandon  misfortune drives a man into bad company pen said it is easy to cry fie against a poor fellow who has no society but such as he finds in a prison and no resource except forgetfulness and the bottle we must deal kindly with the eccentricities of genius and remember that the very ardour and enthusiasm of temperament which makes the author delightful often leads the man astray  a fiddlestick about men of genius warrington cried out who was a very severe moralist upon some points though possibly a very had practitioner i deny that there are so many geniuses as people who whimper about the fate of men of letters assert there are there are thousands of clever fellows in the world who could if they would turn verses write articles read books and deliver a judgment upon them the talk of professional critics and writers is not a whit more brilliant or profound or amusing than that of any other society of educated people if a lawyer or a soldier or a parson outruns his income and does not pay his bills he must go to gaol and an author must go too if an author fuddles himself i dont know why he should be let off a headache the next morningif he orders a coat from the tailors why he shouldnt pay for it  i would give him more money to buy coats said pen smiling i suppose i should like to belong to a welldressed profession i protest against that wretch of a middleman whom i see between genius and his great landlord the public and who stops more than half of the labourers earnings and fame  i am a prose labourer warrington said you my boy are a poet in a small way and so i suppose consider you are authorised to be flighty what is it you want do you want a body of capitalists that shall be forced to purchase the works of all authors who may present themselves manuscript in hand everybody who writes his epic every driveller who can or cant spell and produces his novel or his tragedyare they all to come and find a bag of sovereigns in exchange for their worthless reams of paper who is to settle what is good or bad saleable or otherwise will you give the buyer leave in fine to purchase or not why sir when johnson sate behind the screen at saint johns gate and took his dinner apart because he was too shabby and poor to join the literary bigwigs who were regaling themselves round mr caves best tablecloth the tradesman was doing him no wrong you couldnt force the publisher to recognise the man of genius in the young man who presented himself before him ragged gaunt and hungry rags are not a proof of genius whereas capital is absolute as times go and is perforce the bargainmaster it has a right to deal with the literary inventor as with any otherif i produce a novelty in the book trade i must do the best i can with it but i can no more force mr murray to purchase my book of travels or sermons than i can compel mr tattersall to give me a hundred guineas for my horse i may have my own ideas of the value of my pegasus and think him the most wonderful of animals but the dealer has a right to his opinion too and may want a ladys horse or a cob for a heavy timid rider or a sound hack for the road and my beast wont suit him  you deal in metaphors warrington pen said but you rightly say that you are very prosaic poor shandon there is something about the kindness of that man and the gentleness of that sweet creature of a wife which touches me profoundly i like him i am afraid better than a better man  and so do i warrington said let us give him the benefit of our sympathy and the pity that is due to his weakness though i fear that sort of kindness would be resented as contempt by a more highminded man you see he takes his consolation along with his misfortune and one generates the other or balances ii as the way of the world he is a prisoner but he is not unhappy  his genius sings within his prison bars pen said  yes warrington said bitterly shandon accommodates himself to a cage pretty well he ought to be wretched but he has jack and tom to drink with and that consoles him he might have a high place but as he cant why he can drink with tom and jackhe might be providing for his wife and children but thomas and john have got a bottle of brandy which they want him to tastehe might pay poor snip the tailor the twenty pounds which the poor devil wants for his landlord but john and thomas lay their hands upon his purseand so he drinks whilst his tradesman goes to gaol and his family to ruin let us pity the misfortunes of genius and conspire against the publishing tyrants who oppress men of letters  what are you going to have another glass of brandyandwater pen said with a humorous look it was at the black kitchen that the above philosophical conversation took place between the two young men  warrington began to laugh as usual video meliora proboquei mean bring it me hot with sugar john he said to waiter  i would have some more too only i dont want it said pen it does not seem to me warrington that we are much better than our neighbours and warringtons last glass having been despatched the pair returned to their chambers  they found a couple of notes in the letterbox on their return which had been sent by their acquaintance of the morning mr bungay that hospitable gentleman presented his compliments to each of the gentlemen and requested their pleasure of company at dinner on an early day to meet a few literary friends  we shall have a grand spread warrington we shall meet all bungays corps  all except poor shandon said pen nodding a goodnight to his friend and he went into his own little room the events and acquaintances of the day had excited him a good deal and he lay for some time awake thinking over them as warringtons vigorous and regular snore from the neighbouring apartment pronounced that that gentleman was engaged in deep slumber  is it true thought pendennis lying on his bed and gazing at a bright moon without that lighted up a corner of his dressingtable and the frame of a little sketch of fairoaks drawn by laura and hung over his drawersis it true that i am going to earn my bread at last and with my pen that i shall impoverish the dear mother no longer and that i may gain a name and reputation in the world perhaps these are welcome if they come thought the young visionary laughing and blushing to himself though alone and in the night as he thought how dearly he would relish honour and fame if they could be his if fortune favours me i laud her if she frowns i resign her i pray heaven i may be honest if i fail or if i succeed i pray heaven i may tell the truth as far as i know it that i maynt swerve from it through flattery or interest or personal enmity or party prejudice dearest old mother what a pride will you have if i can do anything worthy of our name i and you laura you wont scorn me as the worthless idler and spendthrift when you see that iwhen i have achieved apsha what an alnaschar i am because i have made five pounds by my poems and am engaged to write half a dozen articles for a newspaper he went on with these musings more happy and hopeful and in a humbler frame of mind than he had felt to be for many a day he thought over the errors and idleness the passions extravagances disappointments of his wayward youth he got up from the bed threw open the window and looked out into the night and then by some impulse which we hope was a good one he went up and kissed the picture of fairoaks and flinging himself down on his knees by the bed remained for some time in that posture of hope and submission when he rose it was with streaming eyes he had found himself repeating mechanically some little words which he had been accustomed to repeat as a child at his mothers side after the saying of which she would softly take him to his bed and close the curtains round him hushing him with a benediction  the next day mr pidgeon their attendant brought in a large brownpaper parcel directed to g warrington esq with mr trotters compliments and a note which warrington read  pen you beggar roared warrington to pen who was in his own room  hullo sung out pen  come here youre wanted cried the other and pen came out  what is it said he  catch cried warrington and flung the parcel at pens head who would have been knocked down had he not caught it  its books for review for the pall mall gazette pitch into em warrington said as for pen he never had been so delighted in his life his hand trembled as he cut the string of the packet and beheld within a smart set of new neat calicobound bookstravels and novels and poems  sport the oak pidgeon said he im not at home to anybody today and he flung into his easychair and hardly gave himself time to drink his tea so eager was he to begin to read and to review     chapter xxxiv in which the history still hovers about fleet street   captain shandon urged on by his wife who seldom meddled in business matters had stipulated that john finucane esquire of the upper temple should be appointed subeditor of forthcoming pall mall gazette and this post was accordingly conferred upon mr finucane by the spirited proprietor of the journal indeed he deserved any kindness at the hands of shandon so fondly attached was he as we have said to the captain and his family and so eager to do him a service it was in finucanes chambers that shandon in former days used to hide when danger was near and bailiffs abroad until at length his hidingplace was known and the sheriffs officers came as regularly to wait for the captain on finucanes staircase as at his own door it was to finucanes chambers that poor mrs shandon came often and often to explain her troubles and griefs and devise means of rescue for her adored captain many a meal did finucane furnish for her and the child there it was an honour to his little rooms to be visited by such a lady and as she went down the staircase with her veil over her face fin would lean over the balustrade looking after her to see that no temple lovelace assailed her upon the road perhaps hoping that some rogue might be induced to waylay her so that he fin might have the pleasure of rushing to her rescue and breaking the rascals bones it was a sincere pleasure to mrs shandon when the arrangements were made by which her kind honest champion was appointed her husbands aidedecamp in the newspaper  he would have sate with mrs shandon as late as the prison hours permitted and had indeed many a time witnessed the putting to bed of little mary who occupied a crib in the room and to whose evening prayers that god might bless papa finucane although of the romish faith himself had said amen with a great deal of sympathybut he had an appointment with mr bungay regarding the affairs of the paper which they were to discuss over a quiet dinner so he went away at six oclock from mrs shandon but made his accustomed appearance at the fleet prison next morning having arrayed himself in his best clothes and ornaments which though cheap as to cost were very brilliant as to colour and appearance and having in his pocket four pounds two shillings being the amount of his weeks salary at the daily journal minus two shillings expended by him in the purchase of a pair of gloves on his way to the prison  he had cut his mutton with mr bungay as the latter gentleman phrased it and mr trotter bungays reader and literary man of business at dicks coffeehouse on the previous day and entered at large into his views respecting the conduct of the pall mall gazette in a masterly manner he had pointed out what should be the subeditorial arrangements of the paper what should be the type for the various articles who should report the markets who the turf and ring who the church intelligence and who the fashionable chitchat he was acquainted with gentlemen engaged in cultivating these various departments of knowledge and in communicating them afterwards to the publicin fine jack finucane was as shandon had said of him and as he proudly owned himself to be one of the best subeditors of a paper in london he knew the weekly earnings of every man connected with the press and was up to a thousand dodges or ingenious economic contrivances by which money could be saved to spirited capitalists who were going to set up a paper he at once dazzled and mystified mr bungay who was slow of comprehension by the rapidity of the calculations which he exhibited on paper as they sate in the box and bungay afterwards owned to his subordinate mr trotter that that irishman seemed a clever fellow  and now having succeeded in making this impression upon mr bungay the faithful fellow worked round to the point which he had very near at heart viz the liberation from prison of his admired friend and chief captain shandon he knew to a shilling the amount of the detainers which were against the captain at the porters lodge of the fleet and indeed professed to know all his debts though this was impossible for no man in england certainly not the captain himself was acquainted with them he pointed out what shandons engagements already were and how much better he would work if removed from confinement though this mr bungay denied for when the captains locked up he said we are sure to find him at home whereas when hes free you can never catch hold of him finally he so worked on mr bungays feelings by describing mrs shandon pining away in the prison and the child sickening there that the publisher was induced to promise that if mrs shandon would come to him in the morning he would see what could be done and the colloquy ending at this time with the second round of brandyandwater although finucane who had four guineas in his pocket would have discharged the tavern reckoning with delight bungay said no sirthis is my affair sir if you please james take the bill and eighteenpence for yourself and he handed over the necessary funds to the waiter thus it was that finucane who went to bed at the temple after the dinner at dicks found himself actually with his weeks salary intact upon saturday morning  he gave mrs shandon a wink so knowing and joyful that that kind creature knew some good news was in store for her and hastened to get her bonnet and shawl when fin asked if he might have the honour of taking her a walk and giving her a little fresh air and little mary jumped for joy at the idea of this holiday for finucane never neglected to give her a toy or to take her to a show and brought newspaper orders in his pocket for all sorts of london diversions to amuse the child indeed he loved them with all his heart and would cheerfully have dashed out his rambling brains to do them or his adored captain a service  may i go charley or shall i stay with you for youre poorly dear this morning hes got a headache mr finucane he suffers from headaches and i persuaded him to stay in bed mrs shandon said  go along with you and polly jack take care of em hand me over the burtons anatomy and leave me to my abominable devices shandon said with perfect goodhumour he was writing and not uncommonly took his greek and latin quotations of which he knew the use as a public writer from that wonderful repertory of learning  so fin gave his arm to mrs shandon and mary went skipping down the passages of the prison and through the gate into the free air from fleet street to paternoster row is not very far as the three reached mr bungays shop mrs bungay was also entering at the private door holding in her hand a paper parcel and a manuscript volume bound in red and indeed containing an account of her transactions with the butcher in the neighbouring market mrs bungay was in a gorgeous shotsilk dress which flamed with red and purple she wore a yellow shawl and had red flowers inside her bonnet and a brilliant light blue parasol  mrs shandon was in an old black watered silk her bonnet had never seen very brilliant days of prosperity any more than its owner but she could not help looking like a lady whatever her attire was the two women curtsied to each other each according to her fashion  i hope youre pretty well mum said mrs bungay  its a very fine day said mrs shandon  wont you step in mum said mrs bungay looking so hard at the child as almost to frighten her  ii came about business with mr bungayii hope hes pretty well said timid mrs shandon  if you go to see him in the countinghouse couldnt you couldnt you leave your little gurl with me said mrs bungay in a deep voice and with a tragic look as she held out one finger towards the child  i want to stay with mamma cried little mary burying her face in her mothers dress  go with this lady mary my dear said the mother  ill show you some pretty pictures said mrs bungay with the voice of an ogress and some nice things besides look hereand opening her brownpaper parcel mrs bungay displayed some choice sweet buscuits such as her bungay loved after his wine little mary followed after this attraction the whole party entering at the private entrance from which a side door led into mr bungays commercial apartments here however as the child was about to part from her mother her courage again failed her and again she ran to the maternal petticoat upon which the kind and gentle mrs shandon seeing the look of disappointment in mrs bungays face goodnaturedly said if you will let me i will come up too and sit for a few minutes and so the three females ascended the stairs together a second biscuit charmed little mary into perfect confidence and in a minute or two she prattled away without the least restraint  faithful finucane meanwhile found mr bungay in a severer mood than he had been on the night previous when twothirds of a bottle of port and two large glasses of brandyandwater had warmed his soul into enthusiasm and made him generous in his promises towards captain shandon his impetuous wife had rebuked him on his return home she had ordered that he should give no relief to the captain he was a goodfornothing fellow whom no money would help she disapproved of the plan of the pall mall gazette and expected that bungay would only lose his money in it as they were losing over the way she always called her brothers establishment over the way by the whitehall journal let shandon stop in prison and do his work it was the best place for him in vain finucane pleaded and promised and implored for his friend bungay had had an hours lecture in the morning and was inexorable  but what honest jack failed to do belowstairs in the countinghouse the pretty faces and manners of the mother and child were effecting in the drawingroom where they were melting the fierce but really soft mrs bungay there was an artless sweetness in mrs shandons voice and a winning frankness of manner which made most people fond of her and pity her and taking courage by the rugged kindness with which her hostess received her the captains lady told her story and described her husbands goodness and virtues and her childs failing health she was obliged to part with two of them she said and send them to school for she could not have them in that horrid placethat mrs bungay though as grim as lady macbeth melted under the influence of the simple tale and said she would go down and speak to bungay now in this household to speak was to command with mrs bungay and with bungay to hear was to obey  it was just when poor finucane was in despair about his negotiation that the majestic mrs bungay descended upon her spouse politely requested mr finucane to step up to his friends in her drawingroom while she held a few minutes conversation with mr b and when the pair were alone the publishers better half informed him of her intentions towards the captains lady  whats in the wind now my dear maecenas asked surprised at his wifes altered tone you wouldnt hear of my doing anything for the captain this morning i wonder what has been a changing of you  the capting is an irishman mrs bungay replied and those irish i have always said i couldnt abide but his wife is a lady as any one can see and a good woman and a clergymans daughter and a west of england woman b which i am myself by my mothers sideand o marmaduke didnt you remark the little gurl  yes mrs b i saw the little girl  and didnt you see how like she was to our angel bessy mr band mrs bungays thoughts flew back to a period eighteen years back when bacon and bungay had just set up in business as small booksellers in a country town and when she had had a child named bessy something like the little mary who had moved her compassion  well well my dear mr bungay said seeing the little eyes of his wife begin to twinkle and grow red the captain aint in for much theres only a hundred and thirty pound against him half the money will take him out of the fleet finucane says and well pay him half salaries till he has made the account square when the little un said why dont you take par out of prizn i did feel it flora upon my honour i did now and the upshot of this conversation was that mr and mrs bungay both ascended to the drawingroom and mr bungay made a heavy and clumsy speech in which he announced to mrs shandon that hearing sixtyfive pounds would set her husband free he was ready to advance that sum of money deducting it from the captains salary and that he would give it to her on condition that she would personally settle with the creditors regarding her husbands liberation  i think this was the happiest day that mrs shandon and mr finucane had had for a long time bedad bungay youre a trump roared out fin in an overpowering brogue and emotion give us your fist old boy and wont we send the pall mall gazette up to ten thousand a week thats all and he jumped about the room and tossed up little mary with a hundred frantic antics  if i could drive you anywhere in my carriage mrs shandonim sure its quite at your service mrs bungay said looking out at a onehorsed vehicle which had just driven up and in which this lady took the air considerablyand the two ladies with little mary between them whose tiny hand maecenass wife kept fixed in her great grasp with the delighted mr finucane on the back seat drove away from paternoster row as the owner of the vehicle threw triumphant glances at the opposite windows at bacons  it wont do the captain any good thought bungay going back to his desk and accounts but mrs b becomes reglar upset when she thinks about her misfortune the child would have been of age yesterday if shed lived flora told me so and he wondered how women did remember things  we are happy to say that mrs shandon sped with very good success upon her errand she who had had to mollify creditors when she had no money at all and only tears and entreaties wherewith to soothe them found no difficulty in making them relent by means of a bribe of ten shillings in the pound and the next sunday was the last for some time at least which the captain spent in prison     chapter xxxv dinner in the row   upon the appointed day our two friends made their appearance at mr bungays door in paternoster row not the public entrance through which booksellers boys issued with their sacks full of bungays volumes and around which timid aspirants lingered with their virgin manuscripts ready for sale to sultan bungay but at the private door of the house whence the splendid mrs bungay would come forth to step into her chaise and take her drive settling herself on the cushions and casting looks of defiance at mrs bacons opposite windowsat mrs bacon who was as yet a chaiseless woman  on such occasions when very much wroth at her sisterinlaws splendour mrs bacon would fling up the sash of her drawingroom window and look out with her four children at the chaise as much as to say look at these four darlings flora bungay this is why i cant drive in my carriage you would give a coachandfour to have the same reason and it was with these arrows out of her quiver that emma bacon shot flora bungay as she sate in her chariot envious and childless  as pen and warrington came to bungays door a carriage and a cab drove up to bacons old dr slocum descended heavily from the first the doctors equipage was as ponderous as his style but both had a fine sonorous effect upon the publishers in the row a couple of dazzling white waistcoats stepped out of the cab  warrington laughed you see bacon has his dinnerparty too that is dr slocum author of memoirs of the poisoners you would hardly have recognised our friend hoolan in that gallant white waistcoat doolan is one of bungays men and faith here he comes indeed messrs hoolan and doolan had come from the strand in the same cab tossing up by the way which should pay the shilling and mr d stepped from the other side of the way arrayed in black with a large pair of white gloves which were spread out on his hands and which the owner could not help regarding with pleasure  the house porter in an evening coat and gentlemen with gloves as large as doolans but of the famous berlin web were on the passage of mr bungays house to receive the guests hats and coats and bawl their names up the stair some of the latter had arrived when the three new visitors made their appearance but there was only mrs bungay in red satin and a turban to represent her own charming sex she made curtsies to each newcomer as he entered the drawingroom but her mind was evidently preoccupied by extraneous thoughts the fact is mrs bacons dinnerparty was disturbing her and as soon as she had received each individual of her own company flora bungay flew back to the embrasure of the window whence she could rake the carriages of emma bacons friends as they came rattling up the row the sight of dr slocums large carriage with the gaunt jobhorses crushed flora none but hack cabs had driven up to her own door on that day  they were all literary gentlemen though unknown as yet to pen there was mr bole the real editor of the magazine of which mr wagg was the nominal chief mr trotter who from having broken out on the world as a poet of a tragic and suicidial cast had now subsided into one of mr bungays back shops as reader for that gentleman and captain sumph an exbeau reader about town and related in some indistinct manner to literature and the peerage he was said to have written a book once to have been a friend of lord byron to be related to lord sumphington in fact anecdotes of byron formed his staple and he seldom spoke but with the name of that poet or some of his contemporaries in his mouth as thus i remember poor shelley at school being sent up for good for a copy of verses every line of which i wrote by jove or i recollect when i was at missolonghi with byron offering to bet gamba and so forth this gentleman pen remarked was listened to with great attention by mrs bungay his anecdotes of the aristocracy of which he was a middleaged member delighted the publishers lady and he was almost a greater man than the great mr wagg himself in her eyes had he but come in his own carriage mrs bungay would have made her bungay purchase any given volume from his pen  mr bungay went about to his guests as they arrived and did the honours of his house with much cordiality how are you sir fine day sir glad to see you year sir flora my love let me ave the honour of introducing mr warrington to you mr warrington mrs bungay mr pendennis mrs bungay hope youve brought good appetites with you gentlemen you doolan i know ave for youve always ad a deuce of a twist  lor bungay said mrs bungay  faith a man must be hard to please bungay who cant eat a good dinner in this house doolan said and he winked and stroked his lean chops with his large gloves and made appeals of friendship to mrs bungay which that honest woman refused with scorn from the timid man she couldnt abide that doolan she said in confidence to her friends indeed all his flatteries failed to win her  as they talked mrs bungay surveying mankind from her window a magnificent vision of an enormous grey cabhorse appeared and neared rapidly a pair of white reins held by small white gloves were visible behind it a face pale but richly decorated with a chintuft the head of an exiguous groom bobbing over the cabheadthese bright things were revealed to the delighted mrs bungay the honourable percy popjoys quite punctual i declare she said and sailed to the door to be in waiting at the noblemans arrival  its percy popjoy said pen looking out of window and seeing an individual in extremely lacquered boots descend from the swinging cab and in fact it was that young nobleman lord falconets eldest son as we all very well know who was come to dine with the publisherhis publisher of the row  he was my fag at eton warrington said i ought to have licked him a little more he and pen had had some bouts at the oxbridge union debates in which pen had had very much the better of percy who presently appeared with his hat under his arm and a look of indescribable goodhumour and fatuity in his round dimpled face upon which nature had burst out with a chintuft but exhausted with the effort had left the rest of the countenance bare of hair  the temporary groom of the chambers bawled out the honourable percy popjoy much to that gentlemans discomposure at hearing his titles announced  what did the man want to take away my hat for bungay he asked of the publisher cant do without my hatwant it to make my bow to mrs bungay how well you look mrs bungay today havent seen your carriage in the park why havent you been there i missed you indeed i did  im afraid youre a sad quiz said mrs bungay  quiz never made a joke in myhullo whos here how dye do pendennis how dye do warrington these are old friends of mine mrs bungay i say how the doose did you come here he asked of the two young men turnip his lacquered heels upon mrs bungay who respected her husbands two young guests now that she found they were intimate with a lords son  what do they know him she asked rapidly of mr b  high fellers i tell youthe young one related to all the nobility said the publisher and both ran forward smiling and bowing to greet almost as great personages as the young lordno less characters indeed than the great mr wenham and the great mr wagg who were now announced  mr wenham entered wearing the usual demure look and stealthy smile with which he commonly surveyed the tips of his neat little shining boots and which he but seldom brought to bear upon the person who addressed him waggs white waistcoat spread out on the contrary with profuse brilliancy his burly red face shone resplendent over it lighted up with the thoughts of good jokes and a good dinner he liked to make his entree into a drawingroom with a laugh and when he went away at night to leave a joke exploding behind him no personal calamities or distresses of which that humourist had his share in common with the unjocular part of mankind could altogether keep his humour down whatever his griefs might be the thought of a dinner rallied his great soul and when he saw a lord he saluted him with a pun  wenham went up then with a smug smile and whisper to mrs bungay and looked at her from under his eyes and showed her the tips of his shoes wagg said she looked charming and pushed on straight at the young nobleman whom he called pop and to whom he instantly related a funny story seasoned with what the french call gros sel he was delighted to see pen too and shook hands with him and slapped him on the back cordially for he was full of spirits and goodhumour and he talked in a loud voice about their last place and occasion of meeting at baymouth and asked how their friends of clavering park were and whether sir francis was not coming to london for the season and whether pen had been to see lady rockminster who had arrivedfine old lady lady rockminster these remarks wagg made not for pens ear so much as for the edification of the company whom he was glad to inform that he paid visits to gentlemens country seats and was on intimate terms with the nobility  wenham also shook hands with our young friendall of which scenes mrs bungay remarked with respectful pleasure and communicated her ideas to bungay afterwards regarding the importance of mr pendennisideas by which pen profited much more than he was aware  pen who had read and rather admired some of her works and expected to find in miss bunion a person somewhat resembling her own description of herself in the passionflower in which she stated that her youth resembled      a violet shrinking meanly      when blows the march wind keenly      a timid fawn on wildwood lawn      where oakboughs rustle greenly  and that her maturer beauty was something very different certainly to the artless loveliness of her prime but still exceedingly captivating and striking beheld rather to his surprise and amusement a large and bony woman in a crumpled satin dress who came creaking into the room with a step as heavy as a grenadiers wagg instantly noted the straw which she brought in at the rumpled skirt of her dress and would have stooped to pick it up but miss bunion disarmed all criticism by observing this ornament herself and putting her own large foot upon it so as to separate it from her robe she stooped and picked up the straw saying to mrs bungay that she was very sorry to be a little late but that the omnibus was very slow and what a comfort it was to get a ride all the way from brompton for sixpence nobody laughed at the poetesss speech it was uttered so simply indeed the worthy woman had not the least notion of being ashamed of an action incidental upon her poverty  is that passionflowers pen said to wenham by whom he was standing why her picture in the volume represents her as a very welllooking young woman  you know passionflowers like all others will run to seed wenham said miss bunions portrait was probably painted some years ago  well i like her for not being ashamed of her poverty  so do i said mr wenham who would have starved rather than have come to dinner in an omnibus but i dont think that she need flourish the straw about do you mr pendennis my dear miss bunion how do you do i was in a great ladys drawingroom this morning and everybody was charmed with your new volume those lines on the christening of lady fanny fantail brought tears into the duchesss eyes i said that i thought i should have the pleasure of meeting you today and she begged me to thank you and say how greatly she was pleased  this history told in a bland smiling manner of a duchess whom wenham had met that very morning too quite put poor waggs dowager and baronet out of court and placed wenham beyond wagg as a man of fashion wenham kept this inestimable advantage and having the conversation to himself ran on with a number of anecdotes regarding the aristocracy he tried to bring mr popjoy into the conversation by making appeals to him and saying i was telling your father this morning or i think you were present at w house the other night when the duke said soandso but mr popjoy would not gratify him by joining in the talk preferring to fall back into the window recess with mrs bungay and watch the cabs that drove up to the opposite door at least if he would not talk the hostess hoped that those odious bacons would see how she had secured the noble percy popjoy for her party  and now the bell of saint pauls tolled half an hour later than that for which mr bungay had invited his party and it was complete with the exception of two guests who at last made their appearance and in whom pen was pleased to recognise captain and mrs shandon  when these two had made their greetings to the master and mistress of the house and exchanged nods of more or less recognition with most of the people present pen and warrington went up and shook hands very warmly with mrs shandon who perhaps was affected to meet them and think where it was she had seen them but a few days before shandon was brushed up and looked pretty smart in a red velvet waistcoat and a frill into which his wife had stuck her best brooch in spite of mrs bungays kindness perhaps in consequence of it mrs shandon felt great terror and timidity in approaching her indeed she was more awful than ever in her red satin and bird of paradise and it was not until she had asked in her great voice about the dear little gurl that the latter was somewhat encouraged and ventured to speak  nicelooking woman popjoy whispered to warrington do introduce me to captain shandon warrington im told hes a tremendous clever fellow and dammy i adore intellect by jove i do this was the truth heaven had not endowed young mr popjoy with much intellect of his own but had given him a generous faculty for admiring if not for appreciating the intellect of others and introduce me to miss bunion im told shes very clever too shes rum to look at certainly but that dont matter dammy i consider myself a literary man and i wish to know all the clever fellows so mr popjoy and mr shandon had the pleasure of becoming acquainted with one another and now the doors of the adjoining diningroom being flung open the party entered and took their seats at table pen found himself next to bunion on one side and to mr waggthe truth is wagg fled alarmed from the vacant place by the poetess and pen was compelled to take it  the gifted being did not talk much during dinner but pen remarked that she ate with a vast appetite and never refused any of the supplies of wine which were offered to her by the butler indeed miss bunion having considered mr pendennis for a minute who gave himself rather grand airs and who was attired in an extremely fashionable style with his very best chains shirt studs and cambric fronts he was set down and not without reason as a prig by the poetess who thought it was much better to attend to her dinner than to take any notice of him she told him as much in after days with her usual candour i took you for one of the little mayfair dandies she said to pen you looked as solemn as a little undertaker and as i disliked beyond measure the odious creature who was on the other side of me i thought it was best to eat my dinner and hold my tongue  and you did both very well my dear miss bunion pen said with a laugh  well so i do but i intend to talk to you the next time a great deal for you are neither so solemn nor so stupid nor so pert as you look  ah miss bunion how i pine for that next time to come pen said with an air of comical gallantrybut we must return to the day and the dinner at paternoster row  the repast was of the richest descriptionwhat i call of the florid gothic style wagg whispered to penn who sate beside the humourist in his sidewing voice the men in creaking shoes and berlin gloves were numerous and solemn carrying on rapid conversations behind the guests as they moved to and fro with the dishes doolan called out waither to one of them and blushed when he thought of his blunder mrs bungays footboy was lost amidst those large and blackcoated attendants  look at that very bowwindowed man wagg said hes an undertaker in amen corner and attends funerals and dinners cold meat and hot dont you perceive hes the sham butler here and i observe my dear mr pendennis as you will through life that wherever there is a sham butler at a london dinner there is sham winethis sherry is filthy bungay my boy where did you get this delicious brown sherry  im glad you like it mr wagg glass with you said the publisher its some i got from alderman bennings store and gave a good figure for it i can tell you mr pendennis will you join us your ealth gentlemen  the old rogue where does he expect to go to it came from the publichouse wagg said it requires two men to carry off that sherry tis so uncommonly strong i wish i had a bottle of old steynes wine here pendennis your uncle and i have had many a one he sends it about to people where he is in the habit of dining i remember at poor rawdon crawleys sir pitt crawleys brotherhe was governor of coventry islandsteynes chef always came in the morning and the butler arrived wit the champagne from gaunt house in the icepails ready  how good this is said popjoy goodnaturedly you must have a cordon bleu in your kitchen  o yes mrs bungay said thinking he spoke of a jackchain very likely  i mean a french chef said the polite guest  o yes your lordship again said the lady  does your artist say hes a frenchman mrs b called out wagg  well im sure i dont know answered the publishers lady  because if he does hes a quizzin yer cried mr wagg but nobody saw the pun which disconcerted somewhat the bashful punster the dinner is from griggs in st pauls churchyard so is bacons he whispered pen bungay writes to give halfacrown a head more than bacon so does bacon they would poison each others ices if they could get near them and as for the madedishesthey are poison thishumhathis brimborion a la sevigne is delicious mrs b he said helping himself to a dish which the undertaker handed to him  well im glad you like it mrs bungay answered blushing and not knowing whether the name of the dish was actually that which wagg gave to it but dimly conscious that that individual was quizzing her accordingly she hated mr wagg with female ardour and would have deposed him from his command over mr bungays periodical but that his name was great in the trade and his reputation in the land considerable  by the displacement of persons warrington had found himself on the right hand of mrs shandon who sate in plain black silk and faded ornaments by the side of the florid publisher the sad smile of the lady moved his rough heart to pity nobody seemed to interest himself about her she sate looking at her husband who himself seemed rather abashed in the presence of some of the company wenham and wagg both knew him and his circumstances he had worked with the latter and was immeasurably his superior in wit genius and acquirement but waggs star was brilliant in the world and poor shandon was unknown there he could not speak before the noisy talk of the coarser and more successful man but drank his wine in silence and as much of it as the people would give him he was under surveillance bungay had warned the undertaker not to fill the captains glass too often or too full it was a melancholy precaution that and the more melancholy that it was necessary mrs shandon too cast alarmed glances across the table to see that her husband did not exceed  abashed by the failure of his first pun for he was impudent and easily disconcerted wagg kept his conversation pretty much to pen during the rest of dinner and of course chiefly spoke about their neighbours this is one of bungays grand fielddays he said we are all bungavians heredid you read popjoys novel it was an old magazine story written by poor buzzard years ago and forgotten here until mr trotter that is trotter with the large shirt collar fished it out and bethought him that it was applicable to the late elopement so bob wrote a few chapters a propospopjoy permitted the use of his name and i dare say supplied a page here and thereand desperation or the fugitive duchess made its appearance the great fun is to examine popjoy about his own work of which he doesnt know a wordi say popjoy what a capital passage that is in volume threewhere the cardinal in disguise after being converted by the bishop of london proposes marriage to the duchesss daughter  glad you like it popjoy answered its a favourite bit of my own  theres no such thing in the whole book whispered wagg to pen invented it myself gad it wouldnt be a bad plot for a highchurch novel  i remember poor byron hobhouse trelawney and myself dining with cardinal mezzocaldo at rome captain sumph began and we had some orvieto wine for dinner which byron liked very much and i remember how the cardinal regretted that he was a single man we went to civita vecchia two days afterwards where byrons yacht wasand by jove the cardinal died within three weeks and byron was very sorry for he rather liked him  a devilish interesting story sumph indeed wagg said  you should publish some of those stories captain sumph you really should such a volume would make our friend bungays fortune shandon said  why dont you ask sumph to publish em in your new paperthe whatdyecallemhay shandon bawled out wagg  why dont you ask him to publish em in your old magazine the thingumbob shandon replied  is there going to be a new paper asked wenham who knew perfectly well but was ashamed of his connection with the press  bungay going to bring out a paper cried popjoy who on the contrary was proud of his literary reputation and acquaintances you must employ me mrs bungay use your influence with him and make him employ me prose or versewhat shall it be novels poems travels or leading articles begad anything or everythingonly let bungay pay me and im readyi am now my dear mrs bungay begad now  its to be called the small beer chronicle growled wagg and little popjoy is to be engaged for the infantine department  it is to be called the pall mall gazette sir and we shall be very happy to have you with us shandon said  pall mall gazettewhy pall mall gazette asked wagg  because the editor was born at dublin the subeditor at cork because the proprietor lives in paternoster rowand the paper is published in catherine street strand wont that reason suffice you wagg shandon said he was getting rather angry everything must have a name my dog ponto has got a namee youve got a name and a name which you deserve more or less indeed why dye grudge the name to our paper  by any other name it would smell as sweet said wagg  ill have ye remember its names not whatdyecallem mr wagg said shandon you know its name well enough andand you know mine  and i know your address too said wagg but this was spoken in an undertone and the goodnatured irishman was appeased almost in an instant after his ebullition of spleen and asked wagg to drink wine with him in a friendly voice  when the ladies retired from the table the talk grew louder still and presently wenham in a courtly speech proposed that everybody should drink to the health of the new journal eulogising highly the talents wit and learning of its editor captain shandon it was his maxim never to lose the support of a newspaper man and in the course of that evening he went round and saluted every literary gentleman present with a privy compliment specially addressed to him informing this one how great an impression had been made in downing street by his last article and telling that one how profoundly his good friend the duke of soandso had been struck by the ability of the late numbers  the evening came to a close and in spite of all the precautions to the contrary poor shandon reeled in his walk and went home to his new lodgings with his faithful wife by his side and the cabman on his box jeering at him wenham had a chariot of his own which he put at popjoys seat and the timid miss bunion seeing mr wagg who was her neighbour about to depart insisted upon a seat in his carriage much to that gentlemans discomfiture  pen and warrington walked home together in the moonlight and now warrington said that you have seen the men of letters tell me was i far wrong in saying that there are thousands of people in this town who dont write books who are to the full as clever and intellectual as people who do  pen was forced to confess that the literary personages with whom he had become acquainted had not said much in the course of the nights conversation that was worthy to be remembered or quoted in fact not one word about literature had been said during the whole course of the nightand it may be whispered to those uninitiated people who are anxious to know the habits and make the acquaintance of men of letters that there are no race of people who talk about books or perhaps who read books so little as literary men     chapter xxxvi the pall mall gazette   considerable success at first attended the new journal it was generally stated that an influential political party supported the paper and great names were cited amongst the contributors to its columns was there any foundation for these rumours we are not at liberty to say whether they were illfounded but this much we may divulge that an article upon foreign policy which was generally attributed to a noble lord whose connexion with the foreign office is very well known was in reality composed by captain shandon in the parlour of the bear and staff publichouse near whitehall stairs whither the printers boy had tracked him and where a literary ally of his mr bludyer had a temporary residence and that a series of papers on finance questions which were universally supposed to be written by a great statesman of the house of commons were in reality composed by mr george warrington of the upper temple  that there may have been some dealings between the pall mall gazette and this influential party is very possible percy popjoy whose father lord falconet was a member of the party might be seen not unfrequently ascending the stairs to warringtons chambers and some information appeared in the paper which it gave a character and could only be got from very peculiar sources several poems feeble in thought but loud and vigorous in expression appeared in the pall mall gazette with the signature of p p and it must be owned that his novel was praised in the new journal in a very outrageous manner  in the political department of the paper mr pen did not take any share but he was a most active literary contributor the pall mall gazette had its offices as we have heard in catherine street in the strand and hither pen often came with his manuscripts in his pocket and with a great deal of bustle and pleasure such as a man feels at the outset of his literary career when to see himself in print is still a novel sensation and he yet pleases himself to think that his writings are creating some noise in the world  here it was that mr jack finucane the subeditor compiled with paste and scissors the journal of which he was supervisor with an eagle eye he scanned all the paragraphs of all the newspapers which had anything to do with the world of fashion over which he presided he didnt let a death or a dinnerparty of the aristocracy pass without having the event recorded in the columns of his journal and from the most recondite provincial prints and distant scotch and irish newspapers he fished out astonishing paragraphs and intelligence regarding the upper classes of society it was a grand nay a touching sight for a philosopher to see jack finucane esquire with a plate of meat from the cookshop and glass of porter from the publichouse for his meal recounting the feasts of the great as if h had been present at them and in tattered trousers and dingy shirtsleeves cheerfully describing and arranging the most brilliant fetes of the world of fashion the incongruity of finucanes avocation and his manners and appearance amused his new friend pen since he left his own native village where his rank probably was not very lofty jack had seldom seen any society but such as used the parlour of the taverns which he frequented whereas from his writing you would have supposed that he dined with ambassadors and that his common lounge was the bowwindow of whites errors of description it is true occasionally slipped from his pen but the ballinafad sentinel of which he was own correspondent suffered by these not the pall mall gazette in which jack was not permitted to write much his london chiefs thinking that the scissors and the paste were better wielded by him than the pen  pen took a great deal of pains with the writing of his reviews and having a pretty fair share of desultory reading acquired in the early years of his life an eager fancy and a keen sense of fun his articles pleased his chief and the public and he was proud to think that he deserved the money which he earned we may be sure that the pall mall gazette was taken in regularly at fairoaks and read with delight by the two ladies there it was received at clavering park too where we know there was a young lady of great literary tastes and old doctor portman himself to whom the widow sent her paper after she had got her sons articles by heart signified his approval of pens productions saying that the lad had spirit taste and fancy and wrote if not like a scholar at any rate like a gentleman  and what was the astonishment and delight of our friend major pendennis on walking into one of his clubs the regent where wenham lord falconet and some other gentlemen of good reputation and fashion were assembled to hear them one day talking over a number of the pall mall gazette and of an article which appeared in its columns making some bitter fun of the book recently published by the wife of a celebrated member of the opposition party the book in question was a book of travels in spain and italy by the countess of muffborough in which it was difficult to say which was the most wonderful the french or the english in which languages her ladyship wrote indifferently and upon the blunders of which the critic pounced with delightful mischief the critic was no other than pen he jumped and danced round about his subject with the greatest jocularity and high spirits he showed up the noble ladys faults with admirable mock gravity and decorum there was not a word in the article which was not polite and gentlemanlike and the unfortunate subject of the criticism was scarified and laughed at during the operation wenhams bilious countenance was puckered up with malign pleasure as he read the critique lady muffborough had not asked him to her parties during the last year lord falconet giggled and laughed with all his heart lord muffborough and he had been rivals ever since they began life and these complimented major pendennis who until now had scarcely paid any attention to some hints which his fairoaks correspondence threw out of dear arthurs constant and severe literary occupations which i fear may undermine the poor boys health and had thought any notice of mr pen and his newspaper connexions quite below his dignity as a major and a gentleman  but when the oracular wenham praised the boys production when lord falconet who had had the news from percy popjoy approved of the genius of young pen when the great lord steyne himself to whom the major referred the article laughed and sniggered over it swore it was capital and that the muffborough would writhe under it like a whale under a harpoon the major as in duty bound began to admire his nephew very much said by gad the young rascal had some stuff in him and would do something he had always said he would do something and with a hand quite tremulous with pleasure the old gentleman sate down to write to the widow at fairoaks all that the great folks had said in praise of pen and he wrote to the young rascal too asking when he would come and eat a chop with his old uncle and saying that he was commissioned to take him to dinner at gaunt house for lord steyne liked anybody who could entertain him whether by his folly wit or by his dulness by his oddity affectation good spirits or any other quality pen flung his letter across the table to warrington perhaps he was disappointed that the other did not seem to be much affected by it  the courage of young critics is prodigious they clamber up to the judgmentseat and with scarce a hesitation give their opinion upon works the most intricate or profound had macaulays history or herschels astronomy been put before pen at this period he would have looked through the volumes meditated his opinion over a cigar and signified his august approval of either author as if the critic had been their born superior and indulgent master and patron by the help of the biographie universelle or the british museum he would be able to take a rapid resume of a historical period and allude to names dates and facts in such a masterly easy way as to astonish his mamma at home who wondered where her boy could have acquired such a prodigious store of reading and himself too when he came to read over his articles two or three months after they had been composed and when he had forgotten the subject and the books which he had consulted at that period of his life mr pen owns that he would not have hesitated at twentyfour hours notice to pass his opinion upon the greatest scholars or to give a judgment upon the encyclopaedia luckily he had warrington to laugh at him and to keep down his impertinence by a constant and wholesome ridicule or he might have become conceited beyond all sufferance for shandon liked the dash and flippancy of his young aidedecamp and was indeed better pleased with pens light and brilliant flashes than with the heavier metal which his elder coadjutor brought to bear  but though he might justly be blamed on the score of impertinence and a certain prematurity of judgment mr pen was a perfectly honest critic a great deal too candid for mr bungays purposes indeed who grumbled sadly at his impartiality pen and his chief the captain had a dispute upon this subject one day in the name of commonsense mr pendennis shandon asked what have you been doingpraising one of mr bacons books bungay has been with me in a fury this morning at seeing a laudatory article upon one of the works of the odious firm over the way  pens eyes opened with wide astonishment do you mean to say he asked that we are to praise no books that bacon publishes or that if the books are good we are to say they are bad  my good young friendfor what do you suppose a benevolent publisher undertakes a critical journal to benefit his rival shandon inquired  to benefit himself certainly but to tell the truth too pen said ruat coelum to tell the truth  and my prospectus said shandon with a laugh and a sner do you consider that was a work of mathematical accuracy of statement  pardon me that is not the question pen said and i dont think you very much care to argue it i had some qualms of conscience about that same prospectus and debated the matter with my friend warrington we agreed however pen said laughing that because the prospectus was rather declamatory and poetical and the giant was painted upon the showboard rather larger than the original who was inside the caravan we need not be too scrupulous about this trifling inaccuracy but might do our part of the show without loss of character or remorse of conscience we are the fiddlers and play our tunes only you are the showman  and leader of the van said shandon well i am glad that your conscience gave you leave to play for us  yes but said pen with a fine sense of the dignity of his position we are all party men in england and i will stick to my party like a briton i will be as goodnatured as you like to our own side he is a fool who quarrels with his own nest and i will hit the enemy as hard as you likebut with fair play captain if you please one cant tell all the truth i suppose but one can tell nothing but the truth and i would rather starve by jove and never earn another penny by my pen this redoubted instrument had now been in use for some six weeks and pen spoke of it with vast enthusiasm and respect than strike an opponent an unfair blow or if called upon to place him rank him below his honest desert  well mr pendennis when we want bacon smashed we must get some other hammer to do it shandon said with fatal goodnature and very likely thought within himself a few years hence perhaps the young gentleman wont be so squeamish the veteran condottiere himself was no longer so scrupulous he had fought and killed on so many a side for many a year past that remorse had long left him gad said he youve a tender conscience mr pendennis its the luxury of all novices and i may have had one once myself but that sort of bloom wears off with the rubbing of the world and im not going to the trouble myself of putting on an artificial complexion like our pious friend wenham or our model of virtue wagg  i dont know whether some peoples hypocrisy is not better captain than others cynicism  its more profitable at any rate said the captain biting his nails that wenham is as dull a quack as ever quacked and you see the carriage in which he drove to dinner faith itll be a long time before mrs shandon will take a drive in her own chariot god help her poor thing and pen went away from his chief after their little dispute and colloquy pointing his own moral to the captains tale and thinking to himself behold this man stored with genius wit learning and a hundred good natural gifts see how he has wrecked them by paltering with his honesty and forgetting to respect himself wilt thou remember thyself o pen thou art conceited enough wilt thou sell thy honour for a bottle no by heavens grace we will be honest whatever befalls and our mouths shall only speak the truth when they open  a punishment or at least a trial was in store for mr pen in the very next number of the pall mall gazette warrington read out with roars of laughter an article which by no means amused arthur pendennis who was himself at work with a criticism for the next weeks number of the same journal and in which the spring annual was ferociously maltreated by some unknown writer the person of all most cruelly mauled was pen himself his verses had not appeared with his own name in the spring annual but under an assumed signature as he had refused to review the book shandon had handed it over to mr bludyer with directions to that author to dispose of it and he had done so effectually mr bludyer who was a man of very considerable talent and of a race which i believe is quite extinct in the press of our time had a certain notoriety in his profession and reputation for savage humour he smashed and trampled down the poor spring flowers with no more mercy than a bull would have on a parterre and having cut up the volume to his hearts content went and sold it at a bookstall and purchased a pint of brandy with the proceeds of the volume     chapter xxxvii where pen appears in town and country   let us be allowed to pass over a few months of the history of mr arthur pendenniss lifetime during the which many events may have occurred which were more interesting and exciting to himself than they would be likely to prove to the reader of his present memoirs we left him in his last chapter regularly entered upon his business as a professional writer or literary hack as mr warrington chooses to style himself and his friend and we know how the life of any hack legal or literary in a curacy or in a marching regiment or at a merchants desk is dull of routine and tedious of description one days labour resembles another much too closely a literary man has often to work for his bread against time or against his will or in spite of his health or of his indolence or of his repugnance to the subject on which he is called to exert himself just like any other daily toiler when you want to make money by pegasus as he must perhaps who has no other saleable property farewell poetry and aerial flights pegasus only rises now like mr greens balloon at periods advertised beforehand and when the spectators money has been paid pegasus trots in harness over the stony pavement and pulls a cart or a cab behind him often pegasus does his work with panting sides and trembling knees and not seldom gets a cut of the whip from his driver  do not let us however be too prodigal of our pity upon pegasus there is no reason why this animal should be exempt from labour or illness or decay any more than any of the other creatures of gods world if he gets the whip pegasus often deserves it and i for one am quite ready to protest my friend george warrington against the doctrine which poetical sympathisers are inclined to put forward viz that of letters and what is called genius are to be exempt from prose duties of this daily breadwanting taxpaying life and not to be made to work and pay like their neighbours  well then the pall mall gazette being duly established and arthur pendenniss merits recognised as a flippant witty and amusing critic he worked away hard every week preparing reviews of such works as came into his department and writing his reviews with flippancy certainly but with honesty and to the best of his power it might be that a historian of threescore who had spent a quarter of a century in composing a work of which our young gentleman disposed in the course of a couple of days reading at the british museum was not altogether fairly treated by such a facile critic or that a poet who had been elaborating sublime sonnets and odes until he thought them fit for the public and for fame was annoyed by two or three dozen pert lines in mr pens review in which the poets claims were settled by the critic as if the latter were my lord on the bench and the author a miserable little suitor trembling before him the actors at the theatres complained of him wofully too and very likely he was too hard upon them but there was not much harm done after all it is different now as we know but there were so few great historians or great poets or great actors in pens time that scarce any at all came up for judgment his critical desk those who got a little whipping got what in the main was good for them not that the judge was any better or wiser than the persons whom he sentenced or indeed ever fancied himself so pen had a strong sense of humour and justice and had not therefore an overweening respect for his own works besides he had his friend warrington at his elbowa terrible critic if the young man was disposed to be conceited and more savage over pen than ever he was to those whom he tried at his literary assize  by these critical labours and by occasional contributions to leading articles of the journal when without wounding his paper this eminent publicist could conscientiously speak his mind mr arthur pendennis gained the sum of four pounds four shillings weekly and with no small pains and labour likewise be furnished magazines and reviews with articles of his composition and is believed to have been though on this score he never chooses to speak london correspondent of the chatteris champion which at that time contained some very brilliant and eloquent letters from the metropolis by these labours the fortunate youth was enabled to earn a sum very nearly equal to four hundred pounds a year and on the second christmas after his arrival in london he actually brought a hundred pounds to his mother as a dividend upon the debt which he owed to laura that mrs pendennis read every word of her sons works and considered him to be the profoundest thinker and most elegant writer of the day that she thought his retribution of the hundred pounds an act of angelic virtue that she feared he was ruining his health by his labours and was delighted when he told her of the society which he met and of the great men of letters and fashion whom he saw will be imagined by all readers who have seen sonworship amongst mothers and that charming simplicity of love with which women in the country watch the career of their darlings in london if john has held such and such a brief if tom has been invited to such and such a ball or george has met this or that great and famous man at dinner what a delight there is in the hearts of mothers and sisters at home in somersetshire how young hopefuls letters are read and remembered what a theme for village talk they give and friendly congratulation in the second winter pen came for a very brief space and cheered the widows heart and lightened up the lonely house at fairoaks helen had her son all to herself laura was away on a visit to old lady rockminster the folks of clavering park were absent the very few old friends of the house doctor portman at their head called upon mr pen and treated him with marked respect between mother and son it was all fondness confidence and affection it was the happiest fortnight of the widows whole life perhaps in the lives of both of them the holiday was gone only too quickly and pen was back in the busy world and the gentle widow alone again she sent arthurs money to laura i dont know why this young lady took the opportunity of leaving home when pen was coming thither or whether he was the more piqued or relieved by her absence  he was by this time by his own merits and his uncles introductions pretty well introduced into london and known both in literary and polite circles amongst the former his fashionable reputation stood him in no little stead he was considered to be a gentleman of good present means and better expectations who wrote for his pleasure than which there cannot be a greater recommendation to a young literary aspirant bacon bungay and co were proud to accept his articles mr wenham asked him to dinner mr wagg looked upon him with a favourable eye and they reported how they met him at the houses of persons of fashion amongst whom he was pretty welcome as they did not trouble themselves about his means present or future as his appearance and address were good and as he had got a character for being a clever fellow finally he was asked to one house because he was seen at another house and thus no small varieties of london life were presented to the young man he was made familiar with all sorts of people from paternoster row to pimlico and was as much at home at mayfair diningtables as at those tavern boards where some of his companions of the pen were accustomed to assemble  full of high spirits and curiosity easily adapting himself to all whom he met the young fellow pleased himself in this strange variety and jumble of men and made himself welcome or at ease at least wherever he went he would breakfast for instance at mr plovers of a morning in company with a peer a bishop a parliamentary orator two blue ladies of fashion a popular preacher the author of the last new novel and the very latest lion imported from egypt or from america and would quit this distinguished society for the back room at the newspaper office where pens and ink and the wet proofsheets were awaiting him here would be finucane the subeditor with the last news from the row and shandon would come in presently and giving a nod to pen would begin scribbling his leading article at the other end of the table flanked by the pint of sherry which when the attendant boy beheld him was always silently brought for the captain or mr bludyers roaring voice would be heard in the front room where that truculent critic would impound the books on the counter in spite of the timid remonstrances of mr midge the publisher and after looking through the volumes would sell them at his accustomed bookstall and having drunken and dined upon the produce of the sale in a tavern box would call for ink and paper and proceed to smash the author of his dinner and the novel towards evening mr pen would stroll in the direction of his club and take up warrington there for a constitutional walk this exercise freed the lungs and gave an appetite for dinner after which pen had the privilege to make his bow at some very pleasant houses which were opened to him or the town before him for amusement there was the opera or the eagle tavern or a ball to go to in mayfair or a quiet night with a cigar and a book and a long talk with warrington or a wonderful new song at the back kitchenat this time of his life mr pen beheld all sorts of places and men and very likely did not know how much he enjoyed himself until long after when balls gave him no pleasure neither did farces make him laugh nor did the tavern joke produce the least excitement in him nor did the loveliest dancer that ever showed her ankles cause him to stir from his chair after dinner at his present mature age all these pleasures are over and the times have passed away too it is but a very very few years sincebut the time is gone and most of the men bludyer will no more bully authors or cheat landlords of their score shandon the learned and thriftless the witty and unwise sleeps his last sleep they buried honest doolan the other day never will he cringe or flatter never pull longbow or empty whiskynoggin any more  the london season was now blooming in its full vigour and the fashionable newspapers abounded with information regarding the grand banquets routs and balls which were enlivening the polite world our gracious sovereign was holding levees and drawingrooms at st jamess the bowwindows of the clubs were crowded with the heads of respectable redfaced newspaperreading gentlemen along the serpentine trailed thousands of carriages squadrons of dandy horsemen trampled over rotten row everybody was in town in a word and of course major arthur pendennis who was somebody was not absent  with his head tied up in a smart bandana handkerchief and his meagre carcass enveloped in a brilliant turkish dressinggown the worthy gentleman sate on a certain morning by his fireside letting his feet gently simmer in a bath whilst he took his early cup of tea and perused his morning post he could not have faced the day without his two hours toilet without his early cup of tea without his morning post i suppose nobody in the world except morgan not even morgans master himself knew how feeble and ancient the major was growing and what numberless little comforts he required  if men sneer as our habit is at the artifices of an old beauty at her paint perfumes ringlets at those innumerable and to us unknown stratagems with which she is said to remedy the ravages of time and reconstruct the charms whereof years have bereft her the ladies it is to be presumed are not on their side altogether ignorant that men are vain as well as they and that the toilets of old bucks are to the full as elaborate as their own how is it that old blushington keeps that constant little rosetint on his cheeks and where does old blondel get the preparation which makes his silver hair pass for golden have you ever seen lord hotspur get off his horse when he thinks nobody is looking taken out of his stirrups his shiny boots can hardly totter up the steps of hotspur house he is a dashing young nobleman still as you see the back of him in rotten row when you behold him on foot what an old old fellow did you ever form to yourself any idea of dick lacy dick has been dick these sixty years in a natural state and without his stays all these men are objects whom the observer of human life and manners may contemplate with as much profit as the most elderly belgravian venus or inveterate mayfair jezebel an old reprobate daddylonglegs who has never said his prayers except perhaps in public these fifty years an old buck who still clings to as many of the habits of youth as his feeble grasp of health can hold by who has given up the bottle but sits with young fellows over it and tells naughty stories upon toastandwaterwho has given up beauty but still talks about it as wickedly as the youngest roue in companysuch an old fellow i say if any parson in pimlico or st jamess were to order the beadles to bring him into the middle aisle and there set him in an armchair and make a text of him and preach about him to the congregation could be turned to a wholesome use for once in his life and might be surprised to find that some good thoughts came out of him but we are wandering from our text the honest major who sits all this while with his feet cooling in the bath morgan takes them out of that place of purification and dries them daintily and proceeds to set the old gentleman on his legs with waistband and wig starched cravat and spotless boots and gloves  it was during these hours of the toilet that morgan and his employer had their confidential conversations for they did not meet much at other times of the daythe major abhorring the society of his own chairs and tables in his lodgings and morgan his masters toilet over and letters delivered had his time very much on his own hands  this spare time the active and wellmannered gentleman bestowed among the valets and butlers of the nobility his acquaintance and morgan pendennis as he was styled for by such compound names gentlemens gentlemen are called in their private circles was a frequent and welcome guest at some of the very highest tables in this town he was a member of two influential clubs in mayfair and pimlico and he was thus enabled to know the whole gossip of the town and entertain his master very agreeably during the two hours toilet conversation he knew a hundred tales and legends regarding persons of the very highest ton whose valets canvass their august secrets just my dear madam as our own parlourmaids and dependants in the kitchen discuss our characters our stinginess and generosity our pecuniary means or embarrassments and our little domestic or connubial tiffs and quarrels if i leave this manuscript open on my table i have not the slightest doubt betty will read it and they will talk it over in the lower regions tonight and tomorrow she will bring in my breakfast with a face of such entire imperturbable innocence that no mortal could suppose her guilty of playing the spy if you and the captain have high words upon any subject which is just possible the circumstances of the quarrel and the characters of both of you will be discussed with impartial eloquence over the kitchen teatable and if mrs smiths maid should by chance be taking a dish of tea with yours her presence will not undoubtedly act as a restraint upon the discussion in question her opinion will be given with candour and the next day her mistress will probably know that captain and mrs jones have been a quarrelling as usual nothing is secret take it as a rule that john knows everything and as in our humble world so in the greatest a duke is no more a hero to his valetdechambre than you or i and his graces man at his club in company doubtless with other men of equal social rank talks over his masters character and affairs with the ingenuous truthfulness which befits gentlemen who are met together in confidence who is a niggard and screws up his moneyboxes who is in the hands of the moneylenders and is putting his noble name on the back of bills of exchange who is intimate with whose wife who wants whom to marry her daughter and which he wont no not at any priceall these facts gentlemens confidential gentlemen discuss confidentially and are known and examined by every person who has any claim to rank in genteel society in a word if old pendennis himself was said to know everything and was at once admirably scandalous and delightfully discreet it is but justice to morgan to say that a great deal of his masters information was supplied to that worthy man by his valet who went out and foraged knowledge for him indeed what more effectual plan is there to get a knowledge of london society than to begin at the foundationthat is at the kitchen floor  so mr morgan and his employer conversed as the latters toilet proceeded there had been a drawingroom on the previous day and the major read among the presentations that of lady clavering by lady rockminster and of miss amory by her mother lady claveringand in a further part of the paper their dresses were described with a precision and in a jargon which will puzzle and amuse the antiquary of future generations the sight of these names carried pendennis back to the country how long have the claverings been in london he asked pray morgan have you seen any of their people  sir francis have sent away his foring man sir mr morgan replied and have took a friend of mine as own man sir indeed he applied on my reckmendation you may recklect towler sirtall redaired manbut dyes his air was groom of the chambers in lord levants family till his lordship broke hup its a fall for towler sir but pore men cant be particklar said the valet with a pathetic voice  devilish hard on towler by gad said the major amused and not pleasant for lord levanthe he  always knew it was coming sir i spoke to you of it michaelmas was four years when her ladyship put the diamonds in pawn it was towler sir took em in two cabs to dobreesand a good deal of the plate went the same way dont you remember seeing of it at blackwall with the levant arms and coronick and lord levant settn oppsit to it at the marquis of steynes dinner beg your pardon did i cut you sir  morgan was now operating upon the majors chinhe continued the theme while strapping the skilful razor theyve took a house in grosvenor place and are coming out strong sir her ladyships going to give three parties besides a dinner a week sir her fortune wont stand itcant stand it  gad she had a devilish good cook when i was at fairoaks the major said with very little compassion for the widow amorys fortune  marobblan was his name sir marobblans gone away sir morgan saidand the major this time with hearty sympathy said he was devilish sorry to lose him  theres been a tremenjuous row about that mosseer marobblan morgan continued at a ball at baymouth sir bless his impadence he challenged mr harthur to fight a jewel sir which mr arthur was very near knocking him down and pitchin him outawinder and serve him right but chevalier strong sir came up and stopped the shindyi beg pardon the holtercation sirthem french cooks has as much pride and hinsolence as if they was real gentlemen  i heard something of that quarrel said the major but mirobolant was not turned off for that  no sirthat affair sir which mr harthur forgave it him and beayved most handsome was hushed hup it was about miss hamory sir that he ad is dismissial those french fellers they fancy everybody is in love with em and he climbed up the large grape vine to her winder sir and was a trying to get in when he was caught sir and mr strong came out and they got the gardenengine and played on him and there was no end of a row sir  confound his impudence you dont mean to say miss amory encouraged him cried the major amazed at a peculiar expression in mr morgans countenance  morgan resumed his imperturbable demeanour know nothing about it sir servants dont know them kind of things the least most probbly there was nothing in itso many lies is told about familiesmarobblan went away bag and baggage saucepans and pianna and allthe feller ad a pianna and wrote potry in french and he took a lodging at clavering and he hankered about the primises and it was said that madam fribsy the milliner brought letters to miss hamory though i dont believe a word about it nor that he tried to pison hisself with charcoal which it was all a humbug betwigst him and madam fribsy and he was nearly shot by the keeper in the park  in the course of that very day it chanced that the major had stationed himself in the great window of bayss club in saint jamess street at the hour in the afternoon when you see a halfscore of respectable old bucks similarly recreating themselves bayss is rather an oldfashioned place of resort now and many of its members more than middleaged but in the time of the prince regent these old fellows occupied the same window and were some of the very greatest dandies in this empiremajor pendennis was looking from the great window and spied his nephew arthur walking down the street in company with his friend mr popjoy  look said popjoy to pen as they passed did you ever pass bayss at four oclock without seeing that collection of old fogies its a regular museum they ought to be cast in wax and set up at madame tussauds  in a chamber of old horrors by themselves pen said laughing  in the chamber of horrors gad doosid good pop cried they are old rogues most of em and no mistake theres old blondel theres my uncle colchicum the most confounded old sinner in europe thereshullo theres somebody rapping the window and nodding at us  its my uncle the major said pen is he an old sinner too  notorious old rogue pop said wagging his head notowious old wogue he pronounced the words thereby rendering them much more emphatiches beckoning you in he wants to speak to you  come in too pen said  cant replied the other cut uncle col two years ago about mademoiselle frangipaneta ta and the young sinner took leave of pen and the club of the elder criminals and sauntered into blacquieres an adjacent establishment frequented by reprobates of his own age  colchicum blondel and the senior bucks had just been conversing about the clavering family whose appearance in london had formed the subject of major pendenniss morning conversation with his valet mr blondels house was next to that of sir francis clavering in grosvenor place giving very good dinners himself he had remarked some activity in his neighbours kitchen sir francis indeed had a new chef who had come in more than once and dressed mr blondels dinner for him that gentleman having only a remarkably expert female artist permanently engaged in his establishment and employing such chiefs of note as happened to be free on the occasion of his grand banquets they go to a devilish expense and see devilish bad company as yet i hear mr blondel said they scour the streets by gad to get people to dine with em champignon says it breaks his heart to serve up a dinner to their society what a shame it is that those low people should have money at all cried mr blondel whose grandfather had been a reputable leatherbreeches maker and whose father had lent money to the princes  i wish i had fallen in with the widow myself sighed lord colchicum and not been laid up with that confounded gout at leghorni would have married the woman myselfim told she has six hundred thousand pounds in the threes  not quite so much as thati knew her family in indiamajor pendennis said i knew her family in india her father was an enormously rich old indigoplanterknow all about herclavering has the next estate to ours in the countryha theres my nephew walking withwith minethe infernal young scamp said lord colchicum glowering at popjoy out of his heavy eyebrows and he turned away from the window as major pendennis tapped upon it  the major was in high goodhumour the sun was bright the air brisk and invigorating he had determined upon a visit to lady clavering on that day and bethought him that arthur would be a good companion for the walk across the green park to her ladyships door master pen was not displeased to accompany his illustrious relative who pointed out a dozen great men in that brief transit through st jamess street and got bows from a duke at a crossing a bishop on a cob and a cabinet minister with an umbrella the duke gave the elder pendennis a finger of a pipeclayed glove to shake which the major embraced with great veneration and all pens blood tingled as he found himself in actual communication as it were with this famous man for pen had possession of the majors left arm whilst the gentlemans other wing was engaged with his graces right and he wished all grey friars school all oxbridge university all paternoster row and the temple and laura and his mother at fairoaks could be standing on each side of the street to see the meeting between him and his uncle and the most famous duke in christendom  how do pendennisfine day were his graces remarkable words and with a nod of his august head he passed onin a blue frockcoat and spotless white duck trousers in a white stock with a shining buckle behind  old pendennis whose likeness to his grace has been remarked began to imitate him unconsciously after they had parted speaking with curt sentences after the manner of the great man we have all of us no doubt met with more than one military officer who has so imitated the manner of a certain great captain of the age and has perhaps changed his own natural character and disposition because fate had endowed him with an aquiline nose in like manner have we not seen many another man pride himself on having a tall forehead and a supposed likeness to mr canning many another go through life swelling with selfgratification on account of an imagined resemblance we say imagined because that anybody should be really like that most beautiful and perfect of men is impossible to the great and revered george iv many third parties who wore low necks to their dresses because they fancied that lord byron and themselves were similar in appearance and has not the grave closed but lately upon poor tom bickerstaff who having no more imagination than mr joseph hume looked in the glass and fancied himself like shakspeare shaved his forehead so as farther to resemble the immortal bard wrote tragedies incessantly and died perfectly crazyactually perished of his forehead these or similar freaks of vanity most people who have frequented the world must have seen in their experience pen laughed in his roguish sleeve at the manner in which his uncle began to imitate the great man from whom they had just parted but mr pen was as vain in his own way perhaps as the elder gentleman and strutted with a very consequential air of his own by the majors side  yes my dear boy said the old bachelor as they sauntered through the green park where many poor children were disporting happily and errandboys were playing at tosshalfpenny and black sheep were grazing in the sunshine and an actor was learning his part on a bench and nurserymaids and their charges sauntered here and there and several couples were walking in a leisurely manner yes depend on it my boy for a poor man there is nothing like having good acquaintances who were those men with whom you saw me in the bowwindow at bayss two were peers of the realm hobananob will be a peer as soon as his granduncle dies and he has had his third seizure and of the other four not one has less than his seven thousand a year did you see that dark blue brougham with that tremendous stepping horse waiting at the door of the club youll know it again it is sir hugh trumpingtons he was never known to walk in his life never appears in the streets on footnever and if he is going two doors off to see his mother the old dowager to whom i shall certainly introduce you for she receives some of the best company in london gad sirhe mounts his horse at no 23 and dismounts again at no 25 a he is now upstairs at bayss playing picquet with count punter he is the secondbest player in englandas well he may be for he plays every day of his life except sundays for sir hugh is an uncommonly religious man from halfpast three till halfpast seven when he dresses for dinner  a very pious manner of spending his time pen said laughing and thinking that his uncle was falling into the twaddling state  gad sir that is not the question a man of his estate may employ his time as he chooses when you are a baronet a county member with ten thousand acres of the best land in cheshire and such a place as trumpington though he never goes there you may do as you like  and so that was his brougham sir was it the nephew said with almost a sneer  his broughamo ay yesand that brings me back to my pointrevenons a nos moutons yes begad revenons a nous moutons well that brougham is mine if i choose between four and seven just as much mine as if i jobbed it from tilburys begad for thirty pound a month sir hugh is the best natured fellow in the world and if it hadnt been so fine an afternoon as it is you and i would have been in that brougham at this very minute on our way to grosvenor place that is the benefit of knowing rich meni dine for nothing siri go into the country and im mounted for nothing other fellows keep hounds and gamekeepers for me sic vos non vobis as we used to say at grey friars hey im of the opinion of my old friend leech of the fortyfourth and a devilish good shrewd fellow he was as most scotchmen are gad sir leech used to say he was so poor that he couldnt afford to know a poor man  you dont act up to your principles uncle pen said goodnaturedly  up to my principles how sir the major asked rather testily  you would have cut me in saint jamess street sir pen said were your practice not more benevolent than your theory you who live with dukes and magnates of the land and would take no notice of a poor devil like me by which speech we may see that mr pen was getting on in the world and could flatter as well as laugh in his sleeve  major pendennis was appeased instantly and very much pleased he tapped affectionately his nephews arm on which he was leaning and saidyou sir you are my flesh and blood hang it sir ive been very proud of you and very fond of you but for your confounded follies and extravagancesand wild oats sir which i hope youve sown em i hope youve sown em begad my object arthur is to make a man of youto see you well placed in the world as becomes one of your name and my own sir you have got yourself a little reputation by your literary talents which i am very far from undervaluing though in my time begad poetry and genius and that sort of thing were devilish disreputable there was poor byron for instance who ruined himself and contracted the worst habits by living with poets and newspaperwriters and people of that kind but the times are changed nowtheres a run upon literatureclever fellows get into the best houses in town begad tempora mutantur sir and by jove i suppose whatever is is right as shakspeare says  pen did not think fit to tell his uncle who was the author who had made use of that remarkable phrase and here descending from the green park the pair made their way into grosvenor place and to the door of the mansion occupied there by sir francis and lady clavering  the diningroom shutters of this handsome mansion were freshly gilded the knockers shone gorgeous upon the newly painted door the balcony before the drawingroom bloomed with a portable garden of the most beautiful plants and with flowers white and pink and scarlet the windows of the upper room the sacred chamber and dressingroom of my lady doubtless and even a pretty little casement of the third story which keensighted mr pen presumed to belong to the virgin bedroom of miss blanche amory were similarly adorned with floral ornaments and the whole exterior face of the house presented the most brilliant aspect which fresh new paint shining plateglass newly cleaned bricks and spotless mortar could offer to the beholder  how strong must have rejoiced in organising all this splendour thought pen he recognised the chevaliers genius in the magnificence before him  lady clavering is going out for her drive the major said we shall only have to leave our pasteboards arthur he used the word pasteboards having heard it from some of the ingenuous youth of the nobility about town and as a modern phrase suited to pens tender years indeed as the two gentlemen reached the door a landau drove up a magnificent yellow carriage lined with brocade or satin of a faint cream colour drawn by wonderful grey horses with flaming ribbons and harness blazing all over with crests no less than three of these heraldic emblems surmounted the coatsofarms on the panels and these shields contained a prodigious number of quarterings betokening the antiquity and splendour of the house of clavering and snell a coachman in a tight silver wig surmounted the magnificent hammercloth whereon the same arms were worked in bullion and controlled the prancing greysa young man still but of a solemn countenance with a laced waistcoat and buckles in his shoeslittle buckles unlike those which john and jeames the footmen wear and which we know are large and spread elegantly over the foot  one of the leaves of the hall door was opened and johnone of the largest of his racewas leaning against the doorpillar with his ambrosial hair powdered his legs crossed beautiful silkstockinged in his hand his cane goldheaded dolichoskion jeames was invisible but near at hand waiting in the hall with the gentleman who does not wear livery and ready to fling down the roll of haircloth over which her ladyship was to step to her carriage these things and men the which to tell of demands time are seen in the glance of a practised eye and in fact the major and pen had scarcely crossed the street when the second battant of the door flew open the horsehair carpet tumbled down the doorsteps to those of the carriage john was opening it on one side of the emblazoned door and jeames on the other the two ladies attired in the highest style of fashion and accompanied by a third who carried a blenheim spaniel yelping in a light blue ribbon came forth to ascend the carriage  miss amory was the first to enter which she did with aerial lightness and took the place which she liked best lady clavering next followed but her ladyship was more mature of age and heavy of foot and one of those feet attired in a green satin boot with some part of a stocking which was very fine whatever the ankle might be which it encircled might be seen swaying on the carriagestep as her ladyship leaned for support on the arm of the unbending jeames by the enraptured observer of female beauty who happened to be passing at the time of this imposing ceremonial  the pendennises senior and junior beheld those charms as they came up to the doorthe major looking grave and courtly and pen somewhat abashed at the carriage and its owners for he thought of sundry little passages at clavering which made his heart beat rather quick  at that moment lady clavering looking round the pairshe was on the first carriagestep and would have been in the vehicle in another second but she gave a start backwards which caused some of the powder to fly from the hair of ambrosial jeames and crying out lor if it isnt arthur pendennis and the old major jumped back to terra firma directly and holding out two fat hands encased in tight orangecoloured gloves the goodnatured woman warmly greeted the major and his nephew  come in both of youwhy havent you been beforeget out blanche and come and see your old friendso im so glad to see you weve been waitin and waitin for you ever so long come in luncheon aint gone down cried out this hospitable lady squeezing pens hand in both hers she had dropped the majors after a brief wrench of recognition and blanche casting up her eyes towards the chimneys descended from the carriage presently with a timid blushing appealing look and gave a little hand to major pendennis  the companion with the spaniel looked about irresolute and doubting whether she should not take fido his airing but she too turned right about face and entered the house after lady clavering her daughter and the two gentlemen and the carriage with the prancing greys was left unoccupied save by the coachman in the silver wig      chapter xxxviii in which the sylph reappears   better folks than morgan the valet were not so well instructed as that gentleman regarding the amount of lady claverings riches and the legend in london upon her ladyships arrival in the polite metropolis was that her fortune was enormous indigo factories opium clippers banks overflowing with rupees diamonds and jewels of native princes and vast sums of interest paid by them for loans contracted by themselves or their predecessors to lady claverings father were mentioned as sources of her wealth her account at her london bankers was positively known and the sum embraced so many cyphers as to create as many os of admiration in the wondering hearer it was a known fact that an envoy from an indian prince a colonel altamont the nawaub of lucknows prime favourite an extraordinary man who had it was said embraced mahometanism and undergone a thousand wild and perilous adventures was at present in this country trying to negotiate with the begum clavering the sale of the nawaubs celebrated nosering diamond the light of the dewan  under the title of the begum lady claverings fame began to spread in london before she herself descended upon the capital and as it has been the boast of delolme and blackstone and all panegyrists of the british constitution that we admit into our aristocracy merit of every kind and that the lowliestborn man if he but deserve it may wear the robes of a peer and sit alongside of a cavendish or a stanley so it ought to be the boast of our good society that haughty though it be naturally jealous of its privileges and careful who shall be admitted into its circle yet if an individual be but rich enough all barriers are instantly removed and he or she is welcomed as from his wealth he merits to be this fact shows our british independence and honest feelingour higher orders are not such mere haughty aristocrats as the ignorant represent them on the contrary if a man have money they will hold out their hands to him eat his dinners dance at his balls marry his daughters or give their own lovely girls to his sons as affably as your commonest roturier would do  as he had superintended the arrangements of the country mansion our friend the chevalier strong gave the benefit of his taste and advice to the fashionable london upholsterers who prepared the town house for the reception of the clavering family in the decoration of this elegant abode honest strongs soul rejoiced as much as if he had been himself its proprietor he hung and rehung the pictures he studied the positions of sofas he had interviews with wine merchants and purveyors who were to supply the new establishment and at the same time the baronets factotum and confidential friend took the opportunity of furnishing his own chambers and stocking his snug little cellar his friends complimented him upon the neatness of the former and the select guests who came in to share strongs cutlet new found a bottle of excellent claret to accompany the meal the chevalier was now as he said in clover he had a very comfortable set of rooms in shepherds inn he was waited on by a former spanish legionary and comrade of his whom he had left at a breach of a spanish fort and found at a crossing in tottenhamcourt road and whom he had elevated to the rank of bodyservant to himself and to the chum who at present shared his lodgings this was no other than the favourite of the nawaub of lucknow the valiant colonel altamont  no man was less curious or at any rate more discreet than ned strong and he did not care to inquire into the mysterious connexion which very soon after their first meeting at baymouth was established between sir francis clavering and the envoy of the nawaub the latter knew some secret regarding the former which put clavering into his power somehow and strong who knew that his patrons early life had been rather irregular and that his career with his regiment in india had not been brilliant supposed that the colonel who swore he knew clavering well at calcutta had some hold upon sir francis to which the latter was forced to yield in truth strong had long understood sir francis claverings character as that of a man utterly weak in purpose in principle and intellect a moral and physical trifler and poltroon  with poor clavering his excellency had had one or two interviews after their baymouth meeting the nature of which conversations the baronet did not confide to strong although he sent letters to altamont by that gentleman who was his ambassador in all sorts of affairs on one of these occasions the nawaubs envoy must have been in an exceeding ill humour for he crushed claverings letter in his hand and said with his own particular manner and emphasis  a hundred be hanged ill have no more letters nor no more shillyshally tell clavering ill have a thousand or by jove ill split and burst him all to atoms let him give me a thousand and ill go abroad and i give you my honour as a gentleman ill not ask him for no more for a year give him that message from me strong my boy and tell him if the money aint here next friday at twelve oclock as sure as my names what it is ill have a paragraph in the newspaper on saturday and next week ill blow up the whole concern  strong carried back these words to his principal on whom their effect was such that actually on the day and hour appointed the chevalier made his appearance once more at altamonts hotel at baymouth with the sum of money required altamont was a gentleman he said and behaved as such he paid his bill at the inn and the baymouth paper announced his departure on a foreign tour strong saw him embark at dover it must be forgery at the very least he thought that has put clavering into this fellows power and the colonel has got the bill  before the year was out however this happy country saw the colonel once more upon its shores a confounded run on the red had finished him he said at baden baden no gentleman could stand against a colour coming up fourteen times he had been obliged to draw upon sir francis clavering for means of returning home and clavering though pressed for money for he had election expenses had set up his establishment in the country and was engaged in furnishing his london house yet found means to accept colonel altamonts bill though evidently very much against his will for in strongs hearing sir francis wished to heaven with many curses that the colonel could have been locked up in a debtors goal in germany for life so that he might never be troubled again  these sums for the colonel sir francis was obliged to raise without the knowledge of his wife for though perfectly liberal nay sumptuous in her expenditure the good lady had inherited a tolerable aptitude for business along with the large fortune of her father snell and gave to her husband only such a handsome allowance as she thought befitted a gentleman of his rank now and again she would give him a present or pay an outstanding gambling debt but she always exacted a pretty accurate account of the moneys so required and respecting the subsidies to the colonel clavering fairly told strong that he couldnt speak to his wife  part of mr strongs business in life was to procure this money and other sums for his patron and in the chevaliers apartments in shepherds inn many negotiations took place between gentlemen of the moneyed world and sir francis clavering and many valuable banknotes and pieces of stamped paper were passed between them when a man has been in the habit of getting in debt from his early youth and of exchanging his promises to pay at twelve months against present sums of money it would seem as if no piece of good fortune ever permanently benefited him a little while after the advent of prosperity the moneylender is pretty certain to be in the house again and the bills with the old signature in the market clavering found it more convenient to see these gentry at strongs lodgings than at his own and such was the chevaliers friendship for the baronet that although he did not possess a shilling of his own his name might be seen as the drawer of almost all the bills of exchange which sir francis clavering accepted having drawn claverings bills he got them discounted in the city when they became due he parleyed with the billholders and gave them instalments of their debt or got time in exchange for fresh acceptances regularly or irregularly gentlemen must live somehow and as we read how the other day at comorn the troops forming that garrison were gay and lively acted plays danced at balls and consumed their rations though menaced with an assault from the enemy without the walls and with a gallows if the austrians were successfulso there are hundreds of gallant spirits in this town walking about in good spirits dining every day in tolerable gaiety and plenty and going to sleep comfortably with a bailiff always more or less near and a rope of debt round their necksthe which trifling inconveniences ned strong the old soldier bore very easily  but we shall have another opportunity of making acquaintance with these and some other interesting inhabitants of shepherds inn and in the meanwhile are keeping lady clavering and her friends too long waiting on the doorsteps of grosvenor place  first they went into the gorgeous diningroom fitted up lady clavering couldnt for goodness gracious tell why in the middleaged style unless said her goodnatured ladyship laughing because me and clavering are middleaged peopleand here they were offered the copious remains of the luncheon of which lady clavering and blanche had just partaken when nobody was near our little sylphide who scarcely ate at dinner more than the six grains of rice of amina the friend of the ghouls in the arabian nights was most active with her knife and fork and consumed a very substantial portion of mutton cutlets in which piece of hypocrisy it is believed she resembled other young ladies of fashion pen and his uncle declined the refection but they admired the diningroom with fitting compliments and pronounced it very chaste that being the proper phrase there were indeed highbacked dutch chairs of the seventeenth century there was a sculptured carved buffet of the sixteenth there was a sideboard robbed out of the carved work of a church in the low countries and a large brass cathedral lamp over the round oak table there were old family portraits from wardour street and tapestry from france bits of armour doublehanded swords and battleaxes made of cartonpierre lookingglasses statuettes of saints and dresden chinanothing in a word could be chaster behind the diningroom was the library fitted with busts and books all of a size and wonderful easychairs and solemn bronzes in the severe classic style here it was that guarded by double doors sir francis smoked cigars and read bells life in london and went to sleep after dinner when he was not smoking over the billiardtable at his clubs or punting at the gamblinghouses in saint jamess  but what could equal the chaste splendour of the drawingroomsthe carpets were so magnificently fluffy that your foot made no more noise on them than your shadow on their white ground bloomed roses and tulips as big as warmingpans about the room were high chairs and low chairs bandylegged chairs chairs so attenuated that it was a wonder any but a sylph could sit upon them marquetterietables covered with marvellous gimcracks china ornaments of all ages and countries bronzes gilt daggers books of beauty yataghans turkish papooshes and boxes of parisian bonbons wherever you sate down there were dresden shepherds and shepherdesses convenient at your elbow there were moreover light blue poodles and ducks and cocks and hens in porcelain there were nymphs by boucher and shepherdesses by greuze very chaste indeed there were muslin curtains and brocade curtains gilt cages with parroquets and lovebirds two squealing cockatoos each outsquealing and outchattering the other a clock singing tunes on a consoletable and another booming the hours like great tom on the mantelpiecethere was in a word everything that comfort could desire and the most elegant taste devise a london drawingroom fitted up without regard to expense is surely one of the noblest and most curious sights of the present day the romans of the lower empire the dear marchionesses and countesses of louis xv could scarcely have had a finer taste than our modern folks exhibit and everybody who saw lady claverings reception rooms was forced to confess that they were most elegant and that the prettiest rooms in londonlady harley quins lady hanway wardours or mrs hodgepodgsons own the great railroad croesus wife were not fitted up with a more consummate chastity  poor lady clavering meanwhile knew little regarding these things and had a sad want of respect for the splendours around her i only know they cost a precious deal of money major she said to her guest and that i dont advise you to try one of them gossamer gilt chairs i came down on one the night we gave our second dinnerparty why didnt you come and see us before wed have asked you to it  you would have liked to see mamma break a chair wouldnt you mr pendennis dear blanche said with a sneer she was angry because pen was talking and laughing with mamma because mamma had made a number of blunders in describing the housefor a hundred other good reasons  i should like to have been by to give lady clavering my arm if she had need of it pen answered with a bow and a blush  quel preux chevalier cried the sylphide tossing up her little head  i have a fellowfeeling with those who fall remember pen said i suffered myself very much from doing so once  and you went home to laura to console you said miss amory pen winced he did not like the remembrance of the consolation which laura had given to him nor was he very well pleased to find that his rebuff in that quarter was known to the world so as he had nothing to say in reply he began to be immensely interested in the furniture round about him and to praise lady claverings taste with all his might  no dont praise me said honest lady clavering its all the upholsterers doings and captain strongs they did it all while we was at the parkandandlady rockminster has been here and says the salongs are very well said lady clavering with an air and tone of great deference  my cousin laura has been staying with her pen said  its not the dowager it is the lady rockminster  indeed cried major pendennis when he heard this great name of fashion if you have her ladyships approval lady clavering you cannot be far wrong no no you cannot be far wrong lady rockminster i should say arthur is the very centre of the circle of fashion and taste the rooms are beautiful indeed and the majors voice hushed as he spoke of this great lady and he looked round and surveyed the apartments awfully and respectfully as if he had been at church  yes lady rockminster has took us up said lady clavering  taken us up mamma cried blanche in a shrill voice  well taken us up then said my lady its very kind of her and i dare say we shall like it when we git used to it only at first one dont fancy being tookwell taken up at all she is going to give our balls for us and wants to invite all our dinners but i wont stand that i will have my old friends and i wont let her send all the cards out and sit mum at the head of my own table you must come to me arthur and majorcome let me see on the 14thit aint one of our grand dinners blanche she said looking round at her daughter who bit her lips and frowned very savagely for a sylphide  the major with a smile and a bow said he would much rather come to a quiet meeting than to a grand dinner he had had enough of those large entertainments and preferred the simplicity of the home circle  i always think a dinners the best the second day said lady clavering thinking to mend her first speech on the 14th well be quite a snug little party at which second blunder miss blanche clasped her hands in despair and said o mamma vous etes incorrigible major pendennis vowed that he liked snug dinners of all things in the world and confounded her ladyships impudence for daring to ask such a man as him to a second days dinner but he was a man of an economical turn of mind and bethinking himself that he could throw over these people if anything better should offer he accepted with the blandest air as for pen he was not a dinerout of thirty years standing as yet and the idea of a fine feast in a fine house was still perfectly welcome to him  what was that pretty little quarrel which engaged itself between your worship and miss amory the major asked of pen as they walked away together i thought you used to au mieux in that quarter  used to be answered pen with a dandified air is a vague phrase regarding a woman was and is are two very different terms sir as regards womens hearts especially  egad they change as we do cried the elder when we took the cape of good hope i recollect there was a lady who talked poisoning herself for your humble servant and begad in three months she ran away from her husband with somebody else dont get yourself entangled with that miss amory she is forward affected and underbred and her character is somewhatnever mind what but dont think of her ten thousand pound wont do for you what my good fellow is ten thousand pound i would scarcely pay that girls milliners bill with the interest of the money  you seem to be a connoisseur in millinery uncle pen said  i was sir i was replied the senior and the old warhorse you know never hears the sound of a trumpet but he begins to he heyou understandand he gave a killing and somewhat superannuated leer and bow to a carriage that passed them and entered the park  lady catherine martingales carriage he said monsous fine girls the daughters though gad i remember their mother a thousand times handsomer no arthur my dear fellow with your person and expectations you ought to make a good coup in marriage some day or other and though i wouldnt have this repeated at fairoaks you rogue ha ha a reputation for a little wickedness and for being an homme dangereux dont hurt a young fellow with the women they like it sir they hate a milksopyoung men must be young men you know but for marriage continued the veteran moralist that is a very different matter marry a woman with money ive told you before it is as easy to get a rich wife as a poor one and a doosed deal more comfortable to sit down to a wellcooked dinner with your little entrees nicely served than to have nothing but a damned cold leg of mutton between you and your wife we shall have a good dinner on the 14th when we dine with sir francis clavering stick to that my boy in your relations with the family cultivate em but keep em for dining no more of your youthful follies and nonsense about love in a cottage  it must be a cottage with a double coachhouse a cottage of gentility sir said pen quoting the hackneyed ballad of the devils walk but his uncle did not know that poem though perhaps he might be leading pen upon the very promenade in question and went on with his philosophical remarks very much pleased with the aptness of the pupil to whom he addressed them indeed arthur pendennis was a clever fellow who took his colour very readily from his neighbour and found the adaptation only too easy  warrington the grumbler growled out that pen was becoming such a puppy that soon there would be no bearing him but the truth is the young mans success and dashing manners pleased his elder companion he liked to see pen gay and spirited and brimful of health and life and hope as a man who has long since left off being amused with clown and harlequin still gets a pleasure in watching a child at a pantomime mr pens former sulkiness disappeared with his better fortune and he bloomed as the sun began to shine upon him     chapter xxxix colonel altamont appears and disappears   on the day appointed major pendennis who had formed no better engagement and arthur who desired none arrived together to dine with sir francis clavering the only tenants of the drawingroom when pen and his uncle reached it were sir francis and his wife and our friend captain strong whom arthur was very glad to see though the major looked very sulkily at strong being by no means well pleased to sit down to dinner with claverings d housesteward as he irreverently called strong but mr welbore welbore claverings country neighbour and brother member of parliament speedily arriving pendennis the elder was somewhat appeased for welbore though perfectly dull and taking no more part in the conversation at dinner than the footman behind his chair was a respectable country gentleman of ancient family and seven thousand a year and the major felt always at ease in such society to these were added other persons of note the dowager lady rockminster who had her reasons for being well with the clavering family and the lady agnes foker with her son mr harry our old acquaintance mr pynsent could not come his parliamentary duties keeping him at the house duties which sate upon the two other senators very lightly miss blanche amory was the last of the company who made her appearance she was dressed in a killing white silk dress which displayed her pearly shoulders to the utmost advantage foker whisped to pen who regarded her with eyes of evident admiration that he considered her a stunner she chose to be very gracious to arthur upon this day and held out her hand most cordially and talked about dear fairoaks and asked for dear laura and his mother and said she was longing to go back to the country and in fact was entirely simple affectionate and artless  harry foker thought he had never seen anybody so amiable and delightful not accustomed much to the society of ladies and ordinarily being dumb to their presence he found that he could speak before miss amory and became uncommonly lively and talkative even before the dinner was announced and the party descended to the lower rooms he would have longed to give his arm to the fair blanche and conduct her down the broad carpeted stair but she fell to the lot of pen upon this occasion mr foker being appointed to escort mrs welbore welbore in consequence of his superior rank as an earls grandson  but though he was separated from the object of his desire during the passage downstairs the delighted foker found himself by miss amorys side at the dinnertable and flattered himself that he had manoeuvred very well in securing that happy place it may be that the move was not his but that it was made by another person blanche had thus the two young men one on each side of her and each tried to render himself gallant and agreeable  fokers mamma from her place surveying her darling boy was surprised at his vivacity harry talked constantly to his fair neighbour about the topics of the day  seen taglioni in the sylphide miss amory bring me that souprame of volile again if you please this was addressed to the attendant near him very good cant think where the souprames come from what becomes of the legs of the fowls i wonder shes clipping in the sylphide aint she and he began very kindly to hum the pretty air which pervades that prettiest of all ballets now faded into the past with that most beautiful and gracious of all dancers will the young folks ever see anything so charming anything so classic anything like taglioni  miss amory is a sylph herself said mr pen  what a delightful tenor voice you have mr foker said the young lady i am sure you have been well taught i sing a little myself i should like to sing with you  pen remembered that words very similar had been addressed to himself by the young lady and that she had liked to sing with him in former days and sneering within himself he wondered with how many other gentlemen she had sung duets since his time but he did not think fit to put this awkward question aloud and only said with the very tenderest air which he could assume i should like to hear you sing again miss blanche i never heard a voice i liked so well as yours i think  i thought you liked lauras said miss blanche  lauras is a contralto and that voice is very often out you know pen said bitterly i have heard a great deal of music in london he continued im tired of those professional peoplethey sing too loudor i have grown too old or too blase one grows old very soon in london miss amory and like all old fellows i only care for the songs i heard in my youth  i like english music best i dont care for foreign songs much get me some saddle of mutton said mr foker  i adore english ballads of all things said miss amory  sing me one of the old songs after dinner will you said pen with an imploring voice  shall i sing you an english song after dinner asked the sylphide turning to mr foker i will if you will promise to come up soon and she gave him a perfect broadside of her eyes  ill come up after dinner fast enough he said simply i dont care about much wine afterwardsi take my whack at dinneri mean my share you know and when i have had as much as i want i toddle up to tea im a domestic character miss amorymy habits are simpleand when im pleased im generally in a goodhumour aint i penthat jelly if you pleasenot that one the other with the cherries inside how the doose do they get those cherries inside the jellies in this way the artless youth prattled on and miss amory listened to him with inexhaustible goodhumour when the ladies took their departure for the upper regions blanche made the two young men promise faithfully to quit the table soon and departed with kind glances to each she dropped her gloves on fokers side of the table and her handkerchief on pens each had had some little attention paid to him her politeness to mr foker was perhaps a little more encouraging than her kindness to arthur but the benevolent little creature did her best to make both the gentlemen happy foker caught her last glance as she rushed out of the door that bright look passed over mr strongs broad white waistcoat and shot straight at harry fokers the door closed on the charmer he sate down with a sigh and swallowed a bumper of claret  as the dinner at which pen and his uncle took their places was not one of our grand parties it had been served at a considerably earlier hour than those ceremonial banquets of the london season which custom has ordained shall scarcely take place before nine oclock and the company being small and miss blanche anxious to betake herself to her piano in the drawingroom giving constant hints to her mother to retreatlady clavering made that signal very speedily so that it was quite daylight yet when the ladies reached the upper apartments from the flowerembroidered balconies of which they could command a view of the two parks of the poor couples and children still sauntering in the one and of the equipages of ladies and the horses of dandies passing through the arch of the other the sun in a word had not set behind the elms of kensington gardens and was still gilding the statue erected by the ladies of england in honour of his grace the duke of wellington when lady clavering and her female friends left the gentlemen drinking wine  the windows of the diningroom were opened to let in the fresh air and afforded to the passersby in the street a pleasant or perhaps tantalising view of six gentlemen in white waistcoats with a quantity of decanters and a variety of fruits before themlittle boys as they passed and jumped up at the arearailings and took a peep said to one another hi hi jim shouldnt you like to be there and have a cut of that there pineapplethe horses and carriages of the nobility and gentry passed by conveying them to belgravian toilets the policeman with clamping feet patrolled up and down before the mansion the shades of evening began to fall the gasman came and lighted the lamps before sir franciss door the butler entered the diningroom and illuminated the antique gothic chandelier over the antique carved oak diningtable so that from outside the house you looked inwards upon a nightscene of feasting and waxcandles and from within you beheld a vision of a calm summer evening and the wall of saint jamess park and the sky above in which a star or two was just beginning to twinkle  jeames with folded legs leaning against the doorpillar of his masters abode looked forth musingly upon the latter tranquil sight whilst a spectator clinging to the railings examined the former scene policeman x passing gave his attention to neither but fixed it upon the individual holding by the railings and gazing into sir francis claverings diningroom where strong was laughing and talking away making the conversation for the party  the man at the railing was very gorgeously attired with chains jewellery and waistcoats which the illumination from the house lighted up to great advantage his boots were shiny he had brass buttons to his coat and large white wristbands over his knuckles and indeed looked so grand that x imagined he beheld a member of parliament or a person of consideration before him whatever his rank however the mp or person of consideration was considerably excited by wine for he lurched and reeled somewhat in his gait and his hat was cocked over his wild and bloodshot eyes in a manner which no sober hat ever could assume his copious black hair was evidently surreptitious and his whiskers of the tyrian purple  as strongs laughter following after one of his own gros mots came ringing out of window this gentleman without laughed and sniggered in the queerest way likewise and he slapped his thigh and winked at jeames pensive in the portico as much as to say plush my boy isnt that a good story  jeamess attention had been gradually drawn from the moon in the heavens to this sublunary scene and he was puzzled and alarmed by the appearance of the man in shiny boots a holtercation he remarked afterwards in the servantshalla holtercation with a feller in the streets is never no good and indeed he was not hired for any such purpose so having surveyed the man for some time who went on laughing reeling nodding his head with tipsy knowingness jeames looked out of the portico and softly called pleaceman and beckoned to that officer  x marched up resolute with one berlin glove stuck in his beltside and jeames simply pointed with his index finger to the individual who was laughing against the railings not one single word more than pleaceman did he say but stood there in the calm summer evening pointing calmly a grand sight  x advanced to the individual and said now sir will you have the kindness to move hon  the individual who was in perfect goodhumour did not appear to bear one word which policeman x uttered but nodded and waggled his grinning head at strong until his hat almost fell from his head over the area railings  now sir move on do you hear cries x in a much more peremptory tone and he touched the stranger gently with one of the fingers enclosed in the gauntlets of the berlin woof  he of the many rings instantly started or rather staggered back into what is called an attitude of selfdefence and in that position began the operation which is entitled squaring at policeman x and showed himself brave and warlike if unsteady hullo keep your hands off a gentleman he said with an oath which need not be repeated  move on out of this said x and dont be a blocking up the pavement staring into gentlemens diningrooms  not stareho honot starethat is a good one replied the other with a satiric laugh and sneerwhos to prevent me from staring looking at my friends if i like not you old highlows  friends i dessay move on answered x  if you touch me ill pitch into you i will roared the other i tell you i know em allthats sir francis clavering baronet mpi know him and he knows meand thats strong and thats the young chap that made the row at the ball i say strong strong  its that d altamont cried sir francis within with a start and a guilty look and strong also with a look of annoyance got up from the table and ran out to the intruder  a gentleman in a white waistcoat running out from a diningroom bareheaded a policeman and an individual decently attired engaged in almost fisticuffs on the pavement were enough to make a crowd even in that quiet neighbourhood at halfpast eight oclock in the evening and a small mob began to assemble before sir francis claverings door for gods sake come in strong said seizing his acquaintances arm send for a cab james if you please he added in an under voice to that domestic and carrying the excited gentleman out of the street the outer door was closed upon him and the small crowd began to move away  mr strong had intended to convey the stranger into sir franciss private sittingroom where the hats of the male guests were awaiting them and having there soothed his friend by bland conversation to have carried him off as soon as the cab arrivedbut the newcomer was in a great state of wrath at the indignity which had been put upon him and when strong would have led him into the second door said in a tipsy voice that aint the doorthats the diningroom doorwhere the drinks going onand ill go and have some by jove ill go and have some at this audacity the butler stood aghast in the hall and placed himself before the door but it opened behind him and the master of the house made his appearance with anxious looks  i will have someby  i will the intruder was roaring out as sir francis came forward hullo clavering i say im come to have some wine with you hay old boyhay old corkscrew get us a bottle of the yellow seal you old thiefthe very besta hundred rupees a dozen and no mistake  the host reflected a moment over his company there is only welbore pendennis and those two lads he thoughtand with a forced laugh and a piteous look he saidwell altamont come in i am very glad to see you im sure  colonel altamont for the intelligent reader has doubtless long ere this discovered in the stranger his excellency the ambassador of the nawaub of lucknow reeled into the diningroom with a triumphant look towards jeames the footman which seemed to say there sir what do you think of that now am i a gentleman or no and sank down into the first vacant chair sir francis clavering timidly stammered out the colonels name to his guest mr welbore welbore and his excellency began drinking wine forthwith and gazing round upon the company now with the most wonderful frowns and anon with the blandest smiles and hiccupped remarks encomiastic of the drink which he was imbibing  very singular man has resided long in a native court in india strong said with great gravity the chevaliers presence of mind never deserting himin those indian courts they get very singular habits  very said major pendennis drily and wondering what in goodness name was the company into which he had got  mr foker was pleased with the newcomer its the man who would sing the malay song at the back kitchen he whispered to pen try this pine sir he then said to colonel altamont its uncommonly fine  pinesive seen em feed pigs on pines said the colonel  all the nawaub of lucknows pigs are fed on pines strong whispered to major pendennis  oh of course the major answered sir francis clavering was in the meanwhile endeavouring to make an excuse to his brotherguest for the newcomers condition and muttered something regarding altamont that he was an extraordinary character very eccentric veryhad indian habitsdidnt understand the rules of english societyto which old welbore a shrewd old gentleman who drank his wine with great regularity said that seemed pretty clear  then the colonel seeing pens honest face regarded it for a while with as much steadiness as became his condition and said i know you too young fellow i remember you baymouth ball by jingo wanted to fight the frenchman i remember you and he laughed and he squared with his fists and seemed hugely amused in the drunken depths of his mind as these recollections passed or rather reeled across it  mr pendennis you remember colonel altamont at baymouth strong said upon which pen bowing rather stiffly said he had the pleasure of remembering that circumstance perfectly  whats his name cried the colonel strong named mr pendennis again  pendennispendennis be hanged altamont roared out to the surprise of every one and thumping with his fist on the table  my name is also pendennis sir said the major whose dignity was exceedingly mortified by the evenings eventsthat he major pendennis should have been asked to such a party and that a drunken man should have been introduced to it my name is pendennis and i will be obliged to you not to curse it too loudly  the tipsy man turned round to look at him and as he looked it appeared as if colonel altamont suddenly grew sober he put his hand across his forehead and in doing so displaced somewhat the black wig which he wore and his eyes stared fiercely at the major who in his turn like a resolute old warrior as he was looked at his opponent very keenly and steadily at the end of the mutual inspection altamont began to button up his brassbuttoned coat and rising up from his chair suddenly and to the companys astonishment reeled towards the door and issued from it followed by strong all that the latter heard him utter wascaptain beak captain beak by jingo  there had not passed above a quarter of an hour from his strange appearance to his equally sudden departure the two young men and the baronets other guest wondered at the scene and could find no explanation for it clavering seemed exceedingly pale and agitated and turned with looks of almost terror towards major pendennis the latter had been eyeing his host keenly for a moment or two do you know him asked sir francis of the major  i am sure i have seen the fellow the major replied looking as if he too was puzzled yes i have it he was a deserter from the horse artillery who got into the nawaubs service i remember his face quite well  oh said clavering with a sigh which indicated immense relief of mind and the major looked at him with a twinkle of his sharp old eyes the cab which strong had desired to be called drove away with the chevalier and colonel altamont coffee was brought to the remaining gentlemen and they went upstairs to the ladies in the drawingroom foker declaring confidentially to pen that this was the rummest go he ever saw which decision pen said laughing showed great discrimination on mr fokers part  then according to her promise miss amory made music for the young men foker was enraptured with her performance and kindly joined in the airs which she sang when he happened to be acquainted with them pen affected to talk aside with others of the party but blanche brought him quickly to the piano by singing some of his own words those which we have given in a previous number indeed and which the sylphide had herself she said set to music i dont know whether the air was hers or how much of it was arranged for her by signor twankidillo from whom she took lessons but good or bad original or otherwise it delighted mr pen who remained by her side and turned the leaves now for her most assiduouslygad how i wish i could write verses like you pen foker sighed afterwards to his companion if i could do em wouldnt i thats all but i never was a dab at writing you see and im sorry i was so idle when i was at school  no mention was made before the ladies of the curious little scene which had been transacted belowstairs although pen was just on the point of describing it to miss amory when that young lady inquired for captain strong who she wished should join her in a duet but chancing to look up towards sir francis clavering arthur saw a peculiar expression of alarm in the baronets ordinarily vacuous face and discreetly held his tongue it was rather a dull evening welbore went to sleep as he always did at music and after dinner nor did major pendennis entertain the ladies with copious anecdotes and endless little scandalous stories as his wont was but sate silent for the most part and appeared to be listening to the music and watching the fair young performer  the hour of departure having arrived the major rose regretting that so delightful an evening should have passed away so quickly and addressed a particularly fine compliment to miss amory upon her splendid talents as a singer your daughter lady clavering he said to that lady is a perfect nightingalea perfect nightingale begad i have scarcely ever heard anything equal to her and her pronunciation of every languagebegad of every languageseems to me to be perfect and the best houses in london must open before a young lady who has such talents and allow an old fellow to say miss amory such a face  blanche was as much astonished by these compliments as pen was to whom his uncle a little time since had been speaking in very disparaging terms of the sylph the major and the two young men walked home together after mr foker had placed his mother in her carriage and procured a light for an enormous cigar  the young gentlemans company or his tobacco did not appear to be agreeable to major pendennis who eyed him askance several times and with a look which plainly indicated that he wished mr foker would take his leave but foker hung on resolutely to the uncle and nephew even until they came to the formers door in bury street where the major wished the lads good night  and i say pen he said in a confidential whisper calling his nephew back mind you make a point of calling in grosvenor place tomorrow theyve been uncommonly civil monsously civil and kind  pen promised and wondered and the majors door having been closed upon him by morgan foker took pens arm and walked with him for some time silently puffing his cigar at last when they had reached charing cross on arthurs way home to the temple harry foker relieved himself and broke out with that eulogium upon poetry and those regrets regarding a misspent youth which have just been mentioned and all the way along the strand and up to the door of pens very staircase in lamb court temple young harry foker did not cease to speak about singing and blanche amory     chapter xl relates to mr harry fokers affairs   since that fatal but delightful night in grosvenor place mr harry fokers heart had been in such a state of agitation as you would hardly have thought so great a philosopher could endure when we remember what good advice he had given to pen in former days how an early wisdom and knowledge of the world had manifested itself in this gifted youth how a constant course of selfindulgence such as becomes a gentleman of his means and expectations ought by right to have increased his cynicism and made him with every succeeding day of his life care less and less for every individual in the world with the single exception of mr harry foker one may wonder that he should fall into the mishap to which most of us are subject once or twice in our lives and disquiet his great mind about a woman but foker though early wise was still a man he could no more escape the common lot than achilles or ajax or lord nelson or adam our first father and now his time being come young harry became a victim to love the allconqueror  when he went to the back kitchen that night after quitting arthur pendennis at his staircasedoor in lamb court the gintwist and devilled turkey had no charms for him the jokes of his companions fell flatly on his ear and when mr hodgen the singer of the body snatcher had a new chant even more dreadful and humorous than that famous composition foker although he appeared his friend and said bravo hodgen as common politeness and his position as one of the chiefs of the back kitchen bound him to do yet never distinctly heard one word of the song which under its title of the cat in the cupboard hodgen has since rendered so famous late and very tired he slipped into his private apartments at home and sought the downy pillow but his slumbers were disturbed by the fever of his soul and the very instant that he woke from his agitated sleep the image of miss amory presented itself to him and said here i am i am your princess and beauty you have discovered me and shall care for nothing else hereafter  heavens how stale and distasteful his former pursuits and friendships appeared to him he had not been up to the present time much accustomed to the society of females of his own rank in life when he spoke of such he called them modest women that virtue which let us hope they possessed had not hitherto compensated to mr foker for the absence of more lively qualities which most of his own relatives did not enjoy and which he found in mesdemoiselles the ladies of the theatre his mother though good and tender did not amuse her boy his cousins the daughters of his maternal uncle the respectable earl of rosherville wearied him beyond measure one was blue and a geologist one was a horsewoman and smoked cigars one was exceedingly low church and had the most heterodox views on religious matters at least so the other said who was herself of the very highest church faction and made the cupboard in her room into an oratory and fasted on every friday in the year their paternal house of drummington foker could very seldom be got to visit he swore he had rather go on the treadmill than stay there he was not much beloved by the inhabitants lord erith lord roshervilles heir considered his cousin a low person of deplorably vulgar habits and manners while foker and with equal reason voted erith a prig and a dullard the nightcap of the house of commons the speakers opprobrium the dreariest of philanthropic spouters nor could george robert earl of gravesend and rosherville ever forget that on one evening when he condescended to play at billiards with his nephew that young gentleman poked his lordship in the side with his cue and said well old cock ive seen many a bad stroke in my life but i never saw such a bad one as that there he played the game out with angelic sweetness of temper for harry was his guest as well as his nephew but he was nearly having a fit in the night and he kept to his own rooms until young harry quitted drummington on his return to oxbridge where the interesting youth was finishing his education at the time when the occurrence took place it was an awful blow to the venerable earl the circumstance was never alluded to in the family he shunned foker whenever he came to see them in london or in the country and could hardly be brought to gasp out a how dye do to the young blasphemer but he would not break his sister agness heart by banishing harry from the family altogether nor indeed could he afford to break with mr foker senior between whom and his lordship there had been many private transactions producing an exchange of bankcheques from mr foker and autographs from the earl himself with the letters i o u written over his illustrious signature  besides the four daughters of lord gravesend whose various qualities have been enumerated in the former paragraph his lordship was blessed with a fifth girl the lady ana milton who from her earliest years and nursery had been destined to a peculiar position in life it was ordained between her parents and her aunt that when mr harry foker attained a proper age lady ann should become his wife the idea had been familiar to her mind when she yet wore pinafores and when harry the dirtiest of little boys used to come back with black eyes from school to drummington or to his fathers house of logwood where lady ann lived much with her aunt both of the young people coincided with the arrangement proposed by the elders without any protests or difficulty it no more entered lady anns mind to question the order of her father than it would have entered esthers to dispute the commands of ahasuerus the heirapparent of the house of foker was also obedient for when the old gentleman said harry your uncle and i have agreed that when youre of a proper age youll marry lady ann she wont have any money but shes good blood and a good one to look at and i shall make you comfortable if you refuse youll have your mothers jointure and two hundred a year during my lifeharry who knew that his sire though a man of few words was yet implicitly to be trusted acquiesced at once in the parental decree and said well sir if anns agreeable i say ditto shes not a badlooking girl  and she has the best blood in england sir your mothers blood your own blood sir said the brewer theres nothing like it sir  well sir as you like it harry replied when you want me please ring the bell only theres no hurry and i hope youll give us a long day i should like to have my fling out before i marry  fling away harry answered the benevolent father nobody prevents you do they and so very little more was said upon this subject and mr harry pursued those amusements in life which suited him best and hung up a little picture of his cousin in his sittingroom amidst the french prints the favourite actresses and dancers the racing and coaching works of art which suited his taste and formed his gallery it was an insignificant little picture representing a simple round face with ringlets and it made as it must be confessed a very poor figure by the side of mademoiselle petitot dancing over a rainbow or mademoiselle redowa grinning in red boots and a lancers cap  being engaged and disposed of lady ann milton did not go out so much in the world as her sisters and often stayed at home in london at the parental house in gaunt square when her mamma with the other ladies went abroad they talked and they danced with one man after another and the men came and went and the stories about them were various but there was only this one story about ann she was engaged to harry foker she never was to think about anybody else it was not a very amusing story  well the instant foker awoke on the day after lady claverings dinner there was blanches image glaring upon him with its clear grey eyes and winning smile there was her tune ringing in his ears yet round about the spot ofttimes i hover ofttimes i hover which poor foker began piteously to hum as he sat up in his bed under the crimson silken coverlet opposite him was a french print of a turkish lady and her greek lover surprised by a venerable ottoman the ladys husband on the other wall was a french print of a gentleman and lady riding and kissing each other at full gallop all round the chaste bedroom were more french prints either portraits of gauzy nymphs of the opera or lovely illustrations of the novels or mayhap an english chefdoeuvre or two in which miss calverley of t r e o would be represented in tight pantaloons in her favourite page part or miss rougemont as venus their value enhanced by the signatures of these ladies maria calverley or frederica rougemont inscribed underneath the prints in an exquisite facsimile such were the pictures in which honest harry delighted he was no worse than many of his neighbours he was an idle jovial kindly fast man about town and if his rooms were rather profusely decorated with works of french art so that simple lady agnes his mamma on entering the apartments where her darling sate enveloped in fragrant clouds of latakia was often bewildered by the novelties which she beheld there why it must be remembered that he was richer than most young men and could better afford to gratify his taste  a letter from miss calverley written in a very degage style of spelling and handwriting scrawling freely over the filagree paper and commencing by calling mr harry her dear hokeypokeyfokey lay on his bed table by his side amidst keys sovereigns cigarcases and a bit of verbena which miss amory had given him and reminding him of the arrival of the day when he was to stand that dinner at the elefant and castle at richmond which he had promised a card for a private box at miss rougemonts approaching benefit a bundle of tickets for ben budgeons night the north lancashire pippin at martin faunces the threecornered hat in st martins lane where conkey sam dick the nailor and deadman the worcestershire nobber would put on the gloves and the lovers of the good old british sport were invited to attendthese and sundry other memoirs of mr fokers pursuits and pleasure lay on the table by his side when he woke  ah how faint all these pleasures seemed now what did he care for conkey sam or the worcestershire nobber what for the french prints ogling him from all sides of the room those regular stunning slapup outandouters and calverley spelling bad and calling him hokeyfokey confound her impudence the idea of being engaged to a dinner at the elephant and castle at richmond with that old woman who was sevenandthirty years old if she was a day filled his mind with dreary disgust now instead of that pleasure which he had only yesterday expected to find from the entertainment  when his fond mamma beheld her boy that morning she remarked on the pallor of his cheek and the general gloom of his aspect why do you go on playing billiards at that wicked spratts lady agnes asked my dearest child those billiards will kill you im sure they will  it isnt the billiards harry said gloomily  then its the dreadful back kitchen said the lady agnes ive often thought dyou know harry of writing to the landlady and begging that she would have the kindness to put only very little wine in the negus which you take and see that you have your shawl on before you get into your brougham  do maam mrs cutts is a most kind motley woman harry said but it isnt the back kitchen neither he added with a ghastly sigh  as lady agnes never denied her son anything and fell into all his ways with the fondest acquiescence she was rewarded by a perfect confidence on young harrys part who never thought to disguise from her a knowledge of the haunts which he frequented and on the contrary brought her home choice anecdotes from the clubs and billiardrooms which the simple lady relished if she did not understand my son goes to spratts she would say to her confidential friends all the young men go to spratts after their balls it is de rigueur my dear and they play billiards as they used to play macao and hazard in mr foxs time yes my dear father often told me that they sate up always until nine oclock the next morning with mr fox at brookess whom i remember at drnmmington when i was a little girl in a buff waistcoat and black satin smallclothes my brother erith never played as a young man nor sate up latehe had no health for it but my boy must do as everybody does you know yes and then he often goes to a place called the back kitchen frequented by all the wits and authors you know whom one does not see in society but whom it is a great privilege and pleasure for harry to meet and there he hears the questions of the day discussed and my dear father often said that it was our duty to encourage literature and he had hoped to see the late dr johnson at drummington only dr johnson died yes and mr sheridan came over and drank a great deal of wineeverybody drank a great deal of wine in those daysand papas winemerchants bill was ten times as much as eriths is who gets it as he wants it from fortnum and masons and doesnt keep any stock at all  that was an uncommon good dinner we had yesterday maam the artful harry broke out their clear soups better than ours moufflet will put too much taragon into everything the supreme de volaille was very gooduncommon and the sweets were better than moufflets sweets did you taste the plombiere maam and the maraschino jelly stunningly good that maraschino jelly  lady agnes expressed her agreement in these as in almost all other sentiments of her son who continued the artful conversation saying  very handsome house that of the claverings furniture i should say got up regardless of expense magnificent display of plate maam the lady assented to all these propositions  very nice people the claverings  hm said lady agnes  i know what you mean lady c aint distangy exactly but she is very goodnatured  oh very mamma said who was herself one of the most goodnatured of women  and sir francis he dont talk much before ladies but after dinner he comes out uncommon strong maama highly agreeable wellinformed man when will you ask them to dinner look out for an early day maam and looking into lady agness pocketbook he chose a day only a fortnight hence an age that fortnight seemed to the young gentleman when the claverings were to be invited to grosvenorstreet  the obedient lady agnes wrote the required invitation she was accustomed to do so without consulting her husband who had his own society and habits and who left his wife to see her own friends alone harry looked at the card but there was an omission in the invitation which did not please him  you have not asked miss whatdyecallemmiss emery lady claverings daughter  oh that little creature lady agnes cried no i think not harry  we must ask miss amory foker said ii want to ask pendennis andand hes very sweet upon her dont you think she sings very well maam  i thought her rather forward and didnt listen to her singing she only sang at you and mr pendennis it seemed to me but i will ask her if you wish harry and so miss amorys name was written on the card with her mothers  this piece of diplomacy being triumphantly executed harry embraced his fond parent with the utmost affection and retired to his own apartments where he stretched himself on his ottoman and lay brooding silently sighing for the day which was to bring the fair miss amory under his paternal roof and devising a hundred wild schemes for meeting her  on his return from making the grand tour mr foker junior had brought with him a polyglot valet who took the place of stoopid and condescended to wait at dinner attired in shirt fronts of worked muslin with many gold studs and chains upon his master and the elders of the family this man who was of no particular country and spoke all languages indifferently ill made himself useful to mr harry in a variety of waysread all the artless youths correspondence knew his favourite haunts and the addresses of his acquaintance and officiated at the private dinners which the young gentleman gave as harry lay upon his sofa after his interview with his mamma robed in a wonderful dressinggown and puffing his pipe in gloomy silence anatole too must have remarked that something affected his masters spirits though he did not betray any illbred sympathy with harrys agitation of mind when harry began to dress himself in his outofdoor morning costume he was very hard indeed to please and particularly severe and snappish about his toilet he tried and cursed pantaloons of many different stripes checks and colours all the boots were villainously varnished the shirts too loud in pattern he scented his linen and person with peculiar richness this day and what must have been the valets astonishment when after some blushing and hesitation on harrys part the young gentleman asked i say anatole when i engaged you didnt youhemdidnt you say that you could dresshemdress hair  the valet said yes he could  cherchy alors une paire de tongsetcurly moi un peu mr foker said in an easy manner and the valet wondering whether his master was in love or was going masquerading went in search of the articlesfirst from the old butler who waited upon mr foker senior on whose bald pate the tongs would have scarcely found a hundred hairs to seize and finally of the lady who had the charge of the meek auburn fronts of the lady agnes and the tongs being got monsieur anatole twisted his young masters locks until he had made harrys head as curly as a negros after which the youth dressed himself with the utmost care and splendour and proceeded to sally out  at what dime sall i order de drag sir to be to miss calverleys door sir the attendant whispered as his master was going forth  confound herput the dinner offi cant go said foker no hang iti must go poyntz and rougemont and ever so many more are coming the drag at pelham corner at six oclock anatole  the drag was not one of mr fokers own equipages but was hired from a liverystable for festive purposes foker however put his own carriage into requisition that morning and for what purpose does the kind reader suppose why to drive down to lamb court temple taking grosvenor place by the way which lies in the exact direction of the temple from grosvenor street as everybody knows where he just had the pleasure of peeping upwards at miss amorys pink windowcurtains having achieved which satisfactory feat he drove off to pens chambers why did he want to see his dear friend pen so much why did he yearn and long after him and did it seem necessary to fokers very existence that he should see pen that morning having parted with him in perfect health on the night previous pen had lived two years in london and foker had not paid half a dozen visits to his chambers what sent him thither now in such a hurry  whatif any young ladies read this page i have only to inform them that when the same mishap befalls them which now had for more than twelve hours befallen harry foker people will grow interesting to them for whom they did not care sixpence on the day before as on the other hand persons of whom they fancied themselves fond will be found to have become insipid and disagreeable then you dearest eliza or maria of the other day to whom you wrote letters and sent locks of hair yards long will on a sudden be as indifferent to you as your stupidest relation whilst on the contrary about his relations you will begin to feel such a warm interest such a loving desire to ingratiate yourself with his mamma such a liking for that dear kind old man his father if he is in the habit of visiting at any house what advances you will make in order to visit there too if he has a married sister you will like to spend long mornings with her you will fatigue your servant by sending notes to her for which there will be the most pressing occasion twice or thrice in a day you will cry if your mamma objects to your going too often to see his family the only one of them you will dislike is perhaps his younger brother who is at home for the holidays and who will persist in staying in the room when you come to see your dear newfound friend his darling second sister something like this will happen to you young ladies or at any rate let us hope it may yes you must go through the hot fits and the cold fits of that pretty fever your mothers if they would acknowledge it have passed through it before you were born your dear papa being the object of the passion of coursewho could it be but he and as you suffer it so will your brothers in their wayand after their kind more selfish than you more eager and headstrong than you they will rush on their destiny when the doomed charmer makes her appearance or if they dont and you dont heaven help you as the gambler said of his dice to love and win is the best thing to love and lose is the next best you dont die of the complaint or very few do the generous wounded heart suffers and survives it and he is not a man or she a woman who is not conquered by it or who does not conquer it in his timenow then if you ask why henry foker esquire was in such a hurry to see arthur pendennis and felt such a sudden value and esteem for him there is no difficulty in saying it was because pen had become really valuable in mr fokers eyes because if pen was not the rose he yet had been near that fragrant flower of love was not he in the habit of going to her house in london did he not live near her in the countryknow all about the enchantress what i wonder would lady ann milton mr fokers cousin and pretendue have said if her ladyship had known all that was going on in the bosom of that funny little gentleman  alas when foker reached lamb court leaving his carriage for the admiration of the little clerks who were lounging in the archway that leads thence into flag court which leads into upper temple lane warrington was in the chambers but pen was absent pen was gone to the printingoffice to see his proofs would foker have a pipe and should the laundress go to the cock and get him some beerwarrington asked remarking with a pleased surprise the splendid toilet of this scented and shinybooted young aristocrat but foker had not the slightest wish for beer or tobacco he had very important business he rushed away to the pall mall gazette office still bent upon finding pen pen had quitted that pace foker wanted him that they might go together to call upon lady clavering foker went away disconsolate and whiled away an hour or two vaguely at clubs and when it was time to pay a visit he thought it would be but decent and polite to drive to grosvenor place and leave a card upon lady clavering he had not the courage to ask to see her when the door was opened he only delivered two cards with mr henry foker engraved upon them to jeames in a speechless agony jeames received the tickets bowing his powdered head the varnished doors closed upon him the beloved object was as far as ever from him though so near he thought he heard the tones of a piano and of a syren singing coming from the drawingroom and sweeping over the balconyshrubbery of geraniums he would have liked to stop and listen but it might not be drive to tattersalls he said to the groom in a voice smothered with emotionand bring my pony round he added as the man drove rapidly away  as good luck would have it that splendid barouche of lady claverings which has been inadequately described in a former chapter drove up to her ladyships door just as foker mounted the pony which was in waiting for him he bestrode the fiery animal and dodged about the arch of the green park keeping the carriage well in view until he saw lady clavering enter and with herwhose could be that angel form but the enchantresss clad in a sort of gossamer with a pink bonnet and a lightblue parasolbut miss amory  the carriage took its fair owners to madame rigodons cap and lace shop to mrs wolseys berlin worsted shopwho knows to what other resorts of female commerce then it went and took ices at hunters for lady clavering was somewhat florid in her tastes and amusements and not only liked to go abroad in the most showy carriage in london but that the public should see her in it too and so in a white bonnet with a yellow feather she ate a large pink ice in the sunshine before hunters door till foker on his pony and the red jacket who accompanied him were almost tired of dodging  then at last she made her way into the park and the rapid foker made his dash forward what to do just to get a nod of recognition from miss amory and her mother to cross them a halfdozen times in the drive to watch and ogle them from the other side of the ditch where the horsemen assemble when the band plays in kensington gardens what is the use of looking at a woman in a pink bonnet across a ditch what is the earthly good to be got out of a nod of the head strange that men will be contented with such pleasures or if not contented at least that they will be so eager in seeking them not one word did harry he so fluent of conversation ordinarily change with his charmer on that day mutely he beheld her return to her carriage and drive away among rather ironical salutes from the young men in the park one said that the indian widow was making the paternal rupees spin rapidly another said that she ought to have burned herself alive and left the money to her daughter this one asked who clavering wasand old tom eales who knew everybody and never missed a day in the park on his grey cob kindly said that clavering had come into an estate over head and heels in mortgage that there were devlish ugly stories about him when he was a young man and that it was reported of him that he had a share in a gamblinghouse and had certainly shown the white feather in his regiment he plays still he is in a hell every night almost mr eales added  i should think so since his marriage said a wag  he gives devilish good dinners said foker striking up for the honour of his host of yesterday  i daresay and i daresay he doesnt ask eales the wag said i say eales do you dine at claveringsat the begums  i dine there said mr eales who would have dined with beelzebub if sure of a good cook and when he came away would have painted his host blacker than fate had made him  you might you know although you do abuse him so continued the wag they say its very pleasant clavering goes to sleep after dinner the begum gets tipsy with cherrybrandy and the young lady sings songs to the young gentlemen she sings well dont she fo  slap up said fo i tell you what poyntz she sings like a whatdyecallumyou know what i meanlike a mermaid you know but thats not their name  i never heard a mermaid sing mr poyntz the wag replied whoever heard a mermaid eales you are an old fellow did you  dont make a lark of me hang it poyntz said foker turning red and with tears almost in his eyes you know what i mean its those whatshisnamesin homer you know i never said i was a good scholar  and nobody ever said it of you my boy mr poyntz remarked and foker striking spurs into his pony cantered away down rotten row his mind agitated with various emotions ambitions mortifications he was sorry that he had not been good at his books in early lifethat he might have cut out all those chaps who were about her and who talked the languages and wrote poetry and painted pictures in her album andand thatwhat am i thought little foker compared to her shes all soul she is and can write poetry or compose music as easy as i could drink a glass of beer beerdamme thats all im fit for is beer i am a poor ignorant little beggar good for nothing but fokers entire i misspent my youth and used to get the chaps to do my exercises and whats the consequences now oh harry foker what a confounded little fool you have been  as he made this dreary soliloquy he had cantered out of rotten row into the park and there was on the point of riding down a large old roomy family carriage of which he took no heed when a cheery voice cried out harry harry and looking up he beheld his aunt the lady rosherville and two of her daughters of whom the one who spoke was harrys betrothed the lady ann  he started back with a pale scared look as a truth about which he had not thought during the whole day came across him there was his fate there in the back seat of that carriage  what is the matter harry why are you so pale you have been raking and smoking too much you wicked boy said lady ann  foker said how do aunt how do ann in a perturbed mannermuttered something about a pressing engagementindeed he saw by the park clock that he must have been keeping his party in the drag waiting for nearly an hourand waved a goodbye the little man and the little pony were out of sight in an instantthe great carriage rolled away nobody inside was very much interested about his coming or going the countess being occupied with her spaniel the lady lucys thoughts and eyes being turned upon a volume of sermons and those of the lady ann upon a new novel which the sisters had just procured from the library     chapter xli carries the reader both to richmond and greenwich  poor foker found the dinner at richmond to be the most dreary entertainment upon which ever mortal man wasted his guineas i wonder how the deuce i could ever have liked these people he thought in his own mind why i can see the crowsfeet under rougemonts eyes and the paint on her cheeks is laid on as thick as clowns in a pantomime the way in which that calverley talks slang is quite disgusting i hate chaff in a woman and old colchicum that old col coming down here in his brougham with his coronet on it and sitting bodkin between mademoiselle coralie and her mother its too bad an english peer and a horserider of franconisit wont do by jove it wont do i aint proud but it will not do  twopencehalfpenny for your thoughts fokey cried out miss rougemont taking her cigar from her truly vermilion lips as she beheld the young fellow lost in thought seated at the head of his table amidst melting ices and cut pineapples and bottles full and empty and cigarashes scattered on fruit and the ruins of a dessert which had no pleasure for him  does foker ever think drawled out mr poyntz foker here is a considerable sum of money offered by a fair capitalist at this end of the table for the present emanations of your valuable and acute intellect old boy  what the deuce is that poyntz a talking about miss calverley asked of her neighbour i hate him hes a drawlin sneerin beast  what a droll of a little man is that little fokare my lor mademoiselle coralie said in her own language and with the rich twang of that sunny gascony in which her swarthy cheeks and bright black eyes had got their fire what a droll of a man he does not look to have twenty years  i wish i were of his age said the venerable colchicum with a sigh as he inclined his purple face towards a large goblet of claret  cte jeunesse peuh je men fiche said madame brack coralies mamma taking a great pinch out of lord colchicums delicate gold snuffbox je maime que les hommes faits moi comme milor coralie nestce pas que tu naimes que les hommes faits ma bichette  my lord said with a grin you flatter me madame brack  taisezvous maman vous netes quune bete coralie cried with a shrug of her robust shoulders upon which my lord said that she did not flatter at any rate and pocketed his snuffbox not desirous that madame bracks dubious fingers should plunge too frequently into his mackabaw  there is no need to give a prolonged detail of the animated conversation which ensued during the rest of the banquet a conversation which would not much edify the reader and it is scarcely necessary to say that all ladies of the corps de dance are not like miss calverley any more than that all peers resemble that illustrious member of their order the late lamented viscount colchicum but there have been such in our memories who have loved the society of riotous youth better than the company of men of their own age and rank and have given the young ones the precious benefit of their experience and example and there have been very respectable men too who have not objected so much to the kind of entertainment as to the publicity of it i am sure for instance that our friend major pendennis would have made no sort of objection to join the a party of pleasure provided that it were en petit comite and that such men as my lord steyne and my lord colchicum were of the society give the young men their pleasures this worthy guardian said to pen more than once im not one of your straitlaced moralists but an old man of the world begad and i know that as long as it lasts young men will be young men and there were some young men to whom this estimable philosopher accorded about seventy years as the proper period for sowing their wild oats but they were men of fashion  mr foker drove his lovely guests home to brompton in the drag that night but he was quite thoughtful and gloomy during the whole of the little journey from richmond neither listening to the jokes of the friends behind him and on the box by his side nor enlivening them as was his wont by his own facetious sallies and when the ladies whom he had conveyed alighted at the door of their house and asked their accomplished coachman whether he would not step in and take something to drink he declined with so melancholy an air that they supposed that the governor and he had had a difference or that some calamity had befallen him and he did not tell these people what the cause of his grief was but left mesdames rougemont and calverley unheeding the cries of the latter who hung over her balcony like jezebel and called out to him to ask him to give another party soon  he sent the drag home under the guidance of one of the grooms and went on foot himself his hands in his pockets plunged in thought the stars and moon shining tranquilly overhead looked down upon mr foker that night as he in his turn sentimentally regarded them and he went and gazed upwards at the house in grosvenor place and at the windows which he supposed to be those of the beloved object and he moaned and he sighed in a way piteous and surprising to witness which policeman x did who informed sir francis claverings people as they took the refreshment of beer on the coachbox at the neighbouring publichouse after bringing home their lady from the french play that there had been another chap hanging about the premises that eveninga little chap dressed like a swell  and now with that perspicuity and ingenuity and enterprise which only belongs to a certain passion mr foker began to dodge miss amory through london and to appear wherever he could meet her if lady clavering went to the french play where her ladyship had a box mr foker whose knowledge of the language as we have heard was not conspicuous appeared in a stall he found out where her engagements were it is possible that anatole his man was acquainted with sir francis claverings gentleman and so got a sight of her ladyships engagementbook and at many of these evening parties mr foker made his appearanceto the surprise of the world and of his mother especially whom he ordered to apply for cards to these parties for which until now he had shown a supreme contempt he told the pleased and unsuspicious lady that he went to parties because it was right for him to see the world he told her that he went to the french play because he wanted to perfect himself in the language and there was no such good lesson as a comedy or vaudevilleand when one night the astonished lady agnes saw him stand up and dance and complimented him upon his elegance and activity the mendacious little rogue asserted that he had learned to dance in paris whereas anatole knew that his young master used to go off privily to an academy in brewer street and study there for some hours in the morning the casino of our modern days was not invented or was in its infancy as yet and gentlemen of mr fokers time had not the facilities of acquiring the science of dancing which are enjoyed by our present youth  old pendennis seldom missed going to church he considered it to be his duty as a gentleman to patronise the institution of public worship and that it was quite a correct thing to be seen at church of a sunday one day it chanced that he and arthur went thither together the latter who was now in high favour had been to breakfast with his uncle from whose lodging they walked across the park to a church not far from belgrave square there was a charity sermon at saint jamess as the major knew by the bills posted on the pillars of his parish church which probably caused him for he was a thrifty man to forsake it for that day besides he had other views for himself and pen we will go to church sir across the park and then begad we will go to the claverings house and ask them for lunch in a friendly way lady clavering likes to be asked for lunch and is uncommonly kind and monstrous hospitable  i met them at dinner last week at lady agnes fokers sir pen said and the begum was very kind indeed so she was in the country so she is everywhere but i share your opinion about miss amory one of your opinions that is uncle for you were changing the last time we spoke about her  and what do you think of her now the elder said  i think her the most confounded little flirt in london pen answered laughing she made a tremendous assault upon harry foker who sat next to her and to whom she gave all the talk though i took her down  bah henry foker is engaged to his cousin all the world knows it not a bad coup of lady roshervilles that i should say that the young man at his fathers death and old fokers lifes devilish bad you know he had a fit at arthurs last year i should say that young foker wont have less than fourteen thousand a year from the brewery besides logwood and norfolk property ive no pride about me pen i like a man of birth certainly but dammy i like a brewery which brings in a man fourteen thousand a year hey pen ha ha thats the sort of man for me and i recommend you now that you are lanced in the world to stick to fellows of that sort to fellows who have a stake in the country begad  foker sticks to me sir arthur answered he has been at our chambers several times lately he has asked me to dinner we are almost as great friends as we used to be in our youth and his talk is about blanche amory from morning till night im sure hes sweet upon her  im sure he is engaged to his cousin and that they will keep the young man to his bargain said the major the marriages in these families are affairs of state lady agnes was made to marry old foker by the late lord although she was notoriously partial to her cousin who was killed at albuera afterwards and who saved her life out of the lake at drummington i remember lady agnes sir an exceedingly fine woman but what did she doof course she married her fathers man why mr foker sate for drummington till the reform bill and paid devlish well for his seat too and you may depend upon this sir that foker senior who is a parvenu and loves a great man as all parvenus do has ambitious views for his son as well as himself and that your friend harry must do as his father bids him lord bless you ive known a hundred cases of love in young men and women hey master arthur do you take me they kick sir they resist they make a deuce of a riot and that sort of thing but they end by listening to reason begad  blanche is a dangerous girl sir pen said i was smitten with her myself once and very far gone too he added but that is years ago  were you how far did it go did she return it asked the major looking hard at pen  pen with a laugh said that at one time he did think he was pretty well in miss amorys good graces but my mother did not like her and the affair went off pen did not think it fit to tell his uncle all the particulars of that courtship which had passed between himself and the young lady  a man might go farther and fare worse arthur the major said still looking queerly at his nephew  her birth sir her father was the mate of a ship they say and she has not money enough objected pen in a dandified manner whats ten thousand pound and a girl bred up like her  you use my own words and it is all very well but i tell you in confidence penin strict honour mindthat its my belief she has a devilish deal more than ten thousand pound and from what i saw of her the other day andand have heard of heri should say she was a devilish accomplished clever girl and would make a good wife with a sensible husband  how do you know about her money pen asked smiling you seem to have information about everybody and to know about all the town  i do know a few things sir and i dont tell all i know mark that the uncle replied and as for that charming miss amoryfor charming begad she isif i saw her mrs arthur pendennis i should neither be sorry nor surprised begad and if you object to ten thousand pound what would you say sir to thirty or forty or fifty and the major looked still more knowingly and still harder at pen  well sir he said to his godfather and namesake make her mrs arthur pendennis you can do it as well as i  psha you are laughing at me sir the other replied rather peevishly and you ought not to laugh so near a church gate here we are at st benedicts they say mr oriel is a beautiful preacher  indeed the bells were tolling the people were trooping into the handsome church the carriages of the inhabitants of the lordly quarter poured forth their pretty loads of devotees in whose company pen and his uncle ending their edifying conversation entered the fane i do not know whether other people carry their worldly affairs to the church door arthur who from habitual reverence and feeling was always more than respectful in a place of worship thought of the incongruity of their talk perhaps whilst the old gentleman at his side was utterly unconscious of any such contrast his hat was brushed his wig was trim his neckcloth was perfectly tied he looked at every soul in the congregation it is true the bald heads and the bonnets the flowers and the feathers but so demurely that he hardly lifted up his eyes from his bookfrom his book which he could not read without glasses as for pens gravity it was sorely put to the test when upon looking by chance towards the seats where the servants were collected he spied out by the side of a demure gentleman in plush henry foker esquire who had discovered this place of devotion following the direction of harrys eye which strayed a good deal from his book pen found that it alighted upon a yellow bonnet and a pink one and that these bonnets were on the heads of lady clavering and blanche amory if pens uncle is not the only man who has talked about his worldly affairs up to the church door is poor harry foker the only one who has brought his worldly love into the aisle  when the congregation issued forth at the conclusion of the service foker was out amongst the first but pen came up with him presently as he was hankering about the entrance which he was unwilling to leave until my ladys barouche with the bewigged coachman had borne away its mistress and her daughter from their devotions  when the two ladies came out they found together the pendennises uncle and nephew and harry foker esquire sucking the crook of his stick standing there in the sunshine to see and to ask to eat were simultaneous with the goodnatured begum and she invited the three gentlemen to luncheon straightway  blanche was too particularly gracious o do come she said to arthur if you are not too great a man i want so to talk to you aboutbut we mustnt say what here you know what would mr oriel say and the young devotee jumped into the carriage after her mammaive read every word of it its adorable she added still addressing herself to pen  i know who is said mr arthur making rather a pert bow  whats the row about asked mr foker rather puzzled  i suppose miss clavering means walter lorraine said the major looking knowing and nodding at pen  i suppose so sir there was a famous review in the pall mall this morning it was warringtons doing though and i must not be too proud  a review in pall mallwalter lorraine what the doose do you mean foker asked walter lorraine died of the measles poor little beggar when we were at grey friars i remember his mother coming up  you are not a literary man foker pen said laughing and hooking his arm into his friends you must know i have been writing a novel and some of the papers have spoken very well of it perhaps you dont read the sunday papers  i read bells life regular old boy mr foker answered at which pen laughed again and the three gentlemen proceeded in great goodhumour to lady claverings house  the subject of the novel was resumed after luncheon by miss amory who indeed loved poets and men of letters if she loved anything and was sincerely an artist in feeling some of the passages in the book made me cry positively they did she said  pen said with some fatuity i am happy to think i have a part of vos larmes miss blancheand the major who had not read more than six pages of pens book put on his sanctified look saying yes there are some passages quite affecting monsous affecting andoh if it makes you crylady amory declared she would not read it that she wouldnt  dont mamma blanche said with a french shrug of her shoulders and then she fell into a rhapsody about the book about the snatches of poetry interspersed in it about the two heroines leonora and neaera about the two heroes walter lorraine and his rival the young dukeand what good company you introduce us to said the young lady archly quel ton how much of your life have you passed at court and are you a prime ministers son mr arthur  pen began to laughit is as cheap for a novelist to create a duke as to make a baronet he said shall i tell you a secret miss amory i promoted all my characters at the request of the publisher the young duke was only a young baron when the novel was first written his false friend the viscount was a simple commoner and so on with all the characters of the story  what a wicked satirical pert young man you have become comme vous voila forme said the young lady how different from arthur pendennis of the country ah i think i like arthur pendennis of the country best though and she gave him the full benefit of her eyesboth of the fond appealing glance into his own and of the modest look downwards towards the carpet which showed off her dark eyelids and long fringed lashes  pen of course protested that he had not changed in the least to which the young lady replied by a tender sigh and thinking that she had done quite enough to make arthur happy or miserable as the case might be she proceeded to cajole his companion mr harry foker who during the literary conversation had sate silently imbibing the head of his cane and wishing that he was a clever chap like that pen  if the major thought that by telling miss amory of mr fokers engagement to his cousin lady ann milton which information the old gentleman neatly conveyed to the girl as he sate by her side at luncheon belowstairsif we say the major thought that the knowledge of this fact would prevent blanche from paying any further attention to the young heir of fokers entire he was entirely mistaken she became only the more gracious to foker she praised him and everything belonging to him she praised his mamma she praised the pony which he rode in the park she praised the lovely breloques or gimcracks which the young gentleman wore at his watchchain and that dear little darling of a cane and those dear little delicious monkeys heads with ruby eyes which ornamented harrys shirt and formed the buttons of his waistcoat and then having praised and coaxed the weak youth until he blushed and tingled with pleasure and until pen thought she really had gone quite far enough she took another theme  i am afraid mr foker is a very sad young man she said turning round to pen  he does not look so pen answered with a sneer  i mean we have heard sad stories about him havent we mamma what was mr poyntz saying here the other day about that party at richmond o you naughty creature but here seeing that harrys countenance assumed a great expression of alarm while pens wore a look of amusement she turned to the latter and said i believe you are just as bad i believe you would have liked to have been therewouldnt you i know you would yesand so should i  lor blanche mamma cried  well i would i never saw an actress in my life i would give anything to know one for i adore talent and i adore richmond that i do and i adore greenwich and i say i should like to go there  why should not we three bachelors the major here broke out gallantly and to his nephews special surprise beg these ladies to honour us with their company at greenwich is lady clavering to go on for ever being hospitable to us and may we make no return speak for yourselves young meneh begad here is my nephew with his pockets full of moneyhis pockets full begad and mr henry foker who as i have heard say is pretty well to do in the worldhow is your lovely cousin lady ann mr fokerhere are these two young onesand they allow an old fellow like me to speak lady clavering will you do me the favour to be my guest and miss blanche shall be arthurs if she will be so good  oh delightful cried blanche  i like a bit of fun too said lady clavering and we will take some day when sir francis  when sir francis dines outyes mamma the daughter said it will be charming  and a charming day it was the dinner was ordered at greenwich and foker though he did not invite miss amory had some delicious opportunities of conversation with her during the repast and afterwards on the balcony of their room at the hotel and again during the drive home in her ladyships barouche pen came down with his uncle in sir hugh trumpingtons brougham which the major borrowed for the occasion i am an old soldier begad he said and i learned in early life to make myself comfortable  and being an old soldier he allowed the two young men to pay for the dinner between them and all the way home in the brougham he rallied pen about miss amorys evident partiality for him praised her good looks spirits and wit and again told pen in the strictest confidence that she would be a devilish deal richer than people thought     chapter xlii contains a novel incident   some account has been given in a former part of this story how mr pen during his residence at home after his defeat at oxbridge had occupied himself with various literary compositions and amongst other works had written the greater part of a novel this book written under the influence of his youthful embarrassments amatory and pecuniary was of a very fierce gloomy and passionate sortthe byronic despair the wertherian despondency the mocking bitterness of mephistopheles of faust were all reproduced and developed in the character of the hero for our youth had just been learning the german language and imitated as almost all clever lads do his favourite poets and writers passages in the volumes once so loved and now read so seldom still bear the mark of the pencil with which he noted them in those days tears fell upon the leaf of the book perhaps or blistered the pages of his manuscript as the passionate young man dashed his thoughts down if he took up the books afterwards he had no ability or wish to sprinkle the leaves with that early dew of former times his pencil was no longer eager to score its marks of approval but as he looked over the pages of his manuscript he remembered what had been overflowing feelings which had caused him to blot it and the pain which had inspired the line if the secret history of books could be written and the authors private thoughts and meanings noted down alongside of his story how many insipid volumes would become interesting and dull tales excite the reader many a bitter smile passed over pens face as he read his novel and recalled the time and feelings which gave it birth how pompous some of the grand passages appeared and how weak were others in which he thought he had expressed his full heart this page was imitated from a then favourite author as he could now clearly see and confess though he had believed himself to be writing originally then as he mused over certain lines he recollected the place and hour where he wrote them the ghost of the dead feeling came back as he mused and he blushed to review the faint image and what meant those blots on the page as you come in the desert to a ground where camels hoofs are marked in the clay and traces of withered herbage are yet visible you know that water was there once so the place in pens mind was no longer green and the fons lacrymarum was dried up  he used this simile one morning to warrington as the latter sate over his pipe and book and pen with much gesticulation according to his wont when excited and with a bitter laugh thumped his manuscript down on the table making the teathings rattle and the blue milk dance in the jug on the previous night he had taken the manuscript out of a longneglected chest containing old shooting jackets old oxbridge scribblingbooks his old surplice and battered cap and gown and other memorials of youth school and home he read in the volume in bed until he fell asleep for the commencement of the tale was somewhat dull and he had come home tired from a london evening party  by jove said pen thumping down his papers when i think that these were written but very few years ago i am ashamed of my memory i wrote this when i believed myself be eternally in love with that little coquette miss amory i used to carry down verses to her and put them into the hollow of a tree and dedicate them amori  that was a sweet little play upon words warrington remarked with a puff amoryamori it showed proof of scholarship let us hear a bit of the rubbish and he stretched over from his easychair and caught hold of pens manuscript with the firetongs which he was just using in order to put a coal into his pipe thus in possession of the volume he began to read out from the leaves from the lifebook of walter lorraine  false as thou art beautiful heartless as thou art fair mockery of passion walter cried addressing leonora what evil spirit hath sent thee to torture me so o leonora  cut that part cried out pen making a dash at the book which however his comrade would not release well dont read it out at any rate thats about my other flame my firstlady mirabel that is now i saw her last night at lady whistons she asked me to a party at her house and said that as old friends we ought to meet oftener she has been seeing me any time these two years in town and never thought of inviting me before but seeing wenham talking to me and monsieur dubois the french literary man who had a dozen orders on and might have passed for a marshal of france she condescended to invite me the claverings are to be there on the same evening wont it be exciting to meet ones two flames at the same table  two flamestwo heaps of burntout cinders warrington said are both the beauties in this book  both or something like them pen said leonora who marries the duke is the fotheringay i drew the duke from magnus charters with whom i was at oxford its a little like him and miss amory is neaera by gad that first woman i thought of her as i walked home from lady whistons in the moonlight and the whole early scenes came back to me as if they had been yesterday and when i got home i pulled out the story which i wrote about her and the other three years ago do you know outrageous as it is it has some good stuff in it and if bungay wont publish it i think bacon will  thats the way of poets said warrington they fall in love jilt or are jilted they suffer and they cry out that they suffer more than any other mortals and when they have experienced feelings enough they note them down in a book and take the book to market all poets are humbugs all literary men are humbugs directly a man begins to sell his feelings for money hes a humbug if a poet gets a pain in his side from too good a dinner he bellows ai ai louder than prometheus  i suppose a poet has a greater sensibility than another man said pen with some spirit that is what makes him a poet i suppose that he sees and feels more keenly it is that which makes him speak of what he feels and sees you speak eagerly enough in your leading articles when you espy a false argument in an opponent or detect a quack in the house paley who does not care for anything else in the world will talk for an hour about a question of law give another the privilege which you take yourself and the free use of his faculty and let him be what nature has made him why should not a man sell his sentimental thoughts as well as you your political ideas or paley his legal knowledge each alike is a matter of experience and practice it is not money which causes you to perceive a fallacy or paley to argue a point but a natural or acquired aptitude for that kind of truth and a poet sets down his thoughts and experiences upon paper as a painter does a landscape or a face upon canvas to the best of his ability and according to his particular gift if ever i think i have the stuff in me to write an epic by jove i will try if i only feel that i am good enough to crack a joke or tell a story i will do that  not a bad speech young one warrington said but that does not prevent all poets from being humbugs  whathomer aeschylus shakspeare and all  their names are not to be breathed in the same sense with you pigmies mr warrington said there are men and men sir  well shakspeare was a man who wrote for money just as you and i do pen answered at which warrington confounded his impudence and resumed his pipe and his manuscript  there was not the slightest doubt then that this document contained a great deal of pens personal experiences and that leaves from the lifebook of walter lorraine would never have been written but for arthur pendenniss own private griefs passions and follies as we have become acquainted with these in the first volume of his biography it will not be necessary to make large extracts from the novel of walter lorraine in which the young gentleman had depicted such of them as he thought were likely to interest the reader or were suitable for the purpose of his story  now though he had kept it in his box for nearly half of the period during which according to the horatian maxim a work of art ought to lie ripening a maxim the truth of which may by the way be questioned altogether mr pen had not buried his novel for this time in order that the work might improve but because he did not know where else to bestow it or had no particular desire to see it a man who thinks of putting away a composition for ten years before he shall give it to the world or exercise his own maturer judgment upon it had best be very sure of the original strength and durability of the work otherwise on withdrawing it from its crypt he may find that like small wine it has lost what flavour it once had and is only tasteless when opened there are works of all tastes and smacks the small and the strong those that improve by age and those that wont bear keeping at all but are pleasant at the first draught when they refresh and sparkle  now pen had never any notion even in the time of his youthful inexperience and fervour of imagination that the story he was writing was a masterpiece of composition or that he was the equal of the great authors whom he admired and when he now reviewed his little performance he was keenly enough alive to its faults and pretty modest regarding its merits it was not very good he thought but it was as good as most books of the kind that had the run of circulating libraries and the career of the season he had critically examined more than one fashionable novel by the authors of the day then popular and he thought that his intellect was as good as theirs and that he could write the english language as well as those ladies or gentlemen and as he now ran over his early performance he was pleased to find here and there passages exhibiting both fancy and vigour and traits if not of genius of genuine passion and feeling this too was warringtons verdict when that severe critic after half an hours perusal of the manuscript and the consumption of a couple of pipes of tobacco laid pens book down yawning portentously i cant read any more of that balderdash now he said but it seems to me there is some good stuff in it pen my boy theres a certain greenness and freshness in it which i like somehow the bloom disappears off the face of poetry after you begin to shave you cant get up that naturalness and artless rosy tint in after days your cheeks are pale and have got faded by exposure to evening parties and you are obliged to take curlingirons and macassar and the deuceknowswhat to your whiskers they curl ambrosially and you are very grand and genteel and so forth but ah pen the springtime was the best  what the deuce have my whiskers to do with the subject in hand pen said who perhaps may have been nettled by warringtons allusion to those ornaments which to say the truth the young man coaxed and curled and oiled and perfumed and petted in rather an absurd manner do you think we can do anything with walter lorraine shall we take him to the publishers or make an autodafe of him  i dont see what is the good of incremation warrington said though i have a great mind to put him into the fire to punish your atrocious humbug and hypocrisy shall i burn him indeed you have much too great a value for him to hurt a hair of his head  have i here goes said pen and walter lorraine went off the table and was flung on to the coals but the fire having done its duty of boiling the young mans breakfastkettle had given up work for the day and had gone out as pen knew very well warrington with a scornful mile once more took up the manuscript with the tongs from out of the harmless cinders  oh pen what a humbug you are warrington said and what is worst of all sir a clumsy humbug i saw you look to see that the fire was out before you sent walter lorraine behind the bars no we wont burn him we will carry him to the egyptians and sell him we will exchange him away for money yea for silver and gold and for beef and for liquors and for tobacco and for raiment this youth will fetch some price in the market for he is a comely lad though not over strong but we will fatten him up and give him the bath and curl his hair and we will sell him for a hundred piasters to bacon or to bungay the rubbish is saleable enough sir and my advice to you is this the next time you go home for a holiday take walter lorraine in your carpetbaggive him a more modern air prune away though sparingly some of the green passages and add a little comedy and cheerfulness and satire and that sort of thing and then well take him to market and sell him the book is not a wonder of wonders but it will do very well  do you think so warrington said pen delighted for this was great praise from his cynical friend  you silly young fool i think its uncommonly clever warrington said in a kind voice so do you sir and with the manuscript which he held in his hand he playfully struck pen on the cheek that part of pens countenance turned as red as it had ever done in the earliest days of his blushes he grasped the others hand and said thank you warrington with all his might and then he retired to his own room with his book and passed the greater part of the day upon his bed rereading it and he did as warrington had advised and altered not a little and added a great deal until at length he had fashioned walter lorraine pretty much into the shape in which as the respected novelreader knows it subsequently appeared  whilst he was at work upon this performance the goodnatured warrington artfully inspired the two gentlemen who read for messrs bacon and bungay with the greatest curiosity regarding walter lorraine and pointed out the peculiar merits of its distinguished author it was at the period when the novel called the fashionable was in vogue among us and warrington did not fail to point out as before how pen was a man of the very first fashion himself and received at the houses of some of the greatest personages in the land the simple and kindhearted percy popjoy was brought to bear upon mrs bungay whom he informed that his friend pendennis was occupied upon a work of the most exciting nature a work that the whole town would run after full of wit genius satire pathos and every conceivable good quality we have said before that bungay knew no more about novels than he did about hebrew or algebra and neither read nor understood any of the books which he published and paid for but he took his opinions from his professional advisers and from mrs b and evidently with a view to a commercial transaction asked pendennis and warrington to dinner again  bacon when he found that bungay was about to treat of course began to be anxious and curious and desired to outbid his rival was anything settled between mr pendennis and the odious house over the way about the new book mr hack the confidential reader was told to make inquiries and see if any thing was to be done and the result of the inquiries of that diplomatist was that one morning bacon himself toiled up the staircase of lamb court and to the door on which the names of mr warrington and mr pendennis were painted  for a gentleman of fashion as poor pen was represented to be it must be confessed that the apartments he and his friend occupied were not very suitable the ragged carpet had grown only more ragged during the two years of joint occupancy a constant odour of tobacco perfumed the sittingroom bacon tumbled over the laundresss buckets in the passage through which he had to pass warringtons shootingjacket was as tattered at the elbows as usual and the chair which bacon was requested to take on entering broke down with the publisher warrington burst out laughing said that bacon had got the game chair and bawled out to pen to fetch a sound one from his bedroom and seeing the publisher looking round the dingy room with an air of profound pity and wonder asked him whether he didnt think the apartments were elegant and if he would like for mrs bacons drawingroom any of the articles of furniture mr warringtons character as a humourist was known to mr bacon i never can make that chap out the publisher was heard to say or tell whether he is in earnest or only chaffing  it is very possible that mr bacon would have set the two gentlemen down as impostors altogether but that there chanced to be on the breakfasttable certain cards of invitation which the post of the morning had brought in for pen and which happened to come from some very exalted personage of the beaumonde into which our young man had his introduction looking down upon these bacon saw that the marchioness of steyne would be at home to mr arthur pendennis upon a given day and that another lady of distinction proposed to have dancing at her house upon a certain future evening warrington saw the admiring publisher eyeing these documents ah said he with an air of simplicity pendennis is one of the most affable young men i ever knew mr bacon here is a young fellow that dines with all the men in london and yet hell take his muttonchop with you and me quite contentedly theres nothing like the affability of the old english gentleman  oh no nothing said mr bacon  and you wonder why he should go on living up three pair of stairs with me dont you now well it is a queer taste but we are fond of each other and as i cant afford to live in a great house he comes and stays in these rickety old chambers with me hes a man that can afford to live anywhere  i fancy it dont cost him much here thought mr bacon and the object of these praises presently entered the room from his adjacent sleeping apartment  then mr bacon began to speak upon the subject of his visit said he heard that mr pendennis had a manuscript novel professed himself anxious to have a sight of that work and had no doubt that they could come to terms respecting it what would be his price for it would he give bacon the refusal of it he would find our house a liberal house and so forth the delighted pen assumed an air of indifference and said that he was already in treaty with bungay and could give no definite answer this piqued the other into such liberal though vague offers that pen began to fancy eldorado was opening to him and that his fortune was made from that day  i shall not mention what was the sum of money which mr arthur pendennis finally received for the first edition of his novel of walter lorraine lest other young literary aspirants should expect to be as lucky as he was and unprofessional persons forsake their own callings whatever they may be for the sake of supplying the world with novels whereof there is already a sufficiency let no young people be misled and rush fatally into romancewriting for one book which succeeds let them remember the many that fail i do not say deservedly or otherwise and wholesomely abstain or if they venture at least let them do so at their own peril as for those who have already written novels this warning is not addressed of course to them let them take their wares to market let them apply to bacon and bungay and all the publishers in the row or the metropolis and may they be happy in their ventures this world is so wide and the tastes of mankind happily so various that there is always a chance for every man and he may win the prize by his genius or by his good fortune but what is the chance of success or failure of obtaining popularity or of holding it when achieved one man goes over the ice which bears him and a score who follow flounder in in fine mr pendenniss was an exceptional case and applies to himself only and i assert solemnly and will to the last maintain that it is one thing to write a novel and another to get money for it  by merit then or good fortune or the skilful playing off of bungay against bacon which warrington performed and which an amateur novelist is quite welcome to try upon any two publishers in the trade pens novel was actually sold for a certain sum of money to one of the two eminent patrons of letters whom we have introduced to our readers the sum was so considerable that pen thought of opening an account at a bankers or of keeping a cab and horse or of descending into the first floor of lamb court into newly furnished apartments or of migrating to the fashionable end of the town  major pendennis advised the latter move strongly he opened his eyes with wonder when he heard of the good luck that had befallen pen and which the latter as soon as it occurred hastened eagerly to communicate to his uncle the major was almost angry that pen should have earned so much money who the doose reads this kind of thing he thought to himself when he heard of the bargain which pen had made i never read your novels and rubbish except paul de kock who certainly makes me laugh i dont think ive looked into a book of the sort these thirty years gad pens a lucky fellow i should think he might write one of these in a month nowsay a monththats twelve in a year dammy he may go on spinning this nonsense for the next four to five years and make a fortune in the meantime i should wish him to live properly take respectable apartments and keep a brougham and on this simple calculation it was that the major counselled pen  arthur laughing told warrington what his uncles advice had been but he luckily had a much more reasonable counsellor than the old gentleman in the person of his friend and in his own conscience which said to him be grateful for this piece of good fortune dont plunge into any extravagancies pay back laura and he wrote a letter to her in which he told her his thanks and his regard and enclosed to her such an instalment of his debt as nearly wiped it off the widow and laura herself might well be affected by the letter it was written with genuine tenderness and modesty and old dr portman when he read a passage in the letter in which pen with an honest heart full of gratitude humbly thanked heaven for his present prosperity and for sending him such dear and kind friends to support him in his ill fortunewhen doctor portman read this portion of the letter his voice faltered and his eyes twinkled behind his spectacles and when he had quite finished reading the same and had taken his glasses off his nose and had folded up the paper and given it back to the widow i am constrained to say that after holding mrs pendenniss hand for a minute the doctor drew that lady towards him and fairly kissed her at which salute of course helen burst out crying on the doctors shoulder for her heart was too full to give any other reply and the doctor blushing at great deal after his feat led the lady with a bow to the sofa on which he seated himself by her and he mumbled out in a low voice some words of a great poet whom he loved very much and who describes how in the days of his prosperity he had made the widows heart to sing for joy  the letter does the boy very great honour very great honour my dear he said patting it as it lay on helens kneeand i think we have all reason to be thankful for itvery thankful i need not tell you in what quarter my dear for you are a sainted woman yes laura my love your mother is a sainted woman and mrs pendennis maam i shall order a copy of the book for myself and another at the book club  we may be sure that the widow and laura walked out to meet the mail which brought them their copy of pens precious novel as soon as that work was printed and ready for delivery to the public and that they read it to each other and that they also read it privately and separately for when the widow came out of her room in her dressinggown at one oclock in the morning with volume two which she had finished she found laura devouring volume three in bed laura did not say much about the book but helen pronounced that it was a happy mixture of shakspeare and byron and walter scott and was quite certain that her son was the greatest genius as he was the best son in the world  did laura not think about the book and the author although she said so little at least she thought about arthur pendennis kind as his tone was it vexed her she did not like his eagerness to repay that money she would rather that her brother had taken her gift as she intended it and was pained that there should be money calculations between them his letters from london written with the goodnatured wish to amuse his mother were full of descriptions of the famous people and the entertainments and magnificence of the great city everybody was flattering him and spoiling him she was sure was he not looking to some great marriage with that cunning uncle for a mentor between whom and laura there was always an antipathy that inveterate worldling whose whole thoughts were bent upon pleasure and rank and fortune he never alluded toto old times when he spoke of her he had forgotten them and her perhaps had he not forgotten other things and people  these thoughts may have passed in miss lauras mind though she did not she could not confide them to helen she had one more secret too from that lady which she could not divulge perhaps because she knew how the widow would have rejoiced to know it this regarded an event which had occurred during that visit to lady rockminster which laura had paid in the last christmas holidays when pen was at home with his mother and when mr pynsent supposed to be so cold and so ambitious had formally offered his hand to miss bell no one except herself and her admirer knew of this proposal or that pynsent had been rejected by her and probably the reasons she gave to the mortified young man himself were not those which actuated her refusal or those which she chose to acknowledge to herself i never she told pynsent can accept such an offer as that which you make me which you own is unknown to your family as i am sure it would be unwelcome to them the difference of rank between us is too great you are very kind to me heretoo good and kind dear mr pynsentbut i am little better than a dependant  a dependant who ever so thought of you you are the equal of all the world pynsent broke out  i am a dependant at home too laura said sweetly and indeed i would not be otherwise left early a poor orphan i have found the kindest and tenderest of mothers and i have vowed never to leave hernever pray do not speak of this againhere under your relatives roof or elsewhere it is impossible  if lady rockminster asks you herself will you listen to her pynsent cried eagerly  no laura said i beg you never to speak of this any more i must go away if you doand with this she left him  pynsent never asked for lady rockminsters intercession he knew how vain it was to look for that and he never spoke again on that subject to laura or to any person  when at length the famous novel appeared it not only met with applause from more impartial critics than mrs pendennis but luckily for pen it suited the taste of the public and obtained a quick and considerable popularity before two months were over pen had the satisfaction and surprise of seeing the second edition of walter lorraine advertised in the newspapers and enjoyed the pleasure of reading and sending home the critiques of various literary journals and reviewers upon his book their censure did not much affect him for the goodnatured young man was disposed to accept with considerable humility the dispraises of others nor did their praise elate him over much for like most honest persons he had his own opinion about his own performance and when a critic praised him in the wrong place he was rather hurt than pleased by the compliment but if a review of his work was very laudatory it was a great pleasure to him to send it home to his mother at fairoaks and to think of the joy which it would give there there are some natures and perhaps as we have said pendenniss was one which are improved and softened by prosperity and kindness as there are men of other dispositions who become arrogant and graceless under good fortune happy he who can endure one or the other with modesty and goodhumour lucky he who has been educated to bear his fate whatsoever it may be by an early example of uprightness and a childish training in honour     chapter xliii alsatia   bred up like a bailiff

you pass into the tranquil oldfashioned quadrangle of shepherds inn in a mangy little grassplat in the centre rises up the statue of shepherd defended by iron railings from the assaults of boys the hall of the inn on which the founders arms are painted occupies one side of the square the tall and ancient chambers are carried round other two sides and over the central archway which leads into oldcastle street and so into the great london thoroughfare  the inn may have been occupied by lawyers once but the laity have long since been admitted into its precincts and i do not know that any of the principal legal firms have their chambers here the offices of the polwheedle and tredyddlum copper mines occupy one set of the groundfloor chambers the registry of patent inventions and union of genius and capital company anotherthe only gentleman whose name figures here and in the law list is mr campion who wears mustachios and who comes in his cab twice or thrice in a week and whose west end offices are in curzon street mayfair where mrs campion entertains the nobility and gentry to whom her husband lends money there and on his glazed cards he is mr somerset campion here he is campion and co and the same tuft which ornaments his chin sprouts from the under lip of the rest of the firm it is splendid to see his cabhorse harness blazing with heraldic bearings as the vehicle stops at the door leading to his chambers the horse flings froth off his nostrils as he chafes and tosses under the shining bit the reins and the breeches of the groom are glittering whitethe lustre of that equipage makes a sunshine in that shady place  our old friend captain costigan has examined campions cab and horse many an afternoon as he trailed about the court in his carpet slippers and dressinggown with his old hat cocked over his eye he suns himself there after his breakfast when the day is suitable and goes and pays a visit to the porters lodge where he pats the heads of the children and talks to mrs bolton about the thayatres and me daughther leedy mirabel mrs bolton was herself in the profession once and danced at the wells in early days as the thirteenth of mr serles forty pupils  costigan lives in the third floor at no 4 in the rooms which were mr podmores and whose name is still on the doorsomebody elses name by the way is on almost all the doors in shepherds inn when charley podmore the pleasing tenor singer trdl and at the back kitchen concert rooms married and went to live at lambeth he ceded his chambers to mr bows and captain costigan who occupy them in common now and you may often hear the tones of mr bowss piano of fine days when the windows are open acid when he is practising for amusement or for the instruction of a theatrical pupil of whom he has one or two fanny bolton is one the porteresss daughter who has heard tell of her mothers theatrical glories which she longs to emulate she has a good voice and a pretty face and figure for the stage and she prepares the rooms and makes the beds and breakfasts for messrs costigan and bows in return for which the latter instructs her in music and singing but for his unfortunate propensity to liquor and in that excess she supposes that all men of fashion indulge she thinks the captain the finest gentleman in the world and believes in all the versions of all his stories and she is very fond of mr bows too and very grateful to him and this shy queer old gentleman has a fatherly fondness for her too for in truth his heart is full of kindness and he is never easy unless he loves somebody  costigan has had the carriages of visitors of distinction before his humble door in shepherds inn and to hear him talk of a morning for his evening song is of a much more melancholy nature you would fancy that sir charles and lady mirabel were in the constant habit of calling at his chambers and bringing with them the select nobility to visit the old man the honest old halfpay captain poor old jack costigan as cos calls himself  the truth is that lady mirabel has left her husbands card which has been stuck in the little lookingglass over the mantelpiece of the sittingroom at no 4 for these many months past and has come in person to see her father but not of late days a kind person disposed to discharge her duties gravely upon her marriage with sir charles she settled a little pension upon her father who occasionally was admitted to the table of his daughter and soninlaw at first poor coss behaviour in the hoight of poloit societee as he denominated lady mirabels drawingroom table was harmless if it was absurd as he clothed his person in his best attire so he selected the longest and richest words in his vocabulary to deck his conversation and adopted a solemnity of demeanour which struck with astonishment all those persons in whose company he happened to bewas your leedyship in the pork to dee he would demand of his daughter i looked for your equipage in veenthe poor old man was not gratified by the soight of his daughthers choriot sir chorlus i saw your neem at the levee manys the levee at the castle at dublin that poor old jack costigan has attended in his time did the juke look pretty well bedad ill call at apsley house and lave me cyard upon um i thank ye james a little dthrop more champeane indeed he was magnificent in his courtesy to all and addressed his observations not only to the master and the guests but to the domestics who waited at the table and who had some difficulty in maintaining their professional gravity while they waited on captain costigan  on the first two or three visits to his soninlaw costigan maintained a strict sobriety content to make up for his lost time when he got to the back kitchen where he bragged about his soninlaws dart and burgundee until his own utterance began to fail him over his sixth tumbler of whiskypunch but with familiarity his caution vanished and poor cos lamentably disgraced himself at sir charles mirabels table by premature inebriation a carriage was called for him the hospitable door was shut upon him often and sadly did he speak to his friends at the kitchen of his resemblance to king lear in the pleeof his having a thankless choild bedadof his being a pore wornout lonely old man dthriven to dthrinking by ingratitude and seeking to dthrown his sorrows in punch  it is painful to be obliged to record the weaknesses of fathers but it must be furthermore told of costigan that when his credit was exhausted and his money gone he would not unfrequently beg money from his daughter and made statements to her not altogether consistent with strict truth on one day a bailiff was about to lead him to prison he wrote unless theto you insignificantsum of three pound five can be forthcoming to liberate a poor mans grey hairs from gaol and the goodnatured lady mirabel despatched the money necessary for her fathers liberation with a caution to him to be more economical for the future on a second occasion the captain met with a frightful accident and broke a plateglass window in the strand for which the proprietor of the shop held him liable the money was forthcoming on this time too to repair her papas disaster and was carried down by lady mirabels servant to the slipshod messenger and aidedecamp of the captain who brought the letter announcing his mishap if the servant had followed the captains aidedecamp who carried the remittance he would have seen that gentleman a person of costigans country too for have we not said that however poor an irish gentleman is he always has a poorer irish gentleman to run on his errands and transact his pecuniary affairs call a cab from the nearest stand and rattle down to the roscius head harlequin yard drury lane where the captain was indeed in pawn and for several glasses containing rumandwater or other spirituous refreshment of which he and his staff had partaken on a third melancholy occasion he wrote that he was attacked by illness and wanted money to pay the physician whom he was compelled to call in and this time lady mirabel alarmed about her fathers safety and perhaps reproaching herself that she had of late lost sight of her father called for her carriage and drove to shepherds inn at the gate of which she alighted whence she found the way to her fathers chambers no 4 third floor name of podmore over the door the porteress said with many curtsies pointing towards the door of the house into which the affectionate daughter entered and mounted the dingy stair alas the door surmounted by the name of podmore was opened to her by poor cos in his shirtsleeves and prepared with the gridiron to receive the muttonchops which mrs bolton had gone to purchase  also it was not pleasant for sir charles mirabel to have letters constantly addressed to him at brookess with the information that captain costigan was in the hall waiting for an answer or when he went to play his rubber at the travellers to be obliged to shoot out of his brougham and run up the steps rapidly lest his fatherinlaw should seize upon him and to think that while he read his paper or played his whist the captain was walking on the opposite side of pall mall with that dreadful cocked hat and the eye beneath it fixed steadily upon the windows of the club sir charles was a weak man he was old and had many infirmities he cried about his fatherinlaw to his wife whom he adored with senile infatuation he said he must go abroadhe must go and live in the countryhe should die or have another fit if he saw that man againhe knew he should and it was only by paying a second visit to captain costigan and representing to him that if he plagued sir charles by letters or addressed him in the street or made any further applications for loans his allowance would be withdrawn altogether that lady mirabel was enabled to keep her papa in order and to restore tranquillity to her husband and on occasion of this visit she sternly rebuked bows for not keeping a better watch over the captain desired that he should not be allowed to drink in that shameful way and that the people at the horrid taverns which he frequented should be told upon no account to give him credit papas conduct is bringing me to the grave she said though she looked perfectly healthy and you as an old man mr bows and one that pretended to have a regard for us ought to be ashamed of abetting him in it those were the thanks which honest bows got for his friendship and his lifes devotion and i do not suppose that the old philosopher was much worse off than many other men or had greater reason to grumble  on the second floor of the next house to bowss in shepherds inn at no 3 live two other acquaintances of ours colonel altamont agent to the nawaub of lucknow and captain chevalier edward strong no name at all is over their door the captain does not choose to let all the world know where he lives and his cards bear the address of a jermyn street hotel and as for the ambassador plenipotentiary of the indian potentate he is not an envoy accredited to the courts of st jamess or leadenhall street but is here on a confidential mission quite independent of the east india company or the board of control in fact strong says colonel altamonts object being financial and to effectuate a sale of some of the principal diamonds and rubies of the lucknow crown his wish is not to report himself at the india house or in cannon row but rather to negotiate with private capitalistswith whom he has had important transactions both in this country and on the continent  we have said that these anonymous chambers of strongs had been very comfortably furnished since the arrival of sir francis clavering in london and the chevalier might boast with reason to the friends who visited him that few retired captains were more snugly quartered than he in his crib in shepherds inn there were three rooms below the office where strong transacted his businesswhatever that might beand where still remained the desk and railings of the departed officials who had preceded him and the chevaliers own bedroom and sittingroom and a private stair led out of the office to two upper apartments the one occupied by colonel altamont and the other serving as the kitchen of the establishment and the bedroom of mr grady the attendant these rooms were on a level with the apartments of our friends bows and costigan next door at no 4 and by reaching over the communicating leads grady could command the mignonettebox which bloomed in bowss window  from gradys kitchen casement often came odours still more fragrant the three old soldiers who formed the garrison of no 3 were all skilled in the culinary art grady was great at an irish stew the colonel was famous for pillaus and curries and as for strong he could cook anything he made french dishes and spanish dishes stews fricassees and omelettes to perfection nor was there any man in england more hospitable than he when his purse was full or his credit was good at those happy periods he could give a friend as he said a good dinner a good glass of wine and a good song afterwards and poor cos often heard with envy the roar of strongs choruses and the musical clinking of the glasses as he sate in his own room so far removed and yet so near to those festivities it was not expedient to invite mr costigan always his practice of inebriation was lamentable and he bored strongs guests with his stories when sober and with his maudlin tears when drunk  a strange and motley set they were these friends of the chevalier and though major pendennis would not much have relished their company arthur and warrington liked it not a little and pen thought it as amusing as the society of the finest gentlemen in the finest houses which he had the honour to frequent there was a history about every man of the set they seemed all to have had their tides of luck and bad fortune most of them had wonderful schemes and speculations in their pockets and plenty for making rapid and extraordinary fortunes jack holt had been in don carloss army when ned strong had fought on the other side and was now organising a little scheme for smuggling tobacco into london which must bring thirty thousand a year to any man who would advance fifteen hundred just to bribe the last officer of the excise who held out and had wind of the scheme tom diver who had been in the mexican navy knew of a specieship which had been sunk in the first year of the war with three hundred and eighty thousand dollars on board and a hundred and eighty thousand pounds in bars and doubloons give me eighteen hundred pounds tom said and im off tomorrow i take out four men and a divingbell with me and i return in ten months to take my seat in parliament by jove and to buy back my family estate keightley the manager of the tredyddlum and polwheedle copper mines which were as yet under water besides singing as good a second as any professional man and besides the tredyddlum office had a smyrna sponge company and a little quicksilver operation in view which would set him straight with the world yet filby had been everything a corporal of dragoons a fieldpreacher and missionaryagent for converting the irish an actor at a greenwich fairbooth in front of which his fathers attorney found him when the old gentleman died and left him that famous property from which he got no rents now and of which nobody exactly knew the situation added to these was sir francis clavering bart who liked their society though he did not much add to its amusements by his convivial powers but he was made much of by the company now on account of his wealth and position in the world he told his little story and sang his little song or two with great affability and he had had his own history too before his accession to good fortune and had seen the inside of more prisons than one and written his name on many a stamped paper  when altamont first returned from paris and after he had communicated with sir francis clavering from the hotel at which he had taken up his quarters and which he had reached in a very denuded state considering the wealth of diamonds and rubies with which this honest man was entrusted strong was sent to his patron by the baronet paid his little bill at the inn and invited him to come and sleep for a night or two at the chambers where he subsequently took up his residence to negotiate with this man was very well but to have such a person settled in his rooms and to be constantly burthened with such society did not suit the chevaliers taste much and he grumbled not a little to his principal  i wish you would put this bear into somebody elses cage he said to clavering the fellows no gentleman i dont like walking with him he dresses himself like a nigger on a holiday i took him to the play the other night and by jove sir he abused the actor who was doing the part of villain in the play and swore at him so that the people in the boxes wanted to turn him out the afterpiece was the brigand where wallack comes in wounded you know and dies when he died altamont began to cry like a child and said it was a dd shame and cried and swore so that there was another row and everybody laughing then i had to take him away because he wanted to take his coat off to one fellow who laughed at him and bellowed to him to stand up like a manwho is he where the deuce does he come from you had best tell me the whole story frank you must one day you and he have robbed a church together thats my belief you had better get it off your mind at once clavering and tell me what this altamont is and what hold he has over you  hang him i wish he was dead was the baronets only reply and his countenance became so gloomy that strong did not think fit to question his patron any further at that time but resolved if need were to try and discover for himself what was the secret tie between altamont and clavering     chapter xliv in which the colonel narrates some of his adventures   early in the forenoon of the day after the dinner in grosvenor place at which colonel altamont had chosen to appear the colonel emerged from his chamber in the upper story at shepherds inn and entered into strongs sittingroom where the chevalier sate in his easychair with the newspaper and his cigar he was a man who made his tent comfortable wherever he pitched it and long before altamonts arrival had done justice to a copious breakfast of fried eggs and broiled rashers which mr grady had prepared secundum artem goodhumoured and talkative he preferred any company rather than none and though he had not the least liking for his fellowlodger and would not have grieved to hear that the accident had befallen him which sir francis clavering desired so fervently yet kept on fair terms with him he had seen altamont to bed with great friendliness on the night previous and taken away his candle for fear of accidents and finding a spiritbottle empty upon which he had counted for his nocturnal refreshment had drunk a glass of water with perfect contentment over his pipe before he turned into his own crib and to sleep that enjoyment never failed him he had always an easy temper a faultless digestion and a rosy cheek and whether he was going into action the next morning or to prison and both had been his lot in the camp or the fleet the worthy captain snored healthfully through the night and woke with a good heart and appetite for the struggles or difficulties or pleasures of the day  the first act of colonel altamont was to bellow to grady for a pint of pale ale the which he first poured into a pewter flagon whence he transferred it to his own lips he put down the tankard empty drew a great breath wiped his mouth in his dressinggown the difference of the colour of his beard from his dyed whiskers had long struck captain strong who had seen too that his hair was fair under his black wig but made no remarks upon these circumstancesthe colonel drew a great breath and professed himself immensely refreshed by his draught nothing like that beer he remarked when the coppers are hot many a day ive drunk a dozen of bass at calcutta andand  and at lucknow i suppose strong said with a laugh i got the beer for you on purpose knew youd want it after last night and the colonel began to talk about his adventures of the preceding evening  i cannot help myself the colonel said beating his head with his big hand im a madman when i get the liquor on board me and aint fit to be trusted with a spiritbottle when i once begin i cant stop till ive emptied it and when ive swallowed it lord knows what i say or what i dont say i dined at home here quite quiet grady gave me just my two tumblers and i intended to pass the evening at the black and red as sober as a parson why did you leave that confounded samplebottle of hollands out of the cupboard strong grady must go out too and leave me the kettle aboiling for tea it was of no use i couldnt keep away from it washed it all down sir by jove and its my belief i had some more too afterwards at that infernal little thieves den  what were you there too strong asked and before you came to grosvenor place that was beginning betimes  early hours to be drunk and cleared out before nine oclock eh but so it was yes like a great big fool i must go there and found the fellows dining blackland and young moss and two or three more of the thieves if wed gone to rouge et noir i must have won but we didnt try the black and red no hang em they knowd id have beat em at thati must have beat emi cant help beating em i tell you but they was too cunnin for me that rascal blackland got the bones out and we played hazard on the diningtable and i dropped all the money i had from you in the morning be hanged to my luck it was that that set me wild and i suppose i must have been very hot about the head for i went off thinking to get some more money from clavering i recollect and thenand then i dont much remember what happened till i woke this morning and heard old bows at no 4 playing on his pianner  strong mused for a while as he lighted his cigar with a coal i should like to know how you always draw money from clavering colonel he said  the colonel burst out with a laughha ha he owes it me he said  i dont know that thats a reason with frank for paying strong answered he owes plenty besides you  well he gives it me because he is so fond of me the other said with the same grinning sneer he loves me like a brother you know he does captainnohe dontwell perhaps he dont and if you ask me no questions perhaps ill tell you no lies captain strongput that in your pipe and smoke it my boy  but ill give up that confounded brandybottle the colonel continued after a pause i must give it up or itll be the ruin of me  it makes you say queer things said the captain looking altamont hard in the face remember what you said last night at claverings table  say what did i say asked the other hastily did i split anything dammy strong did i split anything  ask me no questions and i will tell you no lies the chevalier replied on his part strong thought of the words mr altamont had used and his abrupt departure from the baronets diningtable and house as soon as he recognised major pendennis or captain beak as he called the major but strong resolved to seek an explanation of these words otherwise than from colonel altamont and did not choose to recall them to the others memory no he said then you didnt split as you call it colonel it was only a trap of mine to see if i could make you speak but you didnt say a word that anybody could comprehendyou were too far gone for that  so much the better altamont thought and heaved a great sigh as if relieved strong remarked the emotion but took no notice and the other being in a communicative mood went on speaking  yes i own to my faults continued the colonel there is some things i cant do what i will resist a bottle of brandy a box of dice and a beautiful woman no man of pluck and spirit no man as was worth his salt ever could as i know of theres hardly praps a country in the world in which them three aint got me into trouble  indeed said strong  yes from the age of fifteen when i ran away from home and went cabinboy on board an indiaman till now when im fifty year old pretty nigh them women have always been my ruin why it was one of em and with such black eyes and jewels on her neck and battens and ermine like a duchess i tell youit was one of em at paris that swept off the best part of the thousand pound as i went off with didnt i ever tell you of it well i dont mind at first i was very cautious and having such a lot of money kept it close and lived like a gentlemancolonel altamont meurices hotel and that sort of thingnever played except at the public tables and won more than i lost well sir there was a chap that i saw at the hotel and the palace royal too a regular swell fellow with white kid gloves and a tuft to his chin bloundellbloundell his name was as i made acquaintance with somehow and he asked me to dinner and took me to madame the countess de foljambes soireessuch a woman strongsuch an eye such a hand at the pianner lor bless you shed sit down and sing to you and gaze at you until she warbled your soul out of your body amost she asked me to go to her evening parties every toosday and didnt i take operaboxes and give her dinners at the restauranteurs thats all but i had a run of luck at the tables and it was not in the dinners and operaboxes that poor claverings money went no be hanged to it it was swept off in another way one night at the countesss there was several of us at suppermr bloundellbloundell the honourable deuceace the marky de la tour de forceall tiptop nobs sir and the height of fashion when we had supper and champagne you may be sure in plenty and then some of that confounded brandy i would have iti would it go on at itthe countess mixed the tumblers of punch for me and we had cards as well as grog after supper and i played and drank until i dont know what i did i was like i was last night i was taken away and put to bed somehow and never woke until the next day to a roaring headache and to see my servant who said the honourable deuceace wanted to see me and was waiting in the sittingroom how are you colonel says he a coming into my bedroom how long did you stay last night after i went away the play was getting too high for me and id lost enough to you for one night  to me says i hows that my dear feller for though he was an earls son we was as familiar as you and me hows that my dear feller says i and he tells me that he had borrowed thirty louis of me at vingtetun that he gave me an iou for it the night before which i put into my pocketbook before he left the room i takes out my cardcaseit was the countess as worked it for meand there was the iou sure enough and he paid me thirty louis in gold down upon the table at my bedside so i said he was a gentleman and asked him if he would like to take anything when my servant should get it for him but the honourable deuceace dont drink of a morning and he went away to some business which he said he had  presently theres another ring at my outer door and this time its bloundellbloundell and the marky that comes in bong jour marky says i good morningno headache says he so i said i had one and how i must have been uncommon queer the night afore but they both declared i didnt show no signs of having had too much but took my liquor as grave as a judge  so says the marky deuceace has been with you we met him in the palais royal as we were coming from breakfast has he settled with you get it while you can hes a slippery card and as he won three ponies of bloundell i recommend you to get your money while he has some  he has paid me says i but i knew no more than the dead that he owed me anything and dont remember a bit about lending him thirty louis  the marky and bloundell looks and smiles at each other at this and bloundell says colonel you are a queer feller no man could have supposed from your manners that you had tasted anything stronger than tea all night and yet you forget things in the morning come cometell that to the marines my friendwe wont have it at any price  en efet says the marky twiddling his little black mustachios in the chimneyglass and making a lunge or two as he used to do at the fencingschool he was a wonder at the fencingschool and ive seen him knock down the image fourteen times running at lepages let us speak of affairs colonel you understand that affairs of honour are best settled at once perhaps it wont be inconvenient to you to arrange our little matters of last night  what little matters says i do you owe me any money marky  bah says he do not let us have any more jesting i have your note of hand for three hundred and forty louis la voia says he taking out a paper from his pocketbook  and mine for two hundred and ten says bloundellbloundell and he pulls out his bit of paper  i was in such a rage of wonder at this that i sprang out of bed and wrapped my dressinggown round me are you come here to make a fool of me says i i dont owe you two hundred or two thousand or two louis and i wont pay you a farthing do you suppose you can catch me with your notes of hand i laugh at em and at you and i believe you to be a couple  a couple of what says mr bloundell you of course are aware that we are a couple of men of honour colonel altamont and not come here to trifle or to listen to abuse from you you will either pay us or we will expose you as a cheat and chastise you as a cheat too says bloundell  oui parbleu says the markybut i didnt mind him for i could have thrown the little fellow out of the window but it was different with bloundellhe was a large man that weighs three stone more than me and stands six inches higher and i think he could have done for me  monsieur will pay or monsieur will give me the reason why i believe youre little better than a polisson colonel altamontthat was the phrase he usedaltamont said with a grinand i got plenty more of this language from the two fellows and was in the thick of the row with them when another of our party came in this was a friend of minea gent i had met at boulogne and had taken to the countesss myself and as he hadnt played at all on the previous night and had actually warned me against bloundell and the others i told the story to him and so did the other two  i am very sorry says he you would go on playing the countess entreated you to discontinue these gentlemen offered repeatedly to stop it was you that insisted on the large stakes not they in fact he charged dead against me and when the two others went away he told me how the marky would shoot me as sure as my name waswas what it is i left the countess crying too said he she hates these two men she has warned you repeatedly against them which she actually had done and often told me never to play with them and now colonel i have left her in hysterics almost lest there should be any quarrel between you and that confounded marky should put a bullet through your head its my belief says my friend that that woman is distractedly in love with you  do you think so says i upon which my friend told me how she had actually gone down on her knees to him and save colonel altamont  as soon as i was dressed i went and called upon that lovely woman she gave a shriek and pretty near fainted when she saw me she called me ferdinandim blest if she didnt  i thought your name was jack said strong with a laugh at which the colonel blushed very much behind his dyed whiskers  a man may have more names than one maynt he strong altamont asked when im with a lady i like to take a good one she called me by my christian name she cried fit to break your heart i cant stand seeing a woman crynever couldnot whilst im fond of her she said she could bear not to think of my losing so much money in her house wouldnt i take her diamonds and necklaces and pay part  i swore i wouldnt touch a farthings worth of her jewellery which perhaps i did not think was worth a great dealbut what can a woman do more than give you her all thats the sort i like and i know theres plenty of em and i told her to be easy about the money for i would not pay one single farthing  then theyll shoot you says she theyll kill my ferdinand  theyll kill my jack wouldnt have sounded well in french strong said laughing  never mind about names said the other sulkily a man of honour may take any name he chooses i suppose  well go on with your story said strong she said they would kill you  no says i they wont for i will not let that scamp of a marquis send me out of the world and if he lays a hand on me ill brain him marquis as he is  at this the countess shrank back from me as if i had said something very shocking do i understand colonel altamont aright says she and that a british officer refuses to meet any person who provokes him to the field of honour  field of honour be hanged countess says i you would not have me be a target for that little scoundrels pistol practice  colonel altamont says the countess i thought you were a man of honouri thought ibut no matter goodbye sirand she was sweeping out of the room her voice regular choking in her pockethandkerchief  countess says i rushing after her and seizing her hand  leave me monsieur le colonel says she shaking me off my father was a general of the grand army a soldier should know how to pay all his debts of honour  what could i do everybody was against me caroline said i had lost the money though i didnt remember a syllable about the business i had taken deuceaces money too but then it was because he offered it to me you know and thats a different thing every one of these chaps was a man of fashion and honour and the marky and the countess of the first families in france and by jove sir rather than offend her i paid the money up five hundred and sixty gold napoleons by jove besides three hundred which i lost when i had my revenge  and i cant tell you at this minute whether i was done or not concluded the colonel musing sometimes i think i was but then caroline was so fond of me that woman would never have seen me done never im sure she wouldnt at least if she would im deceived in woman  any further revelations of his past life which altamont might have been disposed to confide to his honest comrade the chevalier were interrupted by a knocking at the outer door of their chambers which when opened by grady the servant admitted no less a person than sir francis clavering into the presence of the two worthies  the governor by jove cried strong regarding the arrival of his patron with surprise whats brought you here growled altamont looking sternly from under his heavy eyebrows at the baronet its no good i warrant and indeed good very seldom brought sir francis clavering into that or any other place  whenever he came into shepherds inn it was money that brought the unlucky baronet into those precincts and there was commonly a gentleman of the moneydealing world in waiting for him at strongs chambers or at campions below and a question of bills to negotiate or to renew claverng was a man who had never looked his debts fairly in the face familiar as he had been with them all his life as long as he could renew a bill his mind was easy regarding it and he would sign almost anything for tomorrow provided today could be left unmolested he was a man whom scarcely any amount of fortune could have benefited permanently and who was made to be ruined to cheat small tradesmen to be the victim of astuter sharpers to be niggardly and reckless and as destitute of honesty as the people who cheated him and a dupe chiefly because he was too mean to be a successful knave he had told more lies in his time and undergone more baseness of stratagem in order to stave off a small debt or to swindle a poor creditor than would have sufficed to make a fortune for a braver rogue he was abject and a shuffler in the very height of his prosperity had he been a crown princehe could not have been more weak useless dissolute or ungrateful he could not move through life except leaning on the arm of somebody and yet he never had an agent but he mistrusted him and marred any plans which might be arranged for his benefit and secretly acting against the people whom he employed strong knew clavering and judged him quite correctly it was not as friends that this pair met but the chevalier worked for his principal as he would when in the army have pursued a harassing march or undergone his part in the danger and privations of a siege because it was his duty and because he had agreed to it what is it he wants thought the officers of the shepherds inn garrison when the baronet came among them  his pale face expressed extreme anger and irritation so sir he said addressing altamont youve been at your old tricks  which of um asked altamont with a sneer  you have been at the rouge et noir you were there last night cried the baronet  how do you knowwere you there the other said i was at the club but it wasnt on the colours i playedask the captainive been telling him of it it was with the bones it was at hazard sir francis upon my word and honour it was and he looked at the baronet with a knowing humorous mock humility which only seemed to make the other more angry  what the deuce do i care sir how a man like you loses his money and whether it is at hazard or roulette screamed the baronet with a multiplicity of oaths and at the top of his voice what i will not have sir is that you should use my name or couple it with yoursdamn him strong why dont you keep him in better order i tell you he has gone and used my name again sirdrawn a bill upon me and lost the money on the tablei cant stand iti

like you intruding himself on my company how dared you show yourself in grosvenor place last night sirandand what do you suppose my friends must think of me when they see a man of your sort walking into my diningroom uninvited and drunk and calling for liquor as if you were the master of the house  theyll think you know some very queer sort of people i dare say altamont said with impenetrable goodhumour look here baronet i apologise on my honour i do and aint an apology enough between two gentlemen it was a strong measure i own walking into your cuddy and calling for drink as if i was the captain but i had had too much before you see thats why i wanted some more nothing can be more simpleand it was because they wouldnt give me no more money upon your name at the black and red that i thought i would come down and speak to you about it to refuse me was nothing but to refuse a bill drawn on you that have been such a friend to the shop and are a baronet and a member of parliament and a gentleman and no mistakedamme its ungrateful  by heavens if ever you do it againif ever you dare show to yourself in my house or give my name at a gamblinghouse or at any other house by joveat any other houseor give any reference at all to me or speak to me in the street by god or anywhere else until i speak to youi disclaim you altogetheri wont give you another shilling  governor dont be provoking altamont said surlily dont talk to me about daring to do this thing or tother or when my dander is up its the very thing to urge me on i oughtnt to have come last night i know i oughtnt but i told you i was drunk and that ought to be sufficient between gentleman and gentleman  you a gentleman dammy sir said the baronet how dares a fellow like you to call himself a gentleman  i aint a baronet i know growled the other and ive forgotten how to be a gentleman almost now butbut i was one once and my father was one and ill not have this sort of talk from you sir f clavering thats flat i want to go abroad again why dont you come down with the money and let me go why the devil are you to be rolling in riches and me to have none why should have a house and a table covered with plate and me be in a garret here in this beggarly shepherds inn were partners aint we id as good a right to be rich as you have havent i tell the story to strong here if you like and ask him to be umpire between us i dont mind letting my secret out to a man that wont split look here strongperhaps you guess the story alreadythe fact is me and the governor  d hold your tongue shrieked out the baronet in a fury you shall have the money as soon as i can get it i aint made of money im so pressed and badgered i dont know where to turn i shall go mad by jove i shall i wish i was dead for im the most miserable brute alive i say mr altamont dont mind me when im out of healthand im devilish bilious this morninghang me i abuse everybody and dont know what i say excuse me if ive offended you iill try and get that little business done strong shall try upon my word he shall and i say strong my boy i want to speak to you come into the office for a minute  almost all claverings assaults ended in this ignominious way and in a shameful retreat altamont sneered after the baronet as he left the room and entered into the office to talk privately with his factotum  what is the matter now the latter asked of him its the old story i suppose  d it yes the baronet said i dropped two hundred in ready money at the little coventry last night and gave a cheque for three hundred more on her ladyships bankers too for tomorrow and i must meet it for therell be the deuce to pay else the last time she paid my playdebts i swore i would not touch a dicebox again and shell keep her word strong and dissolve partnership if i go on i wish i had three hundred a year and was away at a german wateringplace you can do devilish well with three hundred a year but my habits are so dreckless i wish i was in the serpentine i wish i was dead by gad i wish i was i wish i had never touched those confounded bones i had such a run of luck last night with five for the main and seven to five all night until those ruffians wanted to pay me with altamonts bill upon me the luck turned from that minute never held the box again for three mains and came away cleared out leaving that infernal cheque behind me how shall i pay it blackland wont hold it over hulker and bullock will write about it directly to her ladyship by jove ned im the most miserable brute in all england  it was necessary for ned to devise some plan to console the baronet under this pressure of grief and no doubt he found the means of procuring a loan for his patron for he was closeted at mr campions offices that day for some time altamont had once more a guinea or two in his pocket with a promise of a further settlement and the baronet had no need to wish himself dead for the next two or three months at least and strong putting together what he had learned from the colonel and sir francis began to form in his own mind a pretty accurate opinion as to the nature of the tie which bound the two men together     chapter xlv a chapter of conversations   every day after the entertainment at grosvenor place and greenwich of which we have seen major pendennis partake the worthy gentlemans friendship and cordiality for the clavering family seemed to increase his calls were frequent his attentions to the lady of the house unremitting an old man about town he had the good fortune to be received in many houses at which a lady of lady claverings distinction ought to be seen would her ladyship not like to be present at the grand entertainment at gaunt house there was to be a very pretty breakfast ball at viscount marrowfats at fulham everybody was to be there including august personages of the highest rank and there was to be a watteau quadrille in which miss amory would surely look charming to these and other amusements the obsequious old gentleman kindly offered to conduct lady clavering and was also ready to make himself useful to the baronet in any way agreeable to the latter  in spite of his present station and fortune the world persisted in looking rather coldly upon clavering and strange suspicious rumours followed him about he was blackballed at two clubs in succession in the house of commons he only conversed with a few of the most disreputable members of that famous body having a happy knack of choosing bad society and adapting himself naturally to it as other people do to the company of their betters the name all the senators with whom clavering consorted would be invidious we may mention only a few there was captain raff the honourable member for epsom who retired after the last goodwood races having accepted as mr hotspur the whip of the party said a mission to the levant there was hustingson the patriotic member for islington whose voice is never heard now denunciating corruption since his appointment to the governorship of coventry island there was bob freeny of the booterstown freenys who is a dead shot and of whom we therefore wish to speak with every respect and of all these gentlemen with whom in the course of his professional duty mr hotspur had to confer there was none for whom he had a more thorough contempt and dislike than for sir francis clavering the representative of an ancient race who had sat for their own borough of clavering time out of mind in the house if that man is wanted for a division hotspur said ten to one he is to be found in a hell he was educated in the fleet and he has not heard the end of newgate yet take my word for it hell muddle away the begums fortune at thimblerig be caught picking pockets and finish on board the hulks and if the highborn hotspur with such an opinion of clavering could yet from professional reasons be civil to him why should not major pendennis also have reasons of his own for being attentive to this unlucky gentleman  he has a very good cellar and a very good cook the major said as long as he is silent he is not offensive and he very seldom speaks if he chooses to frequent gamblingtables and lose his money to blacklegs what matters to me dont look too curiously into any mans affairs pen my boy every fellow has some cupboard in his house begad which he would not like you and me to peep into why should we try when the rest of the house is open to us and a devilish good house too as you and i know and if the man of the family is not all one could wish the women are excellent the begum is not overrefined but as kind a woman as ever lived and devilish clever too and as for the little blanche you know my opinion about her you rogue you know my belief is that she is sweet on you and would have you for the asking but you are growing such a great man that i suppose you wont be content under a dukes daughterhey sir i recommend you to ask one of them and try  perhaps pen was somewhat intoxicated by his success in the world and it may also have entered into the young mans mind his uncles perpetual hints serving not a little to encourage the notion that miss amory was tolerably well disposed to renew the little flirtation which had been carried on in the early days of both of them by the banks of the rural brawl but he was little disposed to marriage he said at that moment and adopting some of his uncles worldly tone spoke rather contemptuously of the institution and in favour of a bachelor life  you are very happy sir said he and you get on very well alone and so do i with a wife at my side i should lose my place in society and i dont for my part much fancy retiring into the country with a mrs pendennis or taking my wife into lodgings to be waited upon by the servantofallwork the period of my little illusions is over you cured me of my first love who certainly was a fool and would have had a fool for her husband and a very sulky discontented husband too if she had taken me we young fellows live fast sir and i feel as old at fiveandtwenty as many of the old fothe old bachelorswhom i see in the bowwindow at bayss dont look offended i only mean that i am blase about love matters and that i could no more fan myself into a flame for miss amory now than i could adore lady mirabel over again i wish i could i rather like old mirabel for his infatuation about her and think his passion is the most respectable part of his life  sir charles mirabel was always a theatrical man sir the major said annoyed that his nephew should speak flippantly of any person of sir charless rank and station he has been occupied with theatricals since his early days he acted at carlton house when he was page to the prince he has been mixed up with that sort of thing he could afford to marry whom he chooses and lady mirabel is a most respectable woman received everywhereeverywhere mind the duchess of connaught receives her lady rockminster receives herit doesnt become young fellows to speak lightly of people in that station theres not a more respectable woman in england than lady mirabeland the old fogies as you call them at bayss are some of the first gentlemen in england of whom you youngsters had best learn a little manners and a little breeding and a little modesty and the major began to think that pen was growing exceedingly pert and conceited and that the world made a great deal too much of him  the majors anger amused pen he studied his uncles peculiarities with a constant relish and was always in a good humour with his worldly old mentor i am a youngster of fifteen years standing sir he said adroitly and if you think that we are disrespectful you should see those of the present generation a protege of yours came to breakfast with me the other day you told me to ask him and i did it to please you we had a days sights together and dined at the club and went to the play he said the wine at the polyanthus was not so good as elliss wine at richmond smoked warringtons cavendish after breakfast and when i gave him a sovereign as a farewell token said he had plenty of them but would take it to show he wasnt proud  did hedid you ask young clavering cried the major appeased at oncefine boy rather wild but a fine boyparents like that sort of attention and you cant do better than pay it to our worthy friends of grosvenor place and so you took him to the play and tipped him that was right sir that was right with which mentor quitted telemachus thinking that the young men were not so very bad and that he should make something of that fellow yet  as blaster clavering grew into years and stature he became too strong for the authority of his fond parents and governess and rather governed them than permitted himself to be led by their orders with his papa he was silent and sulky seldom making his appearance however in the neighbourhood of that gentleman with his mamma be roared and fought when any contest between them arose as to the gratification of his appetite or other wish of his heart and in his disputes with his governess over his book he kicked that quiet creatures shins so fiercely that she was entirely overmastered and subdued by him and he would have so treated his sister blanche too and did on one or two occasions attempt to prevail over her but she showed an immense resolution and spirit on her part and boxed his ears so soundly that he forbore from molesting miss amory as he did the governess and his mamma and his mammas maid  at length when the family came to london sir francis gave forth his opinion that the little beggar had best be sent to school accordingly the young son and heir of the house of clavering was despatched to the rev otto roses establishment at twickenham where young noblemen and gentlemen were received preparatory to their introduction to the great english public schools  it is not our intention to follow master clavering in his scholastic career the paths to the temple of learning were made more easy to him than they were to some of us of earlier generations he advanced towards that fane in a carriageandfour so to speak and might halt and take refreshment almost whenever he pleased he wore varnished boots from the earliest period of youth and had cambric handkerchiefs and lemoncoloured kid gloves of the smallest size ever manufactured by privat they dressed regularly at mr roses to come down to dinner the young gentlemen had shawl dressinggowns fires in their bedrooms horse and carriage exercise occasionally and oil for their hair corporal punishment was altogether dispensed with by the principal who thought that moral discipline was entirely sufficient to lead youth and the boys were so rapidly advanced in many branches of learning that they acquired the art of drinking spirits and smoking cigars even before they were old enough to enter a public school young frank clavering stole his fathers havannahs and conveyed them to school or smoked them in the stables at a surprisingly early period of life and at ten years old drank his champagne almost as stoutly as any whiskered cornet of dragoons could do  when this interesting youth came home for his vacations major pendennis was as laboriously civil and gracious to him as he was to the rest of the family although the boy had rather a contempt for old wigsby as the major was denominated mimicked him behind his back as the polite major bowed and smirked with lady clavering or miss amory and drew rude caricatures such as are designed by ingenious youths in which the majors wig his nose his tie etc were represented with artless exaggeration untiring in his efforts to be agreeable the major wished that pen too should take particular notice of this child incited arthur to invite him to his chambers to give him a dinner at the club to take him to madame tussauds the tower the play and so forth and to tip him as the phrase is at the end of the days pleastres arthur who was goodnatured and fond of children went through all these ceremonies one day had the boy to breakfast at the temple where he made the most contemptuous remarks regarding the furniture the crockery and the tattered state of warringtons dressinggown and smoked a short pipe and recounted the history of a fight between tuffy and long biggings at roses greatly to the edification of the two gentlemen his hosts  as the major rightly predicted lady clavering was very grateful for arthurs attention to the boy more grateful than the lad himself who took attentions as a matter of course and very likely had more sovereigns in his pocket than poor pen who generously gave him one of his own slender stock of those coins  the major with the sharp eyes with which nature endowed him and with the glasses of age and experience watched this boy and surveyed his position in the family without seeming to be rudely curious about their affairs but as a country neighbour one who had many family obligations to the claverings an old man of the world he took occasion to find out what lady claverings means were how her capital was disposed and what the boy was to inherit and setting himself to workfor what purposes will appear no doubt ulteriorlyhe soon had got a pretty accurate knowledge of lady claverings affairs and fortune and of the prospects of her daughter and son the daughter was to have but a slender provision the bulk of the property was as before has been said to go to the sonhis father did not care for him or anybody elsehis mother was dotingly fond of him as the child of her latter dayshis sister disliked him such may be stated in round numbers to be the result of the information which major pendennis got ah my dear madam he would say patting the head of the boy this boy may wear a barons coronet on his head on some future coronation if matters are but managed rightly and if sir francis clavering would but play his cards well  at this the widow amory heaved a deep sigh he plays only much of his cards major im afraid she said the major owned that he knew as much did not disguise that he had heard of sir francis claverings unfortunate propensity to play pitied lady clavering sincerely but spoke with such genuine sentiment and sense that her ladyship glad to find a person of experience to whom she could confide her grief and her condition talked about them pretty unreservedly to major pendennis and was eager to have his advice and consolation major pendennis became the begums confidante and housefriend and as a mother a wife and a capitalist she consulted him  he gave her to understand showing at the same time a great deal of respectful sympathy that he was acquainted with some of the circumstances of her first unfortunate marriage and with even the person of her late husband whom he remembered in calcuttawhen she was living in seclusion with her father the poor lady with tears of shame more than of grief in her eyes told her version of her story going back a child to india after two years at a european school she had met amory and foolishly married him oh you dont know how miserable that man made me she said or what a life i passed betwixt him and my father before i saw him i had never seen a man except my fathers clerks and native servants you know we didnt go into society in india on account of i know said major pendennis with a bow i was a wild romantic child my head was full of novels which id read at schooli listened to his wild stories and adventures for he was a daring fellow and i thought he talked beautifully of those calm nights on the passage out when he used to well i married him and i was wretched from that daywretched with my father whose character you know major pendennis and i wont speak of but he wasnt a good man sirneither to my poor mother nor to me except that he left me his moneynor to no one else that i ever heard of and he didnt do many kind actions in his lifetime im afraid and as for amory he was almost worse he was a spendthrift when my father was close he drank dreadfully and was furious when in that way he wasnt in any way a good or a faithful husband to me major pendennis and if hed died in the gaol before this trial instead of afterwards he would have saved me a deal of shame and of unhappiness since sir lady clavering added for perhaps i should not have married at all if i had not been so anxious to change his horrid name and i have not been happy in my second husband as i suppose you know sir ah major pendennis ive got money to be sure and im a lady and people fancy im very happy but i aint we all have our cares and griefs and troubles and manys the day that i sit down to one of my grand dinners with an aching heart and many a night do i lay awake on my fine bed a great deal more unhappy than the maid that makes for it im not a happy woman major for all the world says and envies the begum her diamonds and carriages and the great company that comes to my house im not happy in my husband im not in my daughter she aint a good girl like that dear laura bell at fairoaks shes cost me many a tear though you dont see em and she sneers at her mother because i havent had learning and that how should i i was brought up amongst natives till i was twelve and went back to india when i was fourteen ah major i should have been a good woman if i had had a good husband and now i must go upstairs and wipe my eyes for theyre red with cryin and lady rockminsters a comin and were goin to ave a drive in the park and when lady rockminster made her appearance there was not a trace of tears or vexation on lady claverings face but she was full of spirits and bounced out with her blunders and talk and murdered the kings english with the utmost liveliness and goodhumour  begad she is not such a bad woman the major thought within himself she is not refined certainly and calls apollo apoller but she has some heart and i like that sort of thing and a devilish deal of money too three stars in india stock to her name begad which that young cub is to haveis he and he thought how he should like to see a little of the money transferred to miss blanche and better still one of those stars shining in the name of mr arthur pendennis  still bent upon pursuing his schemes whatsoever they might be the old negotiator took the privilege of his intimacy and age to talk in a kindly and fatherly manner to miss blanche when he found occasion to see her alone he came in so frequently at luncheontime and became so familiar with the ladies that they did not even hesitate to quarrel before him and lady clavering whose tongue was loud and temper brusque had many a battle with the sylphide in the family friends presence blanches wit seldom failed to have the mastery in these encounters and the keen barbs of her arrows drove her adversary discomfited away i am an old fellow the major said i have nothing to do in life i have my eyes open i keep good counsel i am the friend of both of you and if you choose to quarrel before me why i shant tell any one but you are two good people and i intend to make it up between you i have between lots of peoplehusbands and wives fathers and sons daughters and mammas before this i like it ive nothing else to do  one day then the old diplomatist entered lady claverings drawingroom just as the latter quitted it evidently in a high state of indignation and ran past him up the stairs to her own apartments she couldnt speak to him now she said she was a great deal too angry with thatthatthat little wickedanger choked the rest of the words or prevented their utterance until lady clavering had passed out of hearing  my dear good miss amory the major said entering the drawingroom i see what is happening you and mamma have been disagreeing mothers and daughters disagree in the best families it was but last week that i healed up a quarrel between lady clapperton and her daughter lady claudia lady lear and her eldest daughter have not spoken for fourteen years kinder and more worthy people than these i never knew in the whole course of my life for everybody but each other admirable but they cant live together they oughtnt to live together and i wish my dear creature with all my soul that i could see you with an establishment of your ownfor there is no woman in london who could conduct one betterwith your own establishment making your own home happy  i am not very happy in this one said the sylphide and the stupidity of mamma is enough to provoke a saint  precisely so you are not suited to one another your mother committed one fault in early lifeor was it nature my dear in your caseshe ought not to have educated you you ought not to have been bred up to become the refined and intellectual being you are surrounded as i own you are by those who have not your genius or your refinement your place would be to lead in the most brilliant circles not to follow and take a second place in any society i have watched you miss amory you are ambitious and your proper sphere is command you ought to shine and you never can in this house i know it i hope i shall see you in another and a happier one some day and the mistress of it  the sylphide shrugged her lily shoulders with a look of scorn where is the prince and where is the palace major pendennis she said i am ready but there is no romance in the world now no real affection  no indeed said the major with the most sentimental and simple air which he could muster  not that i know anything about it said blanche casting her eyes down except what i have read in novels  of course not major pendennis cried how should you my dear young lady and novels aint true as you remark admirably and there is no romance left in the world begad i wish i was a young fellow like my nephew  and what continued miss amory musing what are the men whom we see about at the balls every nightdancing guardsmen penniless treasury clerksboobies if i had my brothers fortune i might have such an establishment as you promise mebut with my name and with my little means what am i to look to a country parson or a barrister in a street near russell square or a captain in a dragoon regiment who will take lodgings for me and come home from the mess tipsy and smelling of smoke like sir francis clavering that is how we girls are destined to end life o major pendennis i am sick of london and of balls and of young dandies with their chintips and of the insolent great ladies who know us one day and cut us the nextand of the world altogether i should like to leave it and to go into a convent that i should i shall never find anybody to understand me and i live here as much alone in my family and in the world as if i were in a cell locked up for ever i wish there were sisters of charity here and that i could be one and catch the plague and die of iti wish to quit the world i am not very old but i am tired i have suffered so muchive been so disillusionatedim weary im wearyo that the angel of death would come and beckon me away  this speech may be interpreted as follows a few nights since a great lady lady flamingo had cut miss amory and lady clavering she was quite mad because she could not get an invitation to lady drums ball it was the end of the season and nobody had proposed to her she had made no sensation at all she who was so much cleverer than any girl of the year and of the young ladies forming her special circle dora who had but five thousand pounds flora who had nothing and leonora who had red hair were going to be married and nobody had come for blanche amory  you judge wisely about the world and about your position my dear miss blanche the major said the prince dont marry nowadays as you say unless the princess has a doosid deal of money in the funds or is a lady of his own rankthe young folks of the great families marry into the great families if they havent fortune they have each others shoulders to push on in the world which is pretty nearly as gooda girl with your fortune can scarcely hope for a great match but a girl with your genius and your admirable tact and fine manners with a clever husband by her side may make any place for herself in the worldwe are grown doosid republican talent ranks with birth and wealth now begad and a clever man with a clever wife may take any place they please  miss amory did not of course in the least understand what major pendennis meantperhaps she thought over circumstances in her mind and asked herself could he be a negotiator for a former suitor of hers and could he mean pen no it was impossiblehe had been civil but nothing moreso she said laughing who is the clever man and when will you bring him to me major pendennis i am dying to see him  at this moment a servant threw open the door and announced mr henry foker at which name and at the appearance of our friend both the lady and the gentleman burst out laughing  that is not the man major pendennis said he is engaged to his cousin lord gravesends daughtergoodbye my dear miss amory                             was pen growing worldly and should a man not get the experience of the world and lay it to his account he felt for his part as he said that he was growing very old very soon how this town forms and changes us he said once to warrington each had come in from his nights amusement and pen was smoking his pipe and recounting as his habit was to his friend the observations and adventures of the evening just past how i am changed he said from the simpleton boy at fairoaks who was fit to break his heart about his first love lady mirabel had a reception tonight and was as grave and collected as if she had been born a duchess and had never seen a trapdoor in her life she gave me the honour of a conversation and patronised me about walter lorraine quite kindly  what condescension broke in warrington  wasnt it pen said simplyat which the other burst out laughing according to his wont is it possible he said that anybody should think of patronising the eminent author of walter lorraine  you laugh at both of us pen said blushing a littlei was coming to that myself she told me that she had not read the book as indeed i believe she never read a book in her life but that lady rockminster had and that the duchess of connaught pronounced it to be very clever in that case i said i should die happy for that to please those two ladies was in fact the great aim of my existence and having their approbation of course i need look for no other lady mirabel looked at me solemnly out of her fine eyes and said oh indeed as if she understood me and then she asked me whether i went to the duchesss thursdays and when i said no hoped she should see me there and that i must try and get there everybody went thereeverybody who was in society and then we talked of the new ambassador from timbuctoo and how he was better than the old one and how lady mary billington was going to marry a clergyman quite below her in rank and how lord and lady ringdove had fallen out three months after their marriage about tom pouter of the blues lady ringdoves cousinand so forth from the gravity of that woman you would have fancied she had been born in a palace and lived all the seasons of her life in belgrave square  and you i suppose you took your part in the conversation pretty well as the descendant of the earl your father and the heir of fairoaks castle warrington said yes i remember reading of the festivities which occurred when you came of age the countess gave a brilliant tea soiree to the neighbouring nobility and the tenantry were regaled in the kitchen with a leg of mutton and a quart of ale the remains of the banquet were distributed amongst the poor of the village and the entrance to the park was illuminated until old john put the candle out on retiring to rest at his usual hour  my mother is not a countess said pen though she has very good blood in her veins toobut commoner as she is i have never met a peeress who was more than her peer mr george and if you will come to fairoaks castle you shall judge for yourself of her and of my cousin too they are not so witty as the london women but they certainly are as well bred the thoughts of women in the country are turned to other objects than those which occupy your london ladies in the country a woman has her household and her poor her long calm days and long calm evenings  devilish long warrington said and a great deal too calm ive tried em  the monotony of that existence must be to a certain degree melancholylike the tune of a long ballad and its harmony grave and gentle sad and tender it would be unendurable else the loneliness of women in the country makes them of necessity soft and sentimental leading a life of calm duty constant routine mystic reveriea sort of nuns at largetoo much gaiety or laughter would jar upon their almost sacred quiet and would be as out of place there as in a church  where you go to sleep over the sermon warrington said  you are a professed misogynist and hate the sex because i suspect you know very little about them mr pen continued with an air of considerable selfcomplacency if you dislike the women in the country for being too slow surely the london woman ought to be fast enough for you the pace of london life is enormous how do people last at it i wondermale and female take a woman of the world follow her course through the season one asks how she can survive it or if she tumbles into a sleep at the end of august and lies torpid until the spring she goes into the world every night and sits watching her marriageable daughters dancing till long after dawn she has a nursery of little ones very likely at home to whom she administers example and affection having an eye likewise to breadandmilk catechism music and french and roast leg of mutton at one oclock she has to call upon ladies of her own station either domestically or in her public character in which she sits upon charity committees or ball committees or emigration committees or queens college committees and discharges i dont know what more duties of british stateswomanship she very likely keeps a poorvisiting list has conversations with the clergyman about soup or flannel or proper religious teaching for the parish and if she lives in certain districts probably attends early church she has the newspapers to read and at least must know what her husbands party is about so as to be able to talk to her neighbour at dinner and it is a fact that she reads every new book that comes out for she can talk and very smartly and well about them all and you see them all upon her drawingroom table she has the cares of her household besidesto make both ends meet to make the girls milliners bills appear not too dreadful to the father and paymaster of the family to snip off in secret a little extra article of expenditure here and there and convey it in the shape of a banknote to the boys at college or at sea to check the encroachments of tradesmen and housekeepers financial fallacies to keep upper and lower servants from jangling with one another and the household in order add to this that she has a secret taste for some art or science models in clay makes experiments in chemistry or plays in private on the violoncelloand i say without exaggeration many london ladies are doing thisand you have a character before you such as our ancestors never heard of and such as belongs entirely to our era and period of civilisation ye gods how rapidly we live and grow in nine months mr paxton grows you a pineapple as large as a portmanteau whereas a little one no bigger than a dutch cheese took three years to attain his majority in old times and as the race of pineapples so is the race of man hoiaperwhats the greek for a pineapple warrington  stop for mercys sake stop with the english and before you come to the greek warrington cried out laughing i never heard you make such a long speech or was aware that you had penetrated so deeply into the female mysteries who taught you all this and into whose boudoirs and nurseries have you been peeping whilst i was smoking my pipe and reading my book lying on my straw bed  you are on the bank old boy content to watch the waves tossing in the winds and the struggles of others at sea pen said i am in the stream now and by jove i like it how rapidly we go down it hey strong and feeble old and youngthe metal pitchers and the earthen pitchersthe pretty little china boat swims gaily till the big bruised brazen one bumps him and sends him downeh vogue la galereyou see a man sink in the race and say goodbye to himlook he has only dived under the other fellows legs and comes up shaking his pole and striking out ever so far ahead eh vogue la galere i say its good sport warringtonnot winning merely but playing  well go in and win young un ill sit and mark the game warrington said surveying the ardent young fellow with an almost fatherly pleasure a generous fellow plays for the play a sordid one for the stake an old fogy sits by and smokes the pipe of tranquillity while jack and tom are pummelling each other in the ring  why dont you come in george and have a turn with the gloves you are big enough and strong enough pen said dear old boy you are worth ten of me  you are not quite as tall as goliath certainly the other answered with a laugh that was rough and yet tender as for me i am disabled i had a fatal hit in early life i will tell you about it some day you may too meet with your master dont be too eager or too confident or too worldly my boy  was pendennis becoming worldly or only seeing the worldly or both and is a man very wrong for being after all only a man which is the most reasonable and does his duty best he who stands aloof from the struggle of life calmly contemplating or he who descends to the ground and takes his part in the contest that philosopher pen said had held a great place amongst the leaders of the world and enjoyed to the full what it had to give of rank and riches renown and pleasure who came wearyhearted out of it and said that all was vanity and vexation of spirit many a teacher of those whom we reverence and who steps out of his carriage up to his carved cathedral place shakes his lawn ruffles over the velvet cushions and cries out that the whole struggle is an accursed one and the works of the world are evil many a consciencestricken mystic flies from it altogether and shuts himself out from it within convent walls real or spiritual whence he can only look up to the sky and contemplate the heaven out of which there is no rest and no good  but the earth where our feet are is the work of the same power as the immeasurable blue yonder in which the future lies into which we would peer who ordered toil as the condition of life ordered weariness ordered sickness ordered poverty failure successto this man a foremost place to the other a nameless struggle with the crowdto that a shameful fall or paralysed limb or sudden accidentto each some work upon the ground he stands on until he is laid beneath it while they were talking the dawn came shining through the windows of the room and pen threw them open to receive the fresh morning air look george said he look and see the sun rise he sees the labourer on his way afield the workgirl plying her poor needle the lawyer at his desk perhaps the beauty smiling asleep upon her pillow of down or the jaded reveller reeling to bed or the fevered patient tossing on it or the doctor watching by it over the throes of the mother for the child that is to be born into the worldto be born and to take his part in the suffering and struggling the tears and laughter the crime remorse love folly sorrow rest     chapter xlvi miss amorys partners   the noble henry foker of whom we have lost sight for a few pages has been in the meanwhile occupied as we might suppose a man of his constancy would be in the pursuit and indulgence of his allabsorbing passion of love  i wish that a few of my youthful readers who are inclined to that amusement would take the trouble to calculate the time which is spent in the pursuit when they would find it to be one of the most costly occupations in which a man can possibly indulge what dont you sacrifice to it indeed young gentlemen and young ladies of illregulated minds many hours of your precious sleep in the first place in which you lie tossing and thinking about the adored object whence you come down late to breakfast when noon is advancing and all the family is long since away to its daily occupations then when you at length get to these occupations you pay no attention to them and engage in them with no ardourall your thoughts and powers of mind being fixed elsewhere then the days work being slurred over you neglect your friends and relatives your natural companions and usual associates in life that you may go and have a glance at the dear personage or a look up at her windows or a peep at her carriage in the park then at night the artless blandishments of home bore you mammas conversation palls upon you the dishes which that good soul prepares for the dinner of her favourite are sent away untastedthe whole meal of life indeed except one particular plat has no relish life business family ties home all things useful and dear once become intolerable and you are never easy except when you are in pursuit of your flame  such i believe to be not unfrequently the state of mind amongst illregulated young gentlemen and such indeed was mr h fokers condition who having been bred up to indulge in every propensity towards which he was inclined abandoned himself to this one with his usual selfish enthusiasm nor because he had given his friend arthur pendennis a great deal of good advice on a former occasion need men of the world wonder that mr foker became passions slave in his turn who among us has not given a plenty of the very best advice to his friends who has not preached and who has practised to be sure you madam are perhaps a perfect being and never had a wrong thought in the whole course of your frigid and irreproachable existence or sir you are a great deal too strongminded to allow any foolish passion to interfere with your equanimity in chambers or your attendance on change you are so strong that you dont want any sympathy we dont give you any then we keep ours for the humble and weak that struggle and stumble and get up again and so march with the rest of mortals what need have you of a hand who never fall your serene virtue is never shaded by passion or ruffled by temptation or darkened by remorse compassion would be impertinence for such an angel but then with such a one companionship becomes intolerable you are from the elevation of your very virtue and high attributes of necessity lonely we cant reach up and talk familiarly with such potentatess goodbye then our way lies with humble folks and not with serene highnesses like you and we give notice that there are no perfect characters in this history except perhaps one little one and that one is not perfect either for she never knows to this day that she is perfect and with a deplorable misapprehension and perverseness of humility believes herself to be as great a sinner as need be  this young person does not happen to be in london at the present period of our story and it is by no means for the like of her that mr henry fokers mind is agitated but what matters a few failings need we be angels male or female in order to be worshipped as such let us admire the diversity of the tastes of mankind and the oldest the ugliest the stupidest and most pompous the silliest and most vapid the greatest criminal tyrant booby bluebeard catherine hayes george barnwell amongst us we need never despair i have read of the passion of a transported pickpocket for a female convict each of them advanced in age being repulsive in person ignorant quarrelsome and given to drink that was as magnificent as the loves of cleopatra and antony or lancelot and guinever the passion which count borulawski the polish dwarf inspired in the bosom of the most beautiful baroness at the court of dresden is a matter with which we are all of us acquainted the flame which burned in the heart of young cornet tozer but the other day and caused him to run off and espouse mrs battersby who was old enough to be his mammaall these instances are told in the page of history or the newspaper column are we to be ashamed or pleased to think that our hearts are formed so that the biggest and highestplaced ajax among us may some day find himself prostrate before the pattens of his kitchenmaid as that there is no poverty or shame or crime which will not be supported hugged even with delight and cherished more closely than virtue would be by the perverse fidelity and admirable constant folly of a woman  so then henry foker esquire longed after his love and cursed the fate which separated him from her when lord gravesends family retired to the country his lordship leaving his proxy with the venerable lord bagwig harry still remained lingering on in london certainly not much to the sorrow of lady ann to whom he was affianced and who did not in the least miss him wherever miss clavering went this infatuated young fellow continued to follow her and being aware that his engagement to his cousin was known in the world he was forced to make a mystery of his passion and confine it to his own breast so that it was so pent in there and pressed down that it is a wonder he did not explode some day with the stormy secret and perish collapsed after the outburst  there had been a grand entertainment at gaunt house on one beautiful evening in june and the next days journals contained almost two columns of the names of the most closely printed nobility and gentry who had been honoured with invitations to the ball among the guests were sir francis and lady clavering and miss amory for whom the indefatigable major pendennis had procured an invitation and our two young friends arthur and harry each exerted himself and danced a great deal with miss blanche as for the worthy major he assumed the charge of lady clavering and took care to introduce her to that department of the mansion where her ladyship specially distinguished herself namely the refreshmentroom where amongst pictures of titian and giorgione and regal portraits of vandyke and reynolds and enormous salvers of gold and silver and pyramids of large flowers and constellations of wax candlesin a manner perfectly regardless of expense in a worda supper was going on all night of how many creams jellies salads peaches white soups grapes pates galantines cups of tea champagne and so forth lady clavering partook it does not become us to say how much the major suffered as he followed the honest woman about calling to the solemn male attendants and lovely servantmaids and administering to lady claverings various wants with admirable patience nobody knowshe never confessed he never allowed his agony to appear on his countenance in the least but with a constant kindness brought plate after plate to the begum  mr wagg counted up all the dishes of which lady clavering partook as long as he could count but as he partook very freely himself of champagne during the evening his powers of calculation were not to be trusted at the close of the entertainment and he recommended mr honeyman lady steynes medical man to look carefully after the begum and to call and get news of her ladyship the next day  sir francis clavering made his appearance and skulked for a while about the magnificent rooms but the company and the splendour which he met there were not to the baronets taste and after tossing off a tumbler of wine or two at the buffet he quitted gaunt house for the neighbourhood of jermyn street where his friends loder punter little moss abramns and captain skewball were assembled at the familiar green table in the rattle of the box and of their agreeable conversation sir franciss spirits rose to their accustomed point of feeble hilarity  mr pynsent who had asked miss amory to dance came up on one occasion to claim her hand but scowls of recognition having already passed between him and mr arthur pendennis in the dancingroom arthur suddenly rose up and claimed miss amory as his partner for the present dance on which mr pynsent biting his lips and scowling yet more savagely withdrew with a profound bow saying that he gave up his claim there are some men who are always falling in ones way in life pynsent and pen had this view of each other and each regarded other accordingly  what a confounded conceited provincial fool that is thought the one because he has written a twopenny novel his absurd head is turned and a kicking would take his conceit out of him  what an impertinent idiot that man is remarked the other to his partner his soul is in downing street his neckcloth is foolscap his hair is sand his legs are rulers his vitals are tape and sealingwax he was a prig in his cradle and never laughed since he was born except three times at the same joke of his chief i have the same liking for that man miss amory i have for that cold boiled veal upon which blanche of course remarked that mr pendennis was wicked mechant perfectly abominable and wondered what he would say when her back was turned  saysay that you have the most beautiful figure and the slimmest waist in the world blanchemiss amory i mean i beg your pardon another turn this music would make an alderman dance  and you have left off tumbling when you waltz now blanche asked archly looking up at her partners face  one falls and one gets up again in life blanche you know i used to call you so in old times and it is the prettiest name in the world besides i have practised since then  and with a great number of partners im afraid blanche said with a little sham sigh and a shrug of the shoulders and so in truth mr pen had practised a good deal in this life and had undoubtedly arrived at being able to dance better  if pendennis was impertinent in his talk foker on the other hand so bland and communicative on most occasions was entirely mum and melancholy when he danced with miss amory to clasp her slender waist was a rapture to whirl round the room with her was a delirium but to speak to her what could he say that was worthy of her what pearl of conversation could he bring that was fit for the acceptance of such a queen of love and wit as blanche it was she who made the talk when she was in the company of this lovestricken partner it was she who asked him bow that dear little pony was and looked at him and thanked him with such a tender kindness and regret and refused the dear little pony with such a delicate sigh when he offered it i have nobody to ride with in london she said mamma is timid and her figure is not pretty on horseback sir francis never goes out with me he loves me likelike a stepdaughter oh how delightful it must be to have a fathera father mr foker  oh uncommon said mr harry who enjoyed that blessing very calmly upon which and forgetting the sentimental air which she had just before assumed blanches grey eyes gazed at foker with such an arch twinkle that both of them burst out laughing and harry enraptured and at his ease began to entertain her with a variety of innocent prattlegood kind simple foker talk flavoured with many expressions by no means to be discovered in dictionaries and relating to the personal history of himself or horses or other things dear and important to him or to persons in the ballroom then passing before them and about whose appearance or character mr harry spoke with artless freedom and a considerable dash of humour  and it was blanche who when the conversation flagged and the youths modesty came rushing back and overpowering him knew how to reanimate her companion asked him questions about logwood and whether it was a pretty place whether he was a hunting man and whether he liked women to hunt in which case she was prepared to say that she adored huntingbut mr foker expressing his opinion against sporting females and pointing out lady bullfinch who happened to pass by as a horsegodmother whom he had seen at cover with a cigar in her face blanche too expressed her detestation of the sports of the field and said it would make her shudder to think of a dear sweet little fox being killed on which foker laughed and waltzed with renewed vigour and grace  and at the end of the waltzthe last waltz they had on that nightblanche asked him about drummington and whether it was a fine house his cousins she had heard were very accomplished lord erith she had met and which of his cousins was his favourite was it not lady ann yes she was sure it was she sure by his looks and his blushes she was tired of dancing it was getting very late she must go to mammaand without another word she sprang away from harry fokers arm and seized upon pens who was swaggering about the dancingroom and again said mamma mammatake me to mamma dear mr pendennis transfixing harry with a parthian shot as she fled from him  my lord steyne with garter and ribbon with a bald head and shining eyes and a collar of red whiskers round his face always looked grand upon an occasion of state and made a great effect upon lady clavering when he introduced himself to her at the request of the obsequious major pendennis with his own white and royal hand he handed to her ladyship a glass of wine said he had heard of her charming daughter and begged to be presented to her and at this very juncture mr arthur pendennis came up with the young lady on his arm  the peer made a profound bow and blanche the deepest curtesy that ever was seen his lordship gave mr arthur pendennis his hand to shake said he had read his book which was very wicked and clever asked miss blanche if she had read itat which pen blushed and winced why blanche was one of the heroines of the novel blanche in black ringlets and a little altered was the neaera of walter lorraine  blanche had read it the language of the eyes expressed her admiration and rapture at the performance this little play being achieved the marquis of steyne made other two profound bows to lady clavering and her daughter and passed on to some other of his guests at the splendid entertainment  mamma and daughter were loud in their expressions of admiration of the noble marquis so soon as his broad back was turned upon them he said they make a very nice couple whispered major pendennis to lady clavering did he now really mamma thought they would mamma was so flustered with the honour which had just been shown to her and with other intoxicating events of the evening that her goodhumour knew no bounds she laughed she winked and nodded knowingly at pen she tapped him on the arm with her fan she tapped blanche she tapped the majorher contentment was boundless and her method of showing her joy equally expansive  as the party went down the great staircase of gaunt house the morning had risen stark and clear over the black trees of the square the skies were tinged with pink and the cheeks of some of the people at the ballah how ghastly they looked that admirable and devoted major above allwho had been for hours by lady claverings side ministering to her and feeding her body with everything that was nice and her ear with everything that was sweet and flatteringoh what an object he was the rings round his eyes were of the colour of bistre those orbs themselves were like the plovers eggs whereof lady clavering and blanche had each tasted the wrinkles in his old face were furrowed in deep gashes and a silver stubble like an elderly morning dew was glittering on his chin and alongside the dyed whiskers now limp and out of curl  there he stood with admirable patience enduring uncomplainingly a silent agony knowing that people could see the state of his face for could he not himself perceive the condition of others males and females of his own agelonging to go to rest for hours past aware that suppers disagreed with him and yet having eaten a little so as to keep his friend lady clavering in goodhumour with twinges of rheumatism in the back and knees with weary feet burning in his varnished bootsso tired oh so tired and longing for bed if a man struggling with hardship and bravely overcoming it is an object of admiration for the gods that power in whose chapels the old major was a faithful worshipper must have looked upwards approvingly upon the constancy of pendenniss martyrdom there are sufferers in that cause as in the other the negroes in the service of mumbo jumbo tattoo and drill themselves with burning skewers with great fortitude and we read that the priests in the service of baal gashed themselves and bled freely you who can smash the idols do so with a good courage but do not be too fierce with the idolatersthey worship the best thing they know  the pendennises the elder and the younger waited with lady clavering and her daughter until her ladyships carriage was announced when the elders martyrdom may be said to have come to an end for the goodnatured begum insisted upon leaving him at his door in bury street so he took the back seat of the carriage after a feeble bow or two and speech of thanks polite to the last and resolute in doing his duty the begum waved her dumpy little hand by way of farewell to arthur and foker and blanche smiled languidly out upon the young men thinking whether she looked very wan and green under her rosecoloured hood and whether it was the mirrors at gaunt house or the fatigue and fever of her own eyes which made her fancy herself so pale  arthur perhaps saw quite well how yellow blanche looked but did not attribute that peculiarity of her complexion to the effect of the lookingglasses or to any error in his sight or her own our young man of the world could use his eyes very keenly and could see blanches face pretty much as nature had made it but for poor foker it had a radiance which dazzled and blinded him he could see no more faults in it than in the sun which was now flaring over the housetops  amongst other wicked london habits which pen had acquired the moralist will remark that he had got to keep very bad hours and often was going to bed at the time when sober countrypeople were thinking of leaving it men get used to one hour as to another editors of newspapers covent garden marketpeople night cabmen and coffeesellers chimneysweeps and gentlemen and ladies of fashion who frequent balls are often quite lively at three or four oclock of a morning when ordinary mortals are snoring we have shown in the last chapter how pen was in a brisk condition of mind at this period inclined to smoke his cigar at ease and to speak freely  foker and pen walked away from gaunt house then indulging in both the above amusements or rather pen talked and foker looked as if he wanted to say something pen was sarcastic and dandified when he had been in the company of great folks he could not help imitating some of their airs and tones and having a most lively imagination mistook himself for a person of importance very easily he rattled away and attacked this person and that sneered at lady john turnbulls bad french which her ladyship will introduce into all conversations in spite of the sneers of everybody at mrs slack ropers extraordinary costume and sham jewels at the old dandies and the young onesat whom didnt he sneer and laugh  you fire at everybody penyoure grown awful that you are foker said now youve pulled about blondels yellow wig and colchicums black one why dont you have a shy at a brown one hay you know whose i mean it got into lady claverings carriage  under my uncles hat my uncle is a martyr foker my boy my uncle has been doing excruciating duties all night he likes to go to bed rather early he has a dreadful headache if he sits up and touches supper he always has the gout if he walks or stands much at a ball he has been sitting up and standing up and supping he has gone home to the gout and the headache and for my sake shall i make fun of the old boy no not for venice  how do you mean that he has been doing it for your sake foker asked looking rather alarmed  boy canst thou keep a secret if i impart it to thee pen cried out in high spirits art thou of good counsel wilt thou swear wilt thou be mum or wilt thou preach wilt thou be silent and hear or wilt thou speak and die and as he spoke flinging himself into an absurd theatrical attitude the men in the cabstand in piccadilly wondered and grinned at the antics of the two young swells  what the doose are you driving at foker asked looking very much agitated  pen however did not remark this agitation much but continued in the same bantering and excited vein henry friend of my youth he said and witness of my early follies though dull at thy books yet thou art not altogether deprived of sensenay blush not henrico thou hast a good portion of that and of courage and kindness too at the service of thy friends were i in a strait of poverty i would come to my fokers purse were i in grief i would discharge my grief upon his sympathising bosom  gammon pengo on foker said  i would henrico upon thy studs and upon thy cambric worked by the hands of beauty to adorn the breast of valour know then friend of my boyhoods days that arthur pendennis of the upper temple studentatlaw feels that he is growing lonely and old care is furrowing his temples and baldness is busy with his crown shall we stop and have a drop of coffee at this stall it looks very hot and nice look how that cabman is blowing at his saucer no you wont aristocrat i resume my tale i am getting on in life i have got devilish little money i want some i am thinking of getting some and settling in life im thinking of settling im thinking of marrying old boy im thinking of becoming a moral man a steady port and sherry character with a good reputation in my quartier and a moderate establishment of two maids and a manwith an occasional brougham to drive out mrs pendennis and a house near the parks for the accommodation of the children ha what sayest thou answer thy friend thou worthy child of beer speak i adjure thee by all thy vats  but you aint got any money pen said the other still looking alarmed  i aint no but she ave i tell thee there is gold in store for menot what you call money nursed in the lap of luxury and cradled on grains and drinking in wealth from a thousand mashtubs what do you know about money what is poverty to you is splendour to the hardy son of the humble apothecary you cant live without an establishment and your houses in town and country a snug little house somewhere off belgravia a brougham for my wife a decent cook and a fair bottle of wine for my friends at home sometimes these simple necessaries suffice for me my foker and here pendennis began to look more serious without bantering further pen continued ive rather serious thoughts of settling and marrying no man can get on in the world without some money at his back you must have a certain stake to begin with before you can go in and play the great game who knows that im not going to try old fellow worse men than i have won at it and as i have not got enough capital from my fathers i must get some by my wifethats all  they were walking down grosvenor street as they talked or rather as pen talked in the selfish fulness of his heart and mr pen must have been too much occupied with his own affairs to remark the concern and agitation of his neighbour for he continued we are no longer children you know you and i harry bah the time of our romance has passed away we dont marry for passion but for prudence and for establishment what do you take your cousin for because she is a nice girl and an earls daughter and the old folks wish it and that sort of thing  and you pendennis asked foker you aint very fond of the girlyoure going to marry  pen shrugged his shoulders comme ca said he i like her well enough shes pretty enough shes clever enough i think shell do very well and she has got money enoughthats the great point psha you know who she is dont you i thought you were sweet on her yourself one night when we dined with her mamma its little amory  ii thought so foker said and has she accepted you  not quite arthur replied with a confident smile which seemed to say i have but to ask and she comes to me that instant  oh not quite said foker and he broke out with such a dreadful laugh that pen for the first time turned his thoughts from himself towards his companion and was struck by the others ghastly pale face  my dear fellow fo whats the matter youre ill pen said in a tone of real concern  you think it was the champagne at gaunt house dont you it aint that come in let me talk to you for a minute ill tell you what it is dit let me tell somebody foker said  they were at mr fokers door by this time and opening it harry walked with his friend into his apartments which were situated in the back part of the house and behind the family diningroom where the elder foker received his guests surrounded by pictures of himself his wife his infant son on a donkey and the late earl of gravesend in his robes as a peer foker and pen passed by this chamber now closed with deathlike shutters and entered into the young mans own quarters dusky streams of sunbeams were playing into that room and lighting up poor harrys gallery of dancinggirls and opera nymphs with flickering illuminations  look here i cant help telling you pen he said ever since the night we dined there im so fond of that girl that i think i shall die if i dont get her i feel as if i should go mad sometimes i cant stand it pen i couldnt bear to hear you talking about her just now about marrying her only because shes money ah pen that aint the question in marrying id bet anything it aint talking about money and such a girl as that itsitswhatdyecallemyou know what i meani aint good at talkingsacrilege then if shed have me id take and sweep a crossing that i would  poor fo i dont think that would tempt her pen said eyeing his friend with a great deal of real goodnature and pity she is not a girl for love and a cottage  she ought to be a duchess i know that very well and i know she wouldnt take me unless i could make her a great place in the worldfor i aint good for anything myself muchi aint clever and that sort of thing foker said sadly if i had all the diamonds that all the duchesses and marchionesses had on tonight wouldnt i put em in her lap but whats the use of talking im booked for another race its that kills me pen i cant get out of it though i die i cant get out of it and though my cousins a nice girl and i like her very well and that yet i hadnt seen this one when our governors settled that matter between us and when you talked just now about her doing very well and about her having money enough for both of you i thought to myself it isnt money or mere liking a girl that ought to be enough to make a fellow marry he may marry and find he likes somebody else better all the money in the world wont make you happy then look at me ive plenty of money or shall have out of the mashtubs as you call em my governor thought hed made it all right for me in settling my marriage with my cousin i tell you it wont do and when lady ann has got her husband it wont be happy for either of us and shell have the most miserable beggar in town  poor old fellow pen said with rather a cheap magnanimity i wish i could help you i had no idea of this and that you were so wild about the girl do you think she would have you without your money no do you think your father would agree to break off your engagement with your cousin you know him very well and that he would cast you off rather than do so  the unhappy foker only groaned a reply flinging himself prostrate on a sofa face forwards his head in his hands  as for my affair pen went on my dear fellow if i had thought matters were so critical with you at least i would not have pained you by choosing you as my confidant and my business is not serious at least not as yet i have not spoken a word about it to miss amory very likely she would not have me if i asked her only i have had a great deal of talk about it with my uncle who says that the match might be an eligible one for me im ambitious and im poor and it appears lady clavering will give her a good deal of money and sir francis might be got to never mind the rest nothing is settled harry they are going out of town directly i promise you i wont ask her before she goes theres no hurry theres time for everybody but suppose you got her foker remember what you said about marriages just now and the misery of a man who doesnt care for his wife and what sort of a wife would you have who didnt care for her husband  but she would care for me said foker from his sofathat is i think she would last night only as we were dancing she said  what did she say pen cried starting up in great wrath but he saw his own meaning more clearly than foker and broke off with a laughwell never mind what she said harry miss amory is a clever girl and says numbers of civil thingsto youto me perhapsand who the deuce knows to whom besides nothings settled old boy at least my heart wont break if i dont get her win her if you can and i wish you joy of her goodbye dont think about what i said to you i was excited and confoundedly thirsty in those hot rooms and didnt i suppose put enough seltzerwater into the champagne good night ill keep your counsel too mum is the word between us and let there be a fair fight and let the best man win as peter crawley says  so saying mr arthur pendennis giving a very queer and rather dangerous look at his companion shook him by the hand with something of that sort of cordiality which befitted his just repeated simile of the boxingmatch and which mr bendigo displays when he shakes hands with mr gaunt before they fight each other for the champions belt and two hundred pounds a side foker returned his friends salute with an imploring look and a piteous squeeze of the hand sank back on his cushions again and pen putting on his hat strode forth into the air and almost over the body of the matutinal housemaid who was rubbing the steps at the door  and so he wants her too does be thought pen as he marched alongand noted within himself with a fatal keenness of perception and almost an infernal mischief that the very pains and tortures which that honest heart of fokers was suffering gave a zest and an impetus to his own pursuit of blanche if pursuit might be called which had been no pursuit as yet but mere sport and idle dallying she said something to him did she perhaps she gave him the fellow flower to this and he took out of his coat and twiddled in his thumb and finger a poor little shrivelled crumpled bud that had faded and blackened with the heat and flare of the nighti wonder to how many more she has given her artless tokens of affectionthe little flirtand he flung his into the gutter where the water may have refreshed it and where any amateur of rosebuds may have picked it up and then bethinking him that the day was quite bright and that the passersby by might be staring at his beard and white neckcloth our modest young gentleman took a cab and drove to the temple  ah is this the boy that prayed at his mothers knee but a few years since and for whom very likely at this hour of morning she is praying is this jaded and selfish worldling the lad who a short while back was ready to fling away his worldly all his hope his ambition his chance of life for his love this is the man you are proud of old pendennis you boast of having formed him and of having reasoned him out of his absurd romance and follyand groaning in your bed over your pains and rheumatisms satisfy yourself still by thinking that at last that lad will do something to better himself in life and that the pendennises will take a good place in the world and is he the only one who in his progress through this dark life goes wilfully or fatally astray whilst the natural truth and love which should illumine him grow dim in the poisoned air and suffice to light him no more  when pen was gone away poor harry foker got up from the sofa and taking out from his waistcoatthe splendidly buttoned but the gorgeously embroidered the work of his mammaa little white rosebud he drew from his dressingcase also the maternal present a pair of scissors with which he nipped carefully the stalk of the flower and placing it in a glass of water opposite his bed he sought refuge there from care and bitter remembrances  it is to be presumed that miss blanche amory had more than one rose in her bouquet and why should not the kind young creature give out of her superfluity and make as many partners as possible happy     chapter xlvii monseigneur samuse   the exertions of that last night at gaunt house had proved almost too much for major pendennis and as soon as he could move his weary old body with safety he transported himself groaning to buxton and sought relief in the healing waters of that place parliament broke up sir francis clavering and family left town and the affairs which we have just mentioned to the reader were not advanced in the brief interval of a few days or weeks which have occurred between this and the last chapter the town was however emptied since then  the season was now come to a conclusion pens neighbours the lawyers were gone upon circuit and his more fashionable friends had taken their passports for the continent or had fled for health or excitement to the scotch moors scarce a man was to be seen in the bowwindows of the clubs or on the solitary pall mall pavement the red jackets had disappeared from before the palacegate the tradesmen of st jamess were abroad taking their pleasure the tailors had grown mustachios and were gone up the rhine the bootmakers were at ems or baden blushing when they met their customers at those places of recreation or punting beside their creditors at the gamblingtables the clergymen of st jamess only preached to half a congregation in which there was not a single sinner of distinction the band in kensington gardens had shut up their instruments of brass and trumpets of silver only two or three old flies and chaises crawled by the banks of the serpentine and clarence bulbul who was retained in town by his arduous duties as a treasury clerk when he took his afternoon ride in rotten row compared its loneliness to the vastness of the arabian desert and himself to a bedouin wending his way through that dusty solitude warrington stowed away a quantity of cavendish tobacco in his carpetbag and betook himself as his custom was in the vacation to his brothers house in norfolk pen was left alone in chambers for a while for this man of fashion could not quit the metropolis when he chose always and was at present detained by the affairs of his newspaper the pall mall gazette of which he acted as the editor and charge daffaires during the temporary absence of the chief captain shandon who was with his family at the salutary wateringplace of boulognesurmer  although as we have seen mr pen had pronounced himself for years past to be a man perfectly blase and wearied of life yet the truth is that he was an exceedingly healthy young fellow still with a fine appetite which he satisfied with the greatest relish and satisfaction at least once a day and a constant desire for society which showed him to be anything but misanthropical if he could not get a good dinner he sate down to a bad one with perfect contentment if he could not procure the company of witty or great or beautiful persons he put up with any society that came to hand and was perfectly satisfied in a tavernparlour or on board a greenwich steamboat or in a jaunt to hampstead with mr finucane his colleague at the pall mall gazette or in a visit to the summer theatres across the river or to the royal gardens of vauxhall where he was on terms of friendship with the great simpson and where he shook the principal comic singer of the lovely equestrian of the arena by the hand and while he could watch the grimaces or the graces of these with a satiric humour that was not deprived of sympathy he could look on with an eye of kindness at the lookerson too at the roystering youth bent upon enjoyment and here taking it at the honest parents with their delighted children laughing and clapping their hands at the show at the poor outcasts whose laughter was less innocent though perhaps louder and who brought their shame and their youth here to dance and be merry till the dawn at least and to get bread and drown care of this sympathy with all conditions of men arthur often boasted said he was pleased to possess it and that he hoped thus to the last he should retain it as another man has an ardour for art or music or natural science mr pen said that anthropology was his favourite pursuit and had his eyes always eagerly open to its infinite varieties and beauties contemplating with an unfailing delight all specimens of it in all places to which he resorted whether it was the coquetting of a wrinkled dowager in a ballroom or a highbred young beauty blushing in her prime there whether it was a hulking guardsman coaxing a servantgirl in the parkor innocent little tommy that was feeding the ducks whilst the nurse listened and indeed a man whose heart is pretty clean can indulge in this pursuit with an enjoyment that never ceases and is only perhaps the more keen because it is secret and has a touch of sadness in it because he is of his mood and humour lonely and apart although not alone  yes pen used to brag and talk in his impetuous way to warrington i was in love so fiercely in my youth that i have burned out that flame for ever i think and if ever i marry it will be a marriage of reason that i will make with a wellbred goodtempered goodlooking person who has a little money and so forth that will cushion our carriage in its course through life as for romance it is all done i have spent that out and am old before my timeim proud of it  stuff growled the other you fancied you were getting bald the other day and bragged about it as you do about everything but you began to use the bearsgrease pot directly the hairdresser told you and are scented like a barber ever since  you are diogenes the other answered and you want every man to live in a tub like yourself violets smell better than stale tobacco you grizzly old cynic but mr pen was blushing whilst he made this reply to his unromantical friend and indeed cared a great deal more about himself still than such a philosopher perhaps should have done indeed considering that he was careless about the world mr pen ornamented his person with no small pains in order to make himself agreeable to it and for a weary pilgrim as he was wore very tight boots and bright varnish  it was in this dull season of the year then of a shining friday night in autumn that mr pendennis having completed at his newspaper office a brilliant leading articlesuch as captain shandon himself might have written had the captain been in goodhumour and inclined to work which he never would do except under compulsionthat mr arthur pendennis having written his article and reviewed it approvingly as it lay before him in its wet proofsheet at the office of the paper bethought him that he would cross the water and regale himself with the fireworks and other amusements of vauxhall so he affably put in his pocket the order which admitted editor of pall mall gazette and friend to that place of recreation and paid with the coin of the realm a sufficient sum to enable him to cross waterloo bridge the walk thence to the gardens was pleasant the stars were shining in the skies above looking down upon the royal property whence the rockets and roman candles had not yet ascended to outshine the stars  before you enter the enchanted ground where twenty thousand additional lamps are burned every night as usual most of us have passed through the black and dreary passage and wickets which hide the splendours of vauxhall from uninitiated men in the walls of this passage are two holes strongly illuminated in the midst of which you see two gentlemen at desks where they will take either your money as a private individual or your order of admission if you are provided with that passport to the gardens pen went to exhibit his ticket at the lastnamed orifice where however a gentleman and two ladies were already in parley before him  the gentleman whose hat was very much on one side and who wore a short and shabby cloak in an excessively smart manner was crying out in a voice which pen at once recognised  bedad sir if ye doubt me honour will ye obleege me by stipping out of that box and  lor capting cried the elder lady  dont bother me said the man in the box  and ask mr hodgen himself whos in the gyardens to let these leedies pass dont be froightened me dear madam im not going to quarl with this gintleman at anyreet before leedies will ye go sir and desoire mr hodgen whose orther i keem in with and hes me most intemate friend and i know hes goan to sing the body snatcher here tonoight with captain costigans compliments to stip out and let in the leediesfor meself sir ive seen vauxhall and i scawrun any interfayrance on moi account but for these leedies one of them has never been there and of should think yed harly take advantage of me misfartune in losing the ticket to deproive her of her pleasure  it aint no use captain i cant go about your business the checktaker said on which the captain swore an oath and the elder lady said lor ow provokin  as for the young one she looked up at the captain and said never mind captain costigan im sure i dont want to go at all come away mamma and with this although she did not want to go at all her feelings overcame her and she began to cry  me poor child the captain said can ye see that sir and will ye not let this innocent creature in  it aint my business cried the doorkeeper peevishly out of the illuminated box and at this minute arthur came up and recognising costigan said dont you know me captain pendennis and he took off his hat and made a bow to the two ladies me dear boy me dear friend cried the captain extending towards pendennis the grasp of friendship and he rapidly explained to the other what he called a most unluckee conthratong he had an order for vauxhall admitting two from mr hodgen then within the gardens and singing as he did at the back kitchen and the nobilitys concerts the body snatcher the death of general wolfe the banner of blood and other favourite melodies and having this order for the admission of two persons he thought that it would admit three and had come accordingly to the gardens with his friends but on his way captain costigan had lost the paper of admissionit was not forthcoming at all and the leedies must go back again to the great disappointment of one of them as pendennis saw  arthur had a great deal of goodnature for everybody and sympathised with the misfortunes of all sorts of people how could he refuse his sympathy in such a case as this he had seen the innocent face as it looked up to the captain the appealing look of the girl the piteous quiver of the mouth and the final outburst of tears if it had been his last guinea in the world he must have paid it to have given the poor little thing pleasure she turned the sad imploring eyes away directly they lighted upon a stranger and began to wipe them with her handkerchief arthur looked very handsome and kind as he stood before the women with his hat off blushing bowing generous a gentleman who are they he asked of himself he thought he had seen the elder lady before  if i can be of any service to you captain costigan the young man said i hope you will command me is there any difficulty about taking these ladies into the garden will you kindly make use of my purse andand i have a ticket myself which will admit twoi hope maam you will permit me  the first impulse of the prince of fairoaks was to pay for the whole party and to make away with his newspaper order as poor costigan had done with his own ticket but his instinct and the appearance of the two women told him that they would be better pleased if he did not give himself the airs of a grand seigneur and he handed his purse to costigan and laughingly pulled out his ticket with one hand as he offered the other to the elder of the ladiesladies was not the wordthey had bonnets and shawls and collars and ribbons and the youngest showed a pretty little foot and boot under her modest grey gown but his highness of fairoaks was courteous to every person who wore a petticoat whatever its texture was and the humbler the wearer only the more stately and polite in his demeanour  fanny take the gentlemans arm the elder said since you will be so very kindive seen you often come in at our gate sir and go in to captain strongs at no 3  fanny made a little curtsey and put her hand under arthurs arm it had on a shabby little glove but it was pretty and small she was not a child but she was scarcely a woman as yet her tears had dried up and her cheek mantled with youthful blushes and her eyes glistened with pleasure and gratitude as she looked up into arthurs kind face  arthur in a protecting way put his other hand upon the little one resting on his arm fannys a very pretty little name he said and so you know me do you  we keep the lodge sir at shepherds inn fanny said with a curtsey and ive never been at vauxhall sir and papa didnt like me to goandandoolaw how beautiful she shrank back as she spoke starting with wonder and delight as she saw the royal gardens blaze before her with a hundred million of lamps with a splendour such as the finest fairy tale the finest pantomime she had ever witnessed at the theatre had never realised pen was pleased with her pleasure and pressed to his side the little hand which clung so kindly to him what would i not give for a little of this pleasure said the blase young man  your purse pendennis me dear boy said the captains voice behind him will ye count it its all roightnoye thrust in old jack costigan he thrusts me ye see madam yeve been me preserver pen ive known um since choildhood mrs bolton hes the proproietor of fairoaks castle and manys the cooper of clart ive dthrunk there with the first nobilitee of his neetive counteemr pendennis yeve been me preserver and of thank ye me daughtther will thank yemr simpson your humble servant sir  if pen was magnificent in his courtesy to the ladies what was his splendour in comparison to captain costigans bowing here and there and crying bravo to the singers  a man descended like costigan from a long line of hibernian kings chieftains and other magnates and sheriffs of the county had of course too much dignity and selfrespect to walk arruminarrum as the captain phrased it with a lady who occasionally swept his room out and cooked his muttonchops in the course of their journey from shepherds inn to vauxhall gardens captain costigan had walked by the side of the two ladies in a patronising and affable manner pointing out to them the edifices worthy of note and discoorsing according to his wont about other cities and countries which he had visited and the people of rank and fashion with whom he had the honour of an acquaintance nor could it be expected nor indeed did mrs bolton expect that arrived in the royal property and strongly illuminated by the flare of the twenty thousand additional lamps the captain could relax from his dignity and give an arm to a lady who was in fact little better than a housekeeper or charwoman  but pen on his part had no such scruples miss fanny bolton did not make his bed nor sweep his chambers and he did not choose to let go his pretty little partner as for fanny her colour heightened and her bright eyes shone the brighter with pleasure as she leaned for protection on the arm of such a fine gentleman as mr pen and she looked at numbers of other ladies in the place and at scores of other gentlemen under whose protection they were walking here and there and she thought that her gentleman was handsomer and granderlooking than any other gent in the place of course there were votaries of pleasure of all ranks thererakish young surgeons fast young clerks and commercialists occasional dandies of the guard regiments and the rest old lord colchicum was there in attendance upon mademoiselle caracoline who had been riding in the ring and who talked her native french very loud and used idiomatic expressions of exceeding strength as she walked about leaning on the arm of his lordship  colchicum was in attendance upon mademoiselle carandine little tom tufthunt was in attendance upon lord colchicum and rather pleased too with his position when don juan scalles the wall theres never a want of a leporello to hold the ladder tom tufthunt was quite happy to act as friend to the elderly viscount and to carve the fowl and to make the salad at supper when pen and his young lady met the viscounts party that noble poor only gave arthur a passing leer of recognition as his lordships eyes passed from pens face under the bonnet of pens companion but tom tufthunt wagged his head very goodnaturedly at mr arthur and said how are you old boy and looked extremely knowing at the godfather of this history  that is the great rider at astleys i have seen her there miss bolton said looking after mademoiselle caracoline and who is that old man is it not the gentleman in the ring  that is lord viscount colchicum miss fanny said pen with an air of protection he meant no harm he was pleased to patronise the young girl and he was not displeased that she should be so pretty and that she should be hanging upon his arm and that yonder elderly don juan should have seen her there  fanny was very pretty her eyes were dark and brilliant her teeth were like little pearls her mouth was almost as red as mademoiselle caracolines when the latter had put on her vermilion and what a difference there was between the ones voice and the others between the girls laugh and the womans it was only very lately indeed that fanny when looking in the little glass over the bowscostigan mantelpiece as she was dusting it had begun to suspect that she was a beauty but a year ago she was a clumsy gawky girl at whom her father sneered and of whom the girls at the dayschool miss minifers newcastle street strand miss m the younger sister took the leading business at the norwich circuit in 182 and she herself had played for two seasons with some credit t r e o t r s w until she fell down a trapdoor and broke her leg the girls at fannys school we say took no account of her and thought her a dowdy little creature as long as she remained under miss minifers instruction and it was unremarked and almost unseen in the porters dark lodge of shepherds inn that this little flower bloomed into beauty  so this young person hung upon mr pens arm and they paced the gardens together empty as london was there were still some two millions of people left lingering about it and amongst them one or two of the acquaintances of mr arthur pendennis  amongst them silent and alone pale with his hands in his pockets and a rueful nod of the head to arthur as they met passed henry foker esq young henry was trying to ease his mind by moving from place to place and from excitement to excitement but he thought about blanche as he sauntered in the dark walks he thought about blanche as he looked at the devices of the lamps he consulted the fortuneteller about her and was disappointed when that gipsy told him that he was in love with a dark lady who would make him happy and at the concert though mr momus sang his most stunning comic songs and asked his most astonishing riddles never did a kind smile come to visit fokers lips in fact he never heard mr momus at all  pen and miss bolton were hard by listening to the same concert and the latter remarked and pen laughed at mr fokeis woebegone face  fanny asked what it was that made that oddlooking little man so dismal i think he is crossed in love pen said isnt that enough to make any man dismal fanny and he looked down at her splendidly protecting her like egmont at clara in goethes play or leicester at amy in scotts novel  crossed in love is he poor gentleman said fanny with a sigh and her eyes turned round towards him with no little kindness and pitybut harry did not see the beautiful dark eyes  how dy do mr pendennisa voice broke in hereit was that of a young man in a large white coat with a red neckcloth over which a dingy shirtcollar was turned so as to exhibit a dubious neckwith a large pin of bullion or other metal and an imaginative waistcoat with exceedingly fanciful glass buttons and trousers that cried with a loud voice come look at me and see how cheap and tawdry i am my master what a dirty buck and a little stick in one pocket of his coat and a lady in pink satin on the other armhow dy doforget me i dare say huxterclavering  how do you do mr huxter the prince of fairoaks said in his most princely manneri hope you are very well  pretty bobbish thankyand mr huxter wagged his head i say pendennis youve been coming it uncommon strong since we had the row at wapshots dont you remember great author hay go about with the swells saw your name in the morning post i suppose youre too much of a swell to come and have a bit of supper with an old friendcharterhouse lane tomorrow nightsome devilish good fellows from bartholomews and some stunning ginpunch heres my card and with this mr huxter released his hand from the pocket where his cane was and pulling off the top of his cardcase with his teeth produced thence a visiting ticket which he handed to pen  you are exceedingly kind i am sure said pen but i regret that i have an engagement which will take me out of town tomorrow night and the marquis of fairoaks wondering that such a creature as this could have the audacity to give him a card put mr huxters card into his waistcoat pocket with a lofty courtesy possibly mr samuel huxter was not aware that there was any great social difference between mr arthur pendennis and himself mr huxters father was a surgeon and apothecary at clavering just as mr pendenniss papa had been a surgeon and apothecary at bath but the impudence of some men is beyond all calculation  well old fellow never mind said mr huxter who always frank and familiar was from vinous excitement even more affable than usual if ever you are passing look up our place im mostly at home saturdays and theres generally a cheese cupboard ta tatheres the bell for the fireworks ringing come along mary and he set off running with the rest of the crowd in the direction of the fireworks  so did pen presently when this agreeable youth was out of sight begin to run with his little companion mrs bolton following after them with captain costigan at her side but the captain was too majestic and dignified in his movements to run for friend or enemy and he pursued his course with the usual jaunty swagger which distinguished his steps so that he and his companion were speedily distanced by pen and miss fanny  perhaps arthur forgot or perhaps he did not choose to remember that the elder couple had no money in their pockets as had been proved by their adventure at the entrance of the gardens howbeit pen paid a couple of shillings for himself and his partner and with her hanging close on his arm scaled the staircase which leads to the firework gallery the captain and mamma might have followed them if they liked but arthur and fanny were too busy to look back people were pushing and squeezing there beside and behind them one eager individual rushed by fanny and elbowed her so that she fell back with a little cry upon which of course arthur caught her adroitly in his arms and just for protection kept her so defended until they mounted the stair and took their places  poor foker sate alone on one of the highest benches his face illuminated by the fireworks or in their absence by the moon arthur saw him and laughed but did not occupy himself about his friend much he was engaged with fanny how she wondered how happy she was how she cried o o o as the rockets soared into the air and showered down in azure and emerald and vermilion as these wonders blazed and disappeared before her the little girl thrilled and trembled with delight at arthurs sideher hand was under his arm still he felt it pressing him as she looked up delighted  how beautiful they are sir she cried  dont call me sir fanny arthur said  a quick blush rushed up into the girls face what shall i call you she said in a low voice sweet and tremulous what would you wish me to say sir  again fanny well i forgot it is best so my dear pendennis said very kindly and gently i may call you fanny  oh yes she said and the little hand pressed his arm once more very eagerly and the girl clung to him so that he could feel her heart beating on his shoulder  i may call you fanny because you are a young girl and a good girl fanny and i am an old gentleman but you mustnt call me anything but sir or mr pendennis if you like for we live in very different stations fanny and dont think i speak unkindly andand why do you take your hand away fanny are you afraid of me do you think i would hurt you not for all the world my dear little girl andand look how beautiful the moon and stars are and how calmly they shine when the rockets have gone out and the noisy wheels have done hissing and blazing when i came here tonight i did not think i should have had such a pretty little companion to sit by my side and see these fine fireworks you must know i live by myself and work very hard i write in books and newspapers fanny and i quite tired out and was expected to sit alone all night anddont cry my dear dear little girl here pen broke out rapidly putting an end to the calm oration which he had begun to deliver for the sight of a womans tears always put his nerves in a quiver and he began forthwith to coax her and soothe her and to utter a hundred and twenty little ejaculations of pity and sympathy which need not be repeated here because they would be absurd in print so would a mothers talk to a child be absurd in print so would a lovers to his bride that sweet artless poetry bears no translation and is too subtle for grammarians clumsy definitions you have but the same four letters to describe the salute which you perform on your grandmothers forehead and that which you bestow on the sacred cheek of your mistress but the same four letters and not one of them a labial do we mean to hint that r arthur pendennis made any use of the monosyllable in question not so in the first place it was dark the fireworks were over and nobody could see him secondly he was not a man to have this kind of secret and tell it thirdly and lastly let the honest fellow who has kissed a pretty girl say what would have been his own conduct in such a delicate juncture  well the truth is that however you may suspect him and whatever you would have done under the circumstances or mr pen would have liked to do he behaved honestly and like a man i will not play with this little girls heart he said within himself and forget my own or her honour she seems to have a great deal of dangerous and rather contagious sensibility and i am very glad the fireworks are over and that i can take her back to her mother come along fanny mind the steps and lean on me dont stumble you heedless little thing this is the way and there is your mamma at the door  and there indeed mrs bolton was unquiet in spirit and grasping her umbrella she seized fanny with maternal fierceness and eagerness and uttered some rapid abuse to the girl in an undertone the expression in captain costigans eyestanding behind the matron and winking at pendennis from under his hatwas i am bound to say indefinably humorous  it was so much so that pen could not refrain from bursting into a laugh you should have taken my arm mrs bolton he said offering it i am very glad to bring miss fanny back quite safe to you we thought you would have followed us up into the gallery we enjoyed the fireworks didnt we  oh yes said miss fanny with rather a demure look  and the bouquet was magnificent said pen and it is ten hours since i had anything to eat ladies and i wish you would permit me to invite you to supper  dad said costigan id loike a snack to only i forgawt me purse or i should have invoited these leedies to a collection  mrs bolton with considerable asperity said she ad an eadache and would much rather go ome  a lobster salad is the best thing in the world for a headache pen said gallantly and a glass of wine im sure will do you good come mrs bolton be kind to me and oblige me i shant have the heart to sup without you and upon my word i have had no dinner give me your arm give me the umbrella costigan im sure youll take care of miss fanny and i shall think mrs bolton angry with me unless she will favour me with her society and we will all sup quietly and go back in a cab together  the cab the lobster salad the frank and goodhumoured look of pendennis as he smilingly invited the worthy matron subdued her suspicions and her anger since he would be so obliging she thought she could take a little bit of lobster and so they all marched away to a box and costigan called for a waither with such a loud and belligerent voice as caused one of those officials instantly to run to him  the carte was examined on the wall and fanny was asked to choose her favourite dish upon which the young creature said she was fond of lobster too but also owned to a partiality for raspberry tart this delicacy was provided by pen and a bottle of the most frisky champagne was moreover ordered for the delight of the ladies little fanny drank thiswhat other sweet intoxication had she not drunk in the course of the night  when the supper which was very brisk and gay was over and captain costigan and mrs bolton had partaken of some of the rackpunch that is so fragrant at vauxhall the bill was called and discharged by pen with great generosityloike a foin young english gentleman of th olden toime be jove costigan enthusiastically remarked and as when they went out of the box he stepped forward and gave mrs bolton his arm fanny fell to pens lot and the young people walked away in high goodhumour together in the wake of their seniors  the champagne and the rackpunch though taken in moderation by all persons except perhaps poor cos who lurched ever so little in his gait had set them in high spirits and goodhumour so that fanny began to skip and move her brisk little feet in time to the band which was playing waltzes and galops for the dancers as they came up to the dancing the music and fannys feet seemed to go quicker togethershe seemed to spring as if naturally from the ground and as if she required repression to keep her there  shouldnt you like a turn said the prince of fairoaks what fun it would be mrs bolton maam do let me take her once round upon which mr costigan said off wid you and mrs bolton not refusing indeed she was an old warhorse and would have liked at the trumpets sound to have entered the arena herself fannys shawl was off her back in a minute and she and arthur were whirling round in a waltz in the midst of a great deal of queer but exceedingly joyful company  pen had no mishap this time with little fanny as he had with miss blanche in old daysat least there was no mishap of his making the pair danced away with great agility and contentmentfirst a waltz then a galop then a waltz again until in the second waltz they were bumped by another couple who had joined the terpsichorean choir this was mr huxter and his pink satin young friend of whom we have already had a glimpse  mr huxter very probably had been also partaking of supper for he was even more excited now than at the time when he had previously claimed pens acquaintance and having run against arthur and his partner and nearly knocked them down this amiable gentleman of course began to abuse the people whom he had injured and broke out into a volley of slang against the unoffending couple now then stoopid dont keep the ground if you cant dance old slow coach the young surgeon roared out using at the same time other expressions far more emphatic and was joined in his abuse by the shrill language and laughter of his partner to the interruption of the ball the terror of poor little fanny and the immense indignation of pen  arthur was furious and not so angry at the quarrel as at the shame attending it a battle with a fellow like that a row in a public garden and with a porters daughter on his arm what a position for arthur pendennis he drew poor little fanny hastily away from the dancers to her mother and wished that lady and costigan and poor fanny underground rather than there in his companionship and under his protection  when huxter commenced his attack that freespoken young gentleman had not seen who was his opponent and directly he was aware that it was arthur whom he had insulted he began to make apologies hold your stoopid tongue mary he said to his partner its an old friend and crony at home i beg pardon pendennis wasnt aware it was you old boy mr huxter had been one of the boys of the clavering school who had been present at a combat which has been mentioned in the early part of this story when young pen knocked down the biggest champion of the academy and huxter knew that it was dangerous to quarrel with arthur  his apologies were as odious to the other as his abuse had been pen stopped his tipsy remonstrance by telling him to hold his tongue and desiring him not to use his pendenniss name in that place or any other and he walked out of the gardens with a titter behind him from the crowd every one of whom he would have liked to massacre for having been witness to the degrading broil he walked out of the gardens quite forgetting poor little fanny who came trembling behind him with her mother and the stately costigan  he was brought back to himself by a word from the captain who touched him on the shoulder just as they were passing the inner gate  theres no rayadmittance except ye pay again the captain said hadnt i better go back and take the fellow your message  pen burst out laughing take him a message do you think i would fight with such a fellow as that he asked  no no dont dont cried out little fanny how can you be so wicked captain costigan the captain muttered something about honour and winked knowingly at pen but arthur said gallantly no fanny dont be frightened it was my fault to have danced in such a placei beg your padon to have asked you to dance there and he gave her his arm once more and called a cab and put his three friends into it  he was about to pay the driver and to take another carriage for himself when little fanny still alarmed put her little hand out and caught him by the coat and implored him and besought him to come in  will nothing satisfy you said pen in great goodhumour that i am not going back to fight him well i will come home with you drive to shepherds inn cab the cab drove to its destination arthur was immensely pleased by the girls solicitude about him her tender terrors quite made him forget his previous annoyance  pen put the ladies into their lodge having shaken hands kindly with both of them and the captain again whispered to him that he would see um in the morning if he was inclined and take his message to that scounthrel but the captain was in his usual condition when he made the proposal and pen was perfectly sure that neither he nor mr huxter when they awoke would remember anything about the dispute     chaptyer xlviii a visit of politeness   costigan never roused pen from his slumbers there was no hostile message from mr huxter to disturb him and when pen woke it was with a brisker and more lively feeling than ordinarily attends that moment in the day of the tired and blase london man a city man wakes up to care and consols and the thoughts of change and the countinghouse take possession of him as soon as sleep flies from under his nightcap a lawyer rouses himself with the early morning to think of the case that will take him all his day to work upon and the inevitable attorney to whom he has promised his papers ere night which of us has not his anxiety instantly present when his eyes are opened to it and to the world after his nights sleep kind strengthener that enables us to face the days task with renewed heart beautiful ordinance of providence that creates rest as it awards labour  mr pendenniss labour or rather his disposition was of that sort that his daily occupations did not much interest him for the excitement of literary composition pretty soon subsides with the hired labourer and the delight of seeing onesself in print only extends to the first two or three appearances in the magazine or newspaper page pegasus put into harness and obliged to run a stage every day is as prosaic as any other hack and wont work without his whip or his feed of corn so indeed mr arthur performed his work at the pall mall gazette and since his success as a novelist with an increased salary but without the least enthusiasm doing his best or pretty nearly and sometimes writing ill and sometimes well he was a literary hack naturally fast in pace and brilliant in action  neither did society or that portion which he saw excite or amuse him over much in spite of his brag and boast to the contrary he was too young as yet for womens society which probably can only be had in perfection when a man has ceased to think about his own person and has given up all designs of being a conqueror of ladies he was too young to be admitted as an equal amongst men who had made their mark in the world and of whose conversation he could scarcely as yet expect to be more than a listener and he was too old for the men of pleasure of his own age too much a man of pleasure for the men of business destinied in a word to be a good deal alone fate awards this lot of solitude to many a man and many like it from taste as many without difficulty bear it pendennis in reality suffered it very equanimously but in words and according to his wont grumbled over it not a little  what a nice little artless creature that was mr pen thought at the very instant of waking after the vauxhall affair what a pretty natural manner she has how much pleasanter than the minauderies of the young ladies in the ballrooms and here he recalled to himself some instances of what he could not help seeing was the artful simplicity of miss blanche and some of the stupid graces of other young ladies in the polite world who could have thought that such a pretty rose could grow in a porters lodge or bloom in that dismal old flowerpot of a shepherds inn so she learns to sing from old bows if her singing voice is as sweet as her speaking voice it must be pretty i like those low voilees voices what would you like me to call you indeed poor little fanny it went to my heart to adopt the grand air with her and tell her to call me sir but well have no nonsense of that sortno faust and margaret business for me that old bows so he teaches her to sing does he hes a dear old fellow old bows a gentleman in those old clothes a philosopher and with a kind heart too how good he was to me in the fotheringay business he too has had his griefs and his sorrows i must cultivate old bows a man ought to see people of all sorts i am getting tired of genteel society besides theres nobody in town yes ill go and see bows and costigan too what a rich character begad ill study him and put him into a book in this way our young anthropologist talked with himself and as saturday was the holiday of the week the pall mall gazette making its appearance upon that day and the contributors to that journal having no further calls upon their brains or inkbottles mr pendennis determined he would take advantage of his leisure and pay a visit to shepherds innof course to see old bows  the truth is that if arthur had been the most determined roue and artful lovelace who ever set about deceiving a young girl he could hardly have adopted better means for fascinating and overcoming poor little fanny bolton than those which he had employed on the previous night his dandified protecting air his conceit generosity and goodhumour the very sense of good and honesty which had enabled him to check the tremulous advances of the young creature and not to take advantage of that little fluttering sensibilityhis faults and his virtues at once contributed to make her admire him and if we could peep into fannys bed which she shared in a cupboard along with those two little sisters to whom we have seen mr costigan administering gingerbread and apples we should find the poor little maid tossing upon her mattress to the great disturbance of its other two occupants and thinking over all the delights and events of that delightful eventful night and all the words looks and actions of arthur its splendid hero many novels had fanny read in secret and at home in three volumes and in numbers periodical literature had not reached the height which it has attained subsequently and the girls of fannys generation were not enabled to purchase sixteen pages of excitement for a penny rich with histories of crime murder oppressed virtue and the heartless seductions of the aristocracy but she had had the benefit of the circulating library which in conjunction with her school and a small brandyball and millinery business miss minifer keptand arthur appeared to her at once as the type and realisation of all the heroes of all those darling greasy volumes which the young girl had devoured mr pen we have seen was rather a dandy about shirts and haberdashery in general fanny had looked with delight at the fineness of his linen at the brilliancy of his shirtstuds at his elegant cambric pockethandkerchief and white gloves and at the jetty brightness of his charming boots the prince had appeared and subjugated the poor little handmaid his image traversed constantly her restless slumbers the tone of his voice the blue light of his eyes the generous look half love half pitythe manly protecting smile the frank winning laughterall these were repeated in the girls fond memory she felt still his arm encircling her and saw him smiling so grand as he filled up that delicious glass of champagne and then she thought of the girls her friends who used to sneer at herof emma baker who was so proud forsooth because she was engaged to a cheesemonger in a white apron near clare market and of betsy rodgers who make such a todo about her young manan attorneys clerk indeed that went about with a bag  so that at about two oclock in the afternoonthe bolton family having concluded their dinner and mr b who besides his place of porter of the inn was in the employ of messrs tressler the eminent undertakers of the strand being absent in the country with the countess of estrichs hearse when a gentleman in a white hat and white trousers made his appearance under the inn archway and stopped at the porters wicket fanny was not in the least surprised only delightful only happy and blushing beyond all measure she knew it could be no other than he she knew hed come there he was there was his royal highness beaming upon her from the gate she called to her mother who was busy in the upper apartment mamma mamma and ran to the wicket at once and opened it pushing aside the other children how she blushed as she gave her hand to him how affably he took off his white hat as he came in the children staring up at him he asked mrs bolton if she had slept well after the fatigues of the night and hoped she had no headache and he said that as he was going that way he could not pass the door without asking news of his little partner  mrs bolton was perhaps rather shy and suspicious about these advances but mr pens goodhumour was inexhaustible he could not see that he was unwelcome he looked about the premises for a seat and none being disengaged for a dishcover was on one a workbox on the other and so forth he took one of the childrens chairs and perched himself upon that uncomfortable eminence at this the children began laughing the child fanny louder than allat least she was more amused than any of them and amazed at his royal highnesss condescension he to sit down in that chairthat little childs chairmany and many a time after she regarded it havent we almost all such furniture in our rooms that our fancy peoples with dear figures that our memory fills with sweet smiling faces which may never look on us more  so pen sate down and talked away with great volubility to mrs bolton he asked about the undertaking business and how many mutes went down with lady estrichs remains and about the inn and who lived there he seemed very much interested about mr campions cab and horse and had met that gentleman in society he thought he should like shares in the polwheedle and tredyddlum did mrs bolton do for those chambers were there any chambers to let in the inn it was better than the temple he should like to come to live in shepherds inn as for captain strong andcolonel altamontwas his name he was deeply interested in them too the captain was an old friend at home he had dined with him at chambers here before the colonel came to live with him what sort of man was the colonel wasnt he a stout man with a large quantity of jewellery and a wig and large black whiskersvery black here pen was immensely waggish and caused hysteric giggles of delight from the ladiesvery black indeed in fact blue black that is to say a rich greenish purple that was the man he had met him too at sir fr in society  oh we know said the ladies sir f is sir f clavering hes often here two or three times a week with the captain my little boy has been out for billstamps for him o lor i beg pardon i shouldnt have mentioned no secrets mrs bolton blurted out being talked perfectly into goodnature by this time but we know you to be a gentleman mr pendennis for im sure you have shown that you can beayve as such hasnt mr pendennis fanny  fanny loved her mother for that speech she cast up her dark eyes to the low ceiling and said oh that he has im sure ma with a voice full of feeling  pen was rather curious about the billstamps and concerning the transactions in strongs chambers and he asked when altamont came and joined the chevalier whether he too was out for billstamps who he was whether he saw many people and so forth these questions put with considerable adroitness by pen who was interested about sir francis claverings doings from private motives of his own were artlessly answered by mrs bolton and to the utmost of her knowledge and ability which in truth were not very great  these questions answered and pen being at a loss for more luckily recollected his privilege as a member of the press and asked the ladies whether they would like any orders for the play the play was their delight as it is almost always the delight of every theatrical person when bolton was away professionally it appeared that of late the porter of shepherds inn had taken a serious turn drank a good deal and otherwise made himself unpleasant to the ladies of his family they would like of all things to slip out and go to the theatrelittle barney their son keeping the lodge and mr pendenniss most generous and most genteel compliment of orders was received with boundless gratitude by both mother and daughter  fanny clapped her hands with pleasure her faced beamed with it she looked and nodded and laughed at har mamma who nodded and laughed in her turn mrs bolton was not superannuated for pleasure yet or by any means too old for admiration she thought and very likely mr pendennis in his conversation with her had insinuated some compliments or shaped his talk so as to please her at first against pen and suspicious of him she was his partisan now and almost as enthusiastic about him as her daughter when two women get together to like a man they help each other oneach pushes the other forwardand the second out of sheer sympathy becomes as eager as the principalat least so it is said by philosophers who have examined this science  so the offer of the playtickets and other pleasantries put all parties into perfect goodhumour except for one brief moment when one of the younger children hearing the name of astleys pronounced came forward and stated that she should like very much to go too on which fanny said dont bother rather sharply and mamma said gitlong betsyjane do now and play in the court so that the two little ones namely betsyjane and ameliarann went away in their little innocent pinafores and disported in the courtyard on the smooth gravel round about the statue of shepherd the great  and here as they were playing they very possibly communicated with an old friend of theirs and dweller in the inn for while pen was making himself agreeable to the ladies at the lodge who were laughing delighted at his sallies an old gentleman passed under the archway from the innsquare and came and looked in at the door of the lodge  he made a very blank and rueful face when he saw mr arthur seated upon a table like macheath in the play in easy discourse with mrs bolton and her daughter  what mr bows how dyou do bows cried out pen in a cheery loud voice i was coming to see you and was asking your address of these ladies  you were coming to see me were you sir bows said and came in with a sad face and shook hands with arthur plague on that old man somebody thought in the room and so perhaps some one else besides her     chapter xlix in shepherds inn   our friend pen said how dye do mr bows in a loud cheery voice on perceiving that gentleman and saluted him in a dashing offhand manner yet you could have seen a blush upon arthurs face answered by fanny whose cheek straightway threw out a similar fluttering red signal and after bows and arthur had shaken hands and the former had ironically accepted the others assertion that he was about to pay mr costigans chambers a visit there was a gloomy and rather guilty silence in the company which pen presently tried to dispel by making a great rattling noise the silence of course departed at mr arthurs noise but the gloom remained and deepened as the darkness does in a vault if you light up a single taper in it pendennis tried to describe in a jocular manner the transactions of the previous night and attempted to give an imitation of costigan vainly expostulating with the checktaker at vauxhall it was not a good imitation what stranger can imitate that perfection nobody laughed mrs bolton did not in the least understand what part mr pendennis was performing and whether it was the checktaker or the captain he was taking off fanny wore an alarmed face and tried a timid giggle old mr bows looked as glum as when he fiddled in the orchestra or played a difficult piece upon the old piano at the back kitchen pen felt that his story was a failure his voice sank and dwindled away dismally at the end of itflickered and went out and it was all dark again you could hear the ticketporter who lolls about shepherds inn as he passed on the flags under the archway the clink of his bootheels was noted by everybody  you were coming to see me sir mr bows said wont you have the kindness to walk up to my chambers with me you do them a great honour i am sure they are rather high up but  oh i live in a garret myself and shepherds inn is twice as cheerful as lamb court mr pendennis broke in  i knew that you had thirdfloor apartments mr bows said and was going to sayyou will please not take my remark as discourteousthat the air up three pair of stairs is wholesomer for gentlemen than the air of a porters lodge  sir said pen whose candle flamed up again in his wrath and who was disposed to be as quarrelsome as men are when they are in the wrong will you permit me to choose my society without  you were so polite as to say that you were about to honour my umble domicile with a visit mr bows said with his sad voice shall i show you the way mr pendennis and i are old friends mrs boltonvery old acquaintances and at the earliest dawn of his life we crossed each other  the old man pointed towards the door with a trembling finger and a hat in the other hand and in an attitude slightly theatrical so were his words when he spoke somewhat artificial and chosen from the vocabulary which he had heard all his life from the painted lips of the orators before the stagelamps but he was not acting or masquerading as pen knew very well though he was disposed to poohpooh the old fellows melodramatic airs come along sir he said as you are so very pressing mrs bolton i wish you a good day goodbye miss fanny i shall always think of our night at vauxhall with pleasure and be sure i will remember the theatre tickets and he took her hand pressed it was pressed by it and was gone  what a nice young man to be sure cried mrs bolton  dyou think so ma said fanny  i was athinkin who he was like when i was at the wells with mrs serle mrs bolton continued looking through the windowcurtain after pen as he went up the court with bows there was a young gentleman from the city that used to come in a tilbry in a white at the very image of him only his whiskers was black and mr ps is red  law ma they are a most beautiful hawburn fanny said  he used to come for emly budd who danced columbine in arleykin ornpipe or the battle of navarino when miss de la bosky was took illa pretty dancer and a fine stage figure of a womanand he was a great sugarbaker in the city with a country ouse at omerton and he used to drive her in the tilbry down goswell street road and one day they drove and was married at st bartholomews church smithfield where they ad their bands read quite private and she now keeps her carriage and i sor her name in the paper as patroness of the manshinghouse ball for the washywomens asylum and look at lady mirabelcapting costigans daughtershe was profeshnl as all very well know thus and more to this purpose mrs bolton spoke now peeping through the windowcurtain now cleaning the mugs and plates and consigning them to their place in the corner cupboard and finishing her speech as she and fanny shook out and folded up the dinnercloth between them and restored it to its drawer in the table  although costigan had once before been made pretty accurately to understand what pens pecuniary means and expectations were i suppose cos had forgotten the information acquired at chatteris years ago or had been induced by his natural enthusiasm to exaggerate his friends income he had described fairoaks park in the most glowing terms to mrs bolton on the preceding evening as he was walking about with her during pens little escapade with fanny had dilated upon the enormous wealth of pens famous uncle the major and shown an intimate acquaintance with arthurs funded and landed property very likely mrs bolton in her wisdom had speculated upon these matters during the night and had had visions of fanny driving in her carriage like mrs boltons old comrade the dancer of sadlers wells  in the last operation of tablecloth folding these two foolish women of necessity came close together and as fanny took the cloth and gave it the last fold her mother put her finger under the young girls chin and kissed her again the red signal flew out and fluttered on fannys cheek what did it mean it was not alarm this time it was pleasure which caused the poor little fanny to blush so poor little fanny what is love sin that it is so pleasant at the beginning and so bitter at the end  after the embrace mrs bolton thought proper to say that she was agoin out upon business and that fanny must keep the lodge which fanny after a very faint objection indeed consented to do so mrs bolton took her bonnet and marketbasket and departed and the instant she was gone fanny went and sae by the window which commanded bowss door and never once took her eyes away from that quarter of shepherds inn  betsyjane and ameliarann were buzzing in one corner of the place and making believe to read out of a picturebook which one of them held topsyturvy it was a grave and dreadful tract of mr boltons collection fanny did not hear her sisters prattling over it she noticed nothing but bowss door  at last she gave a little shake and her eyes lighted up he had come out he would pass the door again but her poor little countenance fell in an instant more pendennis indeed came out but bows followed after him they passed under the archway together he only took off his hat and bowed as he looked in he did not stop to speak  in three or four minutesfanny did not know how long but she looked furiously at him when he came into the lodgebows returned alone and entered into the porters room  wheres your ma dear he said to fanny  i dont know fanny said with an angry toss i dont follow mas steps wherever she goes i suppose mr bows  am i my mothers keeper bows said with his usual melancholy bitterness come here betsyjane and ameliaann ive brought a cake for the one who can read her letters best and a cake for the other who can read them the next best  when the young ladies had undergone the examination through which bows put them they were rewarded with their gingerbread medals and went off to discuss them in the court meanwhile fanny took out some work and pretended to busy herself with it her mind being in great excitement and anger as she plied her needle bows sate so that he could command the entrance from the lodge to the street but the person whom perhaps he expected to see never made his appearance again and mrs bolton came in from market and found mr bows in place of the person whom she had expected to see the reader perhaps can guess what was his name  the interview between bows and his guest when those two mounted to the apartment occupied by the former in common with the descendant of the milesian kings was not particularly satisfactory to either party pen was sulky if bows had anything on his mind he did not care to deliver himself of his thoughts in the presence of captain costigan who remained in the apartment during the whole of pens visit having quitted his bedchamber indeed but a very few minutes before the arrival of that gentleman we have witnessed the deshahille of major pendennis will any man wish to be valetdechambre to our other hero costigan it would seem that the captain before issuing from his bedroom scented himself with ottoofwhisky a rich odour of that delicious perfume breathed from out him as he held out the grasp of cordiality to his visitor the hand which performed that grasp shook wofully it was a wonder how it could hold the razor with which the poor gentleman daily operated on his chin  bowss room was as neat on the other hand as his comrades was disorderly his humble wardrobe hung behind a curtain his books and manuscript music were trimly arranged upon shelves a lithographed portrait of miss fotheringay as mrs haller with the actresss sprawling signature at the corner hung faithfully over the old gentlemans bed lady mirabel wrote much better than miss fotheringay had been able to do her ladyship had laboured assiduously to acquire the art of penmanship since her marriage and in a common note of invitation or acceptance acquitted herself very genteelly bows loved the old handwriting best though the fair artists earlier manner he had but one specimen of the new style a note in reply to a song composed and dedicated to lady mirabel by her most humble servant robert bows and which document was treasured in his desk amongst his other state papers he was teaching fanny bolton now to sing and to write as he had taught emily in former days it was the nature of the man to attach himself to something when emily was torn from him he took a substitute as a man looks out for a crutch when he loses a leg or lashes himself to a raft when he has suffered shipwreck latude had given his heart to a woman no doubt before he grew to be so fond of a mouse in the bastille there are people who in their youth have felt and inspired an heroic passion and end by being happy in the caresses or agitated by the illness of a poodle but it was hard upon bows and grating to his feelings as a man and a sentimentalist that he should find pen again upon his track and in pursuit of this little fanny  meanwhile costigan had not the least idea but that his company was perfectly welcome to messrs pendennis and bows and that the visit of the former was intended for himself he expressed himself greatly pleased with that mark of poloightness and promised in his own mind that he would repay that obligation at leastwhich was not the only debt which the captain owed in lifeby several visits to his young friend he entertained him affably with news of the day or rather of ten days previous for pen in his quality of journalist remembered to have seen some of the captains opinions in the sporting and theatrical newspaper which was costigans oracle he stated that sir charles and lady mirabel were gone to badenbaden and were most pressing in their invitations that he should join them there pen replied with great gravity that he had heard that baden was very pleasant and the grand duke exceedingly hospitable to english costigan answered that the laws of hospitalitee bekeam a grand juke that he sariously would think about visiting him and made some remarks upon the splendid festivities at dublin castle when his excellency the earl of portansherry held the viceraygal coort there and of which he costigan had been a humble but pleased spectator and penas he heard these ofttold wellremembered legendsrecollected the time when he had given a sort of credence to them and had a certain respect for the captain emily and first love and the little room at chatteris and the kind talk with bows on the bridge came back to him he felt quite kindly disposed towards his two old friends and cordially shook the hands of both of them when he rose to go away  he had quite forgotten about little fanny bolton whilst the captain was talking and pen himself was absorbed in other selfish meditations he only remembered her again as bows came hobbling down the stairs after him bent evidently upon following him out of shepherds inn  mr bowss precaution was not a lucky one the wrath of mr arthur pendennis rose at the poor old fellows feeble persecution confound him what does he mean by dogging me thought pen and he burst out laughing when he was in the strand and by himself as he thought of the elders stratagem it was not an honest laugh arthur pendennis perhaps the thought struck arthur himself and he blushed at his own sense of humour  he went off to endeavour to banish the thoughts which occupied him whatever those thoughts might be and tried various places of amusement with but indifferent success he struggled up the highest stairs of the panorama but when he had arrived panting at the height of the eminence care had come up with him and was bearing him company he went to the club and wrote a long letter home exceedingly witty and sarcastic and in which if he did not say a single word about vauxhall and fanny bolton it was because he thought that subject however interesting to himself would not be very interesting to his mother and laura nor could the novels or the library table fix his attention nor the grave and respectable jawkins the only man in town who wished to engage him in conversation nor any of the amusements which he tried after flying from jawkins he passed a comic theatre on his way home and saw stunning farce roars of laughter good old english fun and frolic placarded in vermilion letters on the gate he went into the pit and saw the lovely mrs leary as usual in a mans attire and that eminent buffo actor tom horseman dressed as a woman horsemans travesty seemed to him a horrid and hideous degradation mrs learys glances and ankles had not the least effect he laughed again and bitterly to himself as he thought of the effect which she had produced upon him on the first night of his arrival in london a short timewhat a long long time ago     chapter l or near the temple garden   fashion has long deserted the green and pretty temple garden which in shakespeare makes york and lancaster to pluck the innocent white and red roses which became the badges of their bloody wars and the learned and pleasant writer of the handbook of london tells us that the commonest and hardiest kind of rose has long ceased to put forth a bud in that smoky air not many of the present occupiers of the buildings round about the quarter know or care very likely whether or not roses grow there or pass the old gate except on their way to chambers the attorneys clerks dont carry flowers in their bags or posies under their arms as they run to the counsels chambersthe few lawyers who take constitutional walks think very little about york and lancaster especially since the railroad business is over only antiquarians and literary amateurs care to look at the gardens with much interest and fancy good sir roger de coverley and mr spectator with his short face pacing up and down the road or dear oliver goldsmith in the summerhouse perhaps meditating about the next citizen of the world or the new suit that mr filby the tailor is fashioning for him or the dunning letter that mr newbery has sent treading heavily on the gravel and rolling majestically along in a snuffcoloured suit and a wig that sadly wants the barbers powder and irons one sees the great doctor step up to him his scotch lackey following at the lexicographers heels a little the worse for port wine that they have been taking at the mitre and mr johnson asks mr goldsmith to come home and take a dish of tea with miss williams kind faith of fancy sir roger and mr spectator are as real to us now as the two doctors and the boozy and faithful scotchman the poetical figures live in our memory just as much as the real personagesand as mr arthur pendennis was of a romantic and literary turn by no means addicted to the legal pursuits common in the neighbourhood of the place we may presume that he was cherishing some such poetical reflections as these when upon the evening after the events recorded in the last chapter the young gentleman chose the temple gardens as a place for exercise and meditation  on the sunday evening the temple is commonly calm the chambers are for the most part vacant the great lawyers are giving grand dinnerparties at their houses in the belgravian or tyburnian districts the agreeable young barristers are absent attending those parties and paying their respects to mr kewsys excellent claret or mr justice ermines accomplished daughters the uninvited are partaking of the economic joint and the modest halfpint of wine at the club entertaining themselves and the rest of the company in the clubroom with circuit jokes and points of wit and law nobody is in chambers at all except poor mr cockle who is ill and whose laundress is making him gruel or mr toodle who is an amateur of the flute and whom you may hear piping solitary from his chambers in the second floor or young tiger the student from whose open windows comes a great gush of cigar smoke and at whose door are a quantity of dishes and covers bearing the insignia of dicks or the cock but stop whither does fancy lead us it is vacation time and with the exception of pendennis nobody is in chambers at all  perhaps it was solitude then which drove pen into the garden for although he had never before passed the gate and had looked rather carelessly at the pretty flowerbeds and the groups of pleased citizens sauntering over the trim lawn and the broad gravelwalks by the river on this evening it happened as we have said that the young gentleman who had dined alone at a tavern in the neighbourhood of the temple took a fancy as he was returning home to his chambers to take a little walk in the gardens and enjoy the fresh evening air and the sight of the shining thames after walking for a brief space and looking at the many peaceful and happy groups round about him he grew tired of the exercise and betook himself to one of the summerhouses which flank either end of the main walk and there modestly seated himself what were his cogitations the evening was delightfully bright and calm the sky was cloudless the chimneys on the opposite bank were not smoking the wharfs warehouses looked rosy in the sunshine and as clear as if they too had washed for the holiday the steamers rushed rapidly up and down the stream laden with holiday passengers the bells of the multitudinous city churches were ringing to evening prayerssuch peaceful sabbath evenings as this pen may have remembered in his early days as he paced with his arm round his mothers waist on the terrace before the lawn at home the sun was lighting up the little brawl too as well as the broad thames and sinking downwards majestically behind the clavering elms and the tower of the familiar village church was it thoughts of these or the sunset merely that caused the blush in the young mans face he beat time on the bench to the chorus of the bells without flicked the dust off his shining boots with his pockethandkerchief and starting up stamped with his foot and said no by jove ill go home and with this resolution which indicated that some struggle as to the propriety of remaining where he was or of quitting the garden had been going on in his mind he stepped out of the summerhouse  he nearly knocked down two little children who did not indeed reach much higher than his knee and were trotting along the gravelwalk with their long blue shadows slanting towards the east  one cried out oh the other began to laugh and with a knowing little infantile chuckle said missa pendennis and arthur looking down saw his two little friends of the day before mesdemoiselles ameliarann and betsyjane he blushed more than ever at seeing them and seizing the one whom he had nearly upset jumped her up into the air and kissed her at which sudden assault ameliarann began to cry in great alarm  this cry brought up instantly two ladies in clean collars and new ribbons and grand shawls namely mrs bolton in a rich scarlet caledonian cashmere and a black silk dress and miss f bolton with a yellow scarf and a sweet sprigged muslin and a parasolquite the lady fanny did not say one single word though her eyes flashed a welcome and shone as brightas bright as the most blazing windows in paper buildings but mrs bolton after admonishing betsyjane said lor sirhow very odd that we should meet you year i ope you ave your ealth well siraint it odd fanny that we should meet mr pendennis what do you mean by sniggering mesdames when young croesus has been staying at a countryhouse have you never by any singular coincidence been walking with your fanny in the shrubberies have you and your fanny never happened to be listening to the band of the heavies at brighton when young de boots and captain padmore came clinking down the pier have you and your darling frances never chanced to be visiting old widow wheezy at the cottage on the common when the young curate has stepped in with a tract adapted to the rheumatism do you suppose that if singular coincidences occur at the hall they dont also happen at the lodge  it was a coincidence no doubt that was all in the course of the conversation on the day previous mr pendennis had merely said in the simplest way imaginable and in reply to a question of miss bolton that although some of the courts were gloomy parts of the temple were very cheerful and agreeable especially the chambers looking on the river and around the gardens and that the gardens were a very pleasant walk on sunday evenings and frequented by a great number of peopleand here by the merest chance all our acquaintances met together just like so many people in genteel life what could be more artless goodnatured or natural  pen looked very grave pompous and dandified he was unusually smart and brilliant in his costume his white duck trousers and white hat his neckcloth of many colours his light waistcoat gold chains and shirtstuds gave him the air of a prince of the blood at least how his splendour became his figure was anybody ever like him some one thought he blushedhow his blushes became him the same individual said to herself the children on seeing him the day before had been so struck with him that after he had gone away they had been playing at him and ameliarann sticking her little chubby fingers into the armholes of her pinafore as pen was wont to do with his waistcoat had said now bessyjane ill be missa pendennis fanny had laughed till she cried and smothered her sister with kisses for that feat how happy too she was to see arthur embracing the child  if arthur was red fanny on the contrary was very worn and pale arthur remarked it and asked kindly why she looked so fatigued  i was awake all night said fanny and began to blush a little  i put out her candle and hordered her to go to sleep and leave off readin interposed the fond mother  you were reading and what was it that interested you so asked pen amused  oh its so beautiful said fanny  what  walter lorraine fanny sighed out how i do hate that neaeraneaerai dont know the pronunciation and i love leonora and walter oh how dear he is  how had fanny discovered the novel of walter lorraine and that pen was the author this little person remembered every single word which mr pendennis had spoken on the night previous and how he wrote in books and newspapers what books she was so eager to know that she had almost a mind to be civil to old bows who was suffering under her displeasure since yesterday but she determined first to make application to costigan she began by coaxing the captain and smiling upon him in her most winning way as she helped to arrange his dinner and set his humble apartment in order she was sure his linen wanted mending and indeed the captains linencloset contained some curious specimens of manufactured flax and cotton she would mend his shirtsall his shirts what horrid holeswhat funny holes she put her little face through one of them and laughed at the old warrior in the most winning manner she would have made a funny little picture looking through the holes then she daintily removed costigans dinner things tripping about the room as she had seen the dancers do at the play and she danced to the captains cupboard and produced his whiskybottle and mixed him a tumbler and must taste a drop of ita little drop and the captain must sing her one of his songs his dear songs and teach it to her and when he had sung an irish melody in his rich quavering voice fancying it was he who was fascinating the little siren she put her little question about arthur pendennis and his novel and having got an answer cared for nothing more but left the captain at the piano about to sing her another song and the dinnertray on the passage and the shirts on the chair and ran downstairs quickening her pace as she sped  captain costigan as he said was not a litherary cyarkter nor had he as yet found time to peruse his young friends ellygant perfaurumance though he intended to teak an early opporchunitee of purchasing a cawpee of his work but he knew the name of pens novel from the fact that messrs finucane bludyer and other frequenters of the back kitchen spoke of mr pendennis and not all of them with great friendship for bludyer called him a confounded coxcomb and hoolan wondered that doolan did not kick him etc by the sobriquet of walter lorraineand was hence enabled to give fanny the information which she required  and she went and ast for it at the libery mrs bolton said several liberiesand some ad it and it was bout and some adnt it and one of the liberies as ad it wouldnt let er ave it without a sovering and she adnt one and she came back acryin to medidnt you fannyand i gave her a sovering  and oh i was in such a fright lest any one should have come to the libery and took it while i was away fanny said her cheeks and eyes glowing and oh i do like it so  arthur was touched by this artless sympathy immensely flattered and moved by it do you like it he said if you will come up to my chambers i willno i will bring you oneno i will send you one good night thank you fanny god bless you i mustnt stay with you goodbye goodbye and pressing her hand once and nodding to her mother and the other children he strode out of the gardens  he quickened his pace as he went from them and ran out of the gate talking to himself dear dear little thing he saiddarling little fanny you are worth them all i wish to heaven shandon was back id go home to my mother i mustnt see her i wont i wont so help me  as he was talking thus and running the passersby turning to look at him he ran against a little old man and perceived it was mr bows  your very umble servant sir said mr bows making a sarcastic bow and lifting his old hat from his forehead  i wish you a good day arthur answered sulkily dont let me detain you or give you the trouble to follow me again i am in a hurry sir good evening  bows thought pen had some reason for hurrying to his rooms where are they exclaimed the old gentleman you know whom i mean theyre not in your rooms sir are they they told bolton they were going to church at the temple they werent there they are in your chambers they mustnt stay in your chambers mr pendennis  damn it sir cried out pendennis fiercely come and see if they are in my chambers heres the court and the doorcome in and see and bows taking off his hat and bowing first followed the young man  they were not in pens chambers as we know but when the gardens were closed the two women who had r had but a melancholy evenings amusement walked away sadly with the children and they entered into lamb court and stood under the lamppost which cheerfully ornaments the centre of that quadrangle and looked up to the third floor of the house where pendenniss chambers were and where they saw a light presently kindled then this couple of fools went away the children dragging wearily after them and returned to mr bolton who was immersed in rumandwater at his lodge in shepherds inn  mr bows looked round the blank room which the young man occupied and which had received but very few ornaments or additions since the last time we saw them warringtons old bookcase and battered library pens writingtable with its litter of papers presented an aspect cheerless enough will you like to look in the bedrooms mr bows and see if my victims are there he said bitterly or whether i have made away with the little girls and hid them in the coalhole  your word is sufficient mr pendennis the other said in his sad tone you say they are not here and i know they are not and i hope they never have been here and never will come  upon my word sir you are very good to choose my acquaintances for me arthur said in a haughty tone and to suppose that anybody would be the worse for my society i remember you and owe you kindness from old times mr bows or i should speak more angrily than i do about a very intolerable sort of persecution to which you seem inclined to subject me you followed me out of your inn yesterday as if you wanted to watch that i shouldnt steal something here pen stammered and turned red directly he had said the words he felt he had given the other an opening which bows instantly took  i do think you came to steal something as you say the words sir bows said do you mean to say that you came to pay a visit to poor old bows the fiddler or to mrs bolton at the porters lodge o fie such a fine gentleman as arthur pendennis esquire doesnt condescend to walk up to my garret or to sit in a laundresss kitchen but for reasons of his own and my belief is that you came to steal a pretty girls heart away and to ruin it and to spurn it afterwards mr arthur pendennis thats what the world makes of you young dandies you gentlemen of fashion you high and mighty aristocrats that trample upon the people its sport to you but what is it to the poor think you the toys of your pleasures whom you play with and whom you fling into the streets when you are tired i know your order sir i know your selfishness and your arrogance and your pride what does it matter to my lord that the poor mans daughter is made miserable and her family brought to shame you must have your pleasures and the people of course must pay for them what are we made for but for that its the way with you allthe way with you all sir  bows was speaking beside the question and pen had his advantage here which he was not sorry to takenot sorry to put off the debate from the point upon which his adversary had first engaged it arthur broke out with a sort of laugh for which he asked bowss pardon yes i am an aristocrat he said in a palace up three pair of stairs with a carpet nearly as handsome as yours mr bows my life is passed in grinding the people is itin ruining virgins and robbing the poor my good sir this is very well in a comedy where job thornberry slaps his breast and asks my lord how dare he trample on an honest man and poke out an englishmans fireside but in real life mr bows to a man who has to work for his bread as much as you dohow can you talk about aristocrats tyrannising over the people have i ever done you a wrong or assumed airs of superiority over you did you not have an early regard for mein days when we were both of us romantic young fellows mr bows come dont be angry with me now and let us be as good friends as we were before  those days were very different mr bows answered and mr arthur pendennis was an honest impetuous young fellow then rather selfish and conceited perhaps but honest he liked you then because you were ready to ruin yourself for a woman  and now sir arthur asked  and now times are changed and you want a woman to ruin herself for you bows answered i know this child sir ive always said this lot was hanging over her she has heated her little brain with novels until her whole thoughts are about love and lovers and she scarcely sees that she treads on a kitchen floor i have taught the little thing she is full of many talents and winning ways i grant you i am fond of the girl sir im a lonely old man i lead a life that i dont like among boon companions who make me melancholy i have but this child that i care for have pity upon me and dont take her away from me mr pendennisdont take her away  the old mans voice broke as he spoke its accents touched pen much more than the menacing or sarcastic tone which bows had commenced by adopting  indeed said he kindly you do me a wrong if you fancy i intend one to poor little fanny i never saw her till friday night it was the merest chance that our friend costigan threw her into my way i have no intentions regarding herthat is  that is you know very well that she is a foolish girl and her mother a foolish womanthat is you meet her in the temple gardens and of course without previous concertthat is that when i found her yesterday reading the book youve wrote she scorned me bows said what am i good for but to be laughed at a deformed old fellow like me an old fiddler that wears a threadbare coat and gets his bread by playing tunes at an alehouse you are a fine gentleman you are you wear scent in your handkerchief and a ring on your finger you go to dine with great people who ever gives a crust to old bows and yet i might have been as good a man as the best of you i might have been a man of genius if i had had the chance ay and have lived with the masterspirits of the land but everything hads ailed with me id ambition once and wrote plays poems musicnobody would give me a hearing i never loved a woman but she laughed at me and here i am in my old age alonealone dont take this girl from me mr pendennis i say again leave her with me a little longer she was like a child to me till yesterday why did you step in and made her to mock my deformity and old age  i am guiltless of that at least arthur said with something of a sigh upon my word of honour i wish i had never seen the girl my calling is not seduction mr bows i did not imagine that i had made an impression on poor fanny untiluntil tonight and then sir i was sorry and was flying from my temptation as you came upon me and he added with a glow upon his cheek which in the gathering darkness his companion could not see and with an audible tremor in his voice i do not mind telling you sir that on this sabbath evening as the church bells were ringing i thought of my own home and of women angelically pure and good who dwell there and i was running hither as i met you that i might avoid the danger which beset me and ask strength of god almighty to do my duty  after these words from arthur a silence ensued and when the conversation was resumed by his guest the latter spoke in a tone which was much more gentle and friendly and on taking farewell of pen bows asked leave to shake hands with him and with a very warm and affectionate greeting on both sides apologised to arthur for having mistaken him and paid him some compliments which caused the young man to squeeze his old friends hand heartily again and as they parted at pens door arthur said he had given a promise and he hoped and trusted that mr bows might rely on it  amen to that prayer said mr bows and went slowly down the stair     chapter li the happy village again   early in this history we have had occasion to speak of the little town of clavering near which pens paternal home of fairoaks stood and of some of the people who inhabite the place and as the society there was by no means amusing or pleasant our reports concerning it were not carried to any very great length mr samuel huxter the gentleman whose acquaintance we lately made at vauxhall was one of the choice spirits of the little town when he visited it during his vacation and enlivened the tables of his friends there by the wit of bartholomews and the gossip of the fashionable london circles which he frequented  mr hobnell the young gentleman whom pen had thrashed in consequence of the quarrel in the fotheringay affair was whilst a pupil at the grammar school at clavering made very welcome at the teatable of mrs huxter samuels mother and was free of the surgery where he knew the way to the tamarindpots and could scent his pockethandkerchief with rosewater and it was at this period of his life that he formed an attachment for miss sophy huxter whom on his fathers demise he married and took home to his house of the warren at a few miles from clavering  the family had possessed and cultivated an estate there for many years as yeomen and farmers mr hobnells father pulled down the old farmhouse built a flaring new whitewashed mansion with capacious stables and a piano in the drawingroom kept a pack of harriers and assumed the title of squire hobnell when he died and his son reigned in his stead the family might be fairly considered to be established as county gentry and sam huxter at london did no great wrong in boasting about his brotherinlaws place his hounds horses and hospitality to his admiring comrades at bartholomews every year at a time commonly when mrs hobnell could not leave the increasing duties of her nursery hobnell came up to london for a lark had rooms at the tavistock and he and sam indulged in the pleasures of the town together ascot the theatres vauxhall and the convivial taverns in the joyous neighbourhood of covent garden were visited by the vivacious squire in company with his learned brother when he was in london as he said he liked to do as london does and to go it a bit and when he returned to the west he took a new bonnet and shawl to mrs hobnell and relinquished for country sports and occupations during the next eleven months the elegant amusements of london life  sam huxter kept up a correspondence with his relative and supplied him with choice news of the metropolis in return for the baskets of hares partridges and clouted cream which the squire and his goodnatured wife forwarded to sam a youth more brilliant and distinguished they did not know he was the life and soul of their house when he made his appearance in his native place his songs jokes and fun kept the warren in a roar he had saved their eldest darlings life by taking a fishbone out of her throat in fine he was the delight of their circle  as illluck would have it pen again fell in with mr huxter only three days after the rencontre at vauxhall faithful to his vow he had not been to see little fanny he was trying to drive her from his mind by occupation or other mental excitement he laboured though not to much profit incessantly in his rooms and in his capacity of critic for the pall mall gazette made woful and savage onslaught on a poem and a romance which came before him for judgment these authors slain he went to dine alone at the lonely club of the polyanthus where the vast solitudes frightened him and made him only the more moody he had been to more theatres for relaxation the whole house was roaring with laughter and applause and he saw only an ignoble farce that made him sad it would have damped the spirits of the buffoon on the stage to have seen pens dismal face he hardly knew what was happening the scene and the drama passed before him like a dream or a fever then he thought he would go to the back kitchen his old haunt with warringtonhe was not a bit sleepy yet the day before he had walked twenty miles in search after rest over hampstead common and hendon lanes and had got no sleep at night he would go to the back kitchen it was a sort of comfort to him to think he should see bows bows was there very calm presiding at the old piano some tremendous comic songs were sung which made the room crack with laughter how strange they seemed to pen he could only see bows in an extinct volcano such as he boasted that his breast was it was wonderful how he should feel such a flame two days indulgence had kindled it two days abstinence had set it burning in fury so musing upon this and drinking down one glass after another as ill luck would have it arthurs eyes lighted upon mr huxter who had been to the theatre like himself and with two or three comrades now entered the room huxter whispered to his companions greatly to pens annoyance arthur felt that the other was talking about him huxter then worked through the room followed by his friends and came and took a place opposite pen nodding familiarly to him and holding him out a dirty hand to shake  pen shook hands with his fellowtownsman he thought he had been needlessly savage to him on the last night when they had met as for huxter perfectly at goodhumour with himself and the world it never entered his mind that he could be disagreeable to anybody and the little dispute or chaff as he styled it of vauxhall was a trifle which he did not in the least regard  the disciple of galen having called for four stouts with which he and his party refreshed themselves began to think what would be the most amusing topic of conversation with pen and hit upon that precise one which was most painful to our young gentleman  jolly night at vauxhallwasnt it he said and winked in a very knowing way  im glad you liked it poor pen said groaning in spirit  i was devlish cutuncommonbeen dining with some chaps at greenwich that was a pretty bit of muslin hanging on your armwho was she asked the fascinating student  the question was too much for arthur have i asked you any questions about yourself mr huxter he said  i didnt mean any offencebeg pardonhang it you cut up quite savage said pens astonished interlocutor  do you remember what took place between us the other night pen asked with gathering wrath you forget very probably you were tipsy as you observed just now and very rude  hang it sir i asked your pardon huxter said looking red  you did certainly and it was granted with all my heart i am sure but if you recollect i begged that you would have the goodness to omit me from the list of your acquaintance for the future and when we met in public that you would not take the trouble to recognise me will you please to remember this hereafter and as the song is beginning permit me to leave you to the unrestrained enjoyment of the music  he took his hat and making a bow to the amazed mr huxter left the table as huxters comrades after a pause of wonder set up such a roar of laughter at huxter as called for the intervention of the president of the room who bawled out silence gentlemen do have silence for the body snatcher which popular song began as pen left the back kitchen he flattered himself that he had commanded his temper perfectly he rather wished that huxter had been pugnacious he would have liked to fight him or somebody he went home the days work the dinner the play the whiskyandwater the quarrelnothing soothed him he slept no better than on the previous night  a few days afterwards mr sam huxter wrote home a letter to mr hobnell in the country of which mr arthur pendennis formed the principal subject sam described arthurs pursuits in london and his confounded insolence of behaviour to his old friends from home he said he was an abandoned criminal a regular don juan a fellow who when he did come into the country ought to be kept out of honest peoples houses he had seen him at vauxhall dancing with an innocent girl in the lower ranks of life of whom he was making a victim he had found out from an irish gentleman formerly in the army who frequented a club of which he huxter was member who the girl was on whom this conceited humbug was practising his infernal arts and he thought he should warn her father etc etcthe letter then touched on general news conveyed the writers thanks for the last parcel and the rabbits and hinted his extreme readiness for further favours  about once a year as we have stated there was occasion for a christening at the warren and it happened that this ceremony took place a day after hobnell had received the letter of his brotherinlaw in town the infant a darling little girl was christened myra lucretia after its two godmothers miss portman and mrs pybus of clavering and as of course hobnell had communicated sams letter to his wife mrs hobnell imparted its horrid contents to her two gossips a pretty story it was and prettily it was told throughout clavering in the course of that day  myra did notshe was too much shocked to do sospeak on the matter to her mamma but mrs pybus had no such feelings of reserve she talked over the matter not only with mrs portman but with mr and the honourable mrs simcoe with mrs glanders her daughters being to that end ordered out of the room with madame fribsby and in a word with the whole of the clavering society madame fribsby looking furtively up at her picture of the dragoon and inwards into her own wounded memory said that men would be men and as long as they were men would be deceivers and she pensively quoted some lines from marmion requesting to know where deceiving lovers should rest mrs pybus had no words of hatred horror contempt strong enough for a villain who could be capable of conduct so base this was what came of early indulgence and insolence and extravagance and aristocratic airs it is certain that pen had refused to drink tea with mrs pybus and attending the corrupt and horrid parties in the dreadful modern babylon mrs portman was afraid that she must acknowledge that the mothers fatal partiality had spoiled this boy that his literary successes had turned his head and his horrid passions had made him forget the principles which doctor portman had instilled into him in early life glanders the atrocious captain of dragoons when informed of the occurrence by mrs glanders whistled and made jocular allusions to it at dinnertime on which mrs glanders called him a brute and ordered the girls again out of the room as the horrid captain burst out laughing mr simcoe was calm under the intelligence but rather pleased than otherwise it only served to confirm the opinion which he had always had of that wretched young man not that he knew anything about himnot that he had read one line of his dangerous and poisonous works heaven forbid that he should but what could be expected from such a youth and such frightful such lamentable such deplorable want of seriousness pen formed the subject for a second sermon at the clavering chapelofease where the dangers of london and the crime of reading or writing novels were pointed out on a sunday evening to a large and warm congregation they did not wait to hear whether he was guilty or not they took his wickedness for granted and with these admirable moralists it was who should fling the stone at poor pen  the next day mrs pendennis alone and almost fainting with emotion and fatigue walked or rather ran to dr portmans house to consult the good doctor she had had an anonymous lettersome christian had thought it his or her duty to stab the good soul who had never done mortal a wrongan anonymous letter with references to scripture pointing out the doom of such sinners and a detailed account of pens crime she was in a state of terror and excitement pitiable to witness two or three hours of this pain had aged her already in her first moment of agitation she had dropped the letter and laura had read it laura blushed when she read it her whole frame trembled but it was with anger the cowards she saidit isnt trueno mother it isnt true  it is true and youve done it laura cried out helen fiercely why did you refuse him when he asked you why did you break my heart and refuse him it is you who led him into crime it is you who flung him into the arms of thisthis womandont speak to medont answer me i will never forgive you never martha bring me my bonnet and shawl ill go out i wont have you come with me go away leave me cruel girl why have you brought this shame on me and bidding her daughter and her servants keep away from her she ran down the road to clavering  doctor portman glancing over the letter thought he knew the handwriting and of course was already acquainted with the charge made against poor pen against his own conscience perhaps for the worthy doctor like most of us had a considerable natural aptitude for receiving any report unfavourable to his neighbours he strove to console helen he pointed out that the slander came from an anonymous quarter and therefore must be the work of a rascal that the charge might not be truewas not true most likelyat least that pen must be heard before he was condemned that the son of such a mother was not likely to commit such a crime etc etc  helen at once saw through his feint of objection and denial you think he has done it she saidyou know you think he has done it oh why did i ever leave him doctor portman or suffer him away from me but he cant be dishonestpray god not dishonestyou dont think that do you remember his conduct about that otherpersonhow madly he was attached to her he was an honest boy thenhe is now and i thank godyes i fall down on my knees and thank god he paid laura you said he was goodyou did yourself and nowif this woman loves himand you know they mustif he has taken her from her home or she tempted him which is most likelywhy still she must be his wife and my daughter and he must leave the dreadful world and come back to meto his mother doctor portman let us go away and bring him backyesbring him backand there shall be joy for thethe sinner that repenteth let us go now directly dear friendthis very  helen could say no more she fell back and fainted she was carried to a bed in the house of the pitying doctor and the surgeon was called to attend her she lay all night in an alarming state laura came to her or to the rectory rather for she would not see laura and doctor portman still beseeching her to be tranquil and growing bolder and more confident of arthurs innocence as he witnessed the terrible grief of the poor mother wrote a letter to pen warning him of the rumours that were against him and earnestly praying that he would break off and repent of a connexion so fatal to his best interests and his souls welfare  and laurawas her heart not wrung by the thought of arthurs crime and helens estrangement was it not a bitter blow for the innocent girl to think that at one stroke she should lose all the love which she cared for in the world     chapter lii which had very nearly been the last of the story   doctor portmans letter was sent off to its destination in london and the worthy clergyman endeavoured to soothe down mrs pendennis into some state of composure until an answer should arrive which the doctor tried to think or at any rate persisted in saying would be satisfactory as regarded the morality of mr pen at least helens wisdom of moving upon london and appearing in person to warn her son of his wickedness was impracticable for a day or two the apothecary forbade her moving even so far as fairoaks for the first day and it was not until the subsequent morning that she found herself again back on her sofa at home with the faithful though silent laura nursing at her side  unluckily for himself and all parties pen never read that homily which doctor portman addressed to him until many weeks after the epistle had been composed and day after day the widow waited for her sons reply to the charges against him her own illness increasing with every days delay it was a hard task for laura to bear the anxiety to witness her dearest friends suffering worst of all to support helens estrangement and the pain caused to her by that averted affection but it was the custom of this young lady to the utmost of her power and by means of that gracious assistance which heaven awarded to her pure and constant prayers to do her duty and as that duty was performed quite noiselesslywhile the supplications which endowed her with the requisite strength for fulfilling it also took place in her own chamber away from all mortal sightwe too must be perforce silent about these virtues of hers which no more bear public talking about than a flower will bear to bloom in a ballroom this only we will saythat a good woman is the loveliest flower that blooms under heaven and that we look with love and wonder upon its silent grace its pure fragrance its delicate bloom of beauty sweet and beautifulthe fairest and the most spotlessis it not pity to see them bowed down or devoured by grief or death inexorablewasting in diseasepining with long painor cut off by sudden fate in their prime we may deserve griefbut why should these be unhappyexcept that we know that heaven chastens those whom it loves best being pleased by repeated trials to make these pure spirits more pure  so pen never got the letter although it was duly posted and faithfully discharged by the postman into his letterbox in lamb court and thence carried by the laundress to his writingtable with the rest of his lordships correspondence into which room have we not seen a picture of him entering from his little bedroom adjoining as mrs flanagan his laundress was in the act of drinking his gin  those kind readers who have watched mr arthurs career hitherto and have made as they naturally would do observations upon the moral character and peculiarities of their acquaintance have probably discovered by this time what was the prevailing fault in mr pens disposition and who was that greatest enemy artfully indicated in the titlepage with whom he had to contend not a few of us my beloved public have the very same rascal to contend with a scoundrel who takes every opportunity of bringing us into mischief of plunging us into quarrels of leading us into idleness and unprofitable company and what not in a word pens greatest enemy was himself and as he had been pampering and coaxing and indulging that individual all his life the rogue grew insolent as all spoiled servants will be and at the slightest attempt to coerce him or make him do that which was unpleasant to him became frantically rude and unruly a person who is used to making sacrificeslaura for instance who had got such a habit of giving up her own pleasure for otherscan do the business quite easily but pen unaccustomed as he was to any sort of selfdenial suffered woundily when called on to pay his share and savagely grumbled at being obliged to forgo anything he liked  he had resolved in his mighty mind then that he would not see fanny and he wouldnt he tried to drive the thoughts of that fascinating little person out of his head by constant occupation by exercise by dissipation and society he worked then too much he walked and rode too much he ate drank and smoked too much nor could all the cigars and the punch of which he partook drive little fannys image out of his inflamed brain and at the end of a week of this discipline and selfdenial our young gentleman was in bed with a fever let the reader who has never had a fever in chambers pity the wretch who is bound to undergo that calamity  a committee of marriageable ladies or of any christian persons interested in the propagation of the domestic virtues should employ a cruikshank or a leech or some other kindly expositor of the follies of the day to make a series of designs representing the horrors of a bachelors life in chambers and leading the beholder to think of better things and a more wholesome condition what can be more uncomfortable than the bachelors lonely breakfastwith the black kettle in the dreary fire in midsummer or worse still with the fire gone out at christmas half an hour after the laundress has quitted the sittingroom into this solitude the owner enters shivering and has to commence his day by hunting for coals and wood and before he begins the work of a student has to discharge the duties of a housemaid vice mrs flanagan who is absent without leave or again what can form a finer subject for the classical designer than the bachelors shirtthat garment which he wants to assume just at dinnertime and which he finds without any buttons to fasten it then there is the bachelors return to chambers after a merry christmas holiday spent in a cosy countryhouse full of pretty faces and kind welcomes and regrets he leaves his portmanteau at the barbers in the court he lights his dismal old candle at the sputtering little lamp on the stair he enters the blank familiar room where the only tokens to greet him that show any interest in his personal welfare are the christmas bills which are lying in wait for him amiably spread out on his readingtable add to these scenes an appalling picture of bachelors illness and the rents in the temple will begin to fall from the day of the publication of the dismal diorama to be well in chambers is melancholy and lonely and selfish enough but to be ill in chambersto pass long nights of pain and watchfulnessto long for the morning and the laundressto serve yourself your own medicine by your own watchto have no other companion for long hours but your own sickening fancies and fevered thoughts no kind hand to give you drink if you are thirsty or to smooth the hot pillow that crumples under youthis indeed is a fate so dismal and tragic that we shall not enlarge upon its horrors and shall only heartily pity those bachelors in the temple who brave it every day  this lot befell arthur pendennis after the various excesses which we have mentioned and to which he had subjected his unfortunate brains one night he went to bed ill and the next day awoke worse his only visitor that day besides the laundress was the printers devil from the pall mall gazette office whom the writer endeavoured as best he could to satisfy his exertions to complete his work rendered his fever the greater he could only furnish a part of the quantity of copy usually supplied by him and shandon being absent and warrington not in london to give a help the political and editorial columns of the gazette looked very blank indeed nor did the subeditor know how to fill them  mr finucane rushed up to pens chambers and found that gentleman so exceedingly unwell that the goodnatured irishman set to work to supply his place if possible and produced a series of political and critical compositions such as no doubt greatly edified the readers of the periodical in which he and pen were concerned allusions to the greatness of ireland and the genius and virtue of the inhabitants of that injured country flowed magnificently from finucanes pen and shandon the chief of the paper who was enjoying himself placidly at boulognesurmer looking over the columns of the journal which was forwarded to him instantly recognised the hand of the great subeditor and said laughing as he flung over the paper to his wife look here mary my dear here is jack at work again indeed jack was a warm friend and a gallant partisan and when he had the pen in hand seldom let slip an opportunity of letting the world know that rafferty was the greatest painter in europe and wondering at the petty jealousy of the academy which refused to make him an ra of stating that it was generally reported at the west end that mr rooney mp was appointed governor of barataria or of introducing into the subject in hand whatever it might be a compliment to the round towers or the giants causeway and besides doing pens work for him to the best of his ability his kindhearted comrade offered to forgo his saturdays and sundays holiday and pass those days of holiday and rest as nursetender to arthur who however insisted that the other should not forgo his pleasure and thankfully assured him that he could bear best his malady alone  taking his supper at the back kitchen on the friday night after having achieved the work of the paper finucane informed captain costigan of the illness of their young friend in the temple and remembering the fact two days afterwards the captain went to lamb court and paid a visit to the invalid on sunday afternoon  he found mrs flanagan the laundress in tears in the sittingroom and got a bad report of the poor dear young gentleman within pens condition had so much alarmed her that she was obliged to have recourse to the stimulus of brandy to enable her to support the grief which his illness occasioned as she hung about his bed and endeavoured to minister to him her attentions became intolerable to the invalid and he begged her peevishly not to come near him hence the laundresss tears and redoubled grief and renewed application to the bottle which she was accustomed to use as an anodyne the captain rated the woman soundly for her intemperance and pointed out to her the fatal consequences which must ensue if she persisted in her imprudent courses  pen who was by this time in a very fevered state yet was greatly pleased to receive costigans visit he heard the ellknown voice in his sittingroom as he lay in the bedroom within and called the captain eagerly to him and thanked him for coming and begged him to take a chair and talk to him the captain felt the young mans pulse with great gravityhis own tremulous and clammy hand growing steady for the instant while his finger pressed arthurs throbbing veinthe pulse was beating very fiercelypens face was haggard and hothis eyes were bloodshot and gloomy his bird as the captain pronounced the word afterwards giving a description of his condition had not been shaved for nearly a week pen made his visitor sit down and tossing and turning in his comfortless bed began to try and talk to the captain in a lively manner about the back kitchen about vauxhall and when they should go again and about fannyhow was little fanny  indeed how was she we know how she went home very sadly on the previous sunday evening after she had seen arthur light his lamp in his chambers whilst he was having his interview with bows bows came back to his own rooms presently passing by the lodge door and looking into mrs boltons according to his wont as he passed but with a very melancholy face she had another weary night that night her restlessness wakened her little bedfellows more than once she darent read more of walter lorraine father was at home and would suffer no light she kept the book under her pillow and felt for it in the night she had only just got to sleep when the children began to stir with the morning almost as early as the birds though she was very angry with bows she went to his room at her accustomed hour in the day and there the goodhearted musician began to talk to her  i saw mr pendennis last night fanny he said  did you i thought you did fanny answered looking fiercely at the melancholy old gentleman  ive been fond of you ever since we came to live in this place he continued you were a child when i came and you used to like me fanny until three or four days ago until you saw this gentleman  and now i suppose you are going to say ill of him said fanny do mr bowsthat will make me like you better  indeed i shall do no such thing bows answered i think he is a very good and honest young man  indeed you know that if you said a word against him i would never speak a word to you againnever cried miss fanny and clenched her little hand and paced up and down the room bows noted watched and followed the ardent little creature with admiration and gloomy sympathy her cheeks flushed her frame trembled her eyes beamed love anger defiance you would like to speak ill of him she said but you darentyou know you darent  i knew him many years since bows continued when he was almost as young as you are and he had a romantic attachment for our friend the captains daughterlady mirabel that is now  fanny laughed i suppose there was other people too that had romantic attachments for miss costigan she said i dont want to hear about em  he wanted to marry her but their ages were quite disproportionate and their rank in life she would not have him because he had no money she acted very wisely in refusing him for the two would have been very unhappy and she wasnt a fit person to go and live with his family or to make his home comfortable mr pendennis has his way to make in the world and must marry a lady of his own rank a woman who loves a man will not ruin his prospects cause him to quarrel with his family and lead him into poverty and misery for her gratification an honest girl wont do that for her own sake or for the mans  fannys emotion which but now had been that of defiance and anger here turned to dismay and supplication what do i know about marrying bows she said when was there any talk of it what has there been between this young gentleman and me thats to make people speak so cruel it was not my doing nor arthursmr pendennissthat i met him at vauxhall it was the captain took me and ma there we never thought of nothing wrong im sure he came and rescued us and he was so very kind then he came to call and ask after us and very very good it was of a such grand gentleman to be so polite to humble folks like us and yesterday ma and me just went to walk in the temple gardens andandhere she broke out with that usual unanswerable female argument of tearsand cried oh i wish i was dead i wish i was laid in my grave and had never never seen him  he said as much himself fanny bows said and fanny asked through her sobs why why should he wish he had never seen her had she ever done him any harm oh she would perish rather than do him any harm whereupon the musician informed her of the conversation of the day previous showed her that pen could not and must not think of her as a wife fitting for him and that she as she valued her honest reputation must strive too to forget him and fanny leaving the musician convinced but still of the same mind and promising that she would avoid the danger which menaced her went back to the porters lodge and told her mother all she talked of her love for arthur and bewailed in her artless manner the inequality of their condition that set barriers between them theres the lady of lyons fanny said oh ma how i did love mr macready when i saw him do it and pauline for being faithful to poor claude and always thinking of him and he coming back to her an officer through all his dangers and if everybody admires paulineand im sure everybody does for being so true to a poor manwhy should a gentleman be ashamed of loving a poor girl not that mr arthur loves meoh no no i aint worthy of him only a princess is worthy of such a gentleman as him such a poetwriting so beautifully and looking so grand i am sure hes a nobleman and of ancient family and kep out of his estate perhaps his uncle has it ah if i might oh how id serve him and work for him and slave for him that i would i wouldnt ask for more than that ma just to be allowed to see him of a morning and sometimes hed say how dyou fanny or god bless you fanny as he said on sunday and id work and work and id sit up all night and read and learn and make myself worthy of him the captain says his mother lives in the country and is a grand lady there oh how i wish i might go and be her servant ma i can do plenty of things and work very neat andand sometimes hed come home and i should see him  the girls head fell on her mothers shoulder as she spoke and she gave way to a plentiful outpouring of girlish tears to which the matron of course joined her own you mustnt think no more of him fanny she said if he dont come to you hes a horrid wicked man  dont call him so mother fanny replied hes the best of men the best and the kindest bows says he thinks he is unhappy at leaving poor little fanny it wasnt his fault was it that we metand it aint his that i mustnt see him again he says i mustntand i mustnt mother hell forget me but i shall never forget him no ill pray for him and love him alwaysuntil i dieand i shall die i know i shalland then my spirit will always go and be with him  you forget your poor mother fanny and youll break my heart by goin on so mrs bolton said perhaps you will see him im sure youll see him im sure hell come today if ever i saw a man in love that man is him when emily budds young man first came about her he was sent away by old budd a most respectable man and violoncello in the orchestra at the wells and his own family wouldnt hear of it neither but he came back we all knew he would emily always said so and he married her and this one will come back too and you mark a mothers words and see if he dont dear  at this point of the conversation mr bolton entered the lodge for his evening meal at the fathers appearance the talk between mother and daughter ceased instantly mrs bolton caressed and cajoled the surly undertakers aidedecamp and said lor mr b whod have thought to see you away from the club of a saturday night fanny dear get your pa some supper what will you have b the poor gurls got a gathering in her eye or somethink in iti was lookin at it just now as you came in and she squeezed her daughters hand as a signal of prudence and secrecy and fannys tears were dried up likewise and by that wondrous hypocrisy and power of disguise which women practise and with which weapons of defence nature endows them the traces of her emotion disappeared and she went and took her work and sate in the corner so demure and quiet that the careless male parent never suspected that anything ailed her  thus as if fate seemed determined to inflame and increase the poor childs malady and passion all circumstances and all parties round about her urged it on her mother encouraged and applauded it and the very words which bows used in endeavouring to repress her flame only augmented this unlucky fever pen was not wicked and a seducer pen was highminded in wishing to avoid her pen loved her the good and the great the magnificent youth with the chains of gold and the scented auburn hair and so he did or so he would have loved her five years back perhaps before the world had hardened the ardent and reckless boybefore he was ashamed of a foolish and imprudent passion and strangled it as poor women do their illicit children not on account of the crime but of the shame and from dread that the finger of the world should point to them  what respectable person in the world will not say he was quite right to avoid a marriage with an illeducated person of low degree whose relations a gentleman could not well acknowledge and whose manners would not become her new stationand what philosopher would not tell him that the best thing to do with these little passions if they spring up is to get rid of them and let them pass over and cure them that no man dies about a woman or vice versa and that one or the other having found the impossibility of gratifying his or her desire in the particular instance must make the best of matters forget each other look out elsewhere and choose again and yet perhaps there may be something said on the other side perhaps bows was right in admiring that passion of pens blind and unreasoning as it was that made him ready to stake his all for his love perhaps if selfsacrifice is a laudable virtue mere worldly selfsacrifice is not very much to be praisedin fine let this be a reserved point to be settled by the individual moralist who chooses to debate it  so much is certain that with the experience of the world which mr pen now had he would have laughed at and scouted the idea of marrying a penniless girl out of a kitchen and this point being fixed in his mind he was but doing his duty as an honest man in crushing any unlucky fondness which he might feel towards poor little fanny  so she waited and waited in hopes that arthur would come she waited for a whole week and it was at the end of that time that the poor little creature heard from costigan of the illness under which arthur was suffering  it chanced on that very evening after costigan had visited pen that arthurs uncle the excellent major arrived in town from buxton where his health had been mended and sent his valet morgan to make inquiries for arthur and to request that gentleman to breakfast with the major the next morning the major was merely passing through london on his way to the marquis of steynes house of stillbrook where he was engaged to shoot partridges  morgan came back to his master with a very long face he had seen mr arthur mr arthur was very bad indeed mr arthur was in bed with a fever a doctor ought to be sent to him and morgan thought his case most alarming  gracious goodness this was sad news indeed he had hoped that arthur could come down to stillbrook he had arranged that he should go and procured an invitation for his nephew from lord steyne he must go himself he couldnt throw lord steyne over the fever might be catching it might be measles he had never himself had the measles they were dangerous when contracted at his age was anybody with mr arthur  morgan said there was somebody anussing of mr arthur  the major then asked had his nephew taken any advice morgan said he had asked that question and had been told that mr pendennis had had no doctor  morgans master was sincerely vexed at hearing of arthurs calamity he would have gone to him but what good could it do arthur that he the major should catch a fever his own ailments rendered it absolutely impossible that he should attend to anybody but himself but the young man must have advicethe best advice and morgan was straightway despatched with a note from major pendennis to his friend doctor goodenough who by good luck happened to be in london and at home and who quitted his dinner instantly and whose carriage was in half an hour in upper temple lane near pens chambers  the major had asked the kindhearted physician to bring him news of his nephew at the club where he himself was dining and in the course of the night the doctor made his appearance the affair was very serious the patient was in a high fever he had had pen bled instantly and would see him the first thing in the morning the major went disconsolate to bed with this unfortunate news when goodenough came to see him according to his promise the next day the doctor had to listen for a quarter of an hour to an account of the majors own maladies before the latter had leisure to hear about arthur  he had had a very bad nighthishis nurse said at one hour he had been delirious it might end badly his mother had better be sent for immediately the major wrote the letter to mrs pendennis with the greatest alacrity and at the same time with the most polite precautions as for going himself to the lad in his state it was impossible could i be of any use to him my dear doctor he asked  the doctor with a peculiar laugh said no he didnt think the major could be of any use that his own precious health required the most delicate treatment and that he had best go into the country and stay that he himself would take care to see the patient twice a day and do all in his power for him  the major declared upon his honour that if he could be of any use he would rush to pens chambers as it was morgan should go and see that everything was right the doctor must write to him by every post to stillbrook it was but forty miles distant from london and if anything happened he would come up at any sacrifice  major pendennis transacted his benevolence by deputy and by post what else could he do as he said gad you know in these cases its best not disturbing a fellow if a poor fellow goes to the bad why gad you know hes disposed of but in order to get well and in this my dear doctor im sure that you will agree with me the best way is to keep him quietperfectly quiet  thus it was the old gentleman tried to satisfy his conscience and he went his way that day to stillbrook by railway for railways have sprung up in the course of this narrative though they have not quite penetrated into pens country yet and made his appearance in his usual trim order and curly wig at the dinnertable of the marquis of steyne but we must do the major the justice to say that he was very unhappy and gloomy in demeanour wagg and wenham rallied him about his low spirits asked whether he was crossed in love and otherwise diverted themselves at his expense he lost his money at whist after dinner and actually trumped his partners highest spade and the thoughts of the suffering boy of whom he was proud and whom he loved after his manner kept the old fellow awake half through the night and made him feverish and uneasy  on the morrow he received a note in a handwriting which he did not know it was that of mr bows indeed saying that mr arthur pendennis had had a tolerable night and that as dr goodenough had stated that the major desired to be informed of his nephews health he r b had sent him the news per rail  the next day he was going out shooting about noon with some of the gentlemen staying at lord steynes house and the company waiting for the carriages were assembled on the terrace in front of the house when a fly drove up from the neighbouring station and a greyheaded rather shabby old gentleman jumped out and asked for major pendennis it was mr bows he took the major aside and spoke to him most of the gentlemen round about saw that something serious had happened from the alarmed look of the majors face  wagg said its a bailiff come down to nab the major but nobody laughed at the pleasantry  hullo whats the matter pendennis cried lord steyne with his strident voiceanything wrong  itsitsmy boy thats dead said the major and burst into a sobthe old man was quite overcome  not dead my lord but very ill when i left london mr bows said in a low voice  a britzka came up at this moment as the three men were speaking the peer looked at his watch youve twenty minutes to catch the mailtrain jump in pendennis and drive like h sir do you hear  the carriage drove off swiftly with pendennis and his companions and let us trust that the oath will be pardoned to the marquis of steyne  the major drove rapidly from the station to the temple and found a travelling carriage already before him and blocking up the narrow temple lane two ladies got out of it and were asking their way of the porters the major looked by chance at the panel of the carriage and saw the wornout crest of the eagle looking at the sun and the motto nec tenui penna painted beneath it was his brothers old carriage built many many years ago it was helen and laura that were asking their way to pens room  he ran up to them hastily clasped his sisters arm and kissed her hand and the three entered into lamb court and mounted the long gloomy stair  they knocked very gently at the door on which arthurs name was written and it was opened by fanny bolton     chapter liii a critical chapter   as fanny saw the two ladies and the anxious countenance of the eider who regarded her with a look of inscrutable alarm and terror the poor girl at once knew that pens mother was before her there was a resemblance between the widows haggard eyes and arthurs as he tossed in his bed in fever fanny looked wistfully at mrs pendennis and at laura afterwards there was no more expression in the latters face than if it had been a mass of stone hardheartedness and gloom dwelt on the figures of both the newcomers neither showed any the faintest gleam of mercy or sympathy for fanny she looked desperately from them to the major behind them old pendennis dropped his eyelids looking up ever so stealthily from under them at arthurs poor little nurse  ii wrote to you yesterday if you please maam fanny said trembling in every limb as she spoke and as pale as laura whose sad menacing face looked over mrs pendenniss shoulder  did you madam mrs pendennis said i suppose i may now relieve you from nursing my son i am his mother you understand  yes maam ithis is the way to hisoh wait a minute cried out fanny i must prepare you for his  the widow whose face had been hopelessly cruel and ruthless here started back with a gasp and a little cry which she speedily stifled  hes been so since yesterday fanny said trembling very much and with chattering teeth  a horrid shriek of laughter came out of pens room whereof the door was open and after several shouts the poor wretch began to sing a college drinkingsong and then to hurray and to shout as if he was in the midst of a wineparty and to thump with his fist against the wainscot he was quite delirious  he does not know me maam fanny said  indeed perhaps he will know his mother let me pass if you please and go in to him and the widow hastily pushed by little fanny and through the dark passage which led into pens sittingroom laura sailed by fanny too without a word and major pendennis followed them fanny sat down on a bench in the passage and cried and prayed as well as she could she would have died for him and they hated her they had not a word of thanks or kindness for her the fine ladies she sate there in the passage she did not know how long they never came out to speak to her she sate there until doctor goodenough came to pay his second visit that day he found the poor little thing at the door  what nurse hows your patient asked the goodnatured doctor has he had any rest  go and ask them theyre inside fanny answered  who his mother  fanny nodded her head and didnt speak  you must go to bed yourself my poor little maid said the doctor you will be ill too if you dont  oh maynt i come and see him maynt i come and see him iilove him so the little girl said and as she spoke she fell down on her knees and clasped hold of the doctors hand in such an agony that to see her melted the kind physicians heart and caused a mist to come over his spectacles  pooh pooh nonsense nurse has he taken his draught has he had any rest of course you must come and see him so must i  theyll let me sit here wont they sir ill never make no noise i only ask to stop here fanny said on which the doctor called her a stupid little thing put her down upon the bench where pens printers devil used to sit so many hours tapped her pale cheek with his finger and bustled into the farther room  mrs pendennis was ensconced pale and solemn in a great chair by pens bedside her watch was on the bedtable by pens medicines her bonnet and cloaks were laid in the window she had her bible in her lap without which she never travelled her first movement after seeing her son had been to take fannys shawl and bonnet which were on his drawers and bring them out and drop them down upon his studytable she had closed the door upon major pendennis and laura too and taken possession of her son  she had had a great doubt and terror lest arthur should not know her but that pang was spared to her in part at least pen knew his mother quite well and familiarly smiled and nodded at her when she came in he instantly fancied that they were at home at fairoaks and began to talk and chatter and laugh in a rambling wild way laura could hear him outside his laughter shot shafts of poison into her heart it was true then he had been guiltyand with that creaturean intrigue with a servantmaid and she had loved himand he was dying most likely raving and unrepentant the major now and then hummed out a word of remark or consolation which laura scarce heard  a dismal sitting it was for all parties and when goodenough appeared he came like an angel into the room  it is not only for the sick man it is for the sick mans friends that the doctor comes his presence is often as good for them as for the patient and they long for him yet more eagerly how we have all watched after him what an emotion the thrill of his carriagewheels in the street and at length at the door has made us feel how we hang upon his words and what a comfort we get from a smile or two if he can vouchsafe that sunshine to lighten our darkness who hasnt seen the mother prying into his face to know if there is hope for the sick infant that cannot speak and that lies yonder its little frame battling with fever ah how she looks into his eyes what thanks if there is light there what grief and pain if he casts them down and dares not say hope or it is the housefather who is stricken the terrified wife looks on while the physician feels his patients wrist smothering her agonies as the children have been called upon to stay their plays and their talk over the patient in the fever the wife expectant the children unconscious the doctor stands as if he were fate the dispenser of life and death he must let the patient off this time the woman prays so for his respite one can fancy how awful the responsibility must be to a conscientious man how cruel the feeling that he has given the wrong remedy or that it might have been possible to do better how harassing the sympathy with survivors if the case is unfortunatehow immense the delight of victory  having passed through a hasty ceremony of introduction to the newcomers of whose arrival he had been made aware by the heartbroken little nurse in waiting without the doctor proceeded to examine the patient about whose condition of high fever there could be no mistake and on whom he thought it necessary to exercise the strongest antiphlogistic remedies in his power he consoled the unfortunate mother as best he might and giving her the most comfortable assurances on which he could venture that there was no reason to despair yet that everything might still be hoped from his youth the strength of his constitution and so forth and having done his utmost to allay the horrors of the alarmed matron he took the elder pendennis aside into the vacant room warringtons bedroom for the purpose of holding a little consultation  the case was very critical the fever if not stopped might and would carry off the young fellow he must be bled forthwith the mother must be informed of this necessity why was that other young lady brought with her she was out of place in a sickroom  and there was another woman still be hanged to it the major said thethe little person who opened the door his sisterinlaw had brought the poor little devils bonnet and shawl out flung them upon the studytable did goodenough know anything about thethe little person i just caught a glimpse of her as we passed in the major said and begad she was uncommonly nicelooking the doctor looked queer the doctor smiledin the very gravest moments with life and death pending such strange contrasts and occasions of humour will arise and such smiles will pass to satirise the gloom as it were and to make it more gloomy  i have it at last he said reentering the study and he wrote a couple of notes hastily at the table there and sealed one of them then taking up poor fannys shawl and bonnet and the notes he went out in the passage to that poor little messenger and said quick nurse you must carry this to the surgeon and bid him come instantly and then go to my house and ask for my servant harbottle and tell him to get this prescription prepared and wait until iuntil it is ready it may take a little in preparation  so poor fanny trudged away with her two notes and found the apothecary who lived in the strand hard by and who came straightway his lancet in his pocket to operate on his patient and then fanny made for the doctors house in hanover square  the doctor was at home again before the prescription was made up which took harbottle his servant such a long time in compounding and during the remainder of arthurs illness poor fanny never made her appearance in the quality of nurse at his chambers any more but for that day and the next a little figure might be seen lurking about pens staircasea sad sad little face looked at and interrogated the apothecary and the apothecarys boy and the laundress and the kind physician himself as they passed out of the chambers of the sick man and on the third day the kind doctors chariot stopped at shepherds inn and the good and honest and benevolent man went into the porters lodge and tended a little patient whom he had there for the best remedy he found was on the day when he was enabled to tell fanny bolton that the crisis was over and that there was at length every hope for arthur pendennis  j costigan esquire late of her majestys service saw the doctors carriage and criticised its horses and appointments green liveries bedad the general said and as foin a pair of highstepping bee horses as ever a gentleman need sit behoind let alone a docthor theres no ind to the proide and argance of them docthors nowadaysnot but that is a good one and a scoientific cyarkter and a roight good fellow bedad and hes brought the poor little girl well troo her faver bows me boy and so pleased was mr costigan with the doctors behaviour and skill that whenever he met dr goodenoughs carriage in future he made a point of saluting it and the physician inside in as courteous and magnificent a manner as if dr goodenough had been the lord liftenant himself and captain costigan had been in his glory in phaynix park  the widows gratitude to the physician knew no boundsor scarcely any bounds at least the kind gentleman laughed at the idea of taking a fee from a literary man or the widow of a brother practitioner and she determined when she got to fairoaks that she would send goodenough the silvergilt vase the jewel of the house and the glory of the late john pendennis preserved in green baize and presented to him at bath by the lady elizabeth firebrace on the recovery of her son the late sir anthony firebrace from the scarlet fever hippocrates hygeia king bladud and a wreath of serpents surmount the cup to this day which was executed in their finest manner by messrs abednego of milsom street and the inscription was by mr birch tutor to the young baronet  this priceless gem of art the widow determined to devote to goodenough the preserver of her son and there was scarcely any other favour which her gratitude would not have conferred upon him except one which he desired most and which was that she should think a little charitably and kindly of poor fanny of whose artless sad story he had got something during his interviews with her and of whom he was induced to think very kindlynot being disposed indeed to give much credit to pen for his conduct in the affair or not knowing what that conduct had been he knew enough however to be aware that the poor infatuated little girl was without stain as yet that while she had been in pens room it was to see the last of him as she thought and that arthur was scarcely aware of her presence and that she suffered under the deepest and most pitiful grief at the idea of losing him dead or living  but on the one or two occasions when goodenough alluded to fanny the widows countenance always soft and gentle assumed an expression so cruel and inexorable that the doctor saw it was in vain to ask her for justice or pity and he broke off all entreaties and ceased making any further allusions regarding his little client there is a complaint which neither poppy nor mandragora nor all the drowsy syrups of the east could allay in the men in his time as we are informed by a popular poet of the days of elizabeth and which when exhibited in women no medical discoveries or practice subsequentneither homoeopathy nor hydropathy nor mesmerism nor dr simpson nor dr locock can cure and that iswe wont call it jealousy but rather gently denominate rivalry and emulation in ladies  some of those mischievous and prosaic people who carp and calculate at every detail of the romancer and want to know for instance how when the characters in the critic are at a dead lock with their daggers at each others throats they are to be got out of that murderous complication of circumstances may be induced to ask how it was possible in a set of chambers in the temple consisting of three rooms two cupboards a passage and a coalbox arthur a sick gentleman helen his mother laura her adopted daughter martha their country attendant mrs wheezer a nurse from st bartholomews hospital mrs flanagan an irish laundress major pendennis a retired military officer morgan his valet pidgeon mr arthur pendenniss boy and others could be accommodatedthe answer is given at once that almost everybody in the temple was out of town and that there was scarcely a single occupant of pens house in lamb court except those who were occupied round the sickbed of the sick gentleman about whose fever we have not given a lengthy account neither enlarge we very much upon the more cheerful theme of his recovery  everybody we have said was out of town and of course such a fashionable man as young mr sibwright who occupied chambers on the second floor in pens staircase could not be supposed to remain in london mrs flanagan mr pendenniss laundress was acquainted with mrs rouncy who did for mr sibwright and that gentlemans bedroom was got ready for miss bell or mrs pendennis when the latter should be inclined to leave her sons sickroom to try and seek for a little rest for herself  if that young buck and flower of baker street percy sibwright could have known who was the occupant of his bedroom how proud he would have been of that apartmentwhat poems he would have written about laura several of his things have appeared in the annuals and in manuscript in the nobilitys albumshe was a camford man and very nearly got the english prize poem it was saidsibwright however was absent and his bed given up to miss bell it was the prettiest little brass bed in the world with chintz curtains lined with pinkhe had a mignonettebox in his bedroom window and the mere sight of his little exhibition of shiny boots arranged in trim rows over his wardrobe was a gratification to the beholder he had a museum of scent pomatum and bearsgrease pots quite curious to examine too and a choice selection of portraits of females almost always in sadness and generally in disguise or deshabille glittered round the neat walls of his elegant little bower of repose medora with dishevelled hair was consoling herself over her banjo for the absence of her conradthe princesse fleur de marie of rudolstein and the mysteres de paris was sadly ogling out of the bars of her convent cage in which poor prisoned bird she was moulting awaydorothea of don quixote was washing her eternal feetin fine it was such an elegant gallery as became a gallant lover of the sex and in sibwrights sittingroom while there was quite an infantine law library clad in skins of fresh newborn calf there was a tolerably large collection of classical books which he could not read and of english and french works of poetry and fiction which he read a great deal too much his invitation cards of the past season still decorated his lookingglass and scarce anything told of the lawyer but the wigbox beside the venus upon the middle shelf of the bookcase on which the name of p sibwright esquire was gilded  with sibwright in chambers was mr bangham mr bangham was a sporting man married to a rich widow mr bangham had no practicedid not come to chambers thrice in a term went a circuit for those mysterious reasons which make men go circuitand his room served as a great convenience to sibwright when that young gentleman gave his little dinners it must be confessed that these two gentlemen have nothing to do with our history will never appear in it again probably but we cannot help glancing through their doors as they happen to be open to us and as we pass to pens rooms as in the pursuit of our own business in life through the strand at the club nay at church itself we cannot help peeping at the shops on the way or at our neighbours dinner or at the faces under the bonnets in the next pew  very many years after the circumstances about which we are at present occupied laura with a blush and a laugh showing much humour owned to having read a french novel once much in vogue and when her husband asked her wondering where on earth she could have got such a volume she owned that it was in the temple when she lived in mr percy sibwrights chambers  and also i never confessed she said on that same occasion what i must now own to that i opened the japanned box and took out that strangelooking wig inside it and put it on and looked at myself in the glass in it  suppose percy sibwright had come in at such a moment as that what would he have saidthe enraptured rogue what would have been all the pictures of disguised beauties in his room compared to that living one ah we are speaking of old times when sibwright was a bachelor and before he got a county courtwhen people were youngwhen most people were young other people are young now but we no more  when miss laura played this prank with the wig you cant suppose that pen could have been very ill upstairs otherwise though she had grown to care for him ever so little common sense of feeling and decorum would have prevented her from performing any tricks or trying any disguises  but all sorts of events had occurred in the course of the last few days which had contributed to increase or account for her gaiety and a little colony of the readers old friends and acquaintances was by this time established in lamb court temple and round pens sickbed there first martha mrs pendenniss servant had arrived from fairoaks being summoned thence by the major who justly thought her presence would be comfortable and useful to her mistress and her young master for neither of whom the constant neighbourhood of mrs flanagan who during pens illness required more spirituous consolation than ever to support her could be pleasant martha then made her appearance in due season to wait upon mr pendennis nor did that lady go once to bed until the faithful servant had reached her when with a heart full of maternal thankfulness she went and lay down upon warringtons straw mattress and among his mathematical books as has been already described  it is true that ere that day a great and delightful alteration in pens condition had taken place the fever subjugated by dr goodenoughs blisters potions and lancet had left the young man or only returned at intervals of feeble intermittence his wandering senses had settled in his weakened brain he had had time to kiss and bless his mother for coming to him and calling for laura and his uncle who were both affected according to their different natures by his wan appearance his lean shrunken hands his hollow eyes and voice his thin bearded face to press their hands and thank them affectionately and after this greeting and after they had been turned out of the room by his affectionate nurse he had sunk into a fine sleep which had lasted for about sixteen hours at the end of which period he awoke calling out that he was very hungry if it is hard to be ill and to loathe food oh how pleasant to be getting well and to be feeling hungryhow hungry alas the joys of convalescence become feebler with increasing years as other joys doand thenand then comes that illness when one does not convalesce at all  on the day of this happy event too came another arrival in lamb court this was introduced into the penwarring sittingroom by large puffs of tobacco smokethe puffs of were followed by an individual with a cigar in his mouth and a carpetbag under his armthis was warrington who had run back from norfolk when mr bows thoughtfully wrote to inform him of his friends calamity but he had been from home when bowss letter had reached his brothers housethe eastern counties did not then boast of a railway for we beg the reader to understand that we only commit anachronisms when we choose and when by a daring violation of those natural laws some great ethical truth is to be advancedin fine warrington only appeared with the rest of the good luck upon the lucky day after pens convalescence may have been said to have begun  his surprise was after all not very great when he found the chambers of his sick friend occupied and his old acquaintance the major seated demurely in an easychair warrington had let himself into the rooms with his own passkey listening or pretending to listen to a young lady who was reading to him a play of shakspeare in a low sweet voice the lady stopped and started and laid down her book at the apparition of the tall traveller with the cigar and the carpetbag he blushed he flung the cigar into the passage he took off his hat and dropped that too and going up to the major seized that old gentlemans hand and asked questions about arthur  the major answered in a tremulous though cheery voiceit was curious how emotion seemed to olden himand returning warringtons pressure with a shaking hand told him the news of arthurs happy crisis of his mothers arrivalwith her young chargewith miss  you need not tell me her name mr warrington said with great animation for he was affected and elated with the thought of his friends recoveryyou need not tell me your name i knew at once it was laura and he held out his hand and took hers immense kindness and tenderness gleamed from under his rough eyebrows and shook his voice as he gazed at her and spoke to her and this is laura his looks seemed to say and this is warrington the generous girls heart beat back arthurs herothe brave and the kindhe has come hundreds of miles to succour him when he heard of his friends misfortune  thank you mr warrington was all that laura said however and as she returned the pressure of his kind hand she blushed so that she was glad the lamp was behind her to conceal her flushing face  as these two were standing in this attitude the door of pens bedchamber was opened stealthily as his mother was wont to open it and warrington saw another lady who first looked at him and then turning round towards the bed said hsh and put up her hand  it was to pen helen was turning and giving caution he called out with a feeble tremulous but cheery voice come in stunnercome in warrington i knew it was youby theby the smoke old boy he said as holding his worn hand out and with tears at once of weakness and pleasure in his eyes he greeted his friend  ii beg pardon maam for smoking warrington said who now almost for the first time blushed for his wicked propensity  helen only said god bless you mr warrington she was so happy she would have liked to kiss george then and after the friends had had a brief very brief interview the delighted and inexorable mother giving her hand to warrington sent him out of the room too back to laura and the major who had not resumed their play of cymbeline where they had left it off at the arrival of the rightful owner of pens chambers     chapter liv convalescence   our duty now is to record a fact concerning pendennis which however shameful and disgraceful when told regarding the chief personage and godfather of a novel must nevertheless be made known to the public who reads his veritable memoirs having gone to bed ill with fever and suffering to a certain degree under the passion of love after he had gone through his physical malady and had been bled and had been blistered and had had his head shaved and had been treated and medicamented as the doctor ordainedit is a fact that when he rallied up from his bodily ailment his mental malady had likewise quitted him and he was no more in love with fanny bolton than you or i who are much too wise or too moral to allow our hearts to go gadding after porters daughters  he laughed at himself as he lay on his pillow thinking of this second cure which had been effected upon him he did not care the least about fanny now he wondered how he ever should have cared and according to his custom made an autopsy of that dead passion and anatomised his own defunct sensation for his poor little nurse what could have made him so hot and eager about her but a few weeks back not her wit not her breeding not her beautythere were hundreds of women betterlooking than she it was out of himself that the passion had gone it did not reside in her she was the same but the eyes which saw were changed and alas that it should be so were not particularly eager to see her any more he felt very well disposed towards the little thing and so forth but as for violent personal regard such as he had but a few weeks ago it had fled under the influence of the pill and lancet which had destroyed the fever in his frame and an immense source of comfort and gratitude it was to pendennis though there was something selfish in that feeling as in most others of our young man that he had been enabled to resist temptation at the time when the danger was greatest and had no particular cause of selfreproach as he remembered his conduct towards the young girl as from a precipice down which he might have fallen so from the fever from which he had recovered he reviewed the fanny bolton snare now that he had escaped out of it but im not sure that he was not ashamed of the very satisfaction which he experienced it is pleasant perhaps but it is humiliating to own that you love no more  meanwhile the kind smiles and tender watchfulness of the mother at his bedside filled the young man with peace and security to see that health was returning was all the unwearied nurse demanded to execute any caprice or order of her patients her chiefest joy and reward he felt himself environed by her love and thought himself almost as grateful for it as he had been when weak and helpless in childhood  some misty notions regarding the first part of his illness and that fanny had nursed him pen may have had but they were so dim that he could not realise them with accuracy or distinguish them from what he knew to be delusions which had occurred and were remembered during the delirium of his fever so as he had not thought proper on former occasions to make any allusions about fanny bolton to his mother of course he could not now confide to her his sentiments regarding fanny or make this worthy lady a confidante it was on both sides an unlucky precaution and want of confidence and a word or two in time might have spared the good lady and those connected with her a deal of pain and anguish  seeing miss bolton installed as nurse and tender to pen i am sorry to say mrs pendennis had put the worst construction on the fact of the intimacy of these two unlucky young persons and had settled in her own mind that the accusations against arthur were true why not have stopped to inquirethere are stories to a mans disadvantage that the women who are fondest of him are always the most eager to believe isnt a mans wife often the first to be jealous of him poor pen got a good stock of this suspicious kind of love from the nurse who was now watching over him and the kind and pure creature thought that her boy had gone through a malady much more awful and debasing than the mere physical fever and was stained by crime as well as weakened by illness the consciousness of this she had to bear perforce silently and to try to put a mask of cheerfulness and confidence over her doubt and despair and inward horror  when captain shandon at boulogne read the next number of the pall mall gazette it was to remark to mrs shandon that jack finucanes hand was no longer visible in the leading articles and that mr warrington must be at work there again i know the crack of his whip in a hundred and the cut which the fellows thong leaves theres jack bludyer goes to work like a butcher and mangles a subject mr warrington finished a man and lays his cuts neat and regular straight down the back and drawing blood every line at which dreadful metaphor mrs shandon said law charles how can you talk so i always thought mr warrington very high but a kind gentleman and im sure he was most kind to the children upon which shandon said yes hes kind to the children but hes savage to the men and to be sure my dear you dont understand a word about what im saying and its best you shouldnt for its little good comes out of writing for newspapers and its better here living easy at boulogne where the wines plenty and the brandy costs but two francs a bottle mix us another tumbler mary my dear well go back into harness soon cras ingens iterabimus aequor bad luck to it  in a word warrington went to work with all his might in place of his prostrate friend and did pens portion of the pall mall gazette with a vengeance as the saying is he wrote occasional articles and literary criticisms he attended theatres and musical performances and discoursed about them with his usual savage energy his hand was too strong for such small subjects and it pleased him to tell arthurs mother and uncle and laura that there was no hand in all the band of penmen more graceful and light more pleasant and more elegant than arthurs the people in this country maam dont understand what style is or they would see the merits of our young one he said to mrs pendennis i call him ours maam for i bred him and i am as proud of him as you are and bating a little wilfulness and a little selfishness and a little dandification i dont know a more honest or loyal or gentle creature his pen is wicked sometimes but he is as kind as a young ladyas miss laura hereand i believe he would not do any living mortal harm  at this helen though she heaved a deep deep sigh and laura though she too was sadly wounded nevertheless were most thankful for warringtons good opinion of arthur and loved him for being so attached to their pen and major pendennis was loud in his praises of mr warringtonmore loud and enthusiastic than it was the majors wont to be he is a gentleman my dear creature he said to helen every inch a gentleman my good madamthe suffolk warringtonscharles the firsts baronetswhat could he be but a gentleman come out of that familyfathersir miles warrington ran away withbeg your pardon miss bell sir miles was a very well known man in london and a friend of the prince of wales this gentleman is a man of the greatest talents the very highest accomplishmentssure to get on if he had a motive to put his energies to work  laura blushed for herself whilst the major was talking and praising arthurs hero as she looked at warringtons manly face and dark melancholy eyes this young person had been speculating about him and had settled in her mind that he must have been the victim of an unhappy attachment and as she caught herself so speculating why miss bell blushed  warrington got chambers hard bygreniers chambers in flag court and having executed pens task with great energy in the morning his delight and pleasure of an afternoon was to come and sit with the sick mans company in the sunny autumn evenings and he had the honour more than once of giving miss bell his arm for a walk in the temple gardens to take which pastime when the frank laura asked of helen permission the major eagerly said yes yes begadof course you go out with himits like the country you know everybody goes out with everybody in the gardens and there are beadles you know and that sort of thingeverybody walks in the temple gardens if the great arbiter of morals did not object why should simple helen she was glad that her girl should have such fresh air as the river could give and to see her return with heightened colour and spirits from these harmless excursions  laura and helen had come you must know to a little explanation when the news arrived of pens alarming illness laura insisted upon accompanying the terrified mother to london would not hear of the refusal which the still angry helen gave her and when refused a second time yet more sternly and when it seemed that the poor lost lads life was despaired of and when it was known that his conduct was such as to render all thoughts of union hopeless laura had with many tears told her mother a secret with which every observant person who reads this story was acquainted already now she never could marry him was she to be denied the consolation of owning how fondly how truly how entirely she had loved him the mingling tears of the woman appeased the agony of their grief somewhat and the sorrows and terrors of their journey were at least in so far mitigated that they shared them together  what could fanny expect when suddenly brought up for sentence before a couple of such judges nothing but swift condemnation awful punishment merciless dismissal women are cruel critics in cases such as that in which poor fanny was implicated and we like them to be so for besides the guard which a man places round his own harem and the defences which a woman has in her heart her faith and honour hasnt she all her own friends of her own sex to keep watch that she does not go astray and to tear her to pieces if she is found erring when our mahmouds or selims of baker street or belgrave square visit their fatimas with condign punishment their mothers sew up fatimas sack for her and her sisters and sistersinlaw see her well under water and this present writer does not say nay he protests most solemnly he is a turk too he wears a turban and a beard like another and is all for the sack practice bismillah but o you spotless who have the right of capital punishment vested in you at least be very cautious that you make away with the proper if so she may be called person be very sure of the fact before you order the barge out and dont pop your subject into the bosphorus until you are quite certain that she deserves it this is all i would urge in poor fatimas behalfabsolutely allnot a word more by the beard of the prophet if shes guilty down with herheave over the sack away with it into the golden horn bubble and squeak and justice being done give way men and let us pull back to supper  so the major did not in any way object to warringtons continued promenades with miss laura but like a benevolent old gentleman encouraged in every way the intimacy of that couple were there any exhibitions in town he was for warrington conducting her to them if warrington had proposed to take her to vauxhall itself this most complaisant of men would have seen no harmnor would helen if pendennis the elder had so ruled itnor would there have been any harm between two persons whose honour was entirely spotlessbetween warrington who saw in intimacy a pure and highminded and artless woman for the first time in his lifeand laura who too for the first time was thrown into the constant society of a gentleman of great natural parts and powers of pleasing who possessed varied acquirements enthusiasm simplicity humour and that freshness of mind which his simple life and habits gave him and which contrasted so much with pens dandy indifference of manner and faded sneer in warringtons very uncouthness there was a refinement which the others finery lacked in his energy his respect his desire to please his hearty laughter or simple confiding pathos what a difference to sultan pens yawning sovereignty and languid acceptance of homage what had made pen at home such a dandy and such a despot the women had spoiled him as we like them and as they like to do they had cloyed him with obedience and surfeited him with sweet respect and submission until he grew weary of the slaves who waited upon him and their caresses and cajoleries excited him no more abroad he was brisk and lively and eager and impassioned enoughmost men are so constituted and so nurtureddoes this like the former sentence run a chance of being misinterpreted and does any one dare to suppose that the writer would incite the women to revolt nevert by the whiskers of the prophet again he says he wears a beard and he likes his women to be slaves what man doesnt what man would be henpecked i say we will cut off all the heads in christendom or turkeydom rather than that  well then arthur being so languid and indifferent and careless about the favours bestowed upon him how came it that laura should have such a love and rapturous regard for him that a mere inadequate expression of it should have kept the girl talking all the way from fairoaks to london as she and helen travelled in the postchaise as soon as helen had finished one story about the dear fellow and narrated with a hundred sobs and ejaculations and looks up to heaven some thrilling incidents which occurred about the period when the hero was breeched laura began another equally interesting and equally ornamented with tears and told how heroically he had a tooth out or wouldnt have it out or how daringly he robbed a birds nest or how magnanimously he spared it or how he gave a shilling to the old woman on the common or went without his breadandbutter for the beggarboy who came into the yardand so on one to another the sobbing women sang laments upon their hero who my worthy reader has long since perceived is no more a hero than one of us being as he was why should a sensible girl be so fond of him  this point has been argued before in a previous unfortunate sentence which lately drew down all the wrath of ireland upon the writers head and which said that the greatest rascalcutthroats have had somebody to be fond of them and if those monsters why not ordinary mortals and with whom shall a young lady fall in love but with the person she sees she is not supposed to lose her heart in a dream like a princess in the arabian nights or to plight her young affections to the portrait of a gentleman in the exhibition or a sketch in the illustrated london news you have an instinct within you which inclines you to attach yourself to some one you meet somebody you hear somebody constantly praised you walk or ride or waltz or talk or sit in the same pew at church with somebody you meet again and again andmarriages are made in heave your dear mamma says pinning your orangeflowers wreath on with her blessed eyes dimmed with tearsand there is a wedding breakfast and you take off your white satin and retire to your coachandfour and you and he are a happy pairor the affair is broken off and then poor wounded heart why then you meet somebody else and twine your young affections round number two it is your nature so to do do you suppose it is all for the mans sake that you love and not a bit for your own do you suppose you would drink if you were not thirsty or eat if you were not hungry  so then laura liked pen because she saw scarcely anybody else at fairoaks except doctor portman and captain glanders and because his mother constantly praised her arthur and because he was gentlemanlike tolerably goodlooking and witty and because above all it was of her nature to like somebody and having once received this image into her heart she there tenderly nursed it and clasped itshe there in his long absences and her constant solitudes silently brooded over it and fondled itand when after this she came to london and had an opportunity of becoming rather intimate with mr george warrington what on earth was to prevent her from thinking him a most odd original agreeable and pleasing person  a long time afterwards when these days were over and fate in its own way had disposed of the various persons now assembled in the dingy building in lamb court perhaps some of them looked back and thought how happy the time was and how pleasant had been their evening talks and little walks and simple recreations round the sofa of pen the convalescent the major had a favourable opinion of september in london from that time forward and declared at his clubs and in society that the dead season in town was often pleasant doosid pleasant begad he used to go home to his lodgings in bury street of a night wondering that it was already so late and that the evening had passed away so quickly he made his appearance at the temple pretty constantly in the afternoon and tugged up the long black staircase with quite a benevolent activity and perseverance and he made interest with the chef at bayss that renowned cook the superintendence of whose work upon gastronomy compelled the gifted author to stay in the metropolis to prepare little jellies delicate clear soups aspics and other trifles good for invalids which morgan the valet constantly brought down to the little lamb court colony and the permission to drink a glass or two of pure sherry being accorded to pen by doctor goodenough the major told with almost tears in his eyes how his noble friend the marquis of steyne passing through london on his way to the continent had ordered any quantity of his precious his priceless amontillado that had been a present from king ferdinand to the noble marquis to be placed at the disposal of mr arthur pendennis the widow and laura tasted it with respect though they didnt in the least like the bitter flavour but the invalid was greatly invigorated by it and warrington pronounced it superlatively good and proposed the majors health in a mock speech after dinner on the first day when the wine was served and that of lord steyne and the aristocracy in general  major pendennis returned thanks with the utmost gravity and in a speech in which he used the words the present occasion at least the proper number of times pen cheered with his feeble voice from his armchair warrington taught miss laura to cry hear hear and tapped the table with his knuckles pidgeon the attendant grinned and honest doctor goodenough found the party so merrily engaged when he came in to pay his faithful gratuitous visit  warrington knew sibwright who lived below and that gallant gentleman in reply to a letter informing him of the use to which his apartment had been put wrote back the most polite and flowery letter of acquiescence he placed his chambers at the service of their fair occupants his bed at their disposal his carpets at their feet everybody was kindly disposed towards the sick man and his family his heart and his mothers too as we may fancy melted within him at the thought of so much goodfeeling and goodnature let pens biographer be pardoned for alluding to a time not far distant when a somewhat similar mishap brought him a providential friend a kind physician and a thousand proofs of a most touching and surprising kindness and sympathy  there was a piano in mr sibwrights chamber indeed this gentleman a lover of all the arts performed himselfand excellently ill tooupon the instrument and had had a song dedicated to him the words by himself the air by his devoted friend leopoldo twankidillo and at this musicbox as mr warrington called it laura at first with a great deal of tremor and blushing which became her very much played and sang sometimes of an evening simple airs and old songs of home her voice was a rich contralto and warrington who scarcely knew one tune from another and who had but one tune or bray in his repertoirea most discordant imitation of god save the kingsat rapt in delight listening to these songs he could follow their rhythm if not their harmony and he could watch with a constant and daily growing enthusiasm the pure and tender and generous creature who made the music  i wonder how that poor pale little girl in the black bonnet who used to stand at the lamppost in lamb court sometimes of an evening looking up to the open windows from which the music came liked to hear it when pens bedtime came the songs were hushed lights appeared in the upper room his room whither the widow used to conduct him and then the major and mr warrington and sometimes miss laura would have a game at ecarte or backgammon or she would sit by working a pair of slippers in worsteda pair of gentlemans slippersthey might have been for arthur or for george or for major pendennis one of those three would have given anything for the slippers  whilst such business as this was going on within a rather shabby old gentleman would come and lead away the pale girl in the black bonnet who had no right to be abroad in the night air and the temple porters the few laundresses and other amateurs who had been listening to the concert would also disappear  just before ten oclock there was another musical performance namely that of the chimes of st clements clock in the strand which played the clear cheerful notes of a psalm before it proceeded to ring its ten fatal strokes as they were ringing laura began to fold up the slippers martha from fairoaks appeared with a bedcandle and a constant smile on her face the major said god bless my soul is it so late warrington and he left their unfinished game and got up and shook hands with miss bell martha from fairoaks lighted them out of the passage and down the stair and as they descended they could hear her bolting and locking the sporting door after them upon her young mistress and herself if there had been any danger grinning martha said she would have got down that thar hooky soord which hung up in gantlemans roommeaning the damascus scimitar with the names of the prophet engraved on the blade and the red velvet scabbard which percy sibwright esquire brought back from his tour in the levant along with an albanian dress and which he wore with such elegant effect at lady mullingars fancy ball gloucester square hyde park it entangled itself in miss kewseys train who appeared in the dress in which she with her mamma had been presented to their sovereign the latter by the ld chncllrs lady and led to events which have nothing to do with this history is not miss kewsey now mrs sibwright has sibwright not got a county courtgood night laura and fairoaks martha sleep well and wake happy pure and gentle lady  sometimes after these evenings warrington would walk a little way with major pendennisjust a little way just as far as the temple gateas the strandas charing crossas the clubhe was not going into the club well as far as bury street where he would laughingly shake hands on the majors own doorstep they had been talking about laura all the way it was wonderful how enthusiastic the major who as we know used to dislike her had grown to be regarding the young ladydevlish fine girl begad devlish wellmannered girlmy sisterinlaw has the manners of a duchess and would bring up any girl well miss bells a little countryfied but the smell of the hawthorn is pleasant demmy how she blushes your london girls would give many a guinea for a bouquet like thatnatural flowers begad and shes a little money toonothing to speak ofbut a pooty little bit of money in all which opinions no doubt mr warrington agreed and though he laughed as he shook hands with the major his face fell as he left his veteran companion and he strode back to chambers and smoked pipe after pipe long into the night and wrote article upon article more and more savage in lieu of friend pen disabled  well it was a happy time for almost all parties concerned pen mended daily sleeping and eating were his constant occupations his appetite was something frightful he was ashamed of exhibiting it before laura and almost before his mother who laughed and applauded him as the roast chicken of his dinner went away he eyed the departing friend with sad longing and began to long for jelly or tea or what not he was like an ogre in devouring the doctor cried stop but pen would not nature called out to him more loudly than the doctor and that kind and friendly physician handed him over with a very good grace to the other healer  and here let us speak very tenderly and in the strictest confidence of an event which befell him and to which he never liked an allusion during his delirium the ruthless goodenough ordered ice to be put to his head and all his lovely hair to be cut it was done in the time ofof the other nurse who left every single hair of course in a paper for the widow to count and treasure up she never believed but that the girl had taken away some of it but then women are so suspicious upon these matters  when this direful loss was made visible to major pendennis as of course it was the first time the elder saw the poor young mans shorn pate and when pen was quite out of danger and gaining daily vigour the major with something like blushes and a queer wink of his eyes said he knew of aa persona coiffeur in facta good man whom he would send down to the temple and who wouldaapplyaa temporary remedy to that misfortune  laura looked at warrington with the archest sparkle in her eyeswarrington fairly burst out into a boohoo of laughter even the widow was obliged to laugh and the major erubescent confounded the impudence of the young folks and said when he had his hair cut he would keep a lock of it for miss laura  warrington voted that pen should wear a barristers wig there was sibwrights down below which would become him hugely pen said stuff and seemed as confused as his uncle and the end was that a gentleman from burlington arcade waited next day upon mr pendennis and had a private interview with him in his bedroom and a week afterwards the same individual appeared with a box under his arm and an ineffable grin of politeness on his face and announced that he had brought ome mr pendenniss ead of air  it must have been a grand but melancholy sight to see pen in the recesses of his apartment sadly contemplating his ravaged beauty and the artificial means of hiding its ruin he appeared at length in the ead of air but warrington laughed so that pen grew sulky and went back for his velvet cap a neat turban which the fondest of mammas had worked for him then mr warrington and miss bell got some flowers off the ladies bonnets and made a wreath with which they decorated the wig and brought it out in procession and did homage before it in fact they indulged in a hundred sports jularities waggeries and petits jeux innocens so that the second and third floors of number 6 lamb court temple rang with more cheerfulness and laughter than had been known in those precincts for many a long day  at last after about ten days of this life one evening when the little spy of the court came out to take her usual post of observation at the lamp there was no music from the secondfloor window there were no lights in the thirdstory chambers the windows of each were open and the occupants were gone mrs flanagan the laundress told fanny what had happened the ladies and all the party had gone to richmond for change of air the antique travelling chariot was brought out again and cushioned with many pillows for pen and his mother and miss laura went in the most affable manner in the omnibus under the guardianship of mr george warrington he came back and took possession of his old bed that night in the vacant and cheerless chambers and to his old books and his old pipes but not perhaps to his old sleep  the widow had left a jar full of flowers upon his table prettily arranged and when he entered they filled the solitary room with odour they were memorials of the kind gentle souls who had gone away and who had decorated for a little while that lonely cheerless place he had had the happiest days of his whole life george felthe knew it now they were just gone he went and took up the flowers and put his face to them and smelt themperhaps kissed them as he put them down he rubbed his rough hand across his eyes with a bitter word and laugh he would have given his whole life and soul to win that prize which arthur rejected did she want fame he would have won it for herdevotiona great heart full of pentup tenderness and manly love and gentleness was there for her if she might take it but it might not be fate had ruled otherwise even if i could she would not have me george thought what has an ugly rough old fellow like me to make any woman like him im getting old and ive made no mark in life ive neither good looks nor youth nor money nor reputation a man must be able to do something besides stare at her and offer on his knees his smooth devotion to make a woman like him what can i do lots of young fellows have passed me in the racewhat they call the prizes of life didnt seem to me worth the trouble of the struggle but for her if she had been mine and liked a diamondah shouldnt she have worn it psha what a fool i am to brag of what i would have done we are the slaves of destiny our lots are shaped for us and mine is ordained long ago come let us have a pipe and put the smell of these flowers out of court poor little silent flowers youll be dead tomorrow what business had you to show your red cheeks in this dingy place  by his bedside george found a new bible which the widow had placed there with a note inside saying that she had not seen the book amongst his collection in a room where she had spent a number of hours and where god had vouchsafed to her prayers the life of her son and that she gave to arthurs friend the best thing she could and besought him to read in the volume sometimes and to keep it as a token of a grateful mothers regard and affection poor george mournfully kissed the book as he had done the flowers and the morning found him still reading in its awful pages in which so many stricken hearts in which so many tender and faithful souls have found comfort under calamity and refuge and hope in affliction     chapter lv fannys occupations gone  good helen ever since her sons illness had taken as we have seen entire possession of the young man of his drawers and closets and all which they contained whether shirts that wanted buttons or stockings that required mending or must it be owned letters that lay amongst those articles of raiment and which of course it was necessary that somebody should answer during arthurs weakened and incapable condition perhaps mrs pendennis was laudably desirous to have some explanations about the dreadful fanny bolton mystery regarding which she had never breathed a word to her son though it was present in her mind always and occasioned her inexpressible anxiety and disquiet she had caused the brass knocker to be screwed off the inner door of the chambers where upon the postmans startling double rap would as she justly argued disturb the rest of her patient and she did not allow him to see any letter which arrived whether from bootmakers who importuned him or hatters who had a heavy account to make up against next saturday and would be very much obliged if mr arthur pendennis would have the kindness to settle etc of these documents pen who was always freehanded and careless of course had his share and though no great one one quite enough to alarm his scrupulous and conscientious mother she had some savings pens magnificent selfdenial and her own economy amounting from her great simplicity and avoidance of show to parsimony almost had enabled her to put by a little sum of money a part of which she delightedly consecrated to the paying off the young gentlemans obligations at this price many a worthy youth and respected reader would hand over his correspondence to his parents and perhaps there is no greater test of a mans regularity and easiness of conscience than his readiness to face the postman blessed is he who is made happy by the sound of the rattat the good are eager for it but the naughty tremble at the sound thereof so it was very kind of mrs pendennis doubly to spare pen the trouble of hearing or answering letters during his illness  there could have been nothing in the young mans chest of drawers and wardrobes which could be considered as inculpating him in any way nor any satisfactory documents regarding the fanny bolton affair found there for the widow had to ask her brotherinlaw if he knew anything about the odious transaction and the dreadful intrigue about which her son was engaged when they were at richmond one day and pen with warrington had taken a seat on a bench on the terrace the widow kept major pendennis in consultation and laid her terrors and perplexities before him such of them at least for as is the wont of men and women she did not make quite a clean confession and i suppose no spendthrift asked for a schedule of his debts no lady of fashion asked by her husband for her dressmakers bills ever sent in the whole of them yetsuch we say of her perplexities at least as she chose to confide to her director for the time being  when then she asked the major what course she ought to pursue about this dreadfulthis horrid affair and whether he knew anything regarding it the old gentleman puckered up his face so that you could not tell whether he was smiling or not gave the widow one queer look with his little eyes cast them down to the carpet again and said my dear good creature i dont know anything about it and i dont wish to know anything about it and as you ask me my opinion i think you had best know nothing about it too young men will be young men begad and my good maam if you think our boy is a jo  pray spare me this helen broke in looking very stately  my dear creature i did not commence the conversation permit me to say the major said bowing very blandly  i cant bear to hear such a sinsuch a dreadful sinspoken of in such a way the widow said with tears of annoyance starting from her eyes i cant bear to think that my boy should commit such a crime i wish he had died almost before he had done it i dont know how i survive it myself for it is breaking my heart major pendennis to think that his fathers sonmy childwhom i remember so goodoh so good and full of honourshould be fallen so dreadfully low as toas to  as to flirt with a little grisette my dear creature said the major egad if all the mothers in england were to break their hearts becausenay nay upon my word and honour now dont agitate yourselfdont cry i cant bear to see a womans tearsi never couldnever but how do we know that anything serious has happened has arthur said anything  his silence confirms it sobbed mrs pendennis behind her pockethandkerchief  not at all there are subjects my dear about which a young fellow cannot surely talk to his mamma insinuated the brotherinlaw  she has written to him cried the lady behind the cambric  what before he was ill nothing more likely  no since the mourner with the batiste mask gasped out not before that is i dont think sothat is i  only since and you haveyes i understand i suppose when he was too ill to read his own correspondence you took charge of it did you  i am the most unhappy mother in the world cried out the unfortunate helen  the most unhappy mother in the world because your son is a man and not a hermit have a care my dear sister if you have suppressed any letters to him you may have done yourself a great injury and if i know anything of arthurs spirit may cause a difference between him and you which youll rue all your lifea difference thats a devlish deal more important my good madam than the littlelittletrumpery cause which originated it  there was only one letter broke out helenonly a very little oneonly a few words here it isohhow can you how can you speak so  when the good soul said only a very little one the major could not speak at all so inclined was he to laugh in spite of the agonies of the poor soul before him and for whom he had a hearty pity and liking too but each was looking at the matter with his or her peculiar eyes and views of morals and the majors morals as the reader knows were not those of an ascetic  i recommend you he gravely continued if you can to seal it upthose letters aint unfrequently sealed with wafersand to put it amongst pens other letters and let him have them when he calls for them or if well cant seal it we mistook it for a bill  i cant tell my son a lie said the widow it had been put silently into the letterbox two days previous to their departure from the temple and had been brought to mrs pendennis by martha she had never seen fannys handwriting of course but when the letter was put into her hands she knew the author at once she had been on the watch for that letter every day since pen had been ill she had opened some of his other letters because she wanted to get at that one she had the horrid paper poisoning her bag at that moment she took it out and offered it to her brotherinlaw  arther pendennis esq he read in a timid little sprawling handwriting and with a sneer on his face no my dear i wont read any more but you who have read it may tell me what the letter containsonly prayers for his health in bad spelling you sayand a desire to see him welltheres no harm in that and as you ask me here the major began to look a little queer for his own part and put on his demure lookas you ask me my dear for information why i dont mind telling you thatahthatmorgan my man has made some inquiries regarding this affair and thatmy friend doctor goodenough also looked into itand it appears that this person was greatly smitten with arthur that he paid for her and took her to vauxhall gardens as morgan heard from an old acquaintance of pens and ours an irish gentleman who was very nearly once having the honour of being thefrom an irishman in factthat the girls father a violent man of intoxicated habits has beaten her mother who persists in declaring her daughters entire innocence to her husband on the one hand while on the other she told goodenough that arthur has acted like a brute to her child and so you see the story remains in a mystery will you have it cleared up i have but to ask pen and he will tell me at oncehe is as honourable a man as ever lived  honourable said the widow with bitter scorn oh brother what is this you call honour if my boy has been guilty he must marry her i would go down on my knees and pray him to do so  good god are you mad screamed out the major and remembering former passages in arthurs history and helens the truth came across his mind that were helen to make this prayer to her son he would marry the girl he was wild enough and obstinate enough to commit any folly when a woman he loved was in the case my dear sister have you lost your senses he continued after an agitated pause during which the above dreary reflection crossed him and in a softened tone what right have we to suppose that anything has passed between this girl and him lets see the letter her heart is breaking pray pray write to mehome unhappyunkind fatheryour nursepoor little fannyspelt as you say in a manner to outrage all sense of decorum but good heavens my dear what is there in this only that the little devil is making love to him still why she didnt come into his chambers until he was so delirious that he didnt know her whatdyoucallem flanagan the laundress told morgan my man so she came in company of an old fellow an old mr bows who came most kindly down to stillbrook and brought me

arthur and ask him now look at him there hes on the terrace with mr warrington they are talking to some children my boy was always fond of children hes innocent thank godthank god let me go to him  old pendennis had his own opinion when he briskly took the not guilty side of the case but a moment before very likely the old gentleman had a different view from that which he chose to advocate and judged of arthur by what he himself would have done if she goes to arthur and he speaks the truth as the rascal will it spoils all he thought and he tried one more effort  my dear good soul he said taking helens hand and kissing it as your son has not acquainted you with this affair think if you have any right to examine it as you believe him to be a man of honour what right have you to doubt his honour in this instance who is his accuser an anonymous scoundrel who has brought no specific charge against him if there were any such wouldnt the girls parents have come forward he is not called upon to rebut nor you to entertain an anonymous accusation and as for believing him guilty because a girl of that rank happened to be in his rooms acting as nurse to him begad you might as well insist upon his marrying that demd old irish gindrinking laundress mrs flanagan  the widow burst out laughing through her tearsthe victory was gained by the old general  marry mrs flanagan by ged he continued tapping her slender hand no the boy has told you nothing about it and you know nothing about it the boy is innocentof course and what my good soul is the course for us to pursue suppose he is attached to this girldont look sad again its merely a suppositionand begad a young fellow may have an attachment maynt hedirectly he gets well he will be at her again  he must come home we must go off directly to fairoaks the widow cried out  my good creature hell bore himself to death at fairoaks hell have nothing to do but to think about his passion there theres no place in the world for making a little passion into a big one and where a fellow feeds on his own thoughts like a demd lonely countryhouse where theres nothing to do we must occupy him amuse him we must take him abroad hes never been abroad except to paris for a lark we must travel a little he must have a nurse with him to take great care of him for goodenough says he had a devlish narrow squeak of it dont look frightened and so you must come and watch and i suppose youll take miss bell and i should like to ask warrington to come arthurs devlish fond of warrington he cant do without warrington warringtons family is one of the oldest in england and he is one of the best young fellows i ever met in my life i like him exceedingly  does mr warrington know anything about thisthis affair asked helen he had been away i know for two months before it happened pen wrote me so  not a wordiive asked him about it ive pumped him he never heard of the transaction never i pledge you my word cried out the major in some alarm and my dear i think you had much best not talk to him about itmuch best notof course not the subject is most delicate and painful  the simple widow took her brothers hand and pressed it thank you brother she said you have been very very kind to me you have given me a great deal of comfort ill go to my room and think of what you have said this illness and thesethese emotionshave agitated me a great deal and im not very strong you know but ill go and thank god that my boy is innocent he is innocent isnt he sir  yes my dearest creature yes said the old fellow kissing her affectionately and quite overcome by her tenderness he looked after her as she retreated with a fondness which was rendered more piquant as it were by the mixture of a certain scorn which accompanied it innocent he said id swear till i was black in the face he was innocent rather than give that good soul pain  having achieved this victory the fatigued and happy warrior laid himself down on the sofa and put his yellow silk pockethandkerchief over his face and indulged in a snug little nap of which the dreams no doubt were very pleasant as he snored with refreshing regularity the young men sate meanwhile dawdling away the sunshiny hours on the terrace very happy and pen at least very talkative he was narrating to warrington a plan for a new novel and a new tragedy warrington laughed at the idea of his writing a tragedy by jove he would show that he could and he began to spout some of the lines of his play  the little solo on the wind instrument which the major was performing was interrupted by the entrance of miss bell she had been on a visit to her old friend lady rockminster who had taken a summer villa in the neighbourhood and who hearing of arthurs illness and his mothers arrival at richmond had visited the latter and for the benefit of the former whom she didnt like had been prodigal of grapes partridges and other attentions for laura the old lady had a great fondness and longed that she should come and stay with her but laura could not leave her mother at this juncture worn out by constant watching over arthurs health helens own had suffered very considerably and doctor goodenough had had reason to prescribe for her as well as for his younger patient  old pendennis started up on the entrance of the young lady his slumbers were easily broken he made her a gallant speechhe had been full of gallantry towards her of late where had she been gathering those roses which she wore on her cheeks how happy he was to be disturbed out of his dreams by such a charming reality laura had plenty of humour and honesty and these two caused her to have on her side something very like a contempt for the old gentleman it delighted her to draw out his worldlinesses and to make the old habitue of clubs and drawingrooms tell his twaddling tales about great folks and expound his views of morals  not in this instance however was she disposed to be satirical she had been to drive with lady rockminster in the park she said and she had brought home game for pen and flowers for mamma she looked very grave about mamma she had just been with mrs pendennis helen was very much worn and she feared she was very very ill her large eyes filled with tender marks of the sympathy which she felt in her beloved friends condition she was alarmed about her could not that goodthat dear dr goodenough cure her  arthurs illness and other mental anxiety the major slowly said had no doubt shaken helen a burning blush upon the girls face showed that she understood the old mans allusion but she looked him full in the face and made no reply he might have spared me that she thought what is he aiming at in recalling that shame to me  that he had an aim in view is very possible the old diplomatist seldom spoke without some such end doctor goodenough had talked to him he said about their dear friends health and she wanted rest and change of sceneyes change of scene painful circumstances which had occurred must be forgotten and never alluded to he begged pardon for even hinting at them to miss bellhe never should do so againnor he was sure would she everything must be done to soothe and comfort their friend and his proposal was that they should go abroad for the autumn to a wateringplace in the rhine neighbourhood where helen might rally her exhausted spirits and arthur try and become a new man of course laura would not forsake her mother  of course not it was about helen and helen onlythat is about arthur too for her sake that laura was anxious she would go abroad or anywhere with helen  and helen having thought the matter over for an hour in her room had by that time grown to be as anxious for the tour as any schoolboy who has been reading a book of voyages is eager to go to sea whither should they go the farther the betterto some place so remote that even recollection could not follow them thither so delightful that pen should never want to leave itanywhere so that he could be happy she opened her desk with trembling fingers and took out her bankers book and counted up her little savings if more was wanted she had the diamond cross she would borrow from laura again let us golet us go she thought directly he can bear the journey let us go away come kind doctor goodenoughcome quick and give us leave to quit england  the good doctor drove over to dine with them that very day if you agitate yourself so he said to her and if your heart beats so and if you persist in being so anxious about a young gentleman who is getting well as fast as he can we shall have you laid up and miss laura to watch you and then it will be her turn to be ill and i should like to know how the deuce a doctor is to live who is obliged to come and attend you all for nothing mrs goodenough is already jealous of you and says with perfect justice that i fall in love with my patients and you must please to get out of the country as soon as ever you can that i may have a little peace in my family  when the plan of going abroad was proposed it was received by that gentleman with the greatest alacrity and enthusiasm he longed to be off at once he let his mustachios grow from that very moment in order i suppose that he might get his mouth into training for a perfect french and german pronunciation and he was seriously disquieted in his mind because the mustachios when they came were of a decidedly red colour he had looked forward to an autumn at fairoaks and perhaps the idea of passing two or three months there did not amuse the young man there is not a soul to speak to in the place he said to warrington i cant stand old portmans sermons and pompous afterdinner conversation i know all old glanderss stories about the peninsular war the claverings are the only christian people in the neighbourhood and they are not to be at home before christmas my uncle says besides warrington i want to get out of the country whilst you were away confound it i had a temptation from which i am very thankful to have escaped and which i count that even my illness came very luckily to put an end to and here he narrated to his friend the circumstances of the vauxhall affair with which the reader is already acquainted  warrington looked very grave when he heard this story putting the moral delinquency out of the question he was extremely glad for arthurs sake that the latter had escaped from a danger which might have made his whole life wretched which certainly said warrington would have occasioned the wretchedness and ruin of the other party and your mother andand your friendswhat a pain it would have been to them urged pens companion little knowing what grief and annoyance these good people had already suffered  not a word to my mother pen cried out in a state of great alarm she would never get over it an esclandre of that sort would kill her i do believe and he added with a knowing air and as if like a young rascal of a lovelace he had been engaged in what are called affaires de coeur all his life the best way when a danger of that sort menaces is not to face it but to turn ones back on it and run  and were you very much smitten warrington asked  hm said lovelace she dropped her hs but she was a dear little girl  o clarissas of this life o you poor little ignorant vain foolish maidens if you did but know the way in which the lovelaces speak of you if you could but hear jack talking to tom across the coffeeroom of a club or see ned taking your poor little letters out of his cigarcase and handing them over to charley and billy and harry across the messroom table you would not be so eager to write or so ready to listen theres a sort of crime which is not complete unless the lucky rogue boasts of it afterwards and the man who betrays your honour in the first place is pretty sure remember that to betray your secret too  its hard to fight and its easy to fall said warring gloomily and as you say pendennis when a danger like this is imminent the best way is to turn your back on it and run  after this little discourse upon a subject about which pen would have talked a great deal more eloquently a month back the conversation reverted to the plans for going abroad and arthur eagerly pressed his friend to be of the party warrington was a part of the familya part of the cure arthur said he should not have half the pleasure without warrington  but george said no he couldnt go he must stop at home and take pens place the other remarked that that was needless for shandon was now come back to london and arthur was entitled to a holiday  dont press me warrington said i cant go ive particular engagements im best at home ive not got the money to travel thats the long and short of itfor travelling costs money you know  this little obstacle seemed fatal to pen he mentioned it to his mother mrs pendennis was very sorry mr warrington had been exceedingly kind but she supposed he knew best about his affairs and then no doubt she reproached herself for selfishness in wishing to carry the boy off and have him to herself altogether  what is this i hear from pen my dear mr warrington the major asked one day when the pair were alone and after warringtons objection had been stated to him not go with us we cant hear of such a thingpen wont get well without you i promise you im not going to be his nurse he must have somebody with him thats stronger and gayer and better able to amuse him than a rheumatic old fogy like me i shall go to carlsbad very likely when ive seen you people settle down travelling costs nothing nowadaysor so little andand pray warrington remember that i was your fathers very old friend and if you and your brother are not on such terms as toto enable you toto anticipate your younger brothers allowance i beg you to make me your banker for hasnt pen been getting into your debt these three weeks past during which you have been doing what he informs me is his work with such exemplary talent and genius begad  still in spite of this kind offer and unheardof generosity on the part of the major george warrington refused and said he would stay at home but it was with a faltering voice and an irresolute accent which showed how much he would like to go though his tongue persisted in saying nay  but the majors persevering benevolence was not to be baulked in this way at the teatable that evening helen happening to be absent from the room for the moment looking for pen who had gone to roost old pendennis returned to the charge and rated warrington for refusing to join in their excursion isnt it ungallant miss bell he said turning to that young lady isnt it unfriendly here we have been the happiest party in the world and this odious selfish creature breaks it up  miss bells long eyelashes looked down towards her teacup and warrington blushed hugely but did not speak neither did miss bell speak but when he blushed she blushed too  you ask him to come my dear said the benevolent old gentleman and then perhaps he will listen to you  why should mr warrington listen to me asked the young lady putting the query to her teaspoon seemingly and not to the major  ask him you have not asked him said pens artless uncle  i should be very glad indeed if mr warrington would come remarked laura to the teaspoon  would you said george  she looked up and said yes their eyes met i will go anywhere you ask me or do anything said george lowly and forcing out the words as if they gave him pain  old pendennis was delighted the affectionate old creature clapped his hands and cried bravo bravo its a bargaina bargain begad shake hands on it young people and laura with a look full of tender brightness put out her hand to warrington he took hers his face indicated a strange agitation he seemed to be about to speak when from pens neighbouring room helen entered looking at them as the candle which she held lighted her pale frightened face  laura blushed more red than ever and withdrew her hand  what is it helen asked  its a bargain we have been making my dear creature said the major in his most caressing voice we have just bound over mr warrington in a promise to come abroad with us  indeed helen said     chapter lvi in which fanny engages a new medical man   could helen have suspected that with pens returning strength his unhappy partiality for little fanny would also reawaken though she never spoke a word regarding that young person after her conversation with the major and though to all appearances she utterly ignored fannys existence yet mrs pendennis kept a particularly close watch upon all master arthurs actions on the plea of illhealth would scarcely let him out of her sight and was especially anxious that he should be spared the trouble of all correspondence for the present at least very likely arthur looked at his own letters with some tremor very likely as he received them at the family table feeling his mothers watch upon him though the good souls eye seemed fixed upon her teacup or her book he expected daily to see a little handwriting which he would have known though he had never seen it yet and his heart beat as he received the letters to his address was he more pleased or annoyed that day after day his expectations were not realised and was his mind relieved that there came no letter from fanny though no doubt in these matters when lovelace is tired of clarissa or the contrary it is best for both parties to break at once and each after the failure of the attempt at union to go his own way and pursue his course through life solitary yet our selflove or our pity or our sense of decency does not like that sudden bankruptcy before we announce to the world that our firm of lovelace and co cant meet its engagements we try to make compromises we have mournful meetings of partners we delay the putting up of the shutters and the dreary announcement of the failure it must come but we pawn our jewels to keep things going a little longer on the whole i dare say pen was rather annoyed that he had no remonstrances from fanny what could she part from him and never so much as once look round could she sink and never once hold a little hand out or cry help arthur well well they dont all go down who venture on that voyage some few drown when the vessel founders but most are only ducked and scramble to shore and the readers experience of a pendennis esquire of the upper temple will enable him to state whether that gentleman belonged to the class of persons who were likely to sink or to swim  though pen was as yet too weak to walk half a mile and might not on account of his precious health be trusted to take a drive in a carriage by himself and without a nurse in attendance yet helen could not keep watch over mr warrington too and had no authority to prevent that gentleman from going to london if business called him thither indeed if he had gone and stayed perhaps the widow from reasons of her own would have been glad but she checked these selfish wishes as soon as she ascertained or owned them and remembering warringtons great regard and services and constant friendship for her boy received him as a member of her family almost with her usual melancholy kindness and submissive acquiescence yet somehow one morning when his affairs called him to town she divined what warringtons errand was and that he was gone to london to get news about fanny for pen  indeed arthur had had some talk with his friend and told him more at large what his adventures had been with fanny adventures which the reader knows already and what were his feelings respecting her he was very thankful that he had escaped the great danger to which warrington said amen heartily that he had no great fault wherewith to reproach himself in regard of his behaviour to her but that if they parted as they must he would be glad to say a god bless her and to hope that she would remember him kindly in his discourse with warrington he spoke upon these matters with so much gravity and so much emotion that george who had pronounced himself most strongly for the separation too began to fear that his friend was not so well cured as he boasted of being and that if the two were to come together again all the danger and the temptation might have to be fought once more and with what result it is hard to struggle arthur and it is easy to fall warrington said and the best courage for us poor wretches is to fly from danger i would not have been what i am now had i practised what i preach  and what did you practise george pen asked eagerly i knew there was something tell us about it warrington  there was something that cant be mended and that shattered my whole fortunes early warrington answered i said i would tell you about it some day pen and will but not now take the moral without the fable now pen my boy and if you want to see a man whose whole life has been wrecked by an unlucky rock against which he struck as a boyhere he is arthur and so i warn you  we have shown how mr huxter in writing home to his clavering friends mentioned that there was a fashionable club in london of which he was an attendant and that he was there in the habit of meeting an irish officer of distinction who amongst other news had given that intelligence regarding pendennis which the young surgeon had transmitted to clavering this club was no other than the back kitchen where the disciple of saint bartholomew was accustomed to meet the general the peculiarities of whose brogue appearance disposition and general conversation greatly diverted many young gentlemen who used the back kitchen as a place of nightly entertainment and refreshment huxter who had a fine natural genius for mimicking everything whether it was a favourite tragic or comic actor or a cock on a dunghill a corkscrew going into a bottle and a cork issuing thence or an irish officer of genteel connexions who offered himself as an object of imitation with only too much readiness talked his talk and twanged his poor old long bow whenever drink a hearer and an opportunity occurred studied our friend the general with peculiar gusto and drew the honest fellow out many a night a bait consisting of sixpennyworth of brandyandwater the worthy old man was sure to swallow and under the influence of this liquor who was more happy than he to tell his stories of his daughters triumphs and his own in love war drink and polite society thus huxter was enabled to present to his friends many pictures of costigan of costigan fighting a jewel in the phaynixof costigan and his interview with the juke of yorkof costigan at his sonunlaws teeble surrounded by the nobilitee of his countreeof costigan when crying drunk at which time he was in the habit of confidentially lamenting his daughters ingratichewd and stating that his grey hairs were hastening to a praymachure greeve and thus our friend was the means of bringing a number of young fellows to the back kitchen who consumed the landlords liquors whilst they relished the generals peculiarities so that mine host pardoned many of the latters foibles in consideration of the good which they brought to his house not the highest position in life was thiscertainly or one which if we had a reverence for an old man we would be anxious that he should occupy but of this aged buffoon it may be mentioned that he had no particular idea that his condition of life was not a high one and that in his whiskied blood there was not a black drop nor in his muddled brains a bitter feeling against any mortal being even his child his cruel emily he would have taken to his heart and forgiven with tears and what more can one say of the christian charity of a man than that he is actually ready to forgive those who have done him every kindness and with whom he is wrong in a dispute  there was some idea amongst the young men who frequented the back kitchen and made themselves merry with the society of captain costigan that the captain made a mystery regarding his lodgings for fear of duns or from a desire of privacy and lived in some wonderful place nor would the landlord of the premises when questioned upon this subject answer any inquiries his maxim being that he only knew gentlemen who frequented that room in that room that when they quitted that room having paid their scores as gentlemen and behaved as gentlemen his communication with them ceased and that as a gentleman himself he thought it was only impertinent curiosity to ask where any other gentleman lived costigan in his most intoxicated and confidential moments also evaded any replies to questions or hints addressed to him on this subject there was no particular secret about it as we have seen who have had more than once the honour of entering his apartments but in the vicissitudes of a long life he had been pretty often in the habit of residing in houses where privacy was necessary to his comfort and where the appearance of some visitors would have brought him anything but pleasure hence all sorts of legends were formed by wags or credulous persons respecting his place of abode it was stated that he slept habitually in a watchbox in the city in a cab at a mews where a cabproprietor gave him a shelter in the duke of yorks column etc the wildest of these theories being put abroad by the facetious and imaginative huxter for huxey when not silenced by the company of swells and when in the society of his own friends was a very different fellow to the youth whom we have seen cowed by pens impertinent airs and adored by his family at home was the life and soul of the circle whom he met either round the festive board or the dissecting table on one brilliant september morning as huxter was regaling himself with a cup of coffee at a stall in covent garden having spent a delicious night dancing at vauxhall he spied the general reeling down henrietta street with a crowd of hooting blackguard boys at his heels who had left their beds under the arches of the river betimes and were prowling about already for breakfast and the strange livelihood of the day the poor old general was not in that condition when the sneers and jokes of these young beggars had much effect upon him the cabmen and watermen at the cabstand knew him and passed their comments upon him the policemen gazed after him and warned the boys off him with looks of scorn and pity what did the scorn and pity of men the jokes of ribald children matter to the general he reeled along the street with glazed eyes having just sense enough to know whither he was bound and to pursue his accustomed beat homewards he went to bed not knowing how he had reached it as often as any man in london he woke and found himself there and asked no questions and he was tacking about on this daily though perilous voyage when from his station at the coffeestall huxter spied him to note his friend to pay his twopence indeed he had but eightpence left or he would have had a cab from vauxhall to take him home was with the eager huxter the work of an instantcostigan dived down the alleys by drury lane theatre where ginshops oystershops and theatrical wardrobes abound the proprietors of which were now asleep behind their shutters as the pink morning lighted up their chimneys and through these courts huxter followed the general until he reached oldcastle street in which is the gate of shepherds inn  here just as he was within sight of home a luckless slice of orangepeel came between the generals heel and the pavement and caused the poor old fellow to fall backwards  huxter ran up to him instantly and after a pause during which the veteran giddy with his fall and his previous whisky gathered as he best might his dizzy brains together the young surgeon lifted up the limping general and very kindly and goodnaturedly offered to conduct him to his home for some time and in reply to the queries which the student of medicine put to him the muzzy general refused to say where his lodgings were and declared that they were hard by and that he could reach them without difficulty and he disengaged himself from huxters arm and made a rush as if to get to his own home unattended but he reeled and lurched so that the young surgeon insisted upon accompanying him and with many soothing expressions and cheering and consolatory phrases succeeded in getting the generals dirty old hand under what he called his own fin and led the old fellow moaning piteously across the street he stopped when he came to the ancient gate ornamented with the armorial bearings of the venerable shepherd here tis said he drawing up at the portal and he made a successful pull at the gate bell which presently brought out old mr bolton the porter scowling fiercely and grumbling as he was used to do every morning when it became his turn to let in that early bird  costigan tried to hold bolton for a moment in genteel conversation but the other surlily would not dont bother me said he go to your hown bed capting and dont keep honest men out of theirs so the captain tacked across the square and reached his own staircase up which he stumbled with the worthy huxter at his heels costigan had a key of his own which huxter inserted into the keyhole for him so that there was no need to call up little mr bows from the sleep into which the old musician had not long since fallen and huxter having aided to disrobe his tipsy patient and ascertained that no bones were broken helped him to bed and applied compresses an water to one of his knees and shins which with the pair of trousers which encased them costigan had severely torn in his fall at the generals age and with his habit of body such wounds as he had inflicted on himself are slow to heal a good deal of inflammation ensued and the old fellow lay ill for some days suffering both pain and fever  mr huxter undertook the case of his interesting patient with great confidence and alacrity and conducted it with becoming skill he visited his friend day after day and consoled him with lively rattle and conversation for the absence of the society which costigan needed and of which he was an ornament and he gave special instructions to the invalids nurse about the quantity of whisky which the patient was to takeinstructions which as the poor old fellow could not for many days get out of his bed or sofa himself he could not by any means infringe bows mrs bolton and our little friend fanny when able to do so officiated at the generals bedside and the old warrior was made as comfortable as possible under his calamity  thus huxter whose affable manners and social turn made him quickly intimate with persons in whose society he fell and whose overrefinement did not lead them to repulse the familiarities of this young gentleman became pretty soon intimate in shepherds inn both with our acquaintances in the garrets and those in the porters lodge he thought he had seen fanny somewhere he felt certain that he had but it is no wonder that he should not accurately remember her for the poor little thing never chose to tell him where she had met him he himself had seen her at a period when his own views both of persons and of right and wrong were clouded by the excitement of drinking and dancing and also little fanny was very much changed and worn by the fever and agitation and passion and despair which the past three weeks had poured upon the head of that little victim borne down was the head now and very pale and wan the face and many and many a time the sad eyes had looked into the postmans as he came to the inn and the sickened heart had sunk as he passed away when mr costigans accident occurred fanny was rather glad to have an opportunity of being useful and doing something kindsomething that would make her forget her own little sorrows perhaps she felt she bore them better whilst she did her duty though i dare say many a tear dropped into the old irishmans gruel ah me stir the gruel well and have courage little fanny if everybody who has suffered from your complaint were to die of it straightway what a fine year the undertakers would have  whether from compassion for his only patient or delight in his society mr huxter found now occasion to visit costigan two or three times in the day at least and if any of the members of the porters lodge family were not in attendance on the general the young doctor was sure to have some particular directions to address to those at their own place of habitation he was a kind fellow he made or purchased toys for the children he brought them apples and brandyballs he brought a mask and frightened them with it and caused a smile upon the face of pale fanny he called mrs bolton mrs b and was very intimate familiar and facetious with that lady quite different from that aughty artless beast as mrs bolton now denominated a certain young gentleman of our acquaintance and whom she now vowed she never could abear  it was from this lady who was very free in her conversation that huxter presently learnt what was the illness which was evidently preying upon little fan and what had been pens behaviour regarding her mrs boltons account of the transaction was not it may be imagined entirely an impartial narrative one would have thought from her story that the young gentleman had employed a course of the most persevering and flagitious artifices to win the girls heart had broken the most solemn promises made to her and was a wretch to be hated and chastised by every champion of woman huxter in his present frame of mind respecting arthur and suffering under the latters contumely was ready of course to take all for granted that was said in the disfavour of this unfortunate convalescent but why did he not write home to clavering as he had done previously giving an account of pens misconduct and of the particulars regarding it which had now come to his knowledge he soon in a letter to his brotherinlaw announced that that nice young man mr pendennis had escaped narrowly from a fever and that no doubt all clavering where he was so popular would be pleased at his recovery and he mentioned that he had an interesting case of compound fracture an officer of distinction which kept him in town but as for fanny bolton he made no more mention of her in his lettersno more than pen himself had made mention of her o you mothers at home how much do you think you know about your lads how much do you think you know  but with bows there was no reason why huxter should not speak his mind and so a very short time after his conversation with mrs bolton mr sam talked to the musician about his early acquaintance with pendennis described him as a confounded conceited blackguard and expressed a determination to punch his impudent head as soon as ever he should be well enough to stand up like a man  then it was that bows on his part spoke and told his version of the story whereof arthur and little fan were the hero and heroine how they had met by no contrivance of the former but by a blunder of the old irishman now in bed with a broken shinhow pen had acted with manliness and selfcontrol in the businesshow mrs bolton was an idiot and he related the conversation which he bows had had with pen and the sentiments uttered by the young man perhaps bows story caused some twinges of conscience in the breast of pens accuser and that gentleman frankly owned that he had been wrong with regard to arthur and withdrew his project for punching mr pendenniss head  but the cessation of his hostility for pen did not diminish huxters attentions to fanny which unlucky mr bows marked with his usual jealousy and bitterness of spirit i have but to like anybody the old fellow thought and somebody is sure to come and be preferred to me it has been the same illluck with me since i was a lad until now that i am sixty years old what can such a man as i am expect better than to be laughed at it is for the young to succeed and to be happy and not for old fools like me ive played a second fiddle through life he said with a bitter laugh how can i suppose the luck is to change after it has gone against me so long this was the selfish way in which bows looked at the state of affairs though few persons would have thought there was any cause for his jealousy who looked at the pale and griefstricken countenance of the hapless little girl its object fanny received huxters goodnatured efforts at consolation and kind attentions kindly she laughed now and again at his jokes and games with her little sisters but relapsed quickly into a dejection which ought to have satisfied mr bows that the newcomer had no place in her heart as yet had jealous mr bows been enabled to see with clear eyes  but bows did not fanny attributed pens silence somehow to bowss interference fanny hated him fanny treated bows with constant cruelty and injustice she turned from him when he spokeshe loathed his attempts at consolation a hard life had mr bows and a cruel return for his regard  when warrington came to shepherds inn as pens ambassador it was for mr bowss apartments he inquired no doubt upon a previous agreement with the principal for whom he acted in this delicate negotiation and he did not so much as catch a glimpse of miss fanny when he stopped at the inngate and made his inquiry warrington was of course directed to the musicians chambers and found him tending the patient there from whose chamber he came out to wait upon his guest we have said that they had been previously known to one another and the pair shook hands with sufficient cordiality after a little preliminary talk warrington said that he had come from his friend arthur pendennis and from his family to thank bows for his attention at the commencement of pens illness and for his kindness in hastening into the country to fetch the major  bows replied that it was but his duty he had never thought to have seen the young gentleman alive again when he went in search of pens relatives and he was very glad of mr pendenniss recovery and that he had his friends with him lucky are they who have friends mr warrington said the musician i might be up in this garret and nobody would care for me or mind whether i was alive or dead  what not the general mr bows warrington asked  the general likes his whiskybottle more than anything in life the other answered we live together from habit and convenience and he cares for me no more than you do what is it you want to ask me mr warrington you aint come to visit me i know very well nobody comes to visit me it is about fanny the porters daughter you are comei see thatvery well is mr pendennis now he has got well anxious to see her again does his lordship the sultan propose to throw his andkerchief to her she has been very ill sir ever since the day when mrs pendennis turned her out of doorskind of a lady wasnt it the poor girl and myself found the young gentleman raving in a fever knowing nobody with nobody to tend him but his drunken laundressshe watched day and night by him i set off to fetch his uncle mamma comes and turns fanny to the rightabout uncle comes and leaves me to pay the cab carry my compliments to the ladies and gentleman and say we are both very thankful very why a countess couldnt have behaved better and for an apothecarys lady as im given to understand mrs pendennis wasim sure her behaviour is most uncommon aristocratic and genteel she ought to have a doublegilt pestle and mortar to her coach  it was from mr huxter that bows had learned pens parentage no doubt and if he took pens part against the young surgeon and fannys against mr pendennis it was because the old gentleman was in so savage a mood that his humour was to contradict everybody  warrington was curious and not ill pleased at the musicians taunts and irascibility i never heard of these transactions he said or got but a very imperfect account of them from major pendennis what was a lady to do i think i have never spoken with her on the subject she had some notion that the young woman and my friend pen were onon terms ofof an intimacy which mrs pendennis could not of course recognise  oh of course not sir speak out sir say what you mean at once that the young gentleman of the temple had made a victim of the girl of shepherds inn eh and so she was turned to be out of doorsor brayed alive in the doublegilt pestle and mortar by jove no mr warrington there was no such thing there was no victimising or if there was mr arthur was the victim not the girl he is an honest fellow he is though he is conceited and a puppy sometimes he can feel like a man and run away from temptation like a man i own it though i suffer by it i own it he has a heart he has but the girl hasnt sir that girl will do anything to win a man and fling him away without a pang sir if shes flung away herself sir shell feel it and cry she had a fever when mrs pendennis turned her out of doors and she made love to the doctor doctor goodenough who came to cure her now she has taken on with another chapanother sawbones ha ha d it sir she likes the pestle and mortar and hangs round the pillboxes shes so fond of em and she has got a fellow from saint bartholomews who grins through a horsecollar for her sisters and charms away her melancholy go and see sir very likely hes in the lodge now if you want news about miss fanny you must ask at the doctors shop sir not of an old fiddler like megoodbye sir theres my patient calling  and a voice was heard from the captains bedroom a wellknown voice which said id loike a dthrop of dthrink bows im thirstee and not sorry perhaps to hear that such was the state of things and that pens forsaken was consoling herself warrington took his leave of the irascible musician  as luck would have it he passed the lodge door just as mr huxter was in the act of frightening the children with the mask whereof we have spoken and fanny was smiling languidly at his farces warrington laughed bitterly are all women like that he thought i think theres one thats not he added with a sigh  at piccadilly waiting for the richmond omnibus george fell in with major pendennis bound in the same direction and he told the old gentleman of what he had seen and heard respecting fanny  major pendennis was highly delighted and as might be expected of such a philosopher made precisely the same observation as that which had escaped from warrington all women are the same he said la petite se console daymy when i used to read telemaque at school calypso ne pouvait se consoleryou know the rest warringtoni used to say it was absard absard by gad and so it is and so shes got a new soupirant has she the little porteress dayvlish nice little girl how mad pen will beeh warrington but we must break it to him gently or hell be in such a rage that he will be going after her again we must menager the young fellow  i think mrs pendennis ought to know that pen acted very well in the business she evidently thinks him guilty and according to mr bows arthur behaved like a good fellow warrington said  my dear warrington said the major with a look of some alarm in mrs pendenniss agitated state of health and that sort of thing the best way i think is not to say a single word about the subjector stay leave it to me and ill talk to herbreak it to her gently you know and that sort of thing i give you my word i will and so calypsos consoled is she and he sniggered over this gratifying truth happy in the corner of the omnibus during the rest of the journey  pen was very anxious to hear from his envoy what had been the result of the latters mission and as soon as the two young men could be alone the ambassador spoke in reply to arthurs eager queries  you remember your poem pen of ariadne in naxos warrington said devilish bad poetry it was to be sure  apres asked pen in a great state of excitement  when theseus left ariadne do you remember what happened to her young fellow  its a lie its a lie you dont mean that cried out pen starting up his face turning red  sit down stoopid warrington said and with two fingers pushed pen back into his seat again its better for you as it is young one he said sadly in reply to the savage flush in arthurs face     chapter lvii foreign ground   worthy major pendennis fulfilled his promise to warrington so far as to satisfy his own conscience and in so far to ease poor helen with regard to her son as to make her understand that all connexion between arthur and the odious little gatekeeper was at an end and that she need have no further anxiety with respect to an imprudent attachment or a degrading marriage on pens part and that young fellows mind was also relieved after he had recovered the shock to his vanity by thinking that miss fanny was not going to die of love for him and that no unpleasant consequences were to be apprehended from the luckless and brief connexion  so the whole party were free to carry into effect their projected continental trip and arthur pendennis rentier voyageant avec madame pendennis and mademoiselle bell and george warrington particulier age de 32 ans taille 6 pieds anglais figure ordinaire cheveux noirs barbe idem etc procured passports from the consul of hm the king of the belgians at dover and passed over from that port to ostend whence the party took their way leisurely visiting bruges and ghent on their way to brussels and the rhine it is not our purpose to describe this ofttravelled tour or lauras delight at the tranquil and ancient cities which she saw for the first time or helens wonder and interest at the beguine convents which they visited or the almost terror with which she saw the blackveiled nuns with outstretched arms kneeling before the illuminated altars and beheld the strange pomps and ceremonials of the catholic worship barefooted friars in the streets crowned images of saints and virgins in the churches before which people were bowing down and worshipping in direct defiance as she held of the written law priests in gorgeous robes or lurking in dark confessionals theatres opened and people dancing on sundaysall these new sights and manners shocked and bewildered the simple country lady and when the young men after their evening drive or walk returned to the widow and her adopted daughter they found their books of devotion on the table and at their entrance laura would commonly cease reading some of the psalms or the sacred pages which of all others helen loved the late events connected with her son had cruelly shaken her laura watched with intense though hidden anxiety every movement of her dearest friend and poor pen was most constant and affectionate in waiting upon his mother whose wounded bosom yearned with love towards him though there was a secret between them and an anguish or rage almost on the mothers part to think that she was dispossessed somehow of her sons heart or that there were recesses in it which she must not or dared not enter she sickened as she thought of the sacred days of boyhood when it had not been sowhen her arthurs heart had no secrets and she was his all in all when he poured his hopes and pleasures his childish griefs vanities triumphs into her willing and tender embrace when her home was his nest still and before fate selfishness nature had driven him forth on wayward wingsto range his own flightto sing his own songand to seek his own home and his own mate watching this devouring care and racking disappointment in her friend laura once said to helen if pen had loved me as you wished i should have gained him but i should have lost you mamma i know i should and i like you to love me best men do not know what it is to love as we do i thinkand helen sighing agreed to this portion of the young ladys speech though she protested against the former part for my part i suppose miss laura was right in both statements and with regard to the latter assertion especially that it is an old and received truismlove is an hour with us it is all night and all day with a woman damon has taxes sermon parade tailors bills parliamentary duties and the deuce knows what to think of delia has to think about damondamon is the oak or the post and stands up and delia is the ivy or the honeysuckle whose arms twine about him is it not so delia is it not your nature to creep about his feet and kiss them to twine round his trunk and hang there and damons to stand like a british man with his hands in his breeches pocket while the pretty fond parasite clings round him  old pendennis had only accompanied our friends to the waters edge and left them on board the boat giving the chief charge of the little expedition to warrington he himself was bound on a brief visit to the house of a great man a friend of his after which sojourn he proposed to join his sisterinlaw at the german wateringplace whither the party was bound the major himself thought that his long attentions to his sick family had earned for him a little relaxationand though the best of the partridges were thinned off the pheasants were still to be shot at stillbrook where the noble owner still was old pendennis betook himself to that hospitable mansion and disported there with great comfort to himself a royal duke some foreigners of note some illustrious statesmen and some pleasant people visited it it did the old fellows heart good to see his name in the morning post amongst the list of the distinguished company which the marquis of steyne was entertaining at his countryhouse at stillbrook he was a very useful and pleasant personage in a countryhouse he entertained the young men with queer little anecdotes and grivoises stories on their shootingparties or in their smokingroom where they laughed at him and with him he was obsequious with the ladies of a morning in the rooms dedicated to them he walked the new arrivals about the park and gardens and showed them the carte du pays and where there was the best view of the mansion and where the most favourable point to look at the lake he showed where the timber was to be felled and where the old road went before the new bridge was built and the hill cut down and where the place in the wood was where old lord lynx discovered sir phelim oneal on his knees before her ladyship etc etc he called the lodgekeepers and gardeners by their names he knew the number of domestics that sat down in the housekeepers room and how many dined in the servantshall he had a word for everybody and about everybody and a little against everybody he was invaluable in a countryhouse in a word and richly merited and enjoyed his vacation after his labours and perhaps whilst he was thus deservedly enjoying himself with his country friends the major was not ill pleased at transferring to warrington the command of the family expedition to the continent and thus perforce keeping him in the service of the ladiesa servitude which george was only too willing to undergo for his friends sake and for that of a society which he found daily more delightful warrington was a good german scholar and was willing to give miss laura lessons in the language who was very glad to improve herself though pen for his part was too weak or lazy now to resume his german studies warrington acted as courier and interpreter warrington saw the baggage in and out of ships inns and carriages managed the money matters and put the little troop into marching order warrington found out where the english church was and if mrs pendennis and miss laura were inclined to go thither walked with great decorum along with them warrington walked by mrs pendenniss donkey when that lady went out on her evening excursions or took carriages for her or got galignani for her or devised comfortable seats under the limetrees for her when the guests paraded after dinner and the kursaal band at the bath where our tired friends stopped performed their pleasant music under the trees many a fine whiskered prussian or french dandy come to the bath for the trenteetquarante cast glances of longing towards the pretty freshcoloured english girl who accompanied the pale widow and would have longed to take a turn with her at the galop or the waltz but laura did not appear in the ballroom except once or twice when pen vouchsafed to walk with her and as for warrington that rough diamond had not had the polish of a dancingmaster and he did not know how to waltzthough he would have liked to learn if he could have had such a partner as laurasuch a partner psha what had a stiff bachelor to do with partners and waltzing what was he about dancing attendance here drinking in sweet pleasure at a risk he knows not of what aftersadness and regret and lonely longing but yet he stayed on you would have said he was the widows son to watch his constant care and watchfulness of her or that he was an adventurer and wanted to marry her fortune or at any rate that he wanted some very great treasure or benefit from herand very likely he didfor ours as the reader has possibly already discovered is a selfish story and almost every person according to his nature more or less generous than george and according to the way of the world as it seems to us is occupied about number one so warrington selfishly devoted himself to helen who selfishly devoted herself to pen who selfishly devoted himself to himself at this present period having no other personage or object to occupy him except indeed his mothers health which gave him a serious and real disquiet but though they sate together they did not talk much and the cloud was always between them  every day laura looked for warrington and received him with more frank and eager welcome he found himself talking to her as he didnt know himself that he could talk he found himself performing acts of gallantry which astounded him after the performance he found himself looking blankly in the glass at the crows feet round his eyes and at some streaks of white in his hair and some intrusive silver bristles in his grim blue beard he found himself looking at the young bucks at the bathat the bland tightwaisted germansat the capering frenchmen with their lacquered mustachios and trim varnished bootsat the english dandies pen amongst them with their calm domineering air and insolent languor and envied each one of these some excellence or quality of youth or good looks which he possessed and of which warrington felt the need and every night as the night came he quitted the little circle with greater reluctance and retiring to his own lodging in their neighbourhood felt himself the more lonely and unhappy the widow could not help seeing his attachment she understood now why major pendennis always a tacit enemy of her darling project had been so eager that warrington should be of their party laura frankly owned her great her enthusiastic regard for him and arthur would make no movement arthur did not choose to see what was going on or did not care to prevent or actually encouraged it she remembered his often having said that he could not understand how a man proposed to a woman twice she was in tortureat secret feud with her son of all objects in the world the dearest to herin doubt which she dared not express to herself about lauraaverse to warrington the good and generous no wonder that the healing waters of rosenbad did not do her good or that doctor von glauber the bath physician when he came to visit her found that the poor lady made no progress to recovery meanwhile pen got well rapidly slept with immense perseverance twelve hours out of the twentyfour ate huge meals and at the end of a couple of months had almost got back the bodily strength and weight which he had possessed before his illness  after they had passed some fifteen days at their place of rest and refreshment a letter came from major pendennis announcing his speedy arrival at rosenbad and soon after the letter the major himself made his appearance accompanied by morgan his faithful valet without whom the old gentleman could not move when the major travelled he wore a jaunty and juvenile travelling costume to see his back still you would have taken him for one of the young fellows whose slim waist and youthful appearance warrington was beginning to envy it was not until the worthy man began to move that the observer remarked that time had weakened his ancient knees and had unkindly interfered to impede the action of the natty little varnished boots in which the gay old traveller still pinched his toes there were magnates both of our own country and of foreign nations present that autumn at rosenbad the elder pendennis read over the strangers list with great gratification on the night of his arrival was pleased to find several of his acquaintances among the great folks and would have the honour of presenting his nephew to a german grand duchess a russian princess and an english marquis before many days were over nor was pen by any means averse to making the acquaintance of these great personages having a liking for polite life and all the splendours and amenities belonging to it that very evening the resolute old gentleman leaning on his nephews arm made his appearance in the halls of the kursaal and lost or won a napoleon or two at the table of trenteetquarante he did not play to lose he said or to win but he did as other folks did and betted his napoleon and took his luck as it came he pointed out the russians and spaniards gambling for heaps of gold and denounced their eagerness as something sordid and barbarous an english gentleman should play where the fashion is play but should not elate or depress himself at the sport and he told how he had seen his friend the marquis of steyne when lord gaunt lose eighteen thousand at a sitting and break the bank three nights running at paris without ever showing the least emotion at his defeat or victory and thats what i call being an english gentleman pen my dear boy the old gentleman said warming as he prattled about his recollectionswhat i call the great manner only remains with us and with a few families in france and as russian princesses passed him whose reputation had long ceased to be doubtful and damaged english ladies who are constantly seen in company of their faithful attendant for the time being in these gay haunts of dissipation the old major with eager garrulity and mischievous relish told his nephew wonderful particulars regarding the lives of these heroines and diverted the young man with a thousand scandals egad he felt himself quite young again he remarked to pen as rouged and grinning her enormous chasseur behind her bearing her shawl the princess obstropski smiled and recognised and accosted him he remembered her in 14 when she was an actress of the paris boulevard and the emperor alexanders aidedecamp obstropski a man of great talents who knew a good deal about the emperor pauls death and was a devil to play married her he most courteously and respectfully asked leave to call upon the princess and to present to her his nephew mr arthur pendennis and he pointed out to the latter a halfdozen of other personages whose names were as famous and whose histories were as satisfying what would poor helen have thought could she have heard those tales or known to what kind of people her brotherinlaw was presenting her son only once leaning on arthurs arm she had passed through the room where the green tables were prepared for play and the croaking croupiers were calling out their fatal words of rouge gagne and couleur perd she had shrunk terrified out of the pandemonium imploring pen extorting from him a promise on his word of honour that he would never play at those tables and the scene which so frightened the simple widow only amused the worldly old veteran and made him young again he could breathe the air cheerfully which stifled her her right was not his right his food was her poison human creatures are constituted thus differently and with this variety the marvellous world is peopled to the credit of mr pen let it be said that he kept honestly the promise made to his mother and stoutly told his uncle of his intention to abide by it  when the major arrived his presence somehow cast a damp upon at least three of the persons of our little partyupon laura who had anything but respect for him upon warrington whose manner towards him showed an involuntary haughtiness and contempt and upon the timid and alarmed widow who dreaded lest he should interfere with her darling though almost desperate projects for her boy and indeed the major unknown to himself was the bearer of tidings which were to bring about a catastrophe in the affairs of all our friends  pen with his two ladies had apartments in the town of rosenbad honest warrington had lodgings hard by the major on arrival at rosenbad had as befitted his dignity taken his quarters at one of the great hotels at the roman emperor or the four seasons where two or three hundred gamblers pleasureseekers or invalids sate down and overate themselves daily at the enormous tabledhote to this hotel pen went on the morning after the majors arrival dutifully to pay his respects to his uncle and found the latters sittingroom duly prepared and arranged by mr morgan with the majors hats brushed and his coats laid out his despatchboxes and umbrellacases his guidebooks passports maps and other elaborate necessaries of the english traveller all as trim and ready as they could be in their masters own room in jermyn street everything was ready from the medicinebottle fresh filled from the pharmaciens down to the old fellows prayerbook without which he never travelled for he made a point of appearing at the english church at every place which he honoured with a stay everybody did it he said every english gentleman did it and this pious man would as soon have thought of not calling upon the english ambassador in a continental town as of not showing himself at the national place of worship  the old gentleman had been to take one of the baths for which rosenbad is famous and which everybody takes and his afterbath toilet was not yet completed when pen arrived the elder called out to arthur in a cheery voice from the inner apartment in which he and morgan were engaged and the valet presently came in bearing a little packet to pens addressmr arthurs letters and papers morgan said which he had brought from mr arthurs chambers in london and which consisted chiefly of numbers of the pall mall gazette which our friend mr finucane thought his collaborateur would like to see the papers were tied together the letters in an envelope addressed to pen in the lastnamed gentlemans handwriting  amongst the letters there was a little note addressed as a former letter we have heard of had been to arther pendennis esquire which arthur opened with a start and a blush and read with a very keen pang of interest and sorrow and regard she had come to arthurs house fanny bolton saidand found that he was gonegone away to germany without ever leaving a word for heror answer to her last letter in which she prayed but for one word of kindnessor the books which he had promised her in happier times before he was ill and which she should like to keep in remembrance of him she said she would not reproach those who had found her at his bedside when he was in the fever and knew nobody and who had turned the poor girl away without a word she thought she should have died she said of that but doctor goodenough had kindly tended her and kept her life when perhaps the keeping of it was of no good and she forgave everybody and as for arthur she would pray for him for ever and when he was so ill and they cut off his hair she had made so free as to keep one little lock for herself and that she owned and might she still keep it or would his mamma order that that should be gave up too she was willing to obey him in all things and couldnt but remember that once he was so kind oh so good and kind to his poor fanny  when major pendennis fresh and smirking from his toilet came out of his bedroom to his sittingroom he found arthur with this note before him and an expression of savage anger on his face which surprised the elder gentleman what news from london my boy he rather faintly asked are the duns at you that you look so glum  do you know anything about this letter sir arthur asked  what letter my good sir said the other dryly at once perceiving what had happened  you know what i meanabout about missabout fanny boltonthe poor dear little girl arthur broke out when she was in my room was she there when i was deliriousi fancied she waswas she who sent her out of my chambers who intercepted her letters to me who dared to do it did you do it uncle  its not my practice to tamper with gentlemens letters or to answer damned impertinent questions major pendennis cried out in a great tremor of emotion and indignation there was a girl in your rooms when i came up at great personal inconvenience daymyand to meet with a return of this kind for my affection to you is not pleasant by gad sirnot at all pleasant  thats not the question sir arthur said hotlyand i beg your pardon uncle you were you always have been most kind to me but i say again did you say anything harsh to this poor girl did you send her away from me  i never spoke a word to the girl the uncle said and i never sent her away from you and know no more about her and wish to know no more about her than about the man in the moon  then its my mother that did it arthur broke out did my mother send that poor child away  i repeat i know nothing about it sir the elder said testily lets change the subject if you please  ill never forgive the person who did it said arthur bouncing up and seizing his hat  the major cried out stop arthur for gods sake stop but before he had uttered his sentence arthur had rushed out of the room and at the next minute the major saw him striding rapidly down the street that led towards his home  get breakfast said the old fellow to morgan and he wagged his head and sighed as he looked out of the window poor helenpoor soul therell be a row i knew there would and begad all the fats in the fire  when pen reached home he only found warrington in the ladies drawingroom waiting their arrival in order to conduct them to the room where the little english colony at rosenbad held their sunday church helen and laura had not appeared as yet the former was ailing and her daughter was with her pens wrath was so great that he could not defer expressing it he flung fannys letter across the table to his friend look there warrington he said she tended me in my illness she rescued me out of the jaws of death and this is the way they have treated the dear little creature they have kept her letters from me they have treated me like a child and her like a dog poor thing my mother has done this  if she has you must remember it is your mother warrington interposed  it only makes the crime the greater because it is she who has done it pen answered she ought to have been the poor girls defender not her enemy she ought to go down on her knees and ask pardon of her i ought i will i am shocked at the cruelty which has been shown her what she gave me her all and this is her return she sacrifices everything for me and they spurn her  hush said warrington they can hear you from the next room  hear let them hear pen cried out only so much the louder those may overhear my talk who intercept my letters i say this poor girl has been shamefully used and i will do my best to right her i will  the door of the neighbouring room opened and laura came forth with a pale and stern face she looked at pen with glances from which beamed pride defiance aversion arthur your mother is very ill she said it is a pity that you should speak so loud as to disturb her  it is a pity that i should have been obliged to speak at all pen answered and i have more to say before i have done  i should think what you have to say will hardly be fit for me to hear laura said haughtily  you are welcome to hear it or not as you like said mr pen i shall go in now and speak to my mother  laura came rapidly forward so that she should not be overheard by her friend within not now sir she said to pen you may kill her if you do your conduct has gone far enough to make her wretched  what conduct cried out pen in a fury who dares impugn it who dares meddle with me is it you who are the instigator of this persecution  i said before it was a subject of which it did not become me to hear or to speak laura said but as for mamma if she had acted otherwise than she did with regard toto the person about whom you seem to take such an interest it would have been i that must have quitted your house and not thatthat person  by heavens this is too much pen cried out with a violent execration  perhaps that is what you wished laura said tossing her head up no more of this if you please i am not accustomed to hear such subjects spoken of in such language and with a stately curtsey the young lady passed to her room looking her adversary full in the face as she retreated and closed the door upon him  pen was bewildered with wonder perplexity fury at this monstrous and unreasonable persecution he burst out into a loud and bitter laugh as laura quitted him and with sneers and revilings as a man who jeers under an operation ridiculed at once his own pain and his persecutors anger the laugh which was one of bitter humour and no unmanly or unkindly expression of suffering under most cruel and unmerited torture was heard in the next apartment as some of his unlucky previous expressions had been and like them entirely misinterpreted by the hearers it struck like a dagger into the wounded and tender heart of helen it pierced laura and inflamed the highspirited girl with scorn and anger and it was to this hardened libertine she thoughtto this boaster of low intrigues that i had given my heart away he breaks the most sacred laws thought helen he prefers the creature of his passion to his own mother and when he is upbraided he laughs and glories in his crime she gave me her all i heard him say it argued the poor widow and he boasts of it and laughs and breaks his mothers heart the emotion the shame the grief the mortification almost killed her she felt she should die of his unkindness  warrington thought of lauras speechperhaps that is what you wished she loves pen still he said it was jealousy made her speakcome away pen come away and let us go to church and get calm you must explain this matter to your mother she does not appear to know the truth nor do you quite my good fellow come away and let us talk about it and again he muttered to himself perhaps that is what you wished yes she loves him why shouldnt she love him whom else would i have her love what can she be to me but the dearest and the fairest and the best of women  so leaving the women similarly engaged within the two gentlemen walked away each occupied with his own thought and silent for a considerable space i must set this matter right thought honest george as she loves him stilli must set his mind right about the other woman and with this charitable thought the good fellow began to tell more at large what bows had said to him regarding miss boltons behaviour and fickleness and he described how the girl was no better than a little lightminded flirt and perhaps he exaggerated the goodhumour and contentedness which he had himself as he thought witnessed in her behaviour in the scene with mr huxter  now all bowss statements had been coloured by an insane jealousy and rage on that old mans part and instead of allaying pens renascent desire to see his little conquest again warringtons accounts inflamed and angered pendennis and made him more anxious than before to set himself right as he persisted in phrasing it with fanny they arrived at the church door presently but scarce one word of the service and not a syllable of mr shambles sermon did either of them comprehend probablyso much was each engaged with his own private speculations the major came up to them after the service with his wellbrushed hat and wig and his jauntiest most cheerful air he complimented them upon being seen at church again he said that every commeil faut person made a point of attending the english service abroad and he walked back with the young men prattling to them in garrulous goodhumour and making bows to his acquaintances as they passed and thinking innocently that pen and george were both highly delighted by his anecdotes which they suffered to run on in a scornful and silent acquiescence  at the time of mr shambles sermon an erratic anglican divine hired for the season at places of english resort and addicted to debts drinking and even to roulette it was said pen chafing under the persecution which his womankind inflicted upon him had been meditating a great act of revolt and of justice as he had worked himself up to believe and warrington on his part had been thinking that a crisis in his affairs had likewise come and that it was necessary for him to break away from a connexion which every day made more and more wretched and dear to him yes the time was come he took those fatal words perhaps that is what you wished as a text for a gloomy homily which he preached to himself in the dark pew of his own heart whilst mr shamble was feebly giving utterance to his sermon     chapter lviii fairoaks to let   our poor widow with the assistance of her faithful martha of fairoaks who laughed and wondered at the german ways and superintend the affairs of the simple household had made a little feast in honour of major pendenniss arrival of which however only the major and his two younger friends partook for helen sent to say that she was too unwell to dine at their table and laura bore her company the major talked for the party and did not perceive or choose to perceive what a gloom and silence pervaded the other two sharers of the modest dinner it was evening before helen and laura came into the sittingroom to join the company there she came in leaning on laura with her back to the waning light so that arthur could not see how pallid and woestricken her face was and as she went up to pen whom she had not seen during the day and placed her fond arms on his shoulders and kissed him tenderly laura left her and moved away to another part of the room pen remarked that his mothers voice and her whole frame trembled her hand was clammy cold as she put it up to his forehead piteously embracing him the spectacle of her misery only added somehow to the wrath and testiness of the young man he scarcely returned the kiss which the suffering lady gave him and the countenance with which he met the appeal of her look was hard and cruel she persecutes me he thought within himself and she comes to me with the air of a martyr you look very ill my child she said i dont like to see you look in that way and she tottered to a sofa still holding one of his passive hands in her thin cold clinging fingers  i have had much to annoy me mother pen said with a throbbing breast and as he spoke helens heart began to beat so that she sate almost dead and speechless with terror  warrington laura and major pendennis all remained breathless aware that the storm was about to break  i have had letters from london arthur continued and one that has given me more pain than i ever had in my life it tells me that former letters of mine have been intercepted and purloined away from methatthat a young creature who has shown the greatest love and care for me has been most cruelly used byby you mother  for gods sake stop cried out warrington shes illdont you see she is ill  let him go on said the widow faintly  let him go on and kill her said laura rushing up to her mothers side speak on sir and see her die  it is you who are cruel cried pen more exasperated and more savage because his own heart naturally soft and weak revolted indignantly at the injustice of the very suffering which was laid at his door it is you that are cruel who attribute all this pain to me it is you who are cruel with your wicked reproaches your wicked doubts of me your wicked persecutions of those who love meyes those who love me and who brave everything for me and whom you despise and trample upon because they are of lower degree than you shall i tell you what i will dowhat i am resolved to do now that i know what your conduct has beeni will go back to this poor girl whom you turned out of my doors and ask her to come back and share my home with me ill defy the pride which persecutes her and the pitiless suspicion which insults her and me  do you mean pen that you here the widow with eager eyes and outstretched hands was breaking out but laura stopped her silence hush dear mother she cried and the widow hushed savagely as pen spoke she was only too eager to hear what more he had to say go on arthur go on arthur was all she said almost swooning away as she spoke  by gad i say he shant go on or i wont hear him by gad the major said trembling too in his wrath if you choose sir after all weve done for you after all ive done for you myself to insult your mother and disgrace your name by allying yourself with a lowborn kitchengirl go and do it by gadbut let us maam have no more to do with him i wash my hands of you siri wash my hands of you im an old fellowi aint long for this world i come of as ancient and honourable a family as any in england by gad and i did hope before i went off the hooks by gad that the fellow that id liked and brought up and nursed through life by jove would do something to show me that our nameyes the name of pendennis by gad was left undishonoured behind us but if he wont dammy i say amen by g both my father and my brother jack were the proudest men in england and i never would have thought that there would come this disgrace to my nameneverandand im ashamed that its arthur pendennis the old fellows voice here broke off into a sob it was the second time that arthur had brought tears from those wrinkled lids  the sound of his breaking voice stayed pens anger instantly and he stopped pacing the room as he had been doing until that moment laura was by helens sofa and warrington had remained hitherto an almost silent but not uninterested spectator of the family storm as the parties were talking it had grown almost dark and after the lull which succeeded the passionate outbreak of the major georges deep voice as it here broke trembling into the twilight room was heard with no small emotion by all  will you let me tell you something about myself my kind friends he saidyou have been so good to me maam you have been so kind to me laurai hope i may call you so sometimesmy dear pen and i have been such friends that i have long wanted to tell you my story such as it is and would have told it to you earlier but that it is a sad one and contains anothers secret however it may do good for arthur to know itit is that every one here should it will divert you from thinking about a subject which out of a fatal misconception has caused a great deal of pain to all of you may i please tell you mrs pendennis  pray speak was all helen said and indeed she was not much heeding her mind was full of another idea with which pens words had supplied her and she was in a terror of hope that what he had hinted might be as she wished  george filled himself a bumper of wine and emptied it and began to speak you all of you know how you see me he said a man without a desire to make an advance in the world careless about reputation and living in a garret and from hand to mouth though i have friends and a name and i daresay capabilities of my own that would serve me if i had a mind but mind i have none i shall die in that garret most likely and alone i nailed myself to that doom in early life shall i tell you what it was that interested me about arthur years ago and made me inclined towards him when first i saw him the men from our college at oxbridge brought up accounts of that early affair with the chatteris actress about whom pen has talked to me since and who but for the majors generalship might have been your daughterinlaw maam i cant see pen in the dark but he blushes im sure and i dare say miss bell does and my friend major pendennis i dare say laughs as he ought to dofor he won what would have been arthurs lot now had he been tied at nineteen to an illiterate woman older than himself with no qualities in common between them to make one a companion for the other no equality no confidence and no love speedily what could he have been but most miserable and when he spoke just now and threatened a similar union be sure it was but a threat occasioned by anger which you must give me leave to say maam was very natural on his part for after a generous and manly conductlet me say who know the circumstances wellmost generous and manly and selfdenying which is rare with himhe has met from some friends of his with a most unkind suspicion and has had to complain of the unfair treatment of another innocent person towards whom he and you all are under much obligation  the widow was going to get up here and warrington seeing her attempt to rise said do i tire you maam  oh nogo ongo on said helen delighted and he continued  i liked him you see because of that early history of his which had come to my ears in college gossip and because i like a man if you will pardon me for saying so miss laura who shows that he can have a great unreasonable attachment for a woman that was why we became friendsand are all friends herefor always arent we he added in a lower voice leaning over to her and pen has been a great comfort and companion to a lonely and unfortunate man  i am not complaining of my lot you see for no mans is what he would have it and up in my garret where you left the flowers and with my old books and my pipe for a wife i am pretty contented and only occasionally envy other men whose careers in life are more brilliant or who can solace their ill fortune by what fate and my own fault has deprived me ofthe affection of a woman or a child here there came a sigh from somewhere near warrington in the dark and a hand was held out in his direction which however was instantly withdrawn for the prudery of our females is such that before all expression of feeling or natural kindness and regard a woman is taught to think of herself and the proprieties and to be ready to blush at the very slightest notice and checking as of course it ought this spontaneous motion modesty drew up again kindly friendship shrank back ashamed of itself and warrington resumed his history my fate is such as i made it and not lucky for me or for others involved in it  i too had an adventure before i went to college and there was no one to save me as major pendennis saved pen pardon me miss laura if i tell this story before you it is as well that you all of you should hear my confession before i went to college as a boy of eighteen i was at a private tutors and there like arthur i became attached or fancied i was attached to a woman of a much lower degree and a greater age than my own you shrink from me  no i dont laura said and here the hand went out resolutely and laid itself in warringtons she had divined his story from some previous hints let fall by him and his first words at its commencement  she was a yeomans daughter in the neighbourhood warrington said with rather a faltering voice and i fanciedwhat all young men fancy her parents knew who my father was and encouraged me with all sorts of coarse artifices and scoundrel flatteries which i see now about their house to do her justice i own she never cared for me but was forced into what happened by the threats and compulsion of her family would to god that i had not been deceived but in these matters we are deceived because we wish to be so and i thought i loved that poor woman  what could come of such a marriage i found before long that i was married to a boor she could not comprehend one subject that interested me her dulness palled upon me till i grew to loathe it and after some time of a wretched furtive unioni must tell you alli found letters somewhere and such letters they were which showed me that her heart such as it was had never been mine but had always belonged to a person of her own degree  at my fathers death i paid what debts i had contracted at college and settled every shilling which remained to me in an annuity uponupon those who bore my name on condition that they should hide themselves away and not assume it they have kept that condition as they would break it for more money if i had earned fame or reputation that woman would have come to claim it if i had made a name for myself those who no right to it would have borne it and i entered life at twenty god help mehopeless and ruined beyond remission i was the boyish victim of vulgar cheats and perhaps it is only of late i have found out how hardah how hardit is to forgive them i told you the moral before pen and now i have told you the fable beware how you marry out of your degree i was made for a better lot than this i think but god has awarded me this oneand so you see it is for me to look on and see others successful and others happy with a heart that shall be as little bitter as possible  by gad sir cried the major in high goodhumour i intended you to marry miss laura here  and by gad master shallow i owe you a thousand pound warrington said  how dye mean a thousand it was only a pony sir replied the major simply at which the other laughed  as for helen she was so delighted that she started up and said god bless yougod for ever bless you mr warrington and kissed both his hands and ran up to pen and fell into his arms  yes dearest mother he said as he held her to him and with a noble tenderness and emotion embraced and forgave her i am innocent and my dear dear mother has done me a wrong  oh yes my child i have wronged you thank god i have wronged you helen whispered come away arthurnot herei want to ask my child to forgive meandand my god to forgive me and to bless you and love you my son  he led her tottering into her room and closed the door as the three touched spectators of the reconciliation looked on in pleased silence ever after ever after the tender accents of that voice faltering sweetly at his earthe look of the sacred eyes beaming with an affection unutterablethe quiver of the fond lips smiling mournfullywere remembered by the young man and at his best moments and at his hours of trial and grief and at his times of success or welldoing the mothers face looked down upon him and blessed him with its gaze of pity and purity as he saw it in that night when she yet lingered with him and when she seemed ere she quite left him an angel transfigured and glorified with lovefor which love as for the greatest of the bounties and wonders of gods provision for us let us kneel and thank our father  the moon had risen by this time arthur recollected well afterwards how it lighted up his mothers sweet pale face their talk or his rather for she scarcely could speak was more tender and confidential than it had been for years before he was the frank and generous boy of her early days and love he told her the story the mistake regarding which had caused her so much painhis struggles to fly from temptation and his thankfulness that he had been able to overcome it he never would do the girl wrong never or wound his own honour or his mothers pure heart the threat that he would return was uttered in a moment of exasperation of which he repented he never would see her again but his mother said yes he should and it was she who had been proud and culpableand she would like to give fanny bolton somethingand she begged her dear boys pardon for opening the letterand she would write to the young girl ifif she had time poor thing was it not natural that she should love her arthur and again she kissed him and she blessed him  as they were talking the clock struck nine and helen reminded him how when he was a little boy she used to go up to his bedroom at that hour and hear him say our father and once more oh once more the young man fell down at his mothers sacred knees and sobbed out the prayer which the divine tenderness uttered for us and which has been echoed by twenty ages since by millions of sinful and humbled men and as he spoke the last words of the supplication the mothers head fell down on her boys and her arms closed round him and together they repeated the words for ever and ever and amen  a little time after it might have been a quarter of an hour laura heard arthurs voice call from within laura laura she rushed into the room instantly and found the young man still on his knees and holding his mothers hand helens head had sunk back and was quite pale in the room pen looked round scared with a ghastly terror help laura help he said shes faintedshes  laura screamed and fell by the side of helen the shriek brought warrington and major pendennis and the servants to the room the sainted woman was dead the last emotion of her soul here was joy to be henceforth unchequered and eternal the tender heart beat no more it was to have no more pangs no more doubts no more griefs and trials its last throb was love and helens last breath was a benediction  the melancholy party bent their way speedily homewards and helen was laid by her husbands side at clavering in the old church where she had prayed so often for a while laura went to stay with dr portman who read the service over his dear departed sister amidst his own sobs and those of the little congregation which assembled round helens tomb there were not many who cared for her or who spoke of her when gone scarcely more than of a nun in a cloister did people know of that pious and gentle lady a few words among the cottagers whom her bounty was accustomed to relieve a little talk from house to house at clavering where this lady told how their neighbour died of a complaint in the heart whilst that speculated upon the amount of a property which the widow had left and a third wondered whether arthur would let fairoaks or live in it and expected that he would not be long getting through his propertythis was all and except with one or two who cherished her the kind soul was forgotten by the next marketday would you desire that grief for you should last for a few more weeks and does afterlife seem less solitary provided that our names when we go down into silence are echoing on this side of the grave yet for a little while and human voices are still talking about us she was gone the pure soul whom only two or three loved and knew the great blank she left was in lauras heart to whom her love had been everything and who had now but to worship her memory i am glad that she gave me her blessing before she went away warrington said to pen and as for arthur with a humble acknowledgment and wonder at so much affection he hardly dared to ask of heaven to make him worthy of it though he felt that a saint there was interceding for him  all the ladys affairs were found in perfect order and her little property ready for transmission to her son in trust for whom she held it papers in her desk showed that she had long been aware of the complaint one of the heart under which she laboured and knew that it would suddenly remove her and a prayer was found in her handwriting asking that her end might be as it was in the arms of her son  laura and arthur talked over her sayings all of which the former most fondly remembered to the young mans shame somewhat who thought how much greater her love had been for helen than his own he referred himself entirely to laura to know what helen would have wished should be done what poor persons she would have liked to relieve what legacies or remembrances she would have wished to transmit they packed up the vase which helen in her gratitude had destined to dr goodenough and duly sent it to the kind doctor a silver coffeepot which she used was sent off to portman a diamond ring with her hair was given with affectionate greeting to warrington  it must have been a hard day for poor laura when she went over to fairoaks first and to the little room which she had occupied and which was hers no more and to the widows own blank chamber in which those two had passed so many beloved hours there of course were the clothes in the wardrobe the cushion on which she prayed the chair at the toilette the glass that was no more to reflect her dear sad face after she had been here a while pen knocked and led her downstairs to the parlour again and made her drink a little wine and said god bless you as she touched the glass nothing shall ever be changed in your room he saidit is always your roomit is always my sisters room shall it not be so laura and laura said yes  among the widows papers was found a packet marked by the widow letters from lauras father and which arthur gave to her they were the letters which had passed between the cousins in the early days before the marriage of either of them the ink was faded in which they were written the tears dried out that both perhaps had shed over them the grief healed now whose bitterness they chronicled the friends doubtless united whose parting on earth had caused to both pangs so cruel and laura learned fully now for the first time what the tie was which had bound her so tenderly to helen how faithfully her more than mother had cherished her fathers memory how truly she had loved him how meekly resigned him  one legacy of his mothers pen remembered of which laura could have no cognisance it was that wish of helens to make some present to fanny bolton and pen wrote to her putting his letter under an envelope to mr bows and requesting that gentleman to read it before he delivered it to fanny dear fanny pen said i have to acknowledge two letters from you one of which was delayed in my illness pen found the first letter in his mothers desk after her decease and the reading it gave him a strange pang and to thank you my kind nurse and friend who watched me so tenderly during my fever and i have to tell you that the last words of my dear mother who is no more were words of goodwill and gratitude to you for nursing me and she said she would have written to you had she had timethat she would like to ask your pardon if she had harshly treated youand that she would beg you to show your forgiveness by accepting some token of friendship and regard from her pen concluded by saying that his friend george warrington esq of lamb court temple was trustee of a little sum of money of which the interest would be paid to her until she became of age or changed her name which would always be affectionately remembered by her grateful friend a pendennis the sum was in truth but small although enough to make a little heiress of fanny bolton whose parents were appeased and whose father said mr p had acted quite as the gentlemanthough bows growled out that that to plaster a wounded heart with a banknote was an easy kind of sympathy and poor fanny felt only too clearly that pens letter was one of farewell  sending hundredpound notes to porters daughters is all devlish well old major pendennis said to his nephew whom as thee proprietor of fairoaks and the head of the family he now treated with marked deference and civility and as there was a little ready money at the bank and your poor mother wished it theres perhaps no harm done but my good lad id have you to remember that youve not above five hundred a year though thanks to me the world gives you credit for being a doosid deal better off and on my knees i beg you my boy dont break into your capital stick to it sir dont speculate with it sir keep your land and dont borrow on it tatham tells me that the chatteris branch of the railway maywill almost certainly pass through chatteris and of it can be brought on this side of the brawl sir and through your fields theyll be worth a devlish deal of money and your five hundred a year will jump up to eight or nine whatever it is keep it i implore you keep it and i say pen i think you should give up living in those dirty chambers in the temple and let a decent lodging and i should have a man sir to wait upon me and a horse or two in town in the season all this will pretty well swallow up your income and i know you must live close but remember you have a certain place in society and you cant afford to cut a poor figure in the world what are you going to do in the winter you dont intend to stay down here or i suppose to go on writing for thatwhatdyecallemthat newspaper  warrington and i are going abroad again sir for a little and then we shall see what is to be done arthur replied  and youll let fairoaks of course good school in the neighbourhood cheap country devlish nice place for east india colonels or families wanting to retire ill speak about it at the club there are lots of fellows at the club want a place of that sort  i hope laura will live in it for the winter at least and will make it her home arthur replied at which the major pishd and pshad and said that there ought to be convents begad for english ladies and wished that miss bell had not been there to interfere with the arrangements of the family and that she would mope herself to death alone in that place  indeed it would have been a very dismal abode for poor laura who was not too happy either in dr portmans household and in the town where too many things reminded her of the dear parent whom she had lost but old lady rockminster who adored her young friend laura as soon as she read in the paper of her loss and of her presence in the country rushed over from baymouth where the old lady was staying and insisted that laura should remain six months twelve months all her life with her and to her ladyships house martha from fairoaks as femme de chambre accompanied her young mistress  pen and warrington saw her depart it was difficult to say which of the young men seemed to regard her the most tenderly your cousin is pert and rather vulgar my dear but he seems to have a good heart little lady rockminster said who said her say about everybodybut i like bluebeard best tell me is he touche au coeur  mr warrington has been longengaged laura said dropping her eyes  nonsense child and good heavens my dear thats a pretty diamond cross what do you mean by wearing it in the morning  arthurmy brother gave it me just now it wasit was  she could not finish the sentence the carriage passed over the bridge and by the dear dear gate of fairoakshome no more     chapter lix old friends   it chanced at that great english festival at which all london takes a holiday upon epsom downs that a great number of the personages to whom we have been introduced in the course of this history were assembled to see the derby in a comfortable open carriage which had been brought to the ground by a pair of horses might be seen mrs bungay of paternoster row attired like solomon in all his glory and having by her side modest mrs shandon for whom since the commencement of their acquaintance the worthy publishers lady had maintained a steady friendship bungay having recreated himself with a copious luncheon was madly shying at the sticks hard by till the perspiration ran off his bald pate shandon was shambling about among the drinking tenants and gipsies finucane constant in attendance on the two ladies to whom gentlemen of their acquaintance and connected with the publishing house came up to pay a visit  among others mr archer came up to make her his bow and told mrs bungay who was on the course yonder was the prime minister his lordship had just told him to back borax for the race but archer thought munmeer the better horse he pointed out countless dukes and grandees to the delighted mrs bungay look yonder in the grand stand he said there sits the chinese ambassador with the mandarins of his suite fouchoofoo brought me over letters of introduction from the governorgeneral of india my most intimate friend and i was for some time very kind to him and he had his chopsticks laid for him at my table whenever he chose to come and dine but he brought his own cook with him andwould you believe it mrs bungayone day when i was out and the ambassador was with mrs archer in our garden eating gooseberries of which the chinese are passionately fond the beast of a cook seeing my wifes dear little blenheim spaniel that we had from the duke of marlborough himself whose ancestors life mrs archers greatgreatgrandfather saved at the battle of malplaquet seized upon the poor little devil cut his throat and skinned him and served him up stuffed with forcedmeat in the second course  law said mrs bungay  you may fancy my wifes agony when she knew what had happened the cook came screaming upstairs and told us that she had found poor fidos skin in the area just after we had all of us tasted of the dish she never would speak to the ambassador againnever and upon my word he has never been to dine with us since the lord mayor who did me the honour to dine liked the dish very much and eaten with green peas it tastes rather like duck  you dont say so now cried the astonished publishers lady  fact upon my word look at that lady in blue seated by the ambassador that is lady flamingo and they say she is going to be married to him and return to pekin with his excellency she is getting her feet squeezed down on purpose but shell only cripple herself and will never be able to do itnever my wife has the smallest foot in england and wears shoes for a sixyearsold child but what is that to a chinese ladys foot mrs bungay  who is that carriage as mr pendennis is with mr archer mrs bungay presently asked he and mr warrington was here jest now hes aughty in his manners that mr pendennis and well he may be for im told he keeps tiptop company as he ad a large fortune left him mr archer hes in black still i see  eighteen hundred a year in land and twentytwo thousand five hundred in the threeandahalf per cents thats about it said mr archer  law why you know everything mr a cried the lady of paternoster row  i happen to know because i was called in about poor mrs pendenniss will mr archer replied pendenniss uncle the major seldom does anything without me and as he is likely to be extravagant weve tied up the property so that he cant make ducks and drakes with ithow do you do my lorddo you know that gentleman ladies you have read his speeches in the house it is lord rochester  lord fiddlestick cried out finucane from the box sure its tom staples of the morning advertiser archer  is it archer said simply well im very shortsighted and upon my word i thought it was rochester that gentleman with the double operaglass another nod is lord john and the tall man with him dont you know him is sir james  you know em because you see em in the house growled finucane  i know them because they are kind enough to allow me to call them my most intimate friends archer continued look at the duke of hampshire what a pattern of a fine old english gentleman he never misses the derby archer he said to me only yesterday i have been at sixtyfive derbies appeared on the field for the first time on a piebald pony when i was seven years old with my father the prince of wales and colonel hanger and only missing two racesone when i had the measles at eton and one in the waterloo year when i was with my friend wellington in flanders  and who is that yellow carriage with the pink and yellow parasols that mr pendennis is talking to and ever so many gentlemen asked mrs bungay  that is lady clavering of clavering park next estate to my friend pendennis that is the young son and heir upon the box hes awfully tipsy the little scamp and the young lady is miss amory lady claverings daughter by a first marriage and uncommonly sweet upon my friend pendennis but ive reason to think he has his heart fixed elsewhere you have heard of young mr fokerthe great brewer foker you knowhe was going to hang himself in consequence of a fatal passion for miss amory who refused him but was cut down just in time by his valet and is now abroad under a keeper  how happy that young fellow is sighed mrs bungay whod have thought when he came so quiet and demure to dine with us three or four years ago he would turn out such a grand character why i saw his name at court the other day and presented by the marquis of steyne and all and in every party of the nobility his names down as sure as a gun  i introduced him a good deal when he first came up to town mr archer said and his uncle major pendennis did the rest hallo theres cobden here of all men in the world i must go and speak to him goodbye mrs bungay good morning mrs shandon  an hour previous to this time and at a different part of the course there might have been seen an old stagecoach on the battered roof of which a crowd of shabby raffs were stamping and hallooing as the great event of the daythe derby racerushed over the greensward and by the shouting millions of people assembled to view that magnificent scene this was wheelers the harlequins head drag which had brought down a company of choice spirits from bow street with a slapup luncheon in the boot as the whirling race flashed by each of the choice spirits bellowed out the name of the horse or the colours which he thought or he hoped might be foremost the cornet its muffineer its blue sleeves yallow cap yallow cap yallow cap and so forth yelled the gentlemen sportsmen during that delicious and thrilling minute before the contest was decided and as the fluttering signal blew out showing the number of the famous horse podasokus as winner of the race one of the gentlemen on the harlequins head drag sprang up off the roof as if he was a pigeon and about to fly away to london or york with the news  but his elation did not lift him many inches from his standingplace to which he came down again on the instant causing the boards of the crazy old coachroof to crack with the weight of his joy hurray hurray he bawled out podasokus is the horse supper for ten wheeler my boy ask you all round of course and damn the expense  and the gentlemen on the carriage the shabby swaggerers the dubious bucks said thank youcongratulate you colonel sup with you with pleasure and whispered to one another the colonel stands to win fifteen hundred and he got the odds from a good man too  and each of the shabby bucks and dusky dandies began to eye his neighbour with suspicion lest that neighbour taking his advantage should get the colonel into a lonely place and borrow money of him and the winner on podasokus could not be alone during the whole of that afternoon so closely did his friends watch him and each other  at another part of the course you might have seen a vehicle certainly more modest if not more shabby than that battered coach which had brought down the choice spirits from the harlequins head this was cab no 2002 which had conveyed a gentleman and two ladies from the cabstand in the strand whereof one of the ladies as she sate on the box of the cab enjoying with her mamma and their companion a repast of lobster salad and bitter ale looked so fresh and pretty that many of the splendid young dandies who were strolling about the course and enjoying themselves at the noble diversion of sticks and talking to the beautifully dressed ladies in the beautiful carriages on the hill forsook these fascinations to have a glance at the smiling and rosycheeked lass on the cab the blushes of youth and goodhumour mantled on the girls cheeks and played over that fair countenance like the pretty shining cloudlets on the serene sky overhead the elder ladys cheek was red too but that was a permanent mottled rose deepening only as it received free draughts of pale ale and brandyandwater until her face emulated the rich shell of the lobster which she devoured  the gentleman who escorted these two ladies was most active in attendance upon them here on the course as he had been during the previous journey during the whole of that animated and delightful drive from london his jokes had never ceased he spoke up undauntedly to the most awful drags full of the biggest and most solemn guardsmen as to the humblest donkeychaise in which bob the dustman was driving molly to the race he had fired astonishing volleys of what is called chaff into endless windows as he passed into lines of grinning girls schools into little regiments of shouting urchins hurraying behind the railings of their classical and commercial academies into casements whence smiling maidservants and nurses tossing babies or demure old maiden ladies with dissenting countenances were looking and the pretty girl in the straw bonnet with pink ribbon and her mamma the devourer of lobsters had both agreed that when he was in spirits there was nothing like that mr sam he had crammed the cab with trophies won from the bankrupt proprietors of the sticks hard by and with countless pincushions wooden apples backyboxes jackintheboxes and little soldiers he had brought up a gipsy with a tawny child in her arms to tell the fortunes of the ladies and the only cloud which momentarily obscured the sunshine of that happy party was when the teller of fate informed the young lady that had had reason to beware of a fair man who was false to her that she had had a bad illness and that she would find that a man would prove true  the girl looked very much abashed at this news her mother and the young man interchanged signs of wonder and intelligence perhaps the conjurer had used the same words to a hundred different carriages on that day  making his way solitary amongst the crowd and the carriages and noting according to his wont the various circumstances and characters which the animated scene presented a young friend of ours came suddenly upon cab 2002 and the little group of persons assembled on the outside of the vehicle as he caught sight of the young lady on the box she started and turned pale her mother became redder than ever the heretofore gay and triumphant mr sam immediately assumed a fierce and suspicious look and his eyes turned savagely from fanny bolton whom the reader no doubt has recognised in the young lady of the cab to arthur pendennis advancing to meet her  arthur too looked dark and suspicious on perceiving mr samuel huxter in company with his old acquaintances his suspicion was that of alarmed morality and i dare say highly creditable to mr arthur like the suspicion of mrs lynx when she sees mr brown and mrs jones talking together or when she remarks mrs lamb twice or thrice in a handsome operabox there may be no harm in the conversation of mr b and mr j and mrs lambs operabox though she notoriously cant afford one may be honestly come by but yet a moralist like mrs lynx has a right to the little precautionary fright and arthur was no doubt justified in adopting that severe demeanour of his  fannys heart began to patter violently huxters fists plunged into the pockets of his paletot clenched themselves involuntarily and armed themselves as it were in ambush mrs bolton began to talk with all her might and with a wonderful volubility and lor she was so apply to see mr pendennis and how well he was alookin and wed been talking about mr p only jest before hadnt we fanny and if this was the famous epsom races that they talked so much about she didnt care for her part if she never saw them again and how was major pendennis and that kind mr warrington who brought mr ps great kindness to fanny and she never would forget it never and mr warrington was so tall he almost broke his ead up against their lodge door you recollect mr warrington aknocking of his headdont you fanny  whilst mrs bolton was so discoursing i wonder how many thousands of thoughts passed through fannys mind and what dear times sad struggles lonely griefs and subsequent shamefaced consolations were recalled to her what pangs had the poor little thing as she thought how much she had loved him and that she loved him no more there he stood about whom she was going to die ten months since dandified supercilious with a black crape to his white hat and jet buttons in his shirtfront and a pink in his coat that some one else had probably given him with the tightest lavendercoloured gloves sewn with black and the smallest of canes and mr huxter wore no gloves and great blucher boots and smelt very much of tobacco certainly and looked oh it must be owned he looked as if a bucket of water would do him a great deal of good all these thoughts and a myriad of others rushed through fannys mind as her mamma was delivering herself of her speech and as the girl from under her eyes surveyed pendennissurveyed him entirely from head to foot the circle on his white forehead that his hat left when he lifted it his beautiful beautiful hair had grown again the trinkets at his watchchain the ring on his hand under his glove the neat shining boot so so unlike sams highlowand after her hand had given a little twittering pressure to the lavendercoloured kid grasp which was held out to it and after her mother had delivered herself of her speech all fanny could find to say was this is mr samuel huxter whom you knew formerly i believe sir mr samuel you know you knew mr pendennis formerlyandand will you take a little refreshment  these little words tremulous and uncoloured as they were yet were understood by pendennis in such a manner as to take a great load of suspicion from off his mindof remorse perhaps from his heart the frown on the countenance of the prince of fairoaks disappeared and a goodnatured smile and a knowing twinkle of the eyes illuminated his highnesss countenance i am very thirsty he said and i will be glad to drink your health fanny and i hope mr huxter will pardon me for having been very rude to him the last time we met and when i was so ill and out of spirits that indeed i scarcely knew what i said and herewith the lavendercoloured dexter kidglove was handed out in token of amity to huxter  the dirty fist in the young surgeons pocket was obliged to undoable itself and come out of its ambush disarmed the poor fellow himself felt as he laid it in pens hand how hot his own was and how blackit left black marks on pens gloves he saw themhe would have liked to have clenched it again and dashed it into the others goodhumoured face and have seen there upon that round with fanny with all england looking on which was the best manhe sam huxter of bartholomews or that grinning dandy  pen with ineffable goodhumour took a glasshe didnt mind what it washe was content to drink after the ladies and he filled it with frothing lukewarm beer which he pronounced to be delicious and which he drank cordially to the health of the party  as he was drinking and talking on in an engaging manner a young lady in a shot dovecoloured dress with a white parasol lined with pink and the prettiest dovecoloured boots that ever stepped passed by pen leaning on the arm of a stalwart gentleman with a military moustache  the young lady clenched her little fist and gave a mischievous sidelook as she passed pen he of the mustachios burst out into a jolly laugh he had taken off his hat to the ladies of cab no 2002 you should have seen fanny boltons eyes watching after the dovecoloured young lady immediately huxter perceived the direction which they took they ceased looking after the dovecoloured nymph and they turned and looked into sam huxters orbs with the most artless goodhumoured expression  what a beautiful creature fanny said what a lovely dress did you remark mr sam such little little hands  it was capting strong said mrs bolton and who was the young woman i wonder  a neighbour of mine in the countrymiss amory arthur saidlady claverings daughter youve seen sir francis often in shepherds inn mrs bolton  as he spoke fanny built up a perfect romance in three volumes lovefaithlessnesssplendid marriage at st georges hanover squarebrokenhearted maidand sam huxter was not the hero of that storypoor sam who by this time had got out an exceedingly rank cuba cigar and was smoking it under fannys little nose  after that confounded prig pendennis joined and left the party the sun was less bright to sam huxter the sky less bluethe sticks had no attraction for himthe bitter beer hot and undrinkablethe world was changed he had a quantity of peas and a tin peashooter in the pocket of the cab for amusement on the homeward route he didnt take them out and forgot their existence until some other wag on their return from the races fired a volley into sams sad face upon which salute after a few oaths indicative of surprise he burst into a savage and sardonic laugh  but fanny was charming all the way home she coaxed and snuggled and smiled she laughed pretty laughs she admired everything she took out the darling little jackintheboxes and was so obliged to sam and when they got home and mr huxter still with darkness on his countenance was taking a frigid leave of hershe burst into tears and said he was a naughty unkind thing  upon which with a burst of emotion almost as emphatic as hers the young surgeon held the girl in his armsswore that she was an angel and that he was a jealous brute owned that he was unworthy of her and that he had no right to hate pendennis and asked her implored her to say once more that she  that she whatthe end of the question and fannys answer were pronounced by lips that were so near each other that no bystander could hear the words mrs bolton only said come come mr hno nonsense if you please and i think youve acted like a wicked wretch and been most uncommon cruel to fanny that i do  when arthur left no 2002 he went to pay his respects to the carriage to which and to the side of her mamma the dovecoloured author of mes larmes had by this time returned indefatigable old major pendennis was in waiting upon lady clavering and had occupied the back seat in her carriage the box being in possession of young hopeful under the care of captain strong  a number of dandies and men of a certain fashionof military bucks of young rakes of the public offices of those who may be styled mens men rather than ladieshad come about the carriage during its station on the hilland had exchanged a word or two with lady clavering and a little talk a little chaff some of the most elegant of the men styled their conversation with miss amory they had offered her sportive bets and exchanged with her all sorts of freetalk and knowing innuendoes they pointed out to her who was on the course and the who was not always the person a young lady should know  when pen came up to lady claverings carriage he had to push his way through a crowd of these young bucks who were paying their court to miss amory in order to arrive as near that young lady who beckoned him by many pretty signals to her side  je lay vue she said elle a de bien beaux yeux vous etes un monster  why monster said pen with a laugh hone suit qui mal y peens my young friend yonder is as well protected as any young lady in christendom she has her mamma on one side her pretend on the other could any harm happen to a girl between those two  one does not know what may or may not arrive said miss blanche in french when a girl has the mind and when she is pursued by a wicked monster like you figure to yourself major that i come to find monsieur your nephew near to a cab by two ladies and a man oh such a man and who ate lobsters and who laughed who laughed  it did not strike me that the man laughed pen said and as for lobsters i thought he would have liked to eat me after the lobsters he shook hands with me and gripped me so that he bruised my glove blackandblue he is a young surgeon he comes from clavering dont you remember the gilt pestle and mortar in high street  if he attends you when you are sick continued miss amory he will kill you he will serve you right for you are a monster  the perpetual recurrence to the word monster jarred upon pen she speaks about these matters a great deal too lightly he thought if i had been a monster as she calls it she would have received me just the same this is not the way in which an english lady should speak or think laura would not speak in that way thank god and as he thought so his own countenance fell  of what are you thinking are you going to bouder me at present blanche asked major scold your mechant nephew he does not amuse me at all he is as bete as captain crackenbury  what are you saying about me miss amory said the guardsman with a grin if its anything good say it in english for i dont understand french when its spoke so devilish quick  it aint anything good crack said crackenburys fellow captain clinker lets come away and dont spoil sport they say pendennis is sweet upon her  im told hes a devilish clever fellow sighed crackenbury lady violet lebas says hes a devilish clever fellow he wrote a work or a poem or something and he writes those devilish clever things in thein the papers you know dammy i wish i was a clever fellow clinker  thats past wishing for crack my boy the other said i cant write a good book but i think i can make a pretty good one on the derby what a flat clavering is and the begum i like that old begum shes worth ten of her daughter how pleased the old girl was at winning the lottery  claverings safe to pay up aint he asked captain crackenbury  i hope so said his friend and they disappeared to enjoy themselves among the sticks  before the end of the days amusements many more gentlemen of lady claverings acquaintance came up to her carriage and chatted with the party which it contained the worthy lady was in high spirits and goodhumour laughing and talking according to her wont and offering refreshments to all her friends until her ample baskets and bottles were emptied and her servants and postillions were in such a royal state of excitement as servants and postillions commonly are upon the derby day  the major remarked that some of the visitors to the carriage appeared to look with rather queer and meaning glances towards its owner how easily she takes it one man whispered to another the begums made of money the friend replied how easily she takes what thought old pendennis has anybody lost any money lady clavering said she was happy in the morning because sir francis had promised her not to bet  mr welbore the country neighbour of the claverings was passing the carriage when he was called back by the begum who rallied him for wishing to cut her why didnt he come before why didnt he come to lunch her ladyship was in great delight she told himshe told everybody that she had won five pounds in a lottery as she conveyed this piece of intelligence to him mr welbore looked so particularly knowing and withal melancholy that a dismal apprehension seized upon major pendennis he would go and look after the horses and those rascals of postillions who were so long in coming round when he came back to the carriage his usually benign and smirking countenance was obscured by some sorrow what is the matter with you now the goodnatured begum asked the major pretended a headache from the fatigue and sunshine of the day the carriage wheeled off the course and took its way londonwards not the least brilliant equipage in that vast and picturesque procession the tipsy drivers dashed gallantly over the turf amidst the admiration of footpassengers the ironical cheers of the little donkeycarriages and spring vans and the loud objurgations of horseandchaise men with whom the reckless postboys came in contact the jolly begum looked the picture of goodhumour as she reclined on her splendid cushions the lovely sylphide smiled with languid elegance many an honest holidaymaker with his family wadded into a taxcart many a cheap dandy working his way home on his weary hack admired that brilliant turnout and thought no doubt how happy those swells must be strong sat on the box still with a lordly voice calling to the postboys and the crowd master frank had been put inside of the carriage and was asleep there by the side of the major dozing away the effects of the constant luncheon and champagne of which he had freely partaken  the major was revolving in his mind meanwhile the news the receipt of which had made him so grave if sir francis clavering goes on in this way pendennis the elder thought this little tipsy rascal will be as bankrupt as his father and grandfather before him the begums fortune cant stand such drains upon it no fortune can stand them she has paid his debts half a dozen times already a few years more of the turf and a few coups like this will ruin her  dont you think we could get up races at clavering mamma miss amory asked yes we must have them there again there were races there in the old times the good old times its a national amusement you know and we could have a clavering ball and we might have dances for the tenantry and rustic sports in the parkoh it would be charming  capital fun said mamma wouldnt it major  the turf is a very expensive amusement my dear lady major pendennis answered with such a rueful face that the begum rallied him and asked laughingly whether he had lost money on the race  after a slumber of about an hour and a half the heir of the house began to exhibit symptoms of wakefulness stretching his youthful arms over the majors face and kicking his sisters knees as she sate opposite to him when the amiable youth was quite restored to consciousness he began a sprightly conversation  i say ma he said ive gone and done it this time i have  what have you gone and done franky dear asked mamma  how much is seventeen halfcrowns two pound and halfa crown aint it i drew borax in our lottery but i bought podasokus and manmilliner of leggat minor for two open tarts and a bottle of gingerbeer  you little wicked gambling creature how dare you begin so soon cried miss amory  hold your tongue if you please who ever asked your leave miss the brother said and i say ma  well franky dear  youll tip me all the same you know when i go back and here he broke out into a laugh i say ma shall i tell you something  the begum expressed her desire to hear this something and her son and heir continued  when me and strong was down at the grand stand after the race and i was talking to leggat minor who was there with his governor i saw pa look as savage as a bear and i say ma leggat minor told me that he heard his governor say that pa had lost seven thousand backing the favourite ill never back the favourite when im of age no nohang me if i do leave me alone strong will you  captain strong captain strong is this true cried out the unfortunate begum has sir francis been betting again he promised me he wouldnt he gave me his word of honour he wouldnt  strong from his place on the box had overheard the end of young claverings communication and was trying in vain to stop his unlucky tongue  im afraid its true maam he said turning round i deplore the loss as much as you can he promised me as he promised you but the play is too strong for him he cant refrain from it  lady clavering at this sad news burst into a fit of tears she deplored her wretched fate as the most miserable of women she declared she would separate and pay no more debts for the ungrateful man she narrated with tearful volubility a score of stories only too authentic which showed how her husband had deceived and how constantly she had befriended him and in this melancholy condition whilst young hopeful was thinking about the two guineas which he himself had won and the major revolving in his darkened mind whether certain plans which he had been forming had better not be abandoned the splendid carriage drove up at length to the begums house in grosvenor place the idlers and boys lingering about the place to witness according to public wont the close of the derby day cheering the carriage as it drew up and envying the happy folks who descended from it  and its for the son of this man that i am made a beggar blanche said quivering with anger as she walked upstairs leaning on the majors armfor this cheatfor this blacklegfor this liarfor this robber of women  calm yourself my dear miss blanche the old gentleman said i pray calm yourself you have been hardly treated most unjustly but remember that you have always a friend in me and trust to an old fellow who will try and serve you  and the young lady and the heir of the hopeful house of clavering having retired to their beds the remaining three of the epsom party remained for some time in deep consultation     chapter lx explanations   almost a year as the reader will perceive has passed since an event described a few pages back arthurs black coat is about to be exchanged for a blue one his person has undergone other more pleasing and remarkable changes his wig has been laid aside and his hair though somewhat thinner has returned to public view and he has had the honour of appearing at court in the uniform of a cornet of the clavering troop of the shire yeomanry cavalry being presented to the sovereign by the marquis of steyne  this was a measure strongly and pathetically urged by arthurs uncle the major would not hear of a year passing before this ceremony of gentlemanhood was gone through the old gentleman thought that his nephew should belong to some rather more select club than the megatherium and has announced everywhere in the world his disappointment that the young mans property has turned out not by any means as well as he could have hoped and is under fifteen hundred a year  that is the amount at which pendenniss property is set down in the worldwhere his publishers begin to respect him much more than formerly and where even mammas are by no means uncivil to him for if the pretty daughters are naturally to marry people of very different expectationsat any rate he will be eligible for the plain ones and if the brilliant and fascinating myra is to hook an earl poor little beatrice who has one shoulder higher than the other must hang on to some boor through life and why should not mr pendennis be her support in the very first winter after the accession to his mothers fortune mrs hawxby in a countryhouse caused her beatrice to learn billiards from mr pendennis and would be driven by nobody but him in the pony carriage because he was literary and her beatrice was literary too and declared that the young man under the instigation of his horrid old uncle had behaved most infamously in trifling with beatrices feelings the truth is the old gentleman who knew mrs hawxbys character and how desperately that lady would practise upon unwary young men had come to the countryhouse in question and carried arthur out of the danger of her immediate claws though not out of the reach of her tongue the elder pendennis would have had his nephew pass a part of the christmas at clavering whither the family had returned but arthur had not the heart for that clavering was too near poor old fairoaks and that was too full of sad recollections for the young man  we have lost sight of the claverings too until their reappearance upon the epsom raceground and must give a brief account of them in the interval during the past year the world has not treated any member of the clavering family very kindly lady clavering one of the bestnatured women that ever enjoyed a good dinner or made a slip in grammar has had her appetite and goodnature sadly tried by constant family grievances and disputes such as make the efforts of the best french cook unpalatable and the most delicatelystuffed sofacushion hard to lie on id rather have a turnip strong for dessert than that pineapple and all them muscatel grapes from clavering says poor lady clavering looking at her dinnertable and confiding her grief to her faithful friend if i could but have a little quiet to eat it with oh how much happier i was when i was a widow and before all this money fell in to me  the clavering family had indeed made a false start in life and had got neither conduct nor position nor thanks for the hospitalities which they administered nor a return of kindness from the people whom they entertained the success of their first london season was doubtful and their failure afterwards notorious human patience was not great enough to put up with sir francis clavering people said he was too hopelessly low dull and disreputable you could not say what but there was a taint about the house and its entourages who was the begum with her money and without her hs and where did she come from what an extraordinary little piece of conceit the daughter was with her gallicised graces and daring affectations not fit for wellbred english girls to associate with what strange people were those they assembled round about them sir francis clavering was a gambler living notoriously in the society of blacklegs and profligates hely clinker who was in his regiment said that he not only cheated at cards but showed the white feather what could lady rockminster have meant by taking her up after the first season indeed lady rockminster who had taken up lady clavering put her down the great ladies would not take their daughters to her parties the young men who attended them behaved with the most odious freedom and scornful familiarity and poor lady clavering herself avowed that she was obliged to take what she called the canal into her parlour because the tiptops wouldnt come  she had not the slightest illwill towards the canal the poor dear lady or any pride about herself or idea that she was better than her neighbour but she had taken implicitly the orders which on her entry into the world her social godmother had given her she had been willing to know whom they knew and ask whom they asked the canal in fact was much pleasanter than what is called society but as we said before that to leave a mistress is easy while on the contrary to be left by her is cruel so you may give up society without any great pang or anything but a sensation of relief at the parting but severe are the mortifications and pains you have if society gives up you  one young man of fashion we have mentioned who at least it might have been expected would have been found faithful amongst the faithless and harry foker esq was indeed that young man but he had not managed matters with prudence and the unhappy passion at first confided to pen became notorious and ridiculous to the town was carried to the ears of his weak and fond mother and finally brought under the cognisance of the baldheaded and inflexible foker senior  when mr foker learned this disagreeable news there took place between him and his son a violent and painful scene which ended in the poor little gentlemans banishment from england for a year with a positive order to return at the expiration of that time and complete his marriage with his cousin or to retire into private life and three hundred a year altogether and never see parent or brewery more mr henry foker went away then carrying with him that grief and care which passes free at the strictest customhouses and which proverbially accompanies the exile and with this crape over his eyes even the parisian boulevard looked melancholy to him and the sky of italy black  to sir francis clavering that year was a most unfortunate one the events described in the last chapter came to complete the ruin of the year it was that year of grace in which as our sporting readers may remember lord harrowhills horse he was a classical young nobleman and named his stud out of the iliadwhen podasokus won the derby to the dismay of the knowing ones who pronounced the winning horses name in various extraordinary ways and who backed borax who was nowhere in the race sir francis clavering who was intimate with some of the most rascally characters of the turf and of course had valuable information had laid heavy odds against the winning horse and backed the favourite freely and the result of his dealings was as his son correctly stated to poor lady clavering a loss of seven thousand pounds  indeed it was a cruel blow upon the lady who had discharged her husbands debts many times over who had received as many times his oaths and promises of amendment who had paid his moneylenders and horsedealers who had furnished his town and country houses and who was called upon now instantly to meet this enormous sum the penalty of her cowardly husbands extravagance  it has been described in former pages how the elder pendennis had become the adviser of the clavering family and in his quality of intimate friend of the house had gone over every room of ii and even seen that ugly closet which we all of us have and in which according to the proverb the family skeleton is locked up about the baronets pecuniary matters if the major did not know it was because clavering himself did not know them and hid them from himself and others in such a hopeless entanglement of lies that it was impossible for adviser or attorney or principal to get an accurate knowledge of his affairs but concerning lady clavering the major was much better informed and when the unlucky mishap of the derby arose he took upon himself to become completely and thoroughly acquainted with all her means whatsoever they were and was now accurately informed of the vast and repeated sacrifices which the widow amory had made in behalf of her present husband  he did not concealand he had won no small favour from miss blanche by avowing ithis opinion that lady claverings daughter had been hardly treated at the expense of her son by her second marriage and in his conversations with lady clavering had fairly hinted that he thought miss blanche ought to have a better provision we have said that he had already given the widow to understand that he knew all the particulars of her early and unfortunate history having been in india at the time whenwhen the painful circumstances occurred which had ended in her parting from her first husband he could tell her where to find the calcutta newspaper which contained the account of amorys trial and he showed and the begum was not a little grateful to him for his forbearance how being aware all along of this mishap which had befallen her he had kept all knowledge of it to himself and been constantly the friend of her family  interested motives my dear lady clavering he said of course i may have had we all have interested motives and mine i dont conceal from you was to make a marriage between my nephew and your daughter to which lady clavering perhaps with some surprise that the major should choose her family for a union with his own said she was quite willing to consent  but frankly he said my dear lady my boy has but five hundred a year and a wife with ten thousand pounds to her fortune would scarcely better him we could do better for him than that permit me to say and he is a shrewd cautious young fellow who has sown his wild oats nowwho has very good parts and plenty of ambitionand whose object in marrying is to better himself if you and sir francis choseand sir francis take my word for it will refuse you nothingyou could put arthur in a way to advance very considerably in the world and show the stuff which he has in him of what use is that seat in parliament to clavering who scarcely ever shows his face in the house or speaks a word there im told by gentlemen who heard my boy at oxbridge that he was famous as an orator begadand once put his foot into the stirrup and mount him ive no doubt he wont be the last of the field maam ive tested the chap and know him pretty well i think he is much too lazy and careless and flighty a fellow to make a jogtrot journey and arrive as your lawyers do at the end of their lives but give him a start and good friends and an opportunity and take my word for it hell make himself a name that his sons shall be proud of i dont see any way for a fellow like him to parvenir but by making a prudent marriagenot with a beggarly heiressto sit down for life upon a miserable fifteen hundred a yearbut with somebody whom he can help and who can help him forward in the world and whom he can give a good name and a station in the country begad in return for the advantages which she brings him it would be better for you to have a distinguished soninlaw than to keep your husband on in parliament whos of no good to himself or to anybody else there and thats i say why ive been interested about you and offer you what i think a good bargain for both  you know i look upon arthur as one of the family almost now said the goodnatured begum he comes and goes when he likes and the more i think of his dear mother the more i see theres few people so goodnone so good to me and im sure i cried when i heard of her death and would have gone into mourning for her myself only black dont become me and i know who his mother wanted him to marrylaura i meanwhom old lady rockminster has taken such a fancy to and no wonder shes a better girl than my girl i know both and my betsyblanche i meanaint been a comfort to me major its laura pen ought to marry  marry on five hundred a year my dear good soul you are mad major pendennis said think over what i have said to you do nothing in your affairs with that unhappy husband of yours without consulting me and remember that old pendennis is always your friend  for some time previous pens uncle had held similar language to miss amory he had pointed out to her the convenience of the match which he had at heart and was bound to say that mutual convenience was of all things the very best in the world to marry uponthe only thing look at your lovemarriages my dear young creature the lovematch people are the most notorious of all for quarrelling afterwards and a girl who runs away with jack to gretna green constantly runs away with tom to switzerland afterwards the great point in marriage is for people to agree to be useful to one another the lady brings the means and the gentleman avails himself of them my boys wife brings the horse and begad pen goes in and wins the plate thats what i call a sensible union a couple like that have something to talk to each other about when they come together if you had cupid himself to talk toif blanche and pen were cupid and psyche begadtheyd begin to yawn after a few evenings if they had nothing but sentiment to speak on  as for miss amory she was contented enough with pen as long as there was nobody better and how many other young ladies are like herand how many lovemarriages carry on well to the lastand how sentimental firms do not finish in bankruptcyand how many heroic passions dont dwindle down into despicable indifference or end in shameful defeat  these views of life and philosophy the major was constantly according to his custom inculcating to pen whose mind was such that he could see the right on both sides of many questions and comprehending the sentimental life which was quite out of the reach of the honest majors intelligence could understand the practical life too and accommodate himself or think he could accommodate himself to it so it came to pass that during the spring succeeding his mothers death he became a good deal under the influence of his uncles advice and domesticated in lady claverings house and in a measure was accepted by miss amory without being a suitor and was received without being engaged the young people were extremely familiar without being particularly sentimental and met and parted with each other in perfect goodhumour and i thought pendennis am the fellow who eight years ago had a grand passion and last year was raging in a fever about briseis  yes it was the same pendennis and time had brought to him as to the rest of us its ordinary consequences consolations developments we alter very little when we talk of this man or that woman being no longer the same person whom we remember in youth and remark of course to deplore changes in our friends we dont perhaps calculate that circumstance only brings out the latent defect or quality and does not create it the selfish languor and indifference of todays possession is the consequence of the selfish ardour of yesterdays pursuit the scorn and weariness which cries vanitas vanitatum is but the lassitude of the sick appetite palled with pleasure the insolence of the successful parvenu is only the necessary continuance of the career of the needy struggler our mental changes are like our grey hairs or our wrinklesbut the fulfilment of the plan of mortal growth and decay that which is snowwhite now was glossy black once that which is sluggish obesity today was boisterous rosy health a few years back that calm weariness benevolent resigned and disappointed was ambition fierce and violent but a few years since and has only settled into submissive repose after many a battle and defeat lucky he who can bear his failure so generously and give up his broken sword to fate the conqueror with a manly and humble heart are you not awestricken you friendly reader who taking the page up for a moments light reading lay it down perchance for a graver reflectionto think how you who have consummated your success or your disaster may be holding marked station or a hopeless and nameless place in the crowdwho have passed through how many struggles of defeat success crime remorse to yourself only knownwho may have loved and grown cold wept and laughed again how oftento think how you are the same you whom in childhood you remember before the voyage of life began it has been prosperous and you are riding into port the people huzzaing and the guns salutingand the lucky captain bows from the ships side and there is a care under the star on his breast which nobody knows of or you are wrecked and lashed hopeless to a solitary spar out at seathe sinking man and the successful one are thinking each about home very likely and remembering the time when they were children alone on the hopeless spar drowning out of sight alone in the midst of the crowd applauding you     chapter lxi conversations    our goodnatured begum was at first so much enraged at this last instance of her husbands duplicity and folly that she refused to give sir francis clavering any aid in order to meet his debts of honour and declared that she would separate from him and leave him to the consequences of his incorrigible weakness and waste after that fatal days transactions at the derby the unlucky gambler was in such a condition of mind that he was disposed to avoid everybody alike his turfassociates with whom he had made the debts which he trembled lest he should not have the means of paying and his wife his longsuffering banker on whom he reasonably doubted whether he should be allowed any longer to draw when lady clavering asked the next morning whether sir francis was in the house she received answer that he had not returned that night but had sent a messenger to his valet ordering him to forward clothes and letters by the bearer strong knew that he should have a visit or a message from him in the course of that or the subsequent day and accordingly got a note beseeching him to call upon his distracted friend f c at short hotel blackfriars and ask for mr francis there for the baronet was a gentleman of that peculiarity of mind that he would rather tell a lie than not and always began a contest with fortune by running away and hiding himself the boots of mr shorts establishment who carried claverings message to grosvenor place and brought back his carpetbag was instantly aware who was the owner of the bag and he imparted his information to the footman who was laying the breakfasttable who carried down the news to the servantshall who took it to mrs bonner my ladys housekeeper and confidential maid who carried it to my lady and thus every single person in the grosvenor place establishment knew that sir francis was in hiding under the name of francis at an inn in the blackfriars road and sir franciss coachman told the news to other gentlemens coachmen who carried it to their masters and to the neighbouring tattersalls where very gloomy anticipations were formed that sir francis clavering was about to make a tour in the levant  in the course of that day the number of letters addressed to sir francis clavering bart which found their way to his halltable was quite remarkable the french cook sent in his account to my lady the tradesmen who supplied her ladyships table and messrs finer and gimcrack the mercers and ornamental dealers and madame crinoline the eminent milliner also forwarded their little bills to her ladyship in company with miss amorys private and by no means inconsiderable account at each establishment  in the afternoon of the day after the derby when strong after a colloquy with his principal at shorts hotel whom he found crying and drinking curacoa called to transact business according to his custom at grosvenor place he found all these suspicious documents ranged in the baronets study and began to open them and examine them with a rueful countenance  mrs bonner my ladys maid and housekeeper came down upon him whilst engaged in this occupation mrs bonner a part of the family and as necessary to her mistress as the chevalier was to sir francis was of course on lady claverings side in the dispute between her and her husband and as by duty bound even more angry than her ladyship herself  she wont pay if she takes my advice mrs bonner said youll please to go back to sir francis captainand he lurking about in a low publichouse and dont dare to face his wife like a manand say that we wont pay his debts no longer we made a man of him we took him out of gaol and other folks too perhaps weve paid his debts over and over againwe set him up in parliament and gave him a house in town and country and where he dont dare show his face the shabby sneak weve given him the horse he rides and the dinner he eats and the very clothes he has on his back and we will give him no more our fortune such as is left of it is left to ourselves and we wont waste any more of it on this ungrateful man well give him enough to live upon and leave him thats what well do and thats what you may tell him from susan bonner  susan bonners mistress hearing of strongs arrival sent for him at this juncture and the chevalier went up to her ladyship not without hopes that he should find her more tractable than her factotum mrs bonner many a time before had he pleaded his clients cause with lady clavering and caused her goodnature to relent he tried again once more he painted in dismal colours the situation in which he had found sir francis and would not answer for any consequences which might ensue if he could not find means of meeting his engagements  kill hisself laughed mrs bonner kill hisself will he dyings the best thing he could do strong vowed that he had found him with the razors on the table but at this in her turn lady clavering laughed bitterly hell do himself no harm as long as theres a shilling left of which he can rob a poor woman his lifes quite safe captain you may depend upon that ah it was a bad day that ever i set eyes on him  hes worse than the first man cried out my ladys aidedecamp he was a man he wasa wild devil but he

acheating of her and robbing of her and her money will go to keep a pack of rogues and swindlersi dont mean you captainyouve been a good friend to us enough bating we wish wed never set eyes on you  the chevalier saw from the words which mrs bonner had let slip regarding the diamonds that the kind begum was disposed to relent once more at least and that there were hopes still for his principal  upon my word maam he said with a real feeling of sympathy for lady claverings troubles and admiration for her untiring goodnature and with a show of enthusiasm which advanced not a little his graceless patrons causeanything you say against clavering or mrs bonner here cries out against me is no better than we deserve both of us and it was an unlucky day for you when you saw either he has behaved cruelly to you and if you were not the most generous and forgiving woman in the world i know there would be no chance for him but you cant let the father of your son be a disgraced man and send little frank into the world with such a stain upon him tie him down bind him by any promises you like i vouch for him that he will subscribe them  and break em said mrs bonner  and keep em this time cried out strong he must keep them if you could have seen how he wept maam oh strong he said to me its not for myself i feel now its for my boyits for the best woman in england whom i have

                            if youve the soul of a man clavering strong said to his principal when he recounted this scene to him youll keep your promise this time and so help me heaven if you break word with her ill turn against you and tell all  what all cried mr francis to whom his ambassador brought the news back at shorts hotel where strong found the baronet crying and drinking curacoa  psha do you suppose i am a fool burst out strong do you suppose i could have lived so long in the world frank clavering without having my eyes about me you know i have but to speak and you are a beggar tomorrow and i am not the only man who knows your secret  who else does gasped clavering  old pendennis does or i am very much mistaken he recognised the man the first night he saw him when he came drunk into your house  he knows it does he shrieked out clavering damn himkill him  youd like to kill us all wouldnt you old boy said strong with a sneer puffing his cigar  the baronet dashed his weak hand against his forehead perhaps the other had interpreted his wish rightly oh strong he cried if i dared id put an end to myself for im the dest miserable dog in all england its that that makes me so wild and reckless its that which makes me take to drink and he drank with a trembling hand a bumper of his fortifierthe curacoa and to live about with these thieves i know theyre thieves every one of em dd thieves andand how can i help itand i didnt know it you knowand by gad im innocentand until i saw the dd scoundrel first i knew no more about it than the deadand ill fly and ill go abroad out of the reach of the confounded hells and ill bury myself in a forest by gad and hang myself up to a treeand ohim the most miserable beggar in all england and so with more tears shrieks and curses the impotent wretch vented his grief and deplored his unhappy fate and in the midst of groans and despair and blasphemy vowed his miserable repentance  the honoured proverb which declares that to be an ill wind which blows good to nobody was verified in the case of sir francis clavering and another of the occupants of mr strongs chambers in shepherds inn the man was good by a lucky hap with whom colonel altamont made his bet and on the settling day of the derbyas captain clinker who was appointed to settle sir francis claverings book for him for lady clavering by the advice of major pendennis would not allow the baronet to liquidate his own money transactions paid over the notes to the baronets many creditorscolonel altamont had the satisfaction of receiving the odds of thirty to one in fifties which he had taken against the winning horse of the day  numbers of the colonels friends were present on the occasion to congratulate him on his luckall altamonts own set and the gents who met in the private parlour of the convivial wheeler my host of the harlequins head came to witness their comrades good fortune and would have liked with a generous sympathy for success to share in it now was the time tom driver had suggested to the colonel to have up the specie ship that was sunk in the gulf of mexico with the three hundred and eighty thousand dollars on board besides bars and doubloons the tredyddlums were very lowto be bought for an old songnever was such an opportunity for buying shares mr keightley insinuated and jack holt pressed forward his tobaccosmuggling scheme the audacity of which pleased the colonel more than any other of the speculations proposed to him then of the harlequins head boys there was jack rackstraw who knew of a pair of horses which the colonel must buy tom fleet whose satirical paper the swell wanted but two hundred pounds of capital to be worth a thousand a year to any manwith such a power and influence colonel you rogue and the entree of the greenrooms in london tom urged whilst little moss abiams entreated the colonel not to listen to these absurd fellows with their humbugging speculations but to invest his money in some good bills which moss could get for him and which would return him fifty per cent as safe as the bank of england  each and all of these worthies came round the colonel with their various blandishments but he had courage enough to resist them and to button up his notes in the pocket of his coat and go home to strong and sport the outer door of the chambers honest strong had given his fellowlodger good advice about all his acquaintances and though when pressed he did not mind frankly taking twenty pounds himself out of the colonels winnings strong was a great deal too upright to let others cheat him  he was not a bad fellow when in good fortune this altamont he ordered a smart livery for grady and made poor old costigan shed tears of quickly dried gratitude by giving him a fivepound note after a snug dinner at the back kitchen and he bought a green shawl for mrs bolton and a yellow one for fanny the most brilliant sacrifices of a regent street haberdashers window and a short time after this upon her birthday which happened in the month of june miss amory received from a friend a parcel containing an enormous brass inlaid writingdesk in which there was a set of amethysts the most hideous eyes ever looked upona musical snuffbox and two keepsakes of the year before last and accompanied with a couple of gown pieces of the most astounding colours the receipt of which goods made the sylphide laugh and wonder immoderately now it is a fact that colonel altamont had made a purchase of cigars and french silks from some duffers in fleet street about this period and he was found by strong in the open auction room in cheapside having invested some money in two desks several pairs of richlyplated candlesticks a dinner epergne and a bagatelleboard the dinner epergne remained at chambers and figured at the banquets there which the colonel gave pretty freely it seemed beautiful in his eyes until jack holt said it looked as if it had been taken in a bill and jack holt certainly knew  the dinners were pretty frequent at chambers and sir francis clavering condescended to partake of them constantly his own house was shut up the successor of mirobolant who had sent in his bills so prematurely was dismissed by the indignant lady clavering the luxuriance of the establishment was greatly pruned and reduced one of the large footmen was cashiered upon which the other gave warning not liking to serve without his mate or in a family where ony one footman was kep general and severe economical reforms were practised by the begum in her whole household in consequence of the extravagance of which her graceless husband had been guilty the major as her ladyships friend strong on the part of poor clavering her ladyships lawyer and the honest begum herself executed these reforms with promptitude and severity after paying the baronets debts the settlement of which occasioned considerable public scandal and caused the baronet to sink even lower in the worlds estimation than he had been before lady clavering quitted london for tunbridge wells in high dudgeon refusing to see her reprobate husband whom nobody pitied clavering remained in london patiently by no means anxious to meet his wifes just indignation and sneaked in and out of the house of commons whence he and captain raff and mr marker would go to have a game at billiards and a cigar or showed in the sporting publichouses or might be seen lurking about lincolns inn and his lawyers where the principals kept him for hours waiting and the clerks winked at each other as he sate in their office no wonder that he relished the dinners at shepherds inn and was perfectly resigned there resigned he was so happy nowhere else he was wretched amongst his equals who scorned himbut here he was the chief guest at the table where they continually addressed him with yes sir francis and no sir francis where he told his wretched jokes and where he quavered his dreary little french song after strong had sung his jovial chorus and honest costigan had piped his irish ditties such a jolly menage as strongs with gradys irishstew and the chevaliers brew of punch after dinner would have been welcome to many a better man than clavering the solitude of whose great house at home frightened him where he was attended only by the old woman who kept the house and his valet who sneered at him  yes dammit said he to his friends in shepherds inn that fellow of mine i must turn him away only i owe him two years wages curse him and cant ask my lady he brings me my tea cold of a morning with a demd leaden teaspoon and he says my ladys sent all the plate to the bankers because it aint safenow aint it hard that she wont trust me with a single teaspoon aint it ungentlemanlike altamont you know my ladys of low birththat isi beg your pardonhemthat is its most cruel of her not to show more confidence in me and the very servants begin to laughthe damn scoundrels i break every bone in their great hulking bodies curse em i willthey dont answer my bell andand my man was at vauxhall last night with one of my dressshirts and my velvet waistcoat on i know it was minethe confounded impudent blackguardand he went on dancing before my eyes confound him im sure hell live to be hangedhe deserves to be hangedall those infernal rascals of valets  he was very kind to altamont now he listened to the colonels loud stories when altamont described howwhen he was working his way home once from new zealand where he had been on a whaling expeditionhe and his comrades had been obliged to slink on board at night to escape from their wives by joveand how the poor devils put out in their canoes when they saw the ship under sail and paddled madly after her how he had been lost in the bush once for three months in new south wales when he was there once on a trading speculation how he had seen boney at saint helena and been presented to him with the rest of the officers of the indiaman of which he was a mateto all these tales and over his cups altamont told many of them and it must be owned lied and bragged a great deal sir francis now listened with great attention making a point of drinking wine with altamont at dinner and of treating him with every distinction  leave him alone i know what hes acoming to altamont said laughing to strong who remonstrated with him and leave me alone i know what im atelling very well i was officer on board an indiaman so i was i traded to new south wales so i did in a ship of my own and lost her i became officer to the nawaub so i did only me and my royal master have had a difference strongthats it whos the better or the worse for what i tell or knows anything about me the other chap is deadshot in the bush and his body reckonised at sydney if i thought anybody would split do you think i wouldnt wring his neck ive done as good before now strongi told you how i did for the overseer before i took leavebut in fair fight i meanin fair fight or rayther he had the best of it he had his gun and baynet and i had only an axe fifty of em saw itay and cheered me when i did itand id do it againhim wouldnt i i aint afraid of anybody and id have the life of the man who split upon me thats my maxim and pass me the liquoryou wouldnt turn on a man i know you youre an honest feller and will stand by a feller and have looked death in the face like a man but as for that lilylivered sneakthat poor lyin swindlin cringin cur of a claveringwho stands in my shoesstands in my shoes hang him ill make him pull my boots off and clean em i will ha ha here he burst out into a wild laugh at which strong got up and put away the brandybottle the other still laughed goodhumouredly youre right old boy he said you always keep your head cool you doand when i begin to talk too muchi say when i begin to pitch i authorise you and order you and command you to put away the rumbottle  take my counsel altamont strong said gravely and mind how you deal with that man dont make it too much his interest to get rid of you or who knows what he may do  the event for which with cynical enjoyment altamont had been on the lookout came very speedily one day strong being absent upon an errand for his principal sir francis made his appearance in the chambers and found the envoy of the nawaub alone he abused the world in general for being heartless and unkind to him he abused his wife for being ungenerous to him he abused strong for being ungratefulhundreds of pounds had he given ned strongbeen his friend for life and kept him out of gaol by joveand now ned was taking her ladyships side against him and abetting her in her infernal unkind treatment of him theyve entered into a conspiracy to keep me penniless altamont the baronet said they dont give me as much pocket money as frank has at school  why dont you go down to richmond and borrow of him clavering altamont broke out with a savage laugh he wouldnt see his poor old beggar of a father without pocketmoney would he  i tell you ive been obliged to humiliate myself cruelly clavering said look here sirlook here at these pawntickets fancy a member of parliament and an old english baronet by gad obliged to put a drawingroom clock and a buhl inkstand up the spout and a gold duckshead paperholder that i dare say cost my wife five pound for which theyd only give me fifteenandsix oh its a humiliating thing sir poverty to a man of my habits and its made me shed tears sirtears and that dd valet of minecurse him i wish he was hangedhe had the confounded impudence to threaten to tell my lady as the things in my own house werent my own to sell or to keep or fling out of window if i choseby gad the confounded scoundrel  cry a little dont mind cryin before meitll relieve you clavering the other said why i say old feller what a happy feller i once thought you and what a miserable son of a gun you really are  its a shame that they treat me so aint it clavering went onfor though ordinarily silent and apathetic about his own griefs the baronet could whine for an hour at a time andand by gad sir i havent got the money to pay the very cab thats waiting for me at the door and the porteress that mrs bolton lent me three shillins and i dont like to ask her for any more and i asked that dd old costigan the confounded old penniless irish miscreant and he hadnt got a shillin the beggar and campions out of town or else hed do a little bill for me i know he would  i thought you swore on your honour to your wife that you wouldnt put your name to paper said mr altamont puffing at his cigar  why does she leave me without pocketmoney then damme i must have money cried out the baronet oh am oh altamont im the most miserable beggar alive  youd like a chap to lend you a twentypound note wouldnt you now the other asked  if you would id be grateful to you for everfor ever my dearest friend cried clavering  how much would you give will you give a fiftypound bill at six months for half down and half in plate asked altamont  yes i would so help me and pay it on the day screamed clavering ill make it payable at my bankers ill do anything you like  well i was only chaffing you ill

months i take my oath i will  wellwelltheres the money sir francis clavering i aint a bad fellow when ive money in my pocket dammy i spend it like a man heres fiveandtwenty for you dont be losing it at the hells now dont be making a fool of yourself go down to clavering park and itll keep you ever so long you neednt ave butchers meat theres pigs i dare say on the premises and you can shoot rabbits for dinner you know every day till the game comes in besides the neighbours will ask you about to dinner you know sometimes for you are a baronet though you have outrun the constable and youve got this comfort that im off your shoulders for a good bit to comepraps this two yearsif i dont play and i dont intend to touch the confounded black and red and by that time my lady as you call herjimmy i used to saywill have come round again and youll be ready for me you know and come down handsomely to yours truly  at this juncture of their conversation strong returned nor did the baronet care much about prolonging the talk having got the money and he made his way from shepherds inn and went home and bullied his servant in a manner so unusually brisk and insolent that the man concluded his master must have pawned some more of the house furniture or at any rate have come into possession of some ready money                                       and yet ive looked over the house morgan and i dont thin he has took any more of the things sir franciss valet said to major pendenniss man as they met at their club soon after my lady locked up amost all the bejews afore she went away and he couldnt take away the picters and lookingglasses in a cab and he wouldnt spout the fenders and fireironshe aint so bad as that but hes got money somehow hes so damd imperent when he have a few nights ago i sor him at vauxhall where i was apolkin with lady hemly babewoods galsa wery pleasant room that is and an uncommon good lot in it hall except the ousekeeper and shes methodisticlei was apolkinyoure too old a cove to polk mr morganand eres your ealthand i appened to ave on some of claverings abberdashery and he sor it too and he didnt dare so much as speak a word  how about the house in st johns wood mr morgan asked  execution in itsold up heverythin ponies and pianna and brougham and all mrs montague were hoff to boulognenon est inwentus mr morgan its my belief she put the execution in herself and was tired of him  play much asked morgan  not since the smash when your governor and the lawyers and my lady and him had that tremendous scene he went down on his knees my lady told mrs bonner as told meand swear as he never more would touch a card or a dice or put his name to a bit of paper and my lady was agoin to give him the notes down to pay his liabilities after the race only your governor said which he wrote it on a piece of paper and passed it across the table to the lawyer and my lady that some one else had better book up for him for hed have kep some of the money hes a sly old cove your govnor  the expression of old cove thus flippantly applied by the younger gentleman to himself and his master displeased mr morgan exceedingly on the first occasion when mr lightfoot used the obnoxious expression his comrades anger was only indicated by a silent frown but on the second offence morgan who was smoking his cigar elegantly and holding it on the tip of his penknife withdrew the cigar from his lips and took his young friend to task  dont call major pendennis an old cove if youll ave the goodness lightfoot and dont call me an old cove nether such words aint used in society and we have lived in the fust society both at ome and foring weve been intimate with the fust statesmen of europe when we go abroad we dine with prince metternitch and louy philup reglar we go here to the best houses the tiptops i tell you we ride with lord john and the noble whycount at the edd of foring affairs we dine with the hearl of burgrave and are consulted by the marquis of steyne in everythink we ought to know a thing or two mr lightfoot youre a young man im an old cove as you say weve both seen the world and we both know that it aint money nor bein a baronet nor avin a town and country ouse nor a paltry five or six thousand a year  its ten mr morgan cried mr lightfoot with great animation  it may have been sir morgan said with calm severity it may have been mr lightfoot but it aint six now nor five sir its been doosedly dipped and cut into sir by the confounded extravygance of your master with his helbow shakin and his bill discountin and his cottage in the regency park and his many wickednesses hes a bad un mr lightfoota bad lot sir and that you know and it aint money sirnot such money as that at any rate come from a calcuttar attorney and i dussay wrung out of the pore starving blacksthat will give a pusson position in society as you know very well weve no money but we go everywhere theres not a housekeepers room sir in this town of any consiquince where james morgan aint welcome and it was me who got you into this club lightfoot as you very well know though i am an old cove and they would have blackballed you without me as sure as your name is frederic  i know they would mr morgan said the other with much humility  well then dont call me an old cove sir it aint gentlemanlike frederic lightfoot which i knew you when you was a cabboy and when your father was in trouble and got you the place you have now when the frenchman went away and if you think sir that because youre making up to mrs bonner who may have saved her two thousand poundand i dare say she has in fiveandtwenty years as she have lived confidential maid to lady claveringyet sir you must remember who put you into that service and who knows what you were before sir and it dont become you frederic lightfoot to call me an old cove  i beg your pardon mr morgani cant do more than make an apologywill you have a glass sir and let me drink your ealth  you

the clavering arms for a very little and thatll be no bad thing when the railroad runs through clavering and when we are there i hope youll come and see us mr morgan  its a stoopid place and no society said mr morgan i know it well in mrs pendenniss time we used to go down reglar and the hair refreshed me after the london racket  the railroad will improve mr arthurs property remarked lightfoot whats about the figure of it should you say sir  under fifteen hundred sir answered morgan at which the other who knew the extent of poor arthurs acres thrust his tongue in his cheek but remained wisely silent  is his man any good mr morgan lightfoot resumed  pidgeon aint used to society as yet but hes young and has good talents and has read a good deal and i dessay he will do very well replied morgan he wouldnt quite do for this kind of thing lightfoot for he aint seen the world yet  when the pint of sherry for which mr lightfoot called upon mr morgans announcement that he eclined to drink spirits had been discussed by the two gentlemen who held the wine up to the light and smacked their lips and winked their eyes at it and rallied the landlord as to the vintage in the most approved manner of connoisseurs morgans ruffled equanimity was quite restored and he was prepared to treat his young friend with perfect goodhumour  what dyou think about miss amory lightfoottell us in confidence nowdo you think we should do wellyou understandif we make miss a into mrs a p comprendy vous  she and her mas always quarrellin said mr lightfoot bonner is more than a match for the old lady and treats sir francis like thatlike this year spill which i fling into the grate but she darent say a word to miss amory no more dare none of us when a visitor comes in she smiles and languishes youd think that butter wouldnt melt in her mouth and the minute he is gone very likely she flares up like a little demon and says things fit to send you wild if mr arthur comes its do lets sing that there delightful song or come and write me them pooty verses in this halbum and very likely shes been arilin her mother or sticking pins into her maid a minute before she do stick pins into her and pinch her mary hann showed me one of her arms quite black and blue and i recklect mrs bonner whos as jealous of me as a old cat boxed her ears for showing me and then you should see miss at luncheon when theres nobody but the family she makes bleave she never heats and my you should only jest see her she has mary hann to bring her up plumcakes and creams into her bedroom and the cooks the only man in the house shes civil to bonner says how the second season in london mr soppington was agoin to propose for her and actially came one day and sor her fling a book into the fire and scold her mother so that he went down softly by the back droringroom door which he came in by and next thing we heard of him was he was married to miss rider oh shes a devil that little blanche and thats my candig apinium mr morgan  apinion not apinium lightfoot my good fellow mr morgan said with parental kindness and then asked of his own bosom with a sigh why the deuce does my governor want master arthur to marry such a girl as this and the teteatete of the two gentlemen was broken up by the entry of other gentlemen members of the clubwhen fashionable towntalk politics cribbage and other amusements ensued and the conversation became general  the gentlemans club was held in the parlour of the wheel of fortune publichouse in a snug little bylane leading out of one of the great streets of mayfair and frequented by some of the most select gentlemen about town their masters affairs debts intrigues adventures their ladies good and bad qualities and quarrels with their husbands all the family secrets were here discussed with perfect freedom and confidence and here when about to enter into a new situation a gentleman was enabled to get every requisite information regarding the family of which he proposed to become a member liveries it may be imagined were excluded from this select precinct and the powdered heads of the largest metropolitan footmen might bow down in vain entreating admission into the gentlemans club these outcast giants in plush took their beer in an outer apartment of the wheel of fortune and could no more get an entry into the clubroom than a pall mall tradesman or a lincolns inn attorney could get admission into bayss or spratts and it is because the conversation which we have permitted to overhear here in some measure explains the characters and bearings of our story that we have ventured to introduce the reader into a society so exclusive     chapter lxii the way of the world   a short time after the piece of good fortune which befell colonel altamont at epsom that gentleman put into execution his projected foreign tour and the chronicler of the polite world who goes down to london bridge for the purpose of taking leave of the people of fashion who quit this country announced that among the company on board the soho to antwerp last saturday were sir robert lady and the misses hodge mr serjeant kewsy and mrs and miss kewsy colonel altamont major coddy etc the colonel travelled in state and as became a gentleman he appeared in a rich travelling costume he drank brandyandwater freely during the passage and was not sick as some of the other passengers were and he was attended by his bodyservant the faithful irish legionary who had been for some time in waiting upon himself and captain strong in their chambers of shepherds inn  the chevalier partook of a copious dinner at blackwall with his departing friend the colonel and one or two others who drank many healths to altamont at that liberal gentlemans expense strong old boy the chevaliers worthy chum said if you want a little money nows your time im your man youre a good feller and have been a good feller to me and a twentypound note more or less will make no odds to me but strong said no he didnt want any money he was flush quite flushthat is not flush enough to pay you back your last loan altamont but quite able to carry on for some time to come and so with a not uncordial greeting between them the two parted had the possession of money really made altamont more honest and amiable than he had hitherto been or only caused him to seem more amiable in strongs eyes perhaps he really was better and money improved him perhaps it was the beauty of wealth strong saw and respected but he argued within himself this poor devil this unlucky outcast of a returned convict is ten times as good a fellow as my friend sir francis clavering bart he has pluck and honesty in his way he will stick to a friend and face an enemy the other never had courage to do either and what is it that has put the poor devil under a cloud he was only a little wild and signed his fatherinlaws name many a man has done worse and come to no wrong and holds his head up clavering does no he dont hold his head up he never did in his best days and strong perhaps repented him of the falsehood which he had told to the freehanded colonel that he was not in want of money but it was a falsehood on the side of honesty and the chevalier could not bring down his stomach to borrow a second time from his outlawed friend besides he could get on clavering had promised him some not that claverings promises were much to be believed but the chevalier was of a hopeful turn and trusted in many chances of catching his patron and waylaying some of those stray remittances and supplies in the procuring of which for his principal lay mr strongs chief business  he had grumbled about altamonts companionship in the shepherds inn chambers but he found those lodgings more glum now without his partner than with him the solitary life was not agreeable to his social soul and he had got into extravagant and luxurious habits too having a servant at his command to run his errands to arrange his toilets and to cook his meal it was rather a grand and touching sight now to see the portly and handsome gentleman painting his own boots and broiling his own mutton chop it has been before stated that the chevalier had a wife a spanish lady of vittoria who had gone back to her friends after a few months union with the captain whose head she broke with a dish he began to think whether he should not go back and see his juanita the chevalier was growing melancholy after the departure of his friend the colonel or to use his own picturesque expression was down on his luck these moments of depression and intervals of ill fortune occur constantly in the lives of heroes marius at minturme charles edward in the highlands napoleon before elba what great man has not been called upon to face evil fortune  from clavering no supplies were to be had for some time the fiveandtwenty pounds or the pony which the exemplary baronet had received from mr altamont had fled out of claverings keeping as swiftly as many previous ponies he had been down the river with a choice party of sporting gents who dodged the police and landed in essex where they put up billy bluck to fight dick the cabman whom the baronet backed and who had it all his own way for thirteen rounds when by an unlucky blow in the windpipe billy killed him its always my luck strong sir francis said the betting was three to one on the cabman and i thought myself as sure of thirty pound as if i had it in my pocket and dammy i owe my man lightfoot fourteen pound now which hes lent and paid for me and he duns methe confounded impudent blackguard and i wish to heaven i knew any way of getting a bill done or of screwing a little out of my lady ill give you half ned upon my soul and honour ill give you half if you can get anybody to do us a little fifty  but ned said sternly that he had given his word of honour as a gentleman that he would be no party to any future bill transactions in which her husband might engage who had given his word of honour too and the chevalier said that he at least would keep his word and would black his own boots all his life rather than break his promise and what is more he vowed he would advise lady clavering that sir francis was about to break his faith towards her upon the very first hint which he could get that such was claverings intention  upon this information sir francis clavering according to his custom cried and cursed very volubly he spoke of death as his only resource he besought and implored his dear strong his best friend his dear old ned not to throw him over and when he quitted his dearest ned as he went down the stairs of shepherds inn swore and blasphemed at ned as the most infernal villain and traitor and blackguard and coward under the sun and wished ned was in his grave and in a worse place only he would like the confounded ruffian to live until frank clavering had had his revenge out of him  in strongs chambers the baronet met a gentleman whose visits were now as it has been shown very frequent in shepherds inn mr samuel huxter of clavering that young fellow who had poached the walnuts in clavering park in his youth and had seen the baronet drive through the street at home with four horses and prance up to church with powdered footmen had an immense respect for his member and a prodigious delight in making his acquaintance he introduced himself with much blushing and trepidation as a clavering manson of mr huxter of the marketplacefather attended sir franciss keeper coxwood when his gun burst and took off three fingersproud to make sir franciss acquaintance all of which introduction sir francis received affably and honest huxter talked about sir francis to the chaps at bartholomews and told fanny in the lodge that after all there was nothing like a thoroughbred un a regular good old english gentleman one of the olden time to which fanny replied that she thought sir francis was an ojous creatureshe didnt know whybut she couldnt abear himshe was sure he was wicked and low and meanshe knew he was and when sam to this replied that sir francis was very affable and had borrowed half a sov of him quite kindly fanny burst into a laugh pulled sams long hair which was not yet of irreproachable cleanliness patted his chin and called him a stoopid stoopid old foolish stoopid and said that sir francis was always borrering money of everybody and that mar had actially refused him twice and had had to wait three months to get seven shillings which he had borrowed of er  dont say er but her borrer but borrow actially but actually fanny mr huxter repliednot to a fault in her argument but to grammatical errors in her statement  well then her and borrow and hactuallythere then you stoopid said the other and the scholar made such a pretty face that the grammar master was quickly appeased and would have willingly given her a hundred more lessons on the spot at the price which he took for that one  of course mrs bolton was by and i suppose that fanny and dr sam were on exceedingly familiar and confidential terms by this time and that time had brought to the former certain consolations and soothed certain regrets which are deucedly bitter when they occur but which are no more than toothpulling or any other pang eternal  as you sit surrounded by respect and affection happy honoured and flattered in your old age your foibles gently indulged your least words kindly cherished your garrulous old stories received for the hundredth time with dutiful forbearance and neverfailing hypocritical smiles the women of your house constant in their flatteries the young men hushed and attentive when you begin to speak the servants awestricken the tenants cap in hand and ready to act in the place of your worships horses when your honour takes a driveit has often struck you o thoughtful dives that this respect and these glories are for the main part transferred with your feesimple to your successorthat the servants will bow and the tenants shout for your son as for you that the butler will fetch him the wine improved by a little keeping thats now in your cellar and that when your night is come and the light of your life is gone down as sure as the morning rises after you and without you the sun of prosperity and flattery shines on your heir men come and bask in the halo of consols and acres that beams round about him the reverence is transferred with the estate of which with all its advantages pleasures respect and goodwill he in turn becomes the lifetenant how long do you wish or expect that your people will regret you how much time does a man devote to grief before he begins to enjoy a great man must keep his heir at his feast like a living memento mori if he holds very much by life the presence of the other must be a constant sting and warning make ready to go says the successor to your honour i am waiting and i could hold it as well as you  what has this reference to the possible reader to do with any of the characters of this history do we wish to apologise for pen because he has got a white hat and because his mourning for his mother is fainter all the lapse of years all the career of fortune all the events of life however strongly they may move or eagerly excite him never can remove that sainted image from his heart or banish that blessed love from its sanctuary if he yields to wrong the dear eyes will look sadly upon him when he dares to meet them if he does well endures pain or conquers temptation the ever present love will greet him he knows with approval and pity if he falls plead for him if he suffers cheer himbe with him and accompany him always until death is past and sorrow and sin are no more is this mere dreaming or on the part of an idle storyteller useless moralising may not the man of the world take his moment too to be grave and thoughtful ask of your own hearts and memories brother and sister if we do not live in the dead and to speak reverently prove god by love  of these matters pen and warrington often spoke in many a solemn and friendly converse in after days and pendenniss mother was worshipped in his memory and canonised there as such a saint ought to be lucky he in life who knows a few such women a kind provision of heaven it was that sent us such and gave us to admire that touching and wonderful spectacle of innocence and love and beauty  but as it is certain that if in the course of these sentimental conversations any outer stranger major pendennis for instance had walked into pens chambers arthur and warrington would have stopped their talk and chosen another subject and discoursed about the opera or the last debate in parliament or miss joness marriage with captain smith or what notso let us imagine that the public steps in at this juncture and stops the confidential talk between author and reader and begs us to resume our remarks about this world with which both are certainly better acquainted than with that other one into which we have just been peeping  on coming into his property arthur pendennis at first comported himself with a modesty and equanimity which obtained his friend warringtons praises though arthurs uncle was a little inclined to quarrel with his nephews meanness of spirit for not assuming greater state and pretensions now that he had entered on the enjoyment of his kingdom he would have had arthur installed in handsome quarters and riding on showy park hacks or in wellbuilt cabriolets every day i am too absent arthur said with a laugh to drive a cab in london the omnibus would cut me in two or i should send my horses head into the ladies carriagewindows and you wouldnt have me driven about by my servant like an apothecary uncle no major pendennis would on no account have his nephew appear like an apothecary the august representative of the house of pendennis must not so demean himself and when arthur pursuing his banter said and yet i dare say sir my father was proud enough when he first set up his gig the old major hemmed and had and his wrinkled face reddened with a blush as he answered you know what buonaparte said sir il faut laver son linge sale en famille there is no need sir for you to brag that your father was aa medical man he came of a most ancient but fallen house and was obliged to reconstruct the family fortunes as many a man of good family has done before him you are like the fellow in sterne sirthe marquis who came to demand his sword again your father got back yours for you you are a man of landed estate by gad sir and a gentlemannever forget you are a gentleman  then arthur slily turned on his uncle the argument which he had heard the old gentleman often use regarding himself in the society which i have the honour of frequenting through your introduction who cares to ask about my paltry means or my humble gentility uncle he asked it would be absurd of me to attempt to compete with the great folks and all that they can ask from us is that we should have a decent address and good manners  but for all that sir i should belong to a better club or two the uncle answered i should give an occasional dinner and select my society well and i should come out of that horrible garret in the temple sir and so arthur compromised by descending to the second floor in lamb court warrington still occupying his old quarters and the two friends being determined not to part one from the other cultivate kindly reader those friendships of your youth it is only in that generous time that they are formed how different the intimacies of after days are and how much weaker the grasp of your own hand after it has been shaken about in twenty years commerce with the world and has squeezed and dropped a thousand equally careless palms as you can seldom fashion your tongue to speak a new language after twenty the heart refuses to receive friendship pretty soon it gets too hard to yield to the impression  so pen had many acquaintances and being of a jovial and easy turn got more daily but no friend like warrington and the two men continued to live almost as much in common as the knights of the temple riding upon one horse for pens was at warringtons service and having their chambers and their servitor in common  mr warrington had made the acquaintance of pens friends of grosvenor place during their last unlucky season in london and had expressed himself no better satisfied with sir francis and lady clavering and her ladyships daughter than was the public in general the world is right george said about those people the young men laugh and talk freely before those ladies and about them the girl sees people whom she has no right to know and talks to men with whom no girl should have an intimacy did you see those two reprobates leaning over lady claverings carriage in the park the other day and leering under miss blanches bonnet no good mother would let her daughter know those men or admit them within her doors  the begum is the most innocent and goodnatured soul alive interposed pen she never heard any harm of captain blackball or read that trial in which charley lovelace figures do you suppose that honest ladies read and remember the chronique scandaleuse as well as you you old grumbler  would you like laura bell to know those fellows warrington asked his face turning rather red would you let any woman you loved be contaminated by their company i have no doubt that the poor begum is ignorant of their histories it seems to me she is ignorant of a great number of better things it seems to me that your honest begum is not a lady pen it is not her fault doubtless that she has not had the education or learned the refinements of a lady  she is as moral as lady portsea who has all the world at her balls and as refined as mrs bull who breaks the kings english and has half a dozen dukes at her table pen answered rather sulkily why should you and i be more squeamish than the rest of the world why are we to visit the sins of her father on this harmless kind creature she never did anything but kindness to you or any mortal soul as far as she knows she does her best she does not set up to be more than she is she gives you the best dinners she can buy and the best company she can get she pays the debts of that scamp of a husband of hers she spoils her boy like the most virtuous mother in england her opinion about literary matters to be sure is not much and i daresay she never read a line of wordsworth or heard of tennyson in her life  no more has mrs flanagan the laundress growled out pens mentor no more has betty the housemaid and i have no word of blame against them but a highsouled man doesnt make friends of these a gentleman doesnt choose these for his companions or bitterly rues it afterwards if he do are you who are setting up to be a man of the world and a philosopher to tell me that the aim of life is to guttle three courses and dine off silver do you dare to own to yourself that your ambition in life is good claret and that youll dine with any provided you get a stalled ox to feed on you call me a cynicwhy what a monstrous cynicism it is which you and the rest of you men of the world admit id rather live upon raw turnips and sleep in a hollow tree or turn backwoodsman or savage than degrade myself to this civilisation and own that a french cook was the thing in life best worth living for  because you like a raw beefsteak and a pipe afterwards broke out pen you give yourself airs of superiority over people whose tastes are more dainty and are not ashamed of the world they live in who goes about professing particular admiration or esteem or friendship or gratitude even for the people one meets every day if a asks me to his house and gives me his best i take his good things for what they are worth and no more i do not profess to pay him back in friendship but in the conventional money of society when we part we part without any grief when we meet we are tolerably glad to see one another if i were only to live with my friends your black muzzle old george is the only face i should see  you are your uncles pupil said warrington rather sadly and you speak like a worldling  and why not asked pendennis why not acknowledge the world i stand upon and submit to the conditions of the society which we live in and live by i am older than you george in spite of your grizzled whiskers and have seen much more of the world than you have in your garret here shut up with your books and your reveries and your ideas of oneandtwenty i say i take the world as it is and being of it will not be ashamed of it if the time is out of joint have i any calling or strength to set it right  indeed i dont think you have much of either growled pens interlocutor  if i doubt whether i am better than my neighbour arthur continued if i concede that i am no betteri also doubt whether he is better than i i see men who begin with ideas of universal reform and who before their beards are grown propound their loud plans for the regeneration of mankind give up their schemes after a few years of bootless talking and vainglorious attempts to lead their fellows and after they have found that men will no longer bear them as indeed they never were in the least worthy to be heard sink quietly into the ranksandfileacknowledging their aims impracticable or thankful that they were never put into practice the fiercest reformers grow calm and are faire to put up with things as they are the loudest radical orators become dumb quiescent placemen the most fervent liberals when out of power become humdrum conservatives or downright tyrants or despots in office look at the thiers look at guizot in opposition and in place look at the whigs appealing to the country and the whigs in power would you say that the conduct of these men is an act of treason as the radicals bawlwho would give way in their turn were their turn ever to come no only that they submit to circumstances which are stronger than theymarch as the world marches towards reform but at the worlds pace and the movements of the vast body of mankind must needs be slow forgo this scheme as impracticable on account of oppositionthat as immature because against the sense of the majorityare forced to calculate drawbacks and difficulties as well as to think of reforms and advancesand compelled finally to submit and to wait and to compromise  the right honourable arthur pendennis could not speak better or be more satisfied with himself if he was first lord of the treasury and chancellor of the exchequer warrington said  selfsatisfied why selfsatisfied continued pen it seems to me that my scepticism is more respectful and more modest than the revolutionary ardour of other folks many a patriot of eighteen many a spoutingclub orator would turn the bishops out of the house of lords tomorrow and throw the lords out after the bishops and throw the throne into the thames after the peers and the bench is that man more modest than i who takes these institutions as i find them and waits for time and truth to develop or fortify or if you like destroy them a college tutor or a noblemans toady who appears one fine day as my right reverend lord in a silk apron and a shovelhat and assumes benedictory airs over me is still the same man we remember at oxbridge when he was truckling to the tufts and bullying the poor undergraduates in the lectureroom an hereditary legislator who passes his time with jockeys and blacklegs and balletgirls and who is called to rule over me and his other betters because his grandfather made a lucky speculation in the funds or found a coal or tin mine on his property or because his stupid ancestor happened to be in command of ten thousand men as brave as himself who overcame twelve thousand frenchmen or fifty thousand indianssuch a man i say inspires me with no more respect than the bitterest democrat can feel towards him but such as he is he is a part of the old society to which we belong and i submit to his lordship with acquiescence and he takes his place above the best of us at all dinnerparties and there bides his time i dont want to chop his head off with a guillotine or to fling mud at him in the streets when they call such a man a disgrace to his order and such another who is good and gentle refined and generous who employs his great means in promoting every kindness and charity and art and grace of life in the kindest and most gracious manner an ornament to his rankthe question as to the use and propriety of the order is not in the least affected one way or other there it is extant among us a part of our habits the creed of many of us the growth of centuries the symbol of a most complicated traditionthere stand my lord the bishop and my lord the hereditary legislatorwhat the french call transactions both of themrepresenting in their present shape mailclad barons and doublesworded chiefs from whom their lordships the hereditaries for the most part dont descend and priests professing to hold an absolute truth and a divinely inherited power the which truth absolute our ancestors burned at the stake and denied there the which divine transmissible power still exists in printto be believed or not pretty much at choice and of these i say i acquiesce that they exist and no more if you say that these schemes devised before printing was known or steam was born when thought was an infant scared and whipped and truth under its guardians was gagged and swathed and blindfolded and not allowed to lift its voice or to look out or to walk under the sun before men were permitted to meet or to trade or to speak with each otherif any one says as some faithful souls do that these schemes are for ever and having been changed and modified constantly are to be subject to no further development or decay i laugh and let the man speak but i would have toleration for these as i would ask it for my own opinions and if they are to die i would rather they had a decent and natural than an abrupt and violent death  you would have sacrificed to jove warrington said had you lived in the time of the christian persecutions  perhaps i would said pen with some sadness perhaps i am a cowardperhaps my faith is unsteady but this is my own reserve what i argue here is that i will not persecute make a faith or a dogma absolute and persecution becomes a logical consequence and dominic burns a jew or calvin an arian or nero a christian or elizabeth or mary a papist or protestant or their father both or either according to his humour and acting without any pangs of remorsebut on the contrary notions of duty fulfilled make dogma absolute and to inflict or to suffer death becomes easy and necessary and mahomets soldiers shouting paradise paradise and dying on the christian spears are not more or less praiseworthy than the same men slaughtering a townful of jews or cutting off the heads of all prisoners who would not acknowledge that there was but one prophet of god  a little while since young one warrington said who had been listening to his friends confessions neither without sympathy nor scorn for his mood led him to indulge in both you asked me why i remained out of the strife of the world and looked on at the great labour of my neighbour without taking any part in the struggle why what a mere dilettante you own yourself to be in this confession of general scepticism and what a listless spectator yourself you are sixandtwenty years old and as blase as a rake of sixty you neither hope much nor care much nor believe much you doubt about other men as much as about yourself were it made of such pococuranti as you the world would be intolerable and i had rather live in a wilderness of monkeys and listen to their chatter than in a company of men who denied everything  were the world composed of saint bernards or saint dominies it would be equally odious said pen and at the end of a few scores of years would cease to exist altogether would you have every man with his head shaved and every woman in a cloistercarrying out to the full the ascetic principle would you have conventicle hymns twanging from every lane in every city in the world would you have all the birds of the forest sing one note and fly with one feather you call me a sceptic because i acknowledge what is and in acknowledging that be it linnet or lark or priest or parson be it i mean any single one of the infinite varieties of the creatures of god whose very name i would be understood to pronounce with reverence and never to approach but with distant awe i say that the study and acknowledgment of that variety amongst men especially increases our respect and wonder for the creator commander and ordainer of all these minds so different and yet so unitedmeeting in a common adoration and offering up each according to his degree and means of approaching the divine centre his acknowledgment of praise and worship each singing to recur to the bird simile his natural song  and so arthur the hymn of a saint or the ode of a poet or the chant of a newgate thief are all pretty much the same in your philosophy said george  even that sneer could be answered were it to the point pendennis replied but it is not and it could be replied to you that even to the wretched outcry of the thief on the tree the wisest and the best of all teachers we know of the untiring comforter and consoler promised a pitiful hearing and a certain hope hymns of saints odes of poets who are we to measure the chances and opportunities the means of doing or even judging right and wrong awarded to men and to establish the rule for meting out their punishments and rewards we are as insolent and unthinking in judging of mens morals as of their intellects we admire this man as being a great philosopher and set down the other as a dullard not knowing either or the amount of truth in either or being certain of the truth anywhere we sing te deum for this hero who has won a battle and de profundis for that other one who has broken out of prison and has been caught afterwards by the policeman our measure of rewards and punishments is most partial and incomplete absurdly inadequate utterly worldly and we wish to continue it into the next world into that next and awful world we strive to pursue men and send after them our impotent party verdicts of condemnation or acquittal we set up our paltry little rods to measure heaven immeasurable as if in comparison to that newtons mind or pascals or shakspeares was any loftier than mine as if the ray which travels from the sun would reach me sooner than the man who blacks my boots measured by that altitude the tallest and the smallest among us are so alike diminutive and pitifully base that i say we should take no count of the calculation and it is a meanness to reckon the difference  your figure fails there arthur said the other better pleased if even by common arithmetic we can multiply as we can reduce almost infinitely the great reckoner must take count of all and the small is not small or the great great to his infinity  i dont call those calculations in question arthur said i only say that yours are incomplete and premature false in consequence and by every operation multiplying into wider error i do not condemn the men who murdered socrates and damned galileo i say that they damned galileo and murdered socrates  and yet but a moment since you admitted the propriety of acquiescence in the present and i suppose all other tyrannies  no but that if an opponent menaces me of whom and without cost of blood and violence i can get rid i would rather wait him out and starve him out than fight him out fabius fought hannibal sceptically who was his roman coadjutor whom we read of in plutarch when we were boys who scoffed at the others procrastination and doubted his courage and engaged the enemy and was beaten for his pains  in these speculations and confessions of arthur the reader may perhaps see allusions to questions which no doubt have occupied and discomposed himself and which he has answered by very different solutions to those come to by our friend we are not pledging ourselves for the correctness of his opinions which readers will please to consider are delivered dramatically the writer being no more answerable for them than for the sentiments uttered by any other character of the story our endeavour is merely to follow out in its progress the development of the mind of a worldly and selfish but not ungenerous or unkind or truthavoiding man and it will be seen that the lamentable stage to which his logic at present has brought him is one of general scepticism and sneering acquiescence in the world as it is or if you like so to call it a belief qualified with scorn in all things extant the tastes and habits of such a man prevent him from being a boisterous demagogue and his love of truth and dislike of cant keep him from advancing crude propositions such as many loud reformers are constantly ready with much more of uttering downright falsehoods in arguing questions or abusing opponents which he would die or starve rather than use it was not in our friends nature to be able to utter certain lies nor was he strong enough to protest against others except with a polite sneer his maxim being that he owed obedience to all acts of parliament as long as they were not repealed  and to what does this easy and sceptical life lead a man friend arthur was a sadducee and the baptist might be in the wilderness shouting to the poor who were listening with all their might and faith to the preachers awful accents and denunciations of wrath or woe or salvation and our friend the sadducee would turn his sleek mule with a shrug and a smile from the crowd and go home to the shade of his terrace and muse over preacher and audience and turn to his roll of plato or his pleasant greek songbook babbling of honey and hybla and nymphs and fountains and love to what we say does this scepticism lead it leads a man to a shameful loneliness and selfishness so to speakthe more shameful because it is so goodhumoured and conscienceless and serene conscience what is conscience why accept remorse what is public or private faith mythuses alike enveloped in enormous tradition if seeing and acknowledging the lies of the world arthur as see them you can with only too fatal a clearness you submit to them without any protest further than a laugh if plunged yourself in easy sensuality you allow the whole wretched world to pass groaning by you unmoved if the fight for the truth is taking place and all men of honour are on the ground armed on the one side or the other and you alone are to lie on your balcony and smoke your pipe out of the noise and the danger you had better have died or never have been at all than such a sensual coward  the truth friend arthur said imperturbably where is the truth show it me that is the question between us i see it on both sides i see it on the conservative side of the house and amongst the radicals and even on the ministerial benches i see it in this man who worships by act of parliament and is rewarded with a silk apron and five thousand a year in that man who driven fatally by the remorseless logic of his creed gives up everything friends fame dearest ties closest vanities the respect of an army of churchmen the recognised position of a leader and passes over truthimpelled to the enemy in whose ranks he will serve henceforth as a nameless private soldieri see the truth in that man as i do in his brother whose logic drives him to quite a different conclusion and who after having passed a life in vain endeavours to reconcile an irreconcilable book flings it at last down in despair and declares with tearful eyes and hands up to heaven his revolt and recantation if the truth is with all these why should i take side with any one of them some are called upon to preach let them preach of these preachers there are somewhat too many methinks who fancy they have the gift but we cannot all be parsons in church that is clear some must sit silent and listen or go to sleep mayhap have we not all our duties the head charityboy blows the bellows the master canes the other boys in the organloft the clerk sings out amen from the desk and the beadle with the staff opens the door for his reverence who rustles in silk up to the cushion i wont cane the boys nay or say amen always or act as the churchs champion and warrior in the shape of the beadle with the staff but i will take off my hat in the place and say my prayers there too and shake hands with the clergyman as he steps on the grass outside dont i know that his being there is a compromise and that he stands before me an act of parliament that the church he occupies was built for other worship that the methodist chapel is next door and that bunyan the tinker is bawling out the tidings of damnation on the common hard by yes i am a sadducee and i take things as i find them and the world and the acts of parliament of the world as they are and as i intend to take a wife if i find onenot to be madly in love and prostrate at her feet like a foolnot to worship her as an angel or to expect to find her as suchbut to be goodnatured to her and courteous expecting goodnature and pleasant society from her in turn and so george if ever you hear of my marrying depend on it it wont be a romantic attachment on my side and if you hear of any good place under government i have no particular scruples that i know of which would prevent me from accepting your offer  o pen you scoundrel i know what you mean here warrington broke out this is the meaning of your scepticism of your quietism of your atheism my poor fellow youre going to sell yourself and heaven help you you are going to make a bargain which will degrade you and make you miserable for life and theres no use talking of it if you are once bent on it the devil wont prevent you  on the contrary hes on my side isnt he george said pen with a laugh what good cigars these are come down and have a little dinner at the club the chefs in town and hell cook a good one for me no you wont dont be sulky old boy im going down toto the country tomorrow     chapter lxiii which accounts perhaps for chapter lxi the information regarding the affairs of the clavering family which major pendennis had acquired through strong and by his own personal interference as the friend of the house was such as almost made the old gentleman pause in any plans which he might have once entertained for his nephews benefit to bestow upon arthur a wife with two such fathersinlaw as the two worthies whom the guileless and unfortunate lady clavering had drawn in her marriage ventures was to benefit no man and though the one in a manner neutralised the other and the appearance of amory or altamont in public would be the signal for his instantaneous withdrawal and condign punishmentfor the fugitive convict had cut down the officer in charge of himand a rope would be inevitably his end if he came again under british authorities yet no guardian would like to secure for his ward a wife whose parent was to be got rid of in such a way and the old gentlemans notion always had been that altamont with the gallows before his eyes would assuredly avoid recognition while at the same time by holding the threat of his discovery over clavering the latter who would lose everything by amorys appearance would be a slave in the hands of the person who knew so fatal a secret  but if the begum paid claverings debts many times more her wealth would be expended altogether upon this irreclaimable reprobate and her heirs whoever they might be would succeed but to an emptied treasury and miss amory instead of bringing her husband a good income and a seat in parliament would bring to that individual her person only and her pedigree with that lamentable note of sus per coll at the name of the last male of her line  there was however to the old schemer revolving these things in his mind another course yet open the which will appear to the reader who may take the trouble to peruse a conversation which presently ensued between major pendennis and the honourable baronet the member for clavering  when a man under pecuniary difficulties disappears from among his usual friends and equalsdives out of sight as it were from the flock of birds in which he is accustomed to sail it is wonderful at what strange and distant nooks he comes up again for breath i have known a pall mall lounger and rotten row buck of no inconsiderable fashion vanish from amongst his comrades of the clubs and the park and be discovered very happy and affable at an eighteenpenny ordinary in billingsgate another gentleman of great learning and wit when outrunning the constable were i to say he was a literary man some critics would vow that i intended to insult the literary profession once sent me his address at a little publichouse called the fox under the hill down a most darksome and cavernous archway in the strand such a man under such misfortunes may have a house but he is never in his house and has an address where letters may be left but only simpletons go with the hopes of seeing himonly a few of the faithful know where he is to be found and have the clue to his hidingplace so after the disputes with his wife and the misfortunes consequent thereon to find sir francis clavering at home was impossible ever since i hast him for my book which is fourteen pound he dont come home till three oclock and purtends to be asleep when i bring his water of a mornin and dodges hout when im downstairs mr lightfoot remarked to his friend morgan and announced that he should go down to my lady and be butler there and marry his old woman in like manner after his altercations with strong the baronet did not come near him and fled to other haunts out of the reach of the chevaliers reproachesout of the reach of conscience if possible which many of us try to dodge and leave behind us by changes of scene and other fugitive stratagems  so though the elder pendennis having his own ulterior object was bent upon seeing pens country neighbour and representative in parliament it took the major no inconsiderable trouble and time before he could get him into such a confidential state and conversation as were necessary for the ends which the major had in view for since the major had been called in as family friend and had cognisance of claverings affairs conjugal and pecuniary the baronet avoided him as he always avoided all his lawyers and agents when there was an account to be rendered or an affair of business to be discussed between them and never kept any appointment but when its object was the raising of money thus previous to catching this most shy and timorous bird the major made more than one futile attempt to hold himon one day it was a most innocentlooking invitation to dinner at greenwich to meet a few friends the baronet accepted suspected something and did not come leaving the major who indeed proposed to represent in himself the body of friends to eat his whitebait aloneon another occasion the major wrote and asked for ten minutes talk and the baronet instantly acknowledged the note and made the appointment at four oclock the next day at bayss precisely he carefully underlined the precisely but though four oclock came as in the course of time and destiny it could not do otherwise no clavering made his appearance indeed if he had borrowed twenty pounds of pendennis he could not have been more timid or desirous of avoiding the major and the latter found that it was one thing to seek a man and another to find him  before the close of that day in which strongs patron had given the chevalier the benefit of so many blessings before his face and curses behind his back sir francis clavering who had pledged his word and his oath to his wifes advisers to draw or accept no more bills of exchange and to be content with the allowance which his victimised wife still awarded him had managed to sign his respectable name to a piece of stamped paper which the baronets friend mr moss abrams had carried off promising to have the bill done by a party with whose intimacy mr abrams was favoured and it chanced that strong heard of this transaction at the place where the writings had been drawnin the backparlour namely of mr santiagos cigarshop where the chevalier was constantly in the habit of spending an hour in the evening  he is at his old work again mr santiago told his customer he and moss abrams were in my parlour moss sent out my boy for a stamp it must have been a bill for fifty pound i heard the baronet tell moss to date it two months back he will pretend that it is an old bill and that he forgot it when he came to a settlement with his wife the other day i dare say they will give him some more money now he is clear a man who has the habit of putting his unlucky name to promises to pay at six months has the satisfaction of knowing too that his affairs are known and canvassed and his signature handed round among the very worst knaves and rogues of london  mr santiagos shop was close by st jamess street and bury street where we have had the honour of visiting our friend major pendennis in his lodgings the major was walking daintily towards his apartment as strong burning with wrath and redolent of havanna strode along the same pavement opposite to him  confound these young men how they poison everything with their smoke thought the major here comes a fellow with mustachios and a cigar every fellow who smokes and wears mustachios is a low fellow oh its mr strongi hope you are well mr strong and the old gentleman making a dignified bow to the chevalier was about to pass into his house directing towards the lock of the door with trembling hand the polished doorkey  we have said that at the long and weary disputes and conferences regarding the payment of sir francis claverings last debts strong and pendennis had both been present as friends and advisers of the baronets unlucky family strong stopped and held out his hand to his brother negotiator and old pendennis put out towards him a couple of ungracious fingers  what is your good news said major pendennis patronising the other still further and condescending to address to him an observation for old pendennis had kept such good company all his life that he vaguely imagined he honoured common men by speaking to them still in town mr strong i hope i see you well  my news is bad news sir strong answered it concerns our friends at tunbridge wells and i should like to talk to you about it clavering is at his old tricks again major pendennis  indeed pray do me the favour to come into my lodging cried the major with awakened interest and the pair entered and took possession of his drawingroom here seated strong unburthened himself of his indignation to the major and spoke at large of claverings recklessness and treachery no promises will bind him sir he said you remember when we met sir with my ladys lawyer how he wouldnt be satisfied with giving his honour but wanted to take his oath on his knees to his wife and rang the bell for a bible and swore perdition on his soul if he ever would give another bill he has been signing one this very day sir and will sign as many more as you please for ready money and will deceive anybody his wife or his child or his old friend who has backed him a hundred times why theres a bill of his and mine will be due next week  i thought we had paid all  not that one strong said blushing he asked me not to mention it andandi had half the money for that major and they will be down on me but i dont care for it im used to it its lady clavering that riles me its a shame that that goodnatured woman who has paid him out of gaol a score of times should be ruined by his heartlessness a parcel of billstealers boxers any rascals get his money and he dont scruple to throw an honest fellow over would you believe it sir he took money of altamontyou know whom i mean  indeed of that singular man who i think came tipsy once to sir franciss house major pendennis said with impenetrable countenance who is altamont mr strong  i am sure i dont know if you dont know the chevalier answered with a look of surprise and suspicion  to tell you frankly said the major i have my suspicionsi supposemind i only supposethat in our friend claverings a lifewho between you and me captain strong we must own about as loose a fish as any in my acquaintancethere are no doubt some queer secrets and stories which he would not like to have known none of us would and very likely this fellow who calls himself altamont knows some story against clavering and has some hold on him and gets money out of him on the strength of his information i know some of the best men of the best families in england who are paying through the nose in that way but their private affairs are no business of mine mr strong and it is not to be supposed that because i go and dine with a man i pry into his secrets or am answerable for all his past life and so with our friend clavering i am most interested for his wifes sake and her daughters who is a most charming creature and when her ladyship asked me i looked into her affairs and tried to set them straight and shall do so again you understand to the best of my humble power and ability if i can make myself useful and if i am called uponyou understand if i am called uponandby the way this mr altamont mr strong how is this mr altamont i believe you are acquainted with him is he in town  i dont know that i am called upon to know where he is major pendennis said strong rising and taking up his hat in dudgeon for the majors patronising manner and impertinence of caution offended the honest gentleman not a little  pendenniss manner altered at once from a tone of hauteur to one of knowing goodhumour ah captain strong you are cautious too i see and quite right my good sir quite right we dont know what ears walls may have sir or to whom we may be talking and as a man of the world and an old soldieran old and distinguished soldier i have been told captain strongyou know very well that there is no use in throwing away your fire you may have your ideas and i may put two and two together and have mine but there are things which dont concern him that many a man had better not know eh captain and which i for one wont know until i have reason for knowing them and that i believe is your maxim too with regard to our friend the baronet i think with you it would be most advisable that he should be checked in his imprudent courses and most strongly reprehend any mans departure from his word or any conduct of his which can give any pain to his family or cause them annoyance in any way that is my full and frank opinion and i am sure it is yours  certainly said mr strong drily  i am delighted to hear it delighted that an old brother soldier should agree with me so fully and i am exceedingly glad of the lucky meeting which has procured me the good fortune of your visit good evening thank you morgan show the door to captain strong  and strong preceded by morgan took his leave of major pendennis the chevalier not a little puzzled at the old fellows prudence and the valet to say the truth to the full as much perplexed at his masters reticence for mr morgan in his capacity of accomplished valet moved here and there in a house as silent as a shadow and as it so happened during the latter part of his masters conversation with his visitor had been standing very close to the door and had overheard not a little of the talk between the two gentlemen and a great deal more than he could understand  who is that altamont know anything about him and strong mr morgan asked of mr lightfoot on the next convenient occasion when they met at the club  strongs his man of business draws the governors bills and indosses em and does his odd jobs and that and i suppose altamonts in it too mr lightfoot replied that kiteflying you know mr m always takes two or three on em to set the paper going altamont put the pot on at the derby and won a good bit of money i wish the governor could get some somewhere and i could get my book paid up  do you think my lady would pay his debts again morgan asked find out that for me lightfoot and ill make it worth your while my boy                                       major pendennis had often said with a laugh that his vale morgan was a much richer man than himself and indeed by long course of careful speculation this wary and silent attendant had been amassing a considerable sum of money during the year which he had passed in the majors service where he had made the acquaintance of many other valets of distinction from whom he had learned the affairs of their principals when mr arthur came into his property but not until then morgan had surprised the young gentleman by saying that he had a little sum of money some fifty or a hundred pound which he wanted to lay out to advantage perhaps the gentlemen in the temple knowing about affairs and business and that could help a poor fellow to a good investment morgan would be very much obliged to mr arthur most grateful and obliged indeed if arthur could tell him of one when arthur laughingly replied that he knew nothing about money matters and knew no earthly way of helping morgan the latter with the utmost simplicity was very grateful very grateful indeed to mr arthur and if mr arthur should want a little money before his rents was paid perhaps he would kindly remember that his uncles old and faithful servant had some as he would like to put out and be most proud if he could be useful anyways to any of the family  the prince of fairoaks who was tolerably prudent and had no need of ready money would as soon have thought of borrowing from his uncles servant as of stealing the valets pockethandkerchief and was on the point of making some haughty reply to morgans offer but was checked by the humour of the transaction morgan a capitalist morgan offering to lend to himthe joke was excellent on the other hand the man might be quite innocent and the proposal of money a simple offer of goodwill so arthur withheld the sarcasm that was rising to his lips and contented himself by declining mr morgans kind proposal he mentioned the matter to his uncle however and congratulated the latter on having such a treasure in his service  it was then that the major said that he believed morgan had been getting devilish rich for a devilish long time in fact he had bought the house in bury street in which his master was a lodger and had actually made a considerable sum of money from his acquaintance with the clavering family and his knowledge obtained through his master that the begum would pay all her husbands debts by buying up as many of the baronets acceptances as he could raise money to purchase of these transactions the major however knew no more than most gentlemen do of their servants who live with us all our days and are strangers to us so strong custom is and so pitiless the distinction between class and class  so he offered to lend you money did he the elder pendennis remarked to his nephew hes a devlish sly fellow and a devlish rich fellow and theres many a nobleman would like to have such a valet in his service and borrow from him too and he aint a bit changed monsieur morgan he does his work just as well as everhes always ready to my bellsteals about the room like a cathes so devlishly attached to me morgan  on the day of strongs visit the major bethought him of pens story and that morgan might help him and rallied the valet regarding his wealth with that free and insolent way which so highplaced a gentleman might be disposed to adopt towards so unfortunate a creature  i hear that you have got some money to invest morgan said the major  its mr arthur has been telling hang him thought the valet  im glad my place is such a good one  thank you sirive no reason to complain of my place nor of my master replied morgan demurely  youre a good fellow and i believe you are attached to me and im glad you get on well and i hope youll be prudent and not be taking a publichouse or that kind of thing  a publichouse thought morganme in a publichousethe old fooldammy if i was ten years younger id set in parlyment before i died that i wouldno thank you kindly sir i dont think of the public line sir and ive got my little savings pretty well put out sir  you do a little in the discounting way eh morgan  yes sir a very littleii beg your pardon sirmight i be so free as to ask a question  speak on my good fellow the elder said graciously  about sir francis claverings paper sir do you think hes any longer any good sir will my lady pay on em any more sir  what youve done something in that business already  yes sir a little replied morgan dropping down his eyes and i dont mind owning sir and i hope i may take the liberty of saying sir that a little more would make me very comfortable if it turned out as well as the last  why how much have you netted by him in gads name asked the major  ive done a good bit sir at it that i own sir having some information and made acquaintance with the famly through your kindness i put on the pot sir  you did what  i laid my money on siri got all i could and borrowed and bought sir franciss bills many of em had his name and the gentlemans as is just gone out edward strong esquire sir and of course i know of the blowhup and shindy as is took place in grosvenor place sir and as i may as well make my money as another id be very much obleeged to you if youd tell me whether my lady will come down any more  although major pendennis was as much surprised at this intelligence regarding his servant as if he had heard that morgan was a disguised marquis about to throw off his mask and assume his seat in the house of peers and although he was of course indignant at the audacity of the fellow who had dared to grow rich under his nose and without his cognisance yet he had a natural admiration for every man who represented money and success and found himself respecting morgan and being rather afraid of that worthy as the truth began to dawn upon him  well morgan said he i mustnt ask how rich you are and the richer the better for your sake im sure and if i could give you any information that could serve you i would speedily help you but frankly if lady clavering asks me whether she shall pay any more of sir franciss debts i shall advise and i hope she wont though i fear she willand that is all i know and so you are aware that sir francis is beginning again in hisehreckless and imprudent course  at his old games sircant prevent that gentleman he will do it  mr strong was saying that a mr moss abrams was the holder of one of sir francis claverings notes do you know anything of this mr abrams or the amount of the bill  dont know the bill know abrams quite well sir  i wish you would find out about it for me and i wish you would find out where i can see sir francis clavering morgan  and morgan said thank you sir yes sir i will sir and retired from the room as he had entered it with his usual stealthy respect and quiet humility leaving the major to muse and wonder over what he had just heard  the next morning the valet informed major pendennis that he had seen mr abrams what was the amount of the bill that gentleman was desirous to negotiate and that the baronet would be sure to be in the backparlour of the wheel of fortune tavern that day at one oclock  to this appointment sir francis clavering was punctual and as at one oclock he sate in the parlour of the tavern in question surrounded by spittoons windsor chairs cheerful prints of boxers trotting horses and pedestrians and the lingering of last nights tobacco fumesas the descendant of an ancient line sate in this delectable place accommodated with an old copy of bells life in london much blotted with beer the polite major pendennis walked into the apartment  so its you old boy asked the baronet thinking that mr moss abrams had arrived with the money  how do you do sir francis clavering i wanted to see you and followed you here said the major at sight of whom the others countenance fell  now that he had his opponent before him the major was determined to make a brisk and sudden attack upon him and went into action at once i know he continued who is the exceedingly disreputable person for whom you took me clavering and the errand which brought you here  it aint your business is it asked the baronet with a sulky and deprecatory look why are you following me about and taking the command and meddling in my affairs major pendennis ive never done you any harm have i ive never had your money and i dont choose to be dodged about in this way and domineered over i dont choose it and i wont have it if lady clavering has any proposal to make to me let it be done in the regular way and through the lawyers id rather not have you  i am not come from lady clavering the major said but of my own accord to try and remonstrate with you clavering and see if you can be kept from ruin it is but a month ago that you swore on your honour and wanted to get a bible to strengthen the oath that you would accept no more bills but content yourself with the allowance which lady clavering gives you all your debts were paid with that proviso and you have broken it this mr abrams has a bill of yours for sixty pounds  its an old bill i take my solemn oath its an old bill shrieked out the baronet  you drew it yesterday and you dated it three months back purposely by gad clavering you sicken me with lies i cant help telling you so ive no patience with you by gad you cheat everybody yourself included ive seen a deal of the world but i never met your equal at humbugging its my belief you had rather lie than not  have you come here you oldold beast to tempt me toto pitch into you andand knock your old head off said the baronet with a poisonous look of hatred at the major  what sir shouted out the old major rising to his feet and clasping his cane and looking so fiercely that the baronets tone instantly changed towards him  no no said clavering piteously i beg your pardon i didnt mean to be angry or say anything unkind only youre so damned harsh to me major pendennis what is it you want of me why have you been hunting me so do you want money out of me too by jove you know ive not got a shillingand so clavering according to his custom passed from a curse into a whimper  major pendennis saw from the others tone that clavering knew his secret was in the majors hands  ive no errand from anybody or no design upon you pendennis said but an endeavour if its not too late to save you and your family from utter ruin through the infernal recklessness of your courses i knew your secret  i didnt know it when i married her upon my oath i didnt know it till the dd scoundrel came back and told me himself and its the misery about that which makes me so reckless pendennis indeed it is the baronet cried clasping his hands  i knew your secret from the very first day when i saw amory come drunk into your diningroom in grosvenor place i never forget faces i remember that fellow in sydney a convict and he remembers me i know his trial the date of his marriage and of his reported death in the bush i could swear to him and i know that you are no more married to lady clavering than i am ive kept your secret well enough for ive not told a single soul that i know itnot your wife not yourself till now  poor lady c it would cut her up dreadfully whimpered sir francis and it wasnt my fault major you know it wasnt  rather than allow you to go on ruining her as you do i will tell her clavering and tell all the world too that is what i swear i will do unless i can come to some terms with you and put some curb on your infernal folly by play debt and extravagance of all kind youve got through half your wifes fortune and that of her legitimate heirs mindher legitimate heirs here it must stop you cant live together youre not fit to live in a great house like clavering and before three years more were over would not leave a shilling to carry on ive settled what must be done you shall have six hundred a year you shall go abroad and live on that you must give up parliament and get on as well as you can if you refuse i give you my word ill make the real state of things known tomorrow ill swear to amory who when identified will go back to the country from whence he came and will rid the widow of you and himself together and so that boy of yours loses at once all title to old spells property and it goes to your wifes daughter aint i making myself pretty clearly understood  you wouldnt be so cruel to that poor boy would you pendennis asked the father pleading piteously hang it think about him hes a nice boy though hes devlish wild i own hes devlish wild  its you who are cruel to him said the old moralist why sir youll ruin him yourself inevitably in three years  yes but perhaps i wont have such devlish bad luck you knowthe luck must turn and ill reform by gad ill reform and if you were to split on me it would cut up my wife so you know it would most infernally  to be parted from you said the old major with a sneer you know she wont live with you again  but why cant lady c live abroad or at bath or at tunbridge or at the doose and i go on here clavering continued i like being here better than abroad and i like being in parliament its devlish convenient being in parliament theres very few seats like mine left and if i gave it to em i should not wonder the ministry would give me an island to govern or some devlish good thing for you know im a gentleman of devlish good family and have a handle to my name andand that sort of thing major pendennis eh dont you see dont you think theyd give me something devlish good if i was to play my cards well and then you know id save money and be kept out of the way of the confounded hells and rouge et noirandand so id rather not give up parliament please for at one instant to hate and defy a man at the next to weep before him and at the next to be perfectly confidential and friendly with him was not an unusual process with our versatileminded baronet  as for your seat in parliament the major said with something of a blush on his cheek and a certain tremor which the other did not see you must part with that sir francis clavering toto me  what are you going into the house major pendennis  nonot i but my nephew arthur is a very clever fellow and would make a figure there and when clavering had two members his father might very likely have been one andand should like arthur to be there the major said  dammy does he know it too cried out clavering  nobody knows anything out of this room pendennis answered and if you do this favour for me i hold my tongue if not im a man of my word and will do what i have said  i say major said sir francis with a peculiarly humble smile youyou couldnt get me my first quarter in advance could you like the best of fellows you can do anything with lady clavering and upon my oath ill take up that bill of abrams the little dam scoundrel i know hell do me in the businesshe always does and if you could do this for me wed see major  and i think your best plan would be to go down in september to clavering to shoot and take my nephew with you and introduce him yes that will be the best time and we will try and manage about the advance arthur may lend him that thought old pendennis confound him a seat in parliament is worth a hundred and fifty pounds and clavering you understand of course my nephew knows nothing about this business you have a mind to retire he is a clavering man and a good representative for the borough you introduce him and your people vote for himyou see  when can you get me the hundred and fifty major when shall i come and see you will you be at home this evening or tomorrow morning will you have anything here theyve got some devlish good bitters in the bar i often have a glass of bitters it sets one up so  the old major would take no refreshment but rose and took his leave of the baronet who walked with him to the door of the wheel of fortune and then strolled into the bar where he took a glass of gin and bitters with the landlady there and a gentleman connected with the ring who boarded at the wheel of f coming in he and sir francis clavering and the landlord talked about the fights and the news of the sporting world in general and at length mr moss abrams arrived with the proceeds of the baronets bill from which his own handsome commission was deducted and out of the remainder sir francis stood a dinner at greenwich to his distinguished friend and passed the evening gaily at vauxhall  meanwhile major pendennis calling a cab in piccadilly drove to lamb court temple where he speedily was closeted with his nephew in deep conversation  after their talk they parted on very good terms and it was in consequence of that unreported conversation whereof the reader nevertheless can pretty well guess the bearing that arthur expressed himself as we have heard in the colloquy with warrington which is reported in the last chapter  when a man is tempted to do a tempting thing he can find a hundred ingenious reasons for gratifying his liking and arthur thought very much that he would like to be in parliament and that he would like to distinguish himself there and that he need not care much what side he took as there was falsehood and truth on every side and on this and on other matters he thought he would compromise with his conscience and that sadduceeism was a very convenient and goodhumoured profession of faith     chapter lxiv phyllis and corydon   on a picturesque common in the neighbourhood of tunbridge wells lady clavering had found a pretty villa whither she retired after her conjugal disputes at the end of that unlucky london season miss amory of course accompanied her mother and master clavering came home for the holidays with whom blanches chief occupation was to fight and quarrel but this was only a home pastime and the young schoolboy was not fond of home sports he found cricket and horses and plenty of friends at tunbridge the goodnatured begums house was filled with a constant society of young gentlemen of thirteen who ate and drank much too copiously of tarts and champagne who rode races on the lawn and frightened the fond mother who smoked and made themselves sick and the diningroom unbearable to miss blanche she did not like the society of young gentlemen of thirteen  as for that fair young creature any change as long as it was change was pleasant to her and for a week or two she would have liked poverty and a cottage and breadandcheese and for a night perhaps a dungeon and breadandwater and so the move to tunbridge was by no means unwelcome to her she wandered in the woods and sketched trees and farmhouses she read french novels habitually she drove into tunbridge wells pretty often and to any play or ball or conjurer or musician who might happen to appear in the place she slept a great deal she quarrelled with mamma and frank during the morning she found the little village school and attended it and first fondled the girls and thwarted the mistress then scolded the girls and laughed at the teacher she was constant at church of course it was a pretty little church of immense antiquitya little anglonorman bijou built the day before yesterday and decorated with all sorts of painted windows carved saints heads gilt scripture texts and open pews blanche began forthwith to work a most correct highchurch altarcover for the church she passed for a saint with the clergyman for a while whom she quite took in and whom she coaxed and wheedled and fondled so artfully that poor mrs smirke who at first was charmed with her then bore with her then would hardly speak to her was almost mad with jealousy mrs smirke was the wife of our old friend smirke pens tutor and poor helens suitor he had consoled himself for her refusal with a young lady from clapham whom his mamma provided when the latter died our friends views became every day more and more pronounced he cut off his coat collar and let his hair grow over his back he rigorously gave up the curl which he used to sport on his forehead and the tie of his neckcloth of which he was rather proud he went without any tie at all he went without dinner on fridays he read the roman hours and intimated that he was ready to receive confessions in the vestry the most harmless creature in the world he was denounced as a black and most dangerous jesuit and papist by muffin of the dissenting chapel and mr simeon knight at the old church mr smirke had built his chapelofease with the money left him by his mother at clapham lord lord what would she have said to hear a table called an altar to see candlesticks on it to get letters signed on the feast of saint soandso or the vigil of saint whatdoyoucallem all these things did the boy of clapham practise his faithful wife following him but when blanche had a conference of near two hours in the vestry with mr smirke belinda paced up and down on the grass where there were only two little gravestones as yet she wished that she had a third there only only he would offer very likely to that creature who had infatuated him in a fortnight no she would retire she would go into a convent and profess and leave him such bad thoughts had smirkes wife and his neighbours regarding him these thinking him in direct correspondence with the bishop of rome that bewailing errors to her even more odious and fatal and yet our friend meant no earthly harm the postoffice never brought him any letters from the pope he thought blanche to be sure at first the most pious gifted rightthinking fascinating person he had ever met and her manner of singing the chants delighted himbut after a while he began to grow rather tired of miss amory her ways and graces grew stale somehow then he was doubtful about miss amory then she made a disturbance in his school lost her temper and rapped the childrens fingers blanche inspired this admiration and satiety somehow in many men she tried to please them and flung out all her graces at once came down to them with all her jewels on all her smiles and cajoleries and coaxings and ogles then she grew tired of them and of trying to please them and never having cared about them dropped them and the men grew tired of her and dropped her too it was a happy night for belinda when blanche went away and her husband with rather a blush and a sigh said he had been deceived in her he had thought her endowed with many precious gifts he feared they were mere tinsel he thought she had been a rightthinking person he feared she had merely made religion an amusementshe certainly had quite lost her temper to the schoolmistress and beat polly ruckers knuckles cruelly belinda flew to his arms there was no question about the grave or the veil any more he tenderly embraced her on the forehead there is none like thee my belinda he said throwing his fine eyes up to the ceiling precious among women as for blanche from the instant she lost sight of him and belinda she never thought or cared about either any more  but when arthur went down to pass a few days at tunbridge wells with the begum this stage of indifference had not arrived on miss blanches part or on that of the simple clergyman smirke believed her to be an angel and wonder of a woman such a perfection he had never seen and sate listening to her music in the summer evenings openmouthed rapt in wonder tealess and breadandbutterless fascinating as he had heard the music of the opera to behe had never but once attended an exhibition of that nature which he mentioned with a blush and a sighit was on that day when he had accompanied helen and her son to the play at chatterishe could not conceive anything more delicious more celestial he had almost said than miss amorys music she was a most gifted being she had a precious soul she had the most remarkable talentsto all outward seeming the most heavenly disposition etc etc it was in this way that being then at the height of his own fever and bewitchment for blanche smirke discoursed to arthur about her  the meeting between the two old acquaintances had been very cordial arthur loved anybody who loved his mother smirke could speak on that theme with genuine feeling and emotion they had a hundred things to tell each other of what had occurred in their lives arthur would perceive smirke said that hishis views on church matters had developed themselves since their acquaintance mrs smirke a most exemplary person seconded them with all her endeavours he had built this little church on his mothers demise who had left him provided with a sufficiency of worldly means though in the cloister himself he had heard of arthurs reputation he spoke in the kindest and most saddened tone he held his eyelids down and bowed his fair head on one side arthur was immensely amused with him with his airs with his follies and simplicity with his blank stock and long hair with his real goodness kindness friendliness of feeling and his praises of blanche pleased and surprised our friend not a little and made him regard her with eyes of particular favour  the truth is blanche was very glad to see arthur as one is glad to see an agreeable man in the country who brings down the last news and stories from the great city who can talk better than most countryfolks at least can talk that darling london jargon so dear and indispensable to london people so little understood by persons out of the world the first day pen came down he kept blanche laughing for hours after dinner she sang her songs with redoubled spirit she did not scold her mother she fondled and kissed her to the honest begums surprise when it came to be bedtime she said deja with the prettiest air of regret possible and was really quite sorry to go to bed and squeezed arthurs hand quite fondly he on his side gave her pretty palm a very cordial pressure our young gentleman was of that turn that eyes very moderately bright dazzled him  she is very much improved thought pen looking out into the night very much i suppose the begum wont mind my smoking with the window open shes a jolly good old woman and blanche is immensely improved i liked her manner with her mother tonight i liked her laughing way with that stupid young cub of a boy whom they oughtnt to allow to get tipsy she sang those little verses very prettily they were devilish pretty verses too though i say it who shouldnt say it and he hummed a tune which blanche had put to some verses of his own ah what a fine night how jolly a cigar is at night how pretty that little saxon church looks in the moonlight i wonder what old warringtons doing yes shes a dayvlish nice little thing as my uncle says  oh heavenly here broke out a voice from a clematiscovered casement neara girls voice it was the voice of the author of mes larmes  pen burst into a laugh dont tell about my smoking he said leaning out of his own window  oh go on i adore it cried the lady of mes larmes heavenly night heavenly heavenly moon but i must shut my window and not talk to you on account of les moeurs how droll they are les moeurs adieu and pen began to sing the goodnight to don basilio  the next day they were walking in the fields together laughing and chatteringthe gayest pair of friends they talked about the days of their youth and blanche was prettily sentimental they talked about laura dearest laurablanche had loved her as a sister was she happy with that odd lady rockminster wouldnt she come and stay with them at tunbridge oh what walks they would take together what songs they would singthe old old songs lauras voice was splendid did arthurshe must call him arthurremember the songs they sang in the happy old days now he was grown such a great man and had such a succes etc etc  and the day after which was enlivened with a happy ramble through the woods to penshurst and a sight of that pleasant park and hall came that conversation with the curate which we have narrated and which made our young friend think more and more  is she all this perfection he asked himself has she become serious and religious does she tend schools and visit the poor is she kind to her mother and brother yes i am sure of that i have seen her and walking with his old tutor over his little parish and going to visit his school it was with inexpressible delight that pen found blanche seated instructing the children and fancied to himself how patient she must be how goodnatured how ingenuous how really simple in her tastes and unspoiled by the world  and do you really like the country he asked her as they walked together  i should like never to see that odious city again o arthurthat is mrwell arthur thenones good thoughts grow up in these sweet woods and calm solitudes like those flowers which wont bloom in london you know the gardener comes and changes our balconies once a week i dont think i shall bear to look london in the face againits odious smoky brazen face but heigho  why that sigh blanche  never mind why  yes i do mind why tell me tell me everything  i wish you hadnt come down and a second edition of mes soupirs came out  you dont want me blanche  i dont want you to go away i dont think this house will be very happy without you and thats why i wish that you never had come  mes soupirs were here laid aside and mes larmes had begun  ah what answer is given to those in the eyes of a young woman what is the method employed for drying them what took place o ringdoves and roses o dews and wildflowers o waving greenwoods and balmy airs of summer here were two battered london rakes taking themselves in for a moment and fancying that they were in love with each other like phillis and corydon  when one thinks of country houses and country walks one wonders that any man is left unmarried     chapter lxv temptation   easy and frankspoken as pendennis commonly was with warrington how came it that arthur did not inform the friend and depository of all his secrets of the little circumstances which had taken place at the villa near tunbridge wells he talked about the discovery of his old tutor smirke freely enough and of his wife and of his anglonorman church and of his departure from clapha to rome but when asked about blanche his answers were evasive or general he said she was a goodnatured clever little thing that rightly guided she make no such bad wife after all but that he had for the moment no intention of marriage that his days of romance were over that he was contented with his present lot and so forth  in the meantime there came occasionally to lamb court temple pretty little satin envelopes superscribed in the neatest handwriting and sealed with one of those admirable ciphers which if warrington had been curious enough to watch his friends letters or indeed if the cipher had been decipherable would have shown george that mr arthur was in correspondence with a young lady whose initials were b a to these pretty little compositions mr pen replied in his best and gallantest manner with jokes with news of the town with points of wit nay with pretty little verses very likely in reply to the versicles of the muse of mes larmes blanche we know rhymes with branch and stanch and launch and no doubt a gentleman of pens ingenuity would not forgo these advantages of position and would ring the pretty little changes upon these pleasing notes indeed we believe that those loveverses of mr pens which had such a pleasing success in the roseleaves that charming annual edited by lady violet lebas and illustrated by portraits of the female nobility by the famous artist pinkney were composed at this period of our heros life and were first addressed to blanche per post before they figured in print cornets as it were to pinkneys pictorial garland  verses are all very well the elder pendennis said who found pen scratching down one of these artless effusions at the club as he was waiting for his dinner and letterwriting if mamma allows it and between such old country friends of course there may be a correspondence and that sort of thingbut mind pen and dont commit yourself my boy for who knows what the doose may happen the best way is to make your letters safe i never wrote a letter in all my life that would commit me and demmy sir i have had some experience of women and the worthy gentleman growing more garrulous and confidential with his nephew as he grew older told many affecting instances of the evil results consequent upon this want of caution to many persons in societyhow from using too ardent expressions in some poetical notes to the widow naylor young spoony had subjected himself to a visit of remonstrance from the widows brother colonel flint and thus had been forced into a marriage with a woman old enough to be his mother how when louisa salter had at length succeeded in securing young sir john bird hopwood of the blues produced some letters which miss s had written to him and caused a withdrawal on birds part who afterwards was united to miss stickney of lyme regis etc the major if he had not reading had plenty of observation and could back his wise saws with a multitude of modern instances which he had acquired in a long and careful perusal of the great book of the world  pen laughed at the examples and blushing a little at his uncles remonstrances said that he would bear them in mind and be cautious he blushed perhaps because he had borne them in mind because he was cautious because in his letters to miss blanche he had from instinct or honesty perhaps refrained from any avowals which might compromise him dont you remember the lesson i had sir in lady mirabelsmiss fotheringays affair i am not to be caught again uncle arthur said with mock frankness and humility old pendennis congratulated himself and his nephew heartily on the latters prudence and progress and was pleased at the position which arthur was taking as a man of the world  no doubt if warrington had been consulted his opinion would have been different and he would have told pen that the boys foolish letters were better than the mans adroit compliments and slippery gallantries that to win the woman he loves only a knave or a coward advances under cover with subterfuges and a retreat secured behind him but pen spoke not on this matter to mr warrington knowing pretty well that he was guilty and what his friends verdict would be  colonel altamont had not been for many weeks absent on his foreign tour sir francis clavering having retired meanwhile into the country pursuant to his agreement with major pendennis when the ills of fate began to fall rather suddenly and heavily upon the sole remaining partner of the little firm of shepherds inn when strong at parting with altamont refused the loan proffered by the latter in the fulness of his purse and the generosity of his heart he made such a sacrifice to conscience and delicacy as caused him many an after twinge and pang he and feltit was not very many hours in his life he had experienced the feelingthat in this juncture of his affairs he had been too delicate and too scrupulous why should a fellow in want refuse a kind offer kindly made why should a thirsty man decline a pitcher of water from a friendly hand because it was a little soiled strongs conscience smote him for refusing what the other had fairly come by and generously proffered and he thought ruefully now it was too late that altamonts cash would have been as well in his pocket as in that of the gamblinghouse proprietor at baden or ems with whom his excellency would infallibly leave his derby winnings it was whispered among the tradesmen billdiscounters and others who had commercial dealings with captain strong that he and the baronet had parted company and that the captains paper was henceforth of no value the tradesmen who had put a wonderful confidence in him hithertofor who could resist strongs jolly face and frank and honest demeanournow began to pour in their bills with a cowardly mistrust and unanimity the knocks at the shepherds inn chambers door were constant and tailors bootmakers pastrycooks who had furnished dinners in their own persons or by the boys their representatives held levees on strongs stairs to these were added one or two persons of a less clamorous but far more sly and dangerous sortthe young clerks of lawyers namely who lurked about the inn or concerted with mr campions young man in the chambers hard by having in their dismal pocketbooks copies of writs to be served on edward strong requiring him to appear on an early day next term before our sovereign lady the queen and answer to etc etc  from this invasion of creditors poor strong who had not a guinea in his pocket had of course no refuge but that of the englishmans castle into which he retired shutting the outer and inner door upon the enemy and not quitting his stronghold until after nightfall against this outer barrier the foe used to come and knock and curse in vain whilst the chevalier peeped at them from behind the little curtain which he had put over the orifice of his letterbox and had the dismal satisfaction of seeing the faces of furious clerk and fiery dun as they dashed up against the door and retreated from it but as they could not be always at his gate or sleep on his staircase the enemies of the chevalier sometimes left him free  strong when so pressed by his commercial antagonists was not quite alone in his defence against them but had secured for himself an ally or two his friends were instructed to communicate with him by a system of private signals and they thus kept the garrison from starving by bringing in necessary supplies and kept up strongs heart and prevented him from surrendering by visiting him and cheering him in his retreat two of neds most faithful allies were huxter and miss fanny bolton when hostile visitors were prowling about the inn fannys little sisters were taught a particular cry or jodel which they innocently whooped in the court when fanny and huxter came up to visit strong they archly sang this same note at his door when that barrier was straightway opened the honest garrison came out smiling the provisions and the pot of porter were brought in and in the society of his faithful friends the beleaguered one passed a comfortable night there are some men who could not live under this excitement but strong was a brave man as we have said who had seen service and never lost heart in peril  but besides allies our general had secured for himself under difficulties that still more necessary aid a retreat it has been mentioned in a former part of this history how messrs costigan and bows lived in the house next door to captain strong and that the window of one of their rooms was not very far off the kitchenwindow which was situated in the upper story of strongs chambers a leaden waterpipe and gutter served for the two and strong looking out from his kitchen one day saw that he could spring with great ease up to the sill of his neighbours window and clamber up the pipe which communicated from one to the other he had laughingly shown this refuge to his chum altamont and they had agreed that it would be as well not to mention the circumstance to captain costigan whose duns were numerous and who would be constantly flying down the pipe into their apartments if this way of escape were shown to him  but now that the evil days were come strong made use of the passage and one afternoon burst in upon bows and costigan with his jolly face and explained that the enemy was in waiting on his staircase and that he had taken this means of giving them the slip so while mr markss aidesdecamp were in waiting in the passage of no 3 strong walked down the steps of no 4 dined at the albion went to the play and returned home at midnight to the astonishment of mrs bolton and fanny who had not seen him quit his chambers and could not conceive how he could have passed the line of sentries  strong bore this siege for some weeks with admirable spirit and resolution and as only such an old and brave soldier would for the pains and privations which he had to endure were enough to depress any man of ordinary courage and what vexed and riled him to use his own expression was the infernal indifference and cowardly ingratitude of clavering to whom he wrote letter after letter which the baronet never acknowledged by a single word or by the smallest remittance though a fivepound note as strong said at that time would have been a fortune to him  but better days were in store for the chevalier and in the midst of his despondency and perplexities there came to him a most welcome aid yes if it hadnt been for this good fellow here said strongfor a good fellow you are altamont my boy and hang me if i dont stand by you as long as i livei think pendennis it would have been all up with ned strong i was the fifth week of my being kept a prisoner for i couldnt be always risking my neck across that waterpipe and taking my walks abroad through poor old coss window and my spirit was quite broken sirdammy quite beat and i was thinking of putting an end to myself and should have done it in another week when who should drop down from heaven but altamont  heaven aint exactly the place ned said altamont i came from badenbaden said he and id had a deuced lucky month there thats all  well sir he took up markss bill and he paid the other fellows that were upon me like a man sir that he did said strong enthusiastically  and i shall be very happy to stand a bottle of claret for this company and as many more as the company chooses said mr altamont with a blush hallo waiter bring us a magnum of the right sort do you hear and well drink our healths all round sirand may every good fellow like strong find another good fellow to stand by him at a pinch thats my sentiment mr pendennis though i dont like your name  no and why asked arthur  strong pressed the colonels foot under the table here and altamont rather excited filled up another bumper nodded to pen drank off his wine and said he was a gentleman and that was sufficient and they were all gentlemen  the meeting between these all gentlemen took place at richmond whither pendennis had gone to dinner and where he found the chevalier and his friend at table in the coffeeroom both of the latter were exceedingly hilarious talkative and excited by wine and strong who was an admirable storyteller told the story of his own siege and adventures and escapes with great liveliness and humour and described the talk of the sheriffs officers at his door the pretty little signals of fanny the grotesque exclamations of costigan when the chevalier burst in at his window and his final rescue by altamont in a most graphic manner and so as greatly to interest his hearers  as for me its nothing altamont said when a ships paid off a chap spends his money you know and its the fellers at the black and red at badenbaden that did it i won a good bit of money there and intend to win a good bit more dont i strong im going to take him with me ive got a system ill make his fortune i tell you ill make your fortune if you likedammy everybodys fortune but what ill do and no mistake boys i promise you ill put in for that little fanny dammy sir what do you think she did she had two pound and im blest if she didnt go and lend it to ned strong didnt she ned lets drink her health  with all my heart said arthur and pledged this toast with the greatest cordiality  mr altamont then began with the greatest volubility at great length to describe his system he said that it was infallible if played with coolness that he had it from a chap at baden who had lost by it it was true but because he had not enough capital if he could have stood one more turn of the wheel he would have had all his money back that he and several more chaps were going to make a bank and try it and that he would put every shilling he was worth into it and had come back to the country for the express purpose of fetching away his money and captain strong that strong should play for him that he could trust strong and his temper much better than he could his own and much better than bloundellbloundell or the italian that stood in as he emptied his bottle the colonel described at full length all his plans and prospects to pen who was interested in listening to his story and the confessions of his daring and lawless goodhumour  i met that queer fellow altamont the other day pen said to his uncle a day or two afterwards  altamont what altamont theres lord westports son said the major  no no the fellow who came tipsy into claverings diningroom one day when we were there said the nephew laughing he said he did not like the name of pendennis though he did me the honour to think that i was a good fellow  i dont know any man of the name of altamont i give you my honour said the impenetrable major and as for your acquaintance i think the less you have to do with him the better arthur  arthur laughed again he is going to quit the country and make his fortune by a gambling system he and my amiable college acquaintance bloundell are partners and the colonel takes out strong with him as aidedecamp what is it that binds the chevalier and clavering i wonder  i should think mind you pen i should think but of course i have only the idea that there has been something in claverings previous life which gives these fellows and some others a certain power over him and if there should be no such a secret which affair of ours my boy dammy i say it ought to be a lesson to a man to keep himself straight in life and not to give any man a chance over him  why i think you have some means of persuasion over clavering uncle or why should he give me that seat in parlament  clavering thinks he aint fit for parliament the major answered no more he is whats to prevent him from putting you or anybody else into his place if he likes do you think that vernment or the opposition would make any bones about accepting the seat if he offered it to them why should you be more squeamish than the first men and the most honourable men and men of the highest birth and position in the country begad the major had an answer of this kind to most of pens objections and pen accepted his uncles replies not so much because he believed them but because he wished to believe them we do a thingwhich of us has notnot because everybody does it but because we like it and our acquiescence alas proves not that everybody is right but that we and the rest of the world are poor creatures alike  at his next visit to tunbridge mr pen did not forget to amuse miss blanche with the history which he had learned at richmond of the chevaliers imprisonment and of altamonts gallant rescue and after he had told his tale in his usual satirical way he mentioned with praise and emotion little fannys generous behaviour to the chevalier and altamonts enthusiasm in her behalf  miss blanche was somewhat jealous and a good deal piqued and curious about fanny among the many confidential little communications which arthur made to miss amory in the course of their delightful rural drives and their sweet evening walks it may be supposed that our hero would not forget a story so interesting to himself and so likely to be interesting to her as that of the passion and cure of the poor little ariadne of shepherds inn his own part in that drama he described to do him justice with becoming modesty the moral which he wished to draw from the tale being one in accordance with his usual satirical mood viz that women get over their first loves quite as easily as men do for the fair blanche in their intimes conversations did not cease to twit mr pen about his notorious failure in his own virgin attachment to the fotheringay and number one being withdrawn transfer themselves to number two without much difficulty and poor little fanny was offered up in sacrifice as an instance to prove this theory what griefs she had endured and surmounted what bitter pangs of hopeless attachment she had gone through what time it had taken to heal those wounds of the tender little bleeding heart mr pen did not know or perhaps did not choose to know for he was at once modest and doubtful about his capabilities as a conqueror of hearts and averse to believe that he had executed any dangerous ravages on that particular one though his own instance and argument told against himself in this case for if as he said miss fanny was by this time in love with her surgical adorer who had neither good looks nor good manners nor wit nor anything but ardour and fidelity to recommend him must she not in her first sickness of the lovecomplaint have had a serious attack and suffered keenly for a man who had certainly a number of the showy qualities which mr huxter wanted  you wicked odious creature miss blanche said i believe that you are enraged with fanny for being so impudent as to forget you and that you are actually jealous of mr huxter perhaps miss amory was right as the blush which came in spite of himself and tingled upon pendenniss cheek one of those blows with which a mans vanity is constantly slapping his face proved to pen that he was angry to think he had been superseded by such a rival by such a fellow as that without any conceivable good quality o mr pendennis although this remark does not apply to such a smart fellow as you if nature had not made that provision for each sex in the credulity of the other which sees good qualities where none exist good looks in donkeys ears wit in their numskulls and music in their bray there would not have been near so much marrying and giving in marriage as now obtains and as is necessary for the due propagation and continuance of the noble race to which we belong  jealous or not pen said and blanche i dont say no i should have liked fanny to have come to a better end than that i dont like histories that end in that cynical way and when we arrive at the conclusion of the story of a pretty girls passion to find such a figure as huxters at the last page of the tale is a life a compromise my lady fair and the end of the battle of love an ignoble surrender is the search for the cupid which my poor little psyche pursued in the darknessthe god of her souls longingthe god of the blooming cheek and rainbow pinionsto result in huxter smelling of tobacco and gallypots i wish though i dont see it in life that people could be like jenny and jessamy or my lord and lady clementina in the storybooks and fashionable novels and at once under the ceremony and as it were at the parsons benediction become perfectly handsome and good and happy ever after  and dont you intend to be good and happy pray monsieur le misanthropeand are you very discontented with your lotand will your marriage be a compromiseasked the author of mes larmes with a charming moueand is your psyche an odious vulgar wretch you wicked satirical creature i cant abide you you take the hearts of young things play with them and fling them away with scorn you ask for love and trample on it youyou make me cry that you do arthur andand dontand i wont be consoled in that wayand i think fanny was quite right in leaving such a heartless creature  again i dont say no said pen looking very gloomily at blanche and not offering by any means to repeat the attempt at consolation which had elicited that sweet monosyllable dont from the young lady i dont think i have much of what people call heart but i dont profess it i made my venture when i was eighteen and lighted my lamp and went in search of cupid and what was my discovery of lovea vulgar dancingwoman i failed as everybody does almost everybody only it is luckier to fail before marriage than after  merci du choix monsieur said the sylphide making a curtsey  look my little blanche said pen taking her hand and with his voice of sad goodhumour at least i stoop to no flatteries  quite the contrary said miss blanche  and tell you no foolish lies as vulgar men do why should you and i with our experience ape romance and dissemble passion i do not believe miss blanche amory to be peerless among the beautiful nor the greatest poetess nor the most surpassing musician any more than i believe you to be the tallest woman in the whole worldlike the giantess whose picture we saw as we rode through the fair yesterday but if i dont set you up as a heroine neither do i offer you your very humble servant as a hero but i think you arewell there i think you are very sufficiently goodlooking  merci miss blanche said with another curtsey  i think you sing charmingly im sure youre clever i hope and believe that you are goodnatured and that you will be companionable  and so provided i bring you a certain sum of money and a seat in parliament you condescend to fling to me your royal pockethandkerchief said blanche que dhonneur we used to call your highness the prince of fairoaks what an honour to think that i am to be elevated to the throne and to bring the seat in parliament as backsheesh to the sultan i am glad i am clever and that i can play and sing to your liking my songs will amuse my lords leisure  and if thieves are about the house said pen grimly pursuing the simile forty besetting thieves in the shape of lurking cares and enemies in ambush and passions in arms my morgiana will dance round me with a tambourine and kill all my rogues and thieves with a smile wont she but pen looked as if he did not believe that she would ah blanche he continued after a pause dont be angry dont be hurt at my truthtellingdont you see that i always take you at your word you say you will be a slave and dancei say dance you say i take you with what you bring i say i take you with what you bring to the necessary deceits and hypocrisies of our life why add any that are useless and unnecessary if i offer myself to you because i think we have a fair chance of being happy together and because by your help i may get for both of us a good place and a not undistinguished name why ask me to feign raptures and counterfeit romance in which neither of us believe do you want me to come wooing in a prince prettymans dress from the masquerade warehouse and to pay you compliments like sir charles grandison do you want me to make you verses as in the days when we werewhen we were children i will if you like and sell them to bacon and bungay afterwards shall i feed my pretty princess with bonbons  mais jadore les bonbons moi said the little sylphide with a queer piteous look  i can buy a hatful at fortnum and masons for a guinea and it shall have its bonbons its pooty little sugarplums that it shall pen said with a bitter smile nay my dear nay my dearest little blanche dont cry dry the pretty eyes i cant bear that and he proceeded to offer that consolation which the circumstance required and which the tears the genuine tears of vexation which now sprang from the angry eyes of the author of mes larmes demanded  the scornful and sarcastic tone of pendennis quite frightened and overcame the girl ii dont want your consolation ii never wassospoken to beforeby any of mymyby anybodyshe sobbed out with much simplicity  anybody shouted out pen with a savage burst of laughter and blanche blushed one of the most genuine blushes which her cheek had ever exhibited and she cried out o arthur vous etes un homme terrible she felt bewildered frightened oppressed the worldly little flirt who had been playing at love for the last dozen years of her life and yet not displeased at meeting a master  tell me arthur she said after a pause in this strange lovemaking why does sir francis clavering give up his seat in parliament  au fait why does he give it to me asked arthur now blushing in his turn  you always mock me sir she said if it is good to be in parliament why does sir francis go out  my uncle has talked him over he always said that you were not sufficiently provided for in thethe family disputes when your mamma paid his debts so liberally it was stipulated i suppose that youthat is that ithat is upon my word i dont know why he goes out of parliament pen said with rather a forced laugh you see blanche that you and i are two good little children and that this marriage has been arranged for us by our mammas and uncles and that we must be obedient like a good little boy and girl  so when pen went to london he sent blanche a box of bonbons each sugarplum of which was wrapped up in readymade french verses of the most tender kind and besides despatched to her some poems of his own manufacture quite as artless and authentic and it was no wonder that he did not tell warrington what his conversations with miss amory had been of so delicate a sentiment were they and of a nature so necessarily private  and if like many a worse and better man arthur pendennis the widows son was meditating an apostasy and going to sell himself towe all know whomat least the renegade did not pretend to be a believer in the creed to which he was ready to swear and if every woman and man in this kingdom who has sold her or himself for money or position as mr pendennis was about to do would but purchase a copy of his memoirs what tons of volumes messrs bradbury and evans would sell     chapter lxvi in which pen begins his canvass   melancholy as the great house at clavering park had been in the days before his marriage when its bankrupt proprietor was a refugee in foreign lands it was not much more cheerful now when sir francis clavering came to inhabit it the greater part of the mansion was shut up and the baronet only occupied a few of the rooms on the ground floor where his housekeeper and her assistant from the lodgegate waited upon the luckless gentleman in his forced retreat and cooked a part of the game which he spent the dreary mornings in shooting lightfoot his man had passed over to my ladys service and as pen was informed in a letter from mr smirke who performed the ceremony had executed his prudent intention of marrying mrs bonner my ladys woman who in her mature years was stricken with the charms of the youth and endowed him with her savings and her mature person  to be landlord and landlady of the clavering arms was the ambition of both of them and it was agreed that they were to remain in lady claverings service until quarterday arrived when they were to take possession of their hotel pen graciously promised that he would give his election dinner there when the baronet should vacate his seat in the young mans favour and as it had been agreed by his uncle to whom clavering seemed to be able to refuse nothing arthur came down in september on a visit to clavering park the owner of which was very glad to have a companion who would relieve his loneliness and perhaps would lend him a little ready money  pen furnished his host with these desirable supplies a couple of days after he had made his appearance at clavering and no sooner were these small funds in sir franciss pocket than the latter found he had business at chatteris and at the neighbouring wateringplaces of whichshire boasts many and went off to see to his affairs which were transacted as might be supposed at the county racegrounds and billiardrooms arthur could live alone well enough having many mental resources and amusements which did not require other persons company he could walk with the gamekeeper of a morning and for the evenings there was a plenty of books and occupation for a literary genius like mr arthur who required but a cigar and a sheet of paper or two to make the night pass away pleasantly in truth in two or three days he had found the society of sir francis clavering perfectly intolerable and it was with a mischievous eagerness and satisfaction that he offered clavering the little pecuniary aid which the latter according to his custom solicited and supplied him with the means of taking flight from his own house  besides our ingenious friend had to ingratiate himself with the townspeople of clavering and with the voters of the borough which he hoped to represent and he set himself to this task with only the more eagerness remembering how unpopular he had before been in clavering and determined to vanquish the odium which he had inspired amongst the simple people there his sense of humour made him delight in this task naturally rather reserved and silent in public he became on a sudden as frank easy and jovial as captain strong he laughed with everybody who would exchange a laugh with him shook hands right and left with what may be certainly called a dexterous cordiality made his appearance at the marketday and the farmers ordinary and in fine acted like a consummate hypocrite and as gentlemen of the highest birth and most spotless integrity act when they wish to make themselves agreeable to their constituents and have some end to gain of the countryfolks how is it that we allow ourselves not to be deceived but to be ingratiated so readily by a glib tongue a ready laugh and a frank manner we know for the most part that it is false coin and we take it we know that it is flattery which it costs nothing to distribute to everybody and we had rather have it than be without it friend pen went about at clavering laboriously simple and adroitly pleased and quite a different being from the scornful and rather sulky young dandy whom the inhabitants remembered ten years ago  the rectory was shut up doctor portman was gone with his gout and his family to harrogatean event which pen deplored very much in a letter to the doctor in which in a few kind and simple words he expressed his regret at not seeing his old friend whose advice he wanted and whose aid he might require some day but pen consoled himself for the doctors absence by making acquaintance with mr simcoe the opposition preacher and with the two partners of the clothfactory at chatteris and with the independent preacher there all of whom he met at clavering athenaeum which the liberal party had set up in accordance with the advanced spirit of the age and perhaps in opposition to the aristocratic old readingroom into which the edinburgh review had once scarcely got an admission and where no tradesmen were allowed an entrance he propitiated the younger partner of the clothfactory by asking him to dine in a friendly way at the park he complimented the honourable mrs simcoe with hares and partridges from the same quarter and a request to read her husbands last sermon and being a little unwell one day the rascal took advantage of the circumstance to show his tongue to mr huxter who sent him medicines and called the next morning how delighted old pendennis would have been with his pupil pen himself was amused with the sport in which he was engaged and his success inspired him with a wicked goodhumour  and yet as he walked out of clavering of a night after presiding at a meeting of the athenaeum or working through an evening with mrs simcoe who with her husband was awed by the young londoners reputation and had heard of his social successes as he passed over the old familiar bridge of the rushing brawl and heard that wellremembered sound of waters beneath and saw his own cottage of fairoaks among the trees their darkling outlines clear against the starlit sky different thoughts no doubt came to the young mans mind and awakened pangs of grief and shame there there still used to be a light in the windows of the room which he remembered so well and in which the saint who loved him had passed so many hours of care and yearning and prayer he turned away his gaze from the faint light which seemed to pursue him with its wan reproachful gaze as though it was his mothers spirit watching and warning how clear the night was how keen the stars shone how ceaseless the rush of the flowing waters the old home trees whispered and waved gently their dark heads and branches over the cottage roof yonder in the faint starlight glimmer was the terrace where as a boy he walked of summer evenings ardent and trustful unspotted untried ignorant of doubts or passions sheltered as yet from the worlds contamination in the pure and anxious bosom of love the clock of the near town tolling midnight with a clang disturbs our wanderers reverie and sends him onwards towards his nights restingplace through the lodge into clavering avenue and under the dark arcades of the rustling limes  when he sees the cottage the next time it is smiling in sunset those bedroom windows are open where the light was burning the night before and pens tenant captain stokes of the bombay artillery whose mother old mrs stokes lives in clavering receives his landlords visit with great cordiality shows him over the grounds and the new pond he has made in the backgarden from the stables talks to him confidentially about the roof and chimneys and begs mr pendennis to name a day when he will do himself and mrs stokes the pleasure to etc pen who has been a fortnight in the country excuses himself for not having called sooner upon the captain by frankly owning that he had not the heart to do it i understand you sir the captain says and mrs stokes who had slipped away at the ring of the bell how odd it seemed to pen to ring the bell comes down in her best gown surrounded by her children the young ones clamb about stokes the boy jumps into an armchair it was pens fathers armchair and arthur remembers the days when he would as soon have thought of mounting the kings throne as of seating himself in that armchair he asks if miss stokesshe is the very image of her mammaif she can play he should like to hear a tune on that piano she plays he hears the notes of the old piano once more enfeebled by age but he does not listen to the player he is listening to laura singing as in the days of their youth and sees his mother bending and beating time over the shoulder of the girl  the dinner at fairoaks given in pens honour by his tenant and at which old mrs stokes captain glanders squire hobnel and the clergyman and his lady from tinckleton were present was very stupid and melancholy for pen until the waiter from clavering who aided the captains stableboy and mrs stokess butler whom pen remembered as a street boy and who was now indeed barber in that place dropped a plate over pens shoulder on which mr hobnell who also employed him remarked i suppose hodson your hands are slippery with bearsgrease hes always dropping the crockery about that hodson ishaw haw on which hodson blushed and looked so disconcerted that pen burst out laughing and goodhumour and hilarity were the order of the evening for the second course there was a hare and partridges top and bottom and when after the withdrawal of the servants pen said to the vicar of tinckleton i think mr stooks you should have asked hodson to cut the hare the joke was taken instantly by the clergyman who was followed in the course of a few minutes by captains stokes and glanders and by mr hobnell who arrived rather late but with an immense guffaw                                       while mr pen was engaged in the country in the above schemes it happened that the lady of his choice if not of his affections came up to london from the tunbridge villa bound upon shopping expeditions or important business and in company of old mrs bonner her mothers maid who had lived and quarrelled with blanche many times since she was an infant and who now being about to quit lady claverings service for the hymeneal state was anxious like a good soul to bestow some token of respectful kindness upon her old and young mistress before she quitted them altogether to take her post as the wife of lightfoot and landlady of the clavering arms  the honest woman took the benefit of miss amorys taste to make the purchase which she intended to offer her ladyship and requested the fair blanche to choose something for herself that should be to her liking and remind her of her old nurse who had attended her through many a wakeful night and eventful teething and childish fever and who loved her like a child of her own amost these purchases were made and as the nurse insisted on buying an immense bible for blanche the young lady suggested that bonner should purchase a large johnsons dictionary for her mamma each of the two women might certainly profit by the present made to her  then mrs bonner invested money in some bargains in linendrapery which might be useful at the clavering arms and bought a red and yellow neckhandkerchief which blanche could see at once was intended for mr lightfoot younger than herself by at least fiveandtwenty years mrs bonner regarded that youth with a fondness at once parental and conjugal and loved to lavish ornaments on his person which already glittered with pins rings shirtstuds and chains and seals purchased at the good creatures expense  it was in the strand that mrs bonner made her purchases aided by miss blanche who liked the fun very well and when the old lady had bought everything that she desired and was leaving the shop blanche with a smiling face and a sweet bow to one of the shopmen said pray sir will you have the kindness to show us the way to shepherds inn  shepherds inn was but a few score of yards off old castle street was close by the elegant young shopman pointed out the turning which the young lady was to take and she and her companion walked off together  shepherds inn what can you want in shepherds inn miss blanche bonner inquired mr strong lives there do you want to go and see the captain  i should like to see the captain very well i like the captain but it is not him i want i want to see a dear little good girl who was very kind toto mr arthur when he was so ill last year and saved his life almost and i want to thank her and ask her if she would like anything i looked out several of my dresses on purpose this morning bonner and she looked at bonner as if she had a right to admiration and had performed an act of remarkable virtue blanche indeed was very fond of sugarplums she would have fed the poor upon them when she had had enough and given a country girl a balldress when she had worn it and was tired of it  pretty girlpretty young woman mumbled mrs bonner i know i want no pretty young women to come about lightfoot and in imagination she peopled the clavering arms with a harem of the most hideous chambermaids and barmaids  blanche with pink and blue and feathers and flowers and trinkets that wondrous invention a chatelaine was not extant yet or she would have had one we may be sure and a shotsilk dress and a wonderful mantle and a charming parasol presented a vision of elegance and beauty such as bewildered the eyes of mrs bolton who was scrubbing the lodgefloor of shepherds inn and caused betsyjane and ameliarann to look with delight  blanche looked on them with a smile of ineffable sweetness and protection like rowena going to see rebecca like marie antoinette visiting the poor in the famine like the marchioness of carabas alighting from her carriageandfour at a paupertenants door and taking from john no ii the packet of epsom salts for the invalids benefit carrying it with her own imperial hand into the sickroomblanche felt a queen stepping down from her throne to visit a subject and enjoyed all the bland consciousness of doing a good action  my good woman i want to see fannyfanny bolton is she here  mrs bolton had a sudden suspicion from the splendour of blanches appearance that it must be a playactor or something worse  what do you want with fanny pray she asked  i am lady claverings daughteryou have heard of sir francis clavering and i wish very much indeed to see fanny bolton  pray step in missbetsyjane wheres fanny  betsyjane said fanny had gone into no 3 staircase on which mrs bolton said she was probably in strongs rooms and bade the child go and see if she was there  in captain strongs rooms oh let us go to captain strongs rooms cried out miss blanche i know him very well you dearest little girl show us the way to captain strong cried out miss blanche for the floor reeked with the recent scrubbing and the goddess did not like the smell of brownsoap  and as they passed up the stairs a gentleman by the name of costigan who happened to be swaggering about the court and gave a very knowing look with his oi under blanches bonnet remarked to himself thats a devilish foine gyurll bedad goan up to sthrong and altamont theyre always having foine gyurlls up their stairs  hallohwhats that he presently said looking up at the windows from which some piercing shrieks issued  at the sound of the voice of a distressed female the intrepid cos rushed up the stairs as fast as his old legs would carry him being nearly overthrown by strongs servant who was descending the stair cos found the outer door of strongs chambers opened and began to thunder at the knocker after many and fierce knocks the inner door was partially unclosed and strongs head appeared  its oi me boy hwhats that noise sthrong asked costigan  go to the d was the only answer and the door was shut on coss venerable red nose and he went downstairs muttering threats at the indignity offered to him and vowing that he would have satisfaction in the meanwhile the reader more lucky than captain costigan will have the privilege of being made acquainted with the secret which was withheld from that officer  it has been said of how generous a disposition mr altamont was and when he was well supplied with funds how liberally he spent them of a hospitable turn he had no greater pleasure than drinking in company with other people so that there was no man more welcome at greenwich and richmond than the emissary of the nawaub of lucknow  now it chanced that on the day when blanche and mrs bonner ascended the staircase to strongs room in shepherds inn the colonel had invited miss delaval of the  theatre royal and her mother mrs hodge to a little party down the river and it had been agreed that they were to meet at chambers and thence walk down to a port in the neighbouring strand to take water so that when mrs bonner and mes larmes came to the door where grady altamonts servant was standing the domestic said walk in ladies with the utmost affability and led them into the room which was arranged as if they had been expected there indeed two bouquets of flowers bought at covent garden that morning and instances of the tender gallantry of altamont were awaiting his guests upon the table blanche smelt at the bouquet and put her pretty little dainty nose into it and tripped about the room and looked behind the curtains and at the books and prints and at the plan of clavering estate hanging up on the wall and had asked the servant for captain strong and had almost forgotten his existence and the errand about which she had come namely to visit fanny bolton so pleased was she with the new adventure and the odd strange delightful droll little idea of being in a bachelors chambers in a queer old place in the city  grady meanwhile with a pair of ample varnished boots had disappeared into his masters room blanche had hardly the leisure to remark how big the boots were and how unlike mr strongs  the womens come said grady helping his master to the boots  did you ask em if they would take a glass of anything asked altamont  grady came outhe says will you take anything to drink the domestic asked of them at which blanche amused with the artless question broke out into a pretty little laugh and asked of mrs bonner shall we take anything to drink  well you may take it or lave it said mr grady who thought his offer slighted and did not like the contemptuous manners of the newcomers and so left them  will we take anything to drink blanche asked again and again began to laugh  grady bawled out a voice from the chamber withina voice that made mrs bonner start  grady did not answer his song was heard from afar off from the kitchen his upper room where grady was singing at his work  grady my coat again roared the voice from within  why that is not mr strongs voice said the sylphide still half laughing grady my coatbonner who is grady my coat we ought to go away  bonner still looked quite puzzled at the sound of the voice which she had heard  the bedroom door here opened and the individual who had called out grady my coat appeared without the garment in question  he nodded to the women and walked across the room i beg your pardon ladies grady bring my coat down sir well my dears its a fine day and well have a jolly lark at  he said no more for here mrs bonner who had been looking at him with scared eyes suddenly shrieked out amory amory and fell back screaming and fainting in her chair  the man so apostrophised looked at the woman an instant and rushing up to blanche seized her and kissed her yes betsy he said by git is me mary bonner knew me what a fine gal weve grown but its a secret mind im dead though im your father your poor mother dont know it what a pretty gal weve grown kiss mekiss me close my betsy d it i love you im your old father  betsy or blanche looked quite bewildered and began to scream tooonce twice thrice and it was her piercing shrieks which captain costigan heard as he walked the court below  at the sound of these shrieks the perplexed parent clasped his hands his wristbands were open and on one brawny arm you could see letters tattooed in blue and rushing to his apartment came back with an eaudecologne bottle from his grand silver dressingcase with the fragrant contents of which he began liberally to sprinkle bonner and blanche  the screams of these women brought the other occupants of the chambers into the room grady from his kitchen and strong from his apartment in the upper story the latter at once saw from the aspect of the two women what had occurred  grady go and wait in the court he said and if anybody comesyou understand me  is it the playactress and her mother said grady  yesconfound yousay that theres nobody in chambers and the partys off for today  shall i say that sir and after i bought them bokays asked grady of his master  yes said amory with a stamp of his foot and strong going to the door too reached it just in time to prevent the entrance of captain costigan who had mounted the stair  the ladies from the theatre did not have their treat to greenwich nor did blanche pay her visit to fanny bolton on that day and cos who took occasion majestically to inquire of grady what the mischief was and who was cryinghad for answer that twas a woman another of them and that they were in gradys opinion the cause of most all the mischief in the world     chapter lxvii in which pen begins to doubt about his election   whilst pen in his own county was thus carrying on his selfish plans and parliamentary schemes news came to him that lady rockminster had arrived at baymouth and had brought with her our friend laura at the announcement that laura his sister was near him pen felt rather guilty his wish was to stand higher in her esteem perhaps than in that of any other person in the world she was his mothers legacy to him he was to be her patron and protector in some sort how would she brave the news which he had to tell her and how should he explain the plans which he was meditating he felt as if neither he nor blanche could bear lauras dazzling glance of calm scrutiny and as if he would not dare to disclose his worldly hopes and ambitions to that spotless judge at her arrival at baymouth he wrote a letter thither which contained a great number of fine phrases and protests of affection and a great deal of easy satire and raillery in the midst of all which mr pen could not help feeling that he was in panic and that he was acting like a rogue and hypocrite  how was it that a simple country girl should be the object of fear and trembling to such an accomplished gentleman as mr pen his worldly tactics and diplomacy his satire and knowledge of the world could not bear the test of her purity he felt somehow and he had to own to himself that his affairs were in such a position that he could not tell the truth to that honest soul as he rode from clavering to baymouth he felt as guilty as a schoolboy who doesnt know his lesson and is about to face the awful master for is not truth the master always and does she not have the power and hold the book  under the charge of her kind though somewhat wayward and absolute patroness lady rockminster laura had seen somewhat of the world in the last year had gathered some accomplishments and profited by the lessons of society many a girl who had been accustomed to that too great tenderness in which lauras early life had been passed would have been unfitted for the changed existence which she now had to lead helen worshipped her two children and thought as homebred women will that all the world was made for them or to be considered after them she tended laura with a watchfulness of affection which never left her if she had a headache the widow was as alarmed as if there had never been an aching head before in the world she slept and woke read and moved under her mothers fond superintendence which was now withdrawn from her along with the tender creature whose anxious heart would beat no more and painful moments of grief and depression no doubt laura had when she stood in the great careless world alone nobody heeded her griefs or her solitude she was not quite the equal in social rank of the lady whose companion she was or of the friends and relatives of the imperious but kind old dowager some very likely bore her no goodwillsome perhaps slighted her it might have been that servants were occasionally rude their mistress certainly was often laura not seldom found herself in family meetings the confidence and familiarity of which she felt were interrupted by her intrusion and her sensitiveness of course was wounded at the idea that she should give or feel this annoyance how many governesses are there in the world thought cheerful laurahow many ladies whose necessities make them slaves and companions by profession what bad tempers and coarse unkindness have not these to encounter how infinitely better my lot is with these really kind and affectionate people than that of thousands of unprotected girls it was with this cordial spirit that our young lady adapted herself to her new position and went in advance of her fortune with a trustful smile  did you ever know a person who met fortune in that way whom the goddess did not regard kindly are not even bad people won by a constant cheerfulness and a pure and affectionate heart when the babes in the wood in the ballad looked up fondly and trustfully at those notorious rogues whom their uncle had set to make away with the little folks we all know how one of the rascals relented and made away with the othernot having the heart to be unkind to so much innocence and beauty oh happy they who have that virgin loving trust and sweet smiling confidence in the world and fear no evil because they think none miss laura bell was one of these fortunate persons and besides the gentle widows little cross which as we have seen pen gave her had such a sparkling and brilliant kohinoor in her bosom as is even more precious than that famous jewel for it not only fetches a price and is retained by its owner in another world where diamonds are stated to be of no value but here too is of inestimable worth to its possessor is a talisman against evil and lightens up the darkness of life like cogia hassans famous stone  so that before miss bell had been a year in lady rockminsters house there was not a single person in it whose love she had not won by the use of this talisman from the old lady to the lowest dependent of her bounty laura had secured the goodwill and kindness of everybody with a mistress of such a temper my ladys woman who had endured her mistress for forty years and had been clawed and scolded and jibed every day and night in that space of time could not be expected to have a good temper of her own and was at first angry against miss laura as she had been against her ladyships fifteen preceding companions but when laura was ill at paris this old woman nursed her in spite of her mistress who was afraid of catching the fever and absolutely fought for her medicine with martha from fairoaks now advanced to be miss lauras own maid as she was recovering grandjean the chef wanted to kill her by the numbers of delicacies which he dressed for her and wept when she ate her first slice of chicken the swiss majordomo of the house celebrated miss bells praises in almost every european language which he spoke with indifferent incorrectness the coachman was happy to drive her out the page cried when he heard she was ill and calverley and coldstream those two footmen so large so calm ordinarily and so difficult to move broke out into extraordinary hilarity at the news of her convalescence and intoxicated the page at a wineshop to fete lauras recovery even lady diana pynsent our former acquaintance mr pynsent had married by this time lady diana who had had a considerable dislike to laura for some time was so enthusiastic as to say that she thought miss bell was a very agreeable person and that grandmamma had found a great trouvaille in her all this goodwill and kindness laura had acquired not by any arts not by any flattery but by the simple force of goodnature and by the blessed gift of pleasing and being pleased  on the one or two occasions when he had seen lady rockminster the old lady who did not admire him had been very pitiless and abrupt with our young friend and perhaps pen expected when he came to baymouth to find laura installed in her house in the quality of humble companion and treated no better than himself when she heard of his arrival she came running downstairs and i am not sure that she did not embrace him in the presence of calverley and coldstream not that those gentlemen ever told if the fractus orbis had come to a smash if laura instead of kissing pen had taken her scissors and snipped off his headcalverley and coldstream would have looked on impavidly without allowing a grain of powder to be disturbed by the calamity  laura had so much improved in health and looks that pen could not but admire her the frank and kind eyes which met his beamed with goodhealth the cheek which he kissed blushed with beauty as he looked at her artless and graceful pure and candid he thought he had never seen her so beautiful why should he remark her beauty now so much and remark too to himself that he had not remarked it sooner he took her fair trustful hand and kissed it fondly he looked in her bright clear eyes and read in them that kindling welcome which he was always sure to find there he was affected and touched by the tender tone and the pure sparkling glance their innocence smote him somehow and moved him  how good you are to me laurasister said pen i dont deserve that you shouldthat you should be so kind to me  mamma left you to me she said stooping down and brushing his forehead with her lips hastily you know you were to come to me when you were in trouble or to tell me when you were very happy that was our compact arthur last year before we parted are you very happy now or are you in troublewhich is it and she looked at him with an arch glance of kindness do you like going into parliament do you intend to distinguish yourself there how i shall tremble for your first speech  do you know about the parliament plan then pen asked  knowall the world knows i have heard it talked about many times lady rockminsters doctor talked about it today i daresay it will be in the chatteris paper tomorrow it is all over the county that sir francis clavering of clavering is going to retire in behalf of mr arthur pendennis of fairoaks and that the young and beautiful miss blanche amory is  what that too asked pendennis  that too dear arthur tout se sait as somebody would say whom i intend to be very fond of and who i am sure is very clever and pretty i have had a letter from blanche the kindest of letters she speaks so warmly of you arthur i hopei know she feels what she writeswhen is it to be arthur why did you not tell me i may come and live with you then maynt i  my home is yours dear laura and everything i have pen said if i did not tell you it was becausebecausei do not know nothing is decided as yet no words have passed between us but you think blanche could be happy with medont you not a romantic fondness you know i have no heart i think ive told her so only a sobersided attachmentand want my wife on one side of the fire and my sister on the otherparliament in the session and fairoaks in the holidays and my laura never to leave me until somebody who has a right comes to take her away  somebody who has a rightsomebody with a right why did pen as he looked at the girl and slowly uttered the words begin to feel angry and jealous of the invisible somebody with the right to take her away anxious but a minute ago how she would take the news regarding his probable arrangements with blanche pen was hurt somehow that she received the intelligence so easily and took his happiness for granted  until somebody comes laura said with a laugh i will stay at home and be aunt laura and take care of the children when blanche is in the world i have arranged it all i am an excellent housekeeper do you know i have been to market at paris with mrs beck and have taken some lessons from m grandjean and i have had some lessons in paris in singing too with the money which you sent me you kind boy and i can sing much better now and i have learned to dance though not so well as blanche and when you become a minister of state blanche shall present me and with this and with a provoking goodhumour she performed for him the last parisian curtsey  lady rockminster came in whilst this curtsey was being performed and gave to arthur one finger to shake which he took and over which he bowed as well as he could which in truth was very clumsily  so you are going to be married sir said the old lady  scold him lady rockminster for not telling us laura said going away which in truth the old lady began instantly to do so you are going to marry and to go into parliament in place of that goodfornothing sir francis clavering i wanted him to give my grandson his seatwhy did he not give my grandson his seat i hope you are to have a great deal of money with miss amory i wouldnt take her without a great deal  sir francis clavering is tired of parliament pen said wincing andand i rather wish to attempt that career the rest of the story is at least premature  i wonder when you had laura at home you could take up with such an affected little creature as that the old lady continued  i am very sorry miss amory does not please your ladyship said pen smiling  you meanthat it is no affair of mine and that i am not going to marry her well im not and im very glad i am nota little odious thingwhen i think that a man could prefer her to my laura ive no patience with him and so i tell you mr arthur pendennis  i am very glad you see laura with such favourable eyes pen said  you are very glad and you are very sorry what does it matter sir whether you are very glad or very sorry a young man who prefers miss amory to miss bell has no business to be sorry or glad a young man who takes up with such a crooked lump of affectation as that little amoryfor she is crooked i tell you she isafter seeing my laura has no right to hold up his head again where is your friend bluebeard the tall young man i meanwarrington isnt his name why does he not come down and marry laura what do the young men mean by not marrying such a girl as that they all marry for money now you are all selfish and cowards we ran away with each other and made foolish matches in my time i have no patience with the young men when i was at paris in the winter i asked all the three attaches at the embassy why they did not fall in love with miss bell they laughedthey said they wanted money you are all selfishyou are all cowards  i hope before you offered miss bell to the attaches said pen with some heat you did her the favour to consult her  miss bell has only a little money miss bell must marry soon somebody must make a match for her sir and a girl cant offer herself said the old dowager with great state laura my dear ive been telling your cousin that all the young men are selfish and that there is not a pennyworth of romance left among them he is as bad as the rest  have you been asking arthur why he wont marry me said laura with a kindling smile coming back and taking her cousins hand she had been away perhaps to hide some traces of emotion which she did not wish others to see he is going to marry somebody else and i intend to be very fond of her and to go and live with them provided he then does not ask every bachelor who comes to his house why he does not marry me  the terrors of pens conscience being thus appeased and his examination before laura over without any reproaches on the part of the latter pen began to find that his duty and inclination led him constantly to baymouth where lady rockminster informed him that a place was always reserved for him at her table and i recommend you to come often the old lady said for grandjean is an excellent cook and to be with laura and me will do your manners good it is easy to see that you are always thinking about yourself dont blush and stammeralmost all young men are always thinking about themselves my sons and grandsons always were until i cured them come here and let us teach you to behave properly you will not have to carve that is done at the sidetable hecker will give you as much wine as is good for you and on days when you are very good and amusing you shall have some champagne hecker mind what i say mr pendennis is miss lauras brother and you will make him comfortable and see that he does not have too much wine or disturb me whilst i am taking my nap after dinner you are selfish i intend to cure you of being selfish you will dine here when you have no other engagements and if it rains you had better put up at the hotel as long as the good lady could order everybody round about her she was not hard to please and all the slaves and subjects of her little dowager court trembled before her but loved her  she did not receive a very numerous or brilliant society the doctor of course was admitted as a constant and faithful visitor the vicar and his curate and on public days the vicars wife and daughters and some of the season visitors at baymouth were received at the old ladys entertainments but generally the company was a small one and mr arthur drank his wine by himself when lady rockminster retired to take her doze and to be played and sung to sleep by laura after dinner  if my music can give her a nap said the goodnatured girl ought i not to be very glad that it can do so much good lady rockminster sleeps very little of nights and i used to read to her until i fell ill at paris since when she will not hear of my sitting up  why did you not write to me when you were ill asked pen with a blush  what good could you do me i had martha to nurse me and the doctor every day you are too busy to write to women or to think about them you have your books and your newspapers and your politics and your railroads to occupy you i wrote when i was well  and pen looked at her and blushed again as he remembered that during all the time of her illness he had never written to her and had scarcely thought about her  in consequence of his relationship pen was free to walk and ride with his cousin constantly and in the course of those walks and rides could appreciate the sweet frankness of her disposition and the truth simplicity and kindliness of her fair and spotless heart in their mothers lifetime she had never spoken so openly or so cordially as now the desire of poor helen to make an union between her two children had caused a reserve on lauras part towards pen for which under the altered circumstances of arthurs life there was now no necessity he was engaged to another woman and laura became his sister at oncehiding or banishing from herself any doubts which she might have as to his choice striving to look cheerfully forward and hope for his prosperity promising herself to do all that affection might do to make her mothers darling happy  their talk was often about the departed mother and it was from a thousand stories which laura told him that arthur was made aware how constant and absorbing that silent maternal devotion had been which had accompanied him present and absent through life and had only ended with the fond widows last breath one day the people in clavering saw a lad in charge of a couple of horses at the churchyardgate and it was told over the place that pen and laura had visited helens grave together since arthur had come down into the country he had been there once or twice but the sight of the sacred stone had brought no consolation to him a guilty man doing a guilty deed a mere speculator content to lay down his faith and honour for a fortune and a worldly career and owning that his life was but a contemptible surrenderwhat right had he in the holy place what booted it to him in the world he lived in that others were no better than himself arthur and laura rode by the gates of fairoaks and he shook hands with his tenants children playing on the lawn and the terracelaura looked steadily at the cottage wall at the creeper on the porch and the magnolia growing up to her window mr pendennis rode by today one of the boys told his mother with a lady and he stopped and talked to us and he asked for a bit of honeysuckle off the porch and gave it the lady i couldnt see if she was pretty she had her veil down she was riding one of cramps horses out of baymouth  as they rode over the downs between home and baymouth pen did not speak much though they rode very close together he was thinking what a mockery life was and how men refuse happiness when they may have it or having it kick it down or barter it with their eyes open for a little worthless money or beggarly honour and then the thought came what does it matter for the little space the lives of the best and purest of us are consumed in a vain desire and end in a disappointment as the dear souls who sleeps in her grave yonder she had her selfish ambition as much as caesar had and died baulked of her lifes longing the stone covers over our hopes and our memories our place knows us not other peoples children are playing on the grass he broke out in a hard voice where you and i used to play laura and you see how the magnolia we planted has grown up since our time i have been round to one or two of the cottages where my mother used to visit it is scarcely more than a year that she is gone and the people whom she used to benefit care no more for her death than for queen annes we are all selfish the world is selfish there are but a few exceptions like you my dear to shine like good deeds in a naughty world and make the blackness more dismal  i wish you would not speak in that way arthur said laura looking down and bending her head to the honeysuckle on her breast when you told the little boy to give me this you were not selfish  a pretty sacrifice i made to get it for you said the sneerer  but your heart was kind and full of love when you did so one cannot ask for more than love and kindness and if you think humbly of yourself arthur the love and kindness arediminishedare they i often thought our dearest mother spoiled you at home by worshipping you and that if you arei hate the wordwhat you say her too great fondness helped to make you so and as for the world when men go out into it i suppose they cannot be otherwise than selfish you have to fight for yourself and to get on for yourself and to make a name for yourself mamma and your uncle both encouraged you in this ambition if it is a vain thing why pursue it i suppose such a clever man as you intend to do a great deal of good to the country by going into parliament or you would not wish to be there what are you going to do when you are in the house of commons  women dont understand about politics my dear pen said sneering at himself as he spoke  but why dont you make us understand i could never tell about mr pynsent why he should like to be there so much he is not a clever man  he certainly is not a genius pynsent said pen  lady diana says that he attends committees all day that then again he is at the house all night that he always votes as he is told that he never speaks that he will never get on beyond a subordinate place and as his grandmother tells him he is choked with redtape are you going to follow the same career arthur what is there in it so brilliant that you should be so eager for it i would rather that you should stop at home and write booksgood books kind books with gentle kind thoughts such as you have dear arthur and such as might do people good to read and if you do not win fame what then you own it is vanity and you can live very happily without it i must not pretend to advise but i take you at your own word about the world and as you own it is wicked and that it tires you ask you why you dont leave it  and what would you have me do asked arthur  i would have you bring your wife to fairoaks to live there and study and do good round about you i would like to see your own children playing on the lawn arthur and that we might pray in our mothers church again once more dear brother if the world is a temptation are we not told to pray that we may not be led into it  do you think blanche would make a good wife for a petty country gentleman do you think i should become the character very well laura pen asked remember temptation walks about the hedgerows as well as the city streets and idleness is the greatest tempter of all  what doesdoes mr warrington say said laura as a blush mounted up to her cheek and of which pen saw the fervour though lauras veil fell over her face to hide it  pen rode on by lauras side silently for a while georges name so mentioned brought back the past to him and the thoughts which he had once had regarding george and laura why should the recurrence of the thought agitate him now that he knew the union was impossible why should he be curious to know if during the months of their intimacy laura had felt a regard for warrington from that day until the present time george had never alluded to his story and arthur remembered now that since then george had scarcely ever mentioned lauras name  at last he cane close to her tell me something laura he said  she put back her veil and looked at him what is it arthur she askedthough from the tremor of her voice she guessed very well  tell mebut for georges misfortunei never knew him speak of it before or since that daywould youwould you have given himwhat you refused me  yes pen she said bursting into tears  he deserved you better than i did poor arthur groaned forth with an indescribable pang at his heart i am but a selfish wretch and george is better nobler truer than i am god bless him  yes pen said laura reaching out her hand to her cousin and he put his arm round her and for a moment she sobbed on his shoulder  the gentle girl had had her secret and told it in the widows last journey from fairoaks when hastening with her mother to arthurs sickbed laura had made a different confession and it was only when warrington told his own story and described the hopeless condition of his life that she discovered how much her feelings had changed and with what tender sympathy with what great respect delight and admiration she had grown to regard her cousins friend until she knew that some plans she might have dreamed of were impossible and that warrington reading in her heart perhaps had told his melancholy story to warn her she had not asked herself whether it was possible that her affections could change and had been shocked and seared by the discovery of the truth how should she have told it to helen and confessed her shame poor laura felt guilty before her friend with the secret which she dared not confide to her felt as if she had been ungrateful for helens love and regard felt as if she had been wickedly faithless to pen in withdrawing that love from him which he did not even care to accept humbled even and repentant before warrington lest she should have encouraged him by undue sympathy or shown the preference which she began to feel  the catastrophe which broke up lauras home and the grief and anguish which she felt for her mothers death gave her little leisure for thoughts more selfish and by the time she rallied from that grief the minor one was also almost cured it was but for a moment that she had indulged a hope about warrington her admiration and respect for him remained as strong as ever but the tender feeling with which she knew she had regarded him was schooled into such calmness that it may be said to have been dead and passed away the pang which it left behind was one of humility and remorse oh how wicked and proud i was about arthur she thought how selfconfident and unforgiving i never forgave from my heart this poor girl who was fond of him or him for encouraging her love and i have been more guilty than she poor little artless creature i professing to love one man could listen to another only too eagerly and would not pardon the change of feelings in arthur whilst i myself was changing and unfaithful and so humiliating herself and acknowledging her weakness the poor girl sought for strength and refuge in the manner in which she had been accustomed to look for them  she had done no wrong but there are some folks who suffer for a fault ever so trifling as much as others whose stout consciences can walk under crimes of almost any weight and poor laura chose to fancy that she had acted in this delicate juncture of her life as a very great criminal she determined that she had done pen a great injury by withdrawing that love which privately in her mothers hearing she had bestowed upon him that she had been ungrateful to her dead benefactress by ever allowing herself to think of another or of violating her promise and that considering her own enormous crimes she ought to be very gentle in judging those of others whose temptations were much greater very likely and whose motives she could not understand  a year back laura would have been indignant at the idea that arthur should marry blanche and her high spirit would have risen as she thought that from worldly motives he should stoop to one so unworthy now when the news was brought to her of such a chance the intelligence was given to her by old lady rockminster whose speeches were as direct and rapid as a slap on the face the humbled girl winced a little at the blow but bore it meekly and with a desperate acquiescence he has a right to marry he knows a great deal more of the world than i do she argued with herself blanche may not be so lightminded as she seemed and who am i to be her judge i daresay it is very good that arthur should go into parliament and distinguish himself and my duty is to do everything that lies in my power to aid him and blanche and to make his home happy i daresay i shall live with them if i am godmother to one of their children i will leave her my three thousand pounds and forthwith she began to think what she could give blanche out of her small treasures and how best to conciliate her affection she wrote her forthwith a kind letter in which of course no mention was made of the plans in contemplation but in which laura recalled old times and spoke her goodwill and in reply to this she received an eager answer from blanche in which not a word about marriage was said to be sure but mr pendennis was mentioned two or three times in the letter and they were to be henceforth dearest laura and dearest blanche and loving sisters and so forth  when pen and laura reached home after lauras confession pens noble acknowledgment of his own inferiority and generous expression of love for warrington causing the girls heart to throb and rendering doubly keen those tears which she sobbed on his shoulder a little slim letter was awaiting miss bell in the hall which she trembled rather guiltily as she unsealed and which pen blushed as he recognised for he saw instantly that it was from blanche  laura opened it hastily and cast her eyes quickly over it as pen kept his fixed on her blushing  she dates from london laura said she has been with old bonner lady claverings maid bonner is going to marry lightfoot the butler where do you think blanche has been she cried out eagerly  to paris to scotland to the casino  to shepherds inn to see fanny but fanny wasnt there and blanche is going to leave a present for her isnt it kind of her and thoughtful and she handed the letter to pen who read  i saw madame mere who was scrubbing the room and looked at me with very scrubby looks but la belle fanny was not au logis and as i heard that she was in captain strongs apartments bonner and i mounted au troisieme to see this famous beauty another disappointmentonly the chevalier strong and a friend of his in the room so we came away after all without seeing the enchanting fanny  je tenvoie mille et mille baisers when will that horrid canvassing be over sleeves are worn etc etc etc  after dinner the doctor was reading the times a young gentleman i attended when he was here some eight or nine years ago has come into a fine fortune the doctor said i see here announced the death of john henry foker esq of logwood hall at pau in the pyrenees on the 15th ult     chapter lxviii in which the major is bidden to stand and deliver   any gentleman who has frequented the wheel of fortune publichouse where it may be remembered that mr james morgans club was held and where sir francis clavering had an interview with major pendennis is aware that there are three rooms for guests upon the ground floor besides the bar where the landlady sits one is a parlour frequented by the public at large to another room gentlemen in livery resort and the third apartment on the door of which private is painted is that hired by the club of the confidentials of which messrs morgan and lightfoot were members  the noiseless morgan had listened to the conversation between strong and major pendennis at the latters own lodgings and had carried away from it matter for much private speculation and a desire of knowledge had led him to follow his master when the major came to the wheel of fortune and to take his place quietly in the confidential room whilst pendennis and clavering had their discourse in the parlour there was a particular corner in the confidential room from which you could hear almost all that passed in the next apartment and as the conversation between the two gentlemen there was rather angry and carried on in a high key morgan had the benefit of overhearing almost the whole of it and what he heard strengthened the conclusions which his mind had previously formed  he knew altamont at once did he when he saw him in sydney clavering aint no more married to my lady than i am altamonts the man altamonts a convict young harthur comes into parlyment and the govnor promises not to split by jove what a sly old rogue it is that old govnor no wonder hes anxious to make the match between blanche and harthur why shell have a hundred thousand if shes a penny and bring her man a seat in parlyment into the bargain nobody saw but a physiognomist would have liked to behold the expression of mr morgans countenance when this astounding intelligence was made clear to him but for my hage and the confounded preudices of society he said surveying himself in the glass dammy james morgan you might marry her yourself but if he could not marry miss blanche and her fortune morgan thought he could mend his own by the possession of this information and that it might be productive of benefit to him from very many sources of all the persons whom the secret affected the greater number would not like to have it known for instance sir francis clavering whose fortune it involved would wish to keep it quiet colonel altamont whose neck it implicated would naturally be desirous to hush it and that young hupstart beast mr harthur who was for getting into parlyment on the strenth of it and was as proud as if he was a duke with half a millium a year such we grieve to say was morgans opinion of his employers nephew would pay anythink sooner than let the world know that he was married to a convicks daughter and had got his seat in parlyment by trafficking with this secret as for lady c morgan thought if shes tired of clavering and wants to get rid of him shell pay if shes frightened about her son and fond of the little beggar shell pay all the same and miss blanche will certainly come down handsome to the man who will put her into her rights which she was unjustly defrauded of them and no mistake dammy concluded the valet reflecting upon this wonderful hand which luck had given him to play with such cards as these james morgan you are a made man it may be a reglar enewity to me every one of em must susscribe and with what ive made already i may cut business give my old govnor warning turn gentleman and have a servant of my own begad entertaining himself with calculations such as these that were not a little likely to perturb a mans spirit mr morgan showed a very great degree of selfcommand by appearing and being calm and by not allowing his future prospects in any way to interfere with his present duties  one of the persons whom the story chiefly concerned colonel altamont was absent from london when morgan was thus made acquainted with his history the valet knew of sir francis claverings shepherds inn haunt and walked thither an hour or two after the baronet and pendennis had had their conversation together but that bird was flown colonel altamont had received his derby winnings and was gone to the continent the fact of his absence was exceedingly vexatious to mr morgan hell drop all that money at the gamblingshops on the rhind thought morgan and i might have had a good bit of it its confounded annoying to think hes gone and couldnt have waited a few days longer hope triumphant or deferred ambition or disappointment victory or patient ambush morgan bore all alike with similar equable countenance until the proper day came the majors boots were varnished and his hair was curled his early cup of tea was brought to his bedside his oaths rebukes and senile satire borne with silent obsequious fidelity who would think to see him waiting upon his master packing and shouldering his trunks and occasionally assisting at table at the countryhouses where he might be staying that morgan was richer than his employer and knew his secrets and other peoples in the profession mr morgan was greatly respected and admired and his reputation for wealth and wisdom got him much renown at most suppertables the younger gentlemen voted him stoopid a feller of no idears and a fogey in a word but not one of them would not say amen to the heartfelt prayer which some of the most seriousminded among the gentlemen uttered when i die may i cut up as well as morgan pendennis  as became a man of fashion major pendennis spent the autumn passing from house to house of such country friends as were at home to receive him and if the duke happened to be abroad the marquis in scotland condescending to sojourn with sir john or the plain squire to say the truth the old gentlemans reputation was somewhat on the wane many of the men of his time had died out and the occupants of their halls and the present wearers of their titles knew not major pendennis and little cared for his traditions of the wild prince and poins and of the heroes of fashion passed away it must have struck the good man with melancholy as he walked by many a london door to think how seldom it was now opened for him and how often he used to knock at itto what banquets and welcome he used to pass through ita score of years back he began to own that he was no longer of the present age and dimly to apprehend that the young men laughed at him such melancholy musings must come across many a pall mall philosopher the men thinks he are not such as they used to be in his time the old grand manner and courtly grace of life are gone what is castlewood house and the present castlewood compared to the magnificence of the old mansion and owner the late lord came to london with four postchaises and sixteen horses all the north road hurried out to look at his cavalcade the people in london streets even stopped as his procession passed them the present lord travels with five bagmen in a railway carriage and sneaks away from the station smoking a cigar in a brougham the late lord in autumn filled castlewood with company who drank claret till midnight the present man buries himself in a hut on a scotch mountain and passes november in two or three closets in an entresol at paris where his amusements are a dinner at a cafe and a box at a little theatre what a contrast there is between his lady lorraine the regents lady lorraine and her little ladyship of the present era he figures to himself the first beautiful gorgeous magnificent in diamonds and velvets daring in rouge the wits of the world the old wits the old polished gentlemennot the canaille of today with their language of the cabstand and their coats smelling of smoke bowing at her feet and then thinks of todays lady lorrainea little woman in a black silk gown like a governess who talks astronomy and labouring classes and emigration and the deuce knows what and lurks to church at eight oclock in the morning abbotslorraine that used to be the noblest house in the county is turned into a monasterya regular la trappe they dont drink two glasses of wine after dinner and every other man at table is a country curate with a white neckcloth whose talk is about polly higsons progress at school or widow watkinss lumbago and the other young men those lounging guardsmen and great lazy dandiessprawling over sofas and billiardtables and stealing off to smoke pipes in each others bedrooms caring for nothing reverencing nothing not even an old gentleman who has known their fathers and their betters not even a pretty womanwhat a difference there is between these men who poison the very turnips and stubblefields with their tobacco and the gentlemen of our time thinks the major the breed is gonetheres no use for em theyre replaced by a parcel of damned cottonspinners and utilitarians and young sprigs of parsons with their hair combed down their barks im getting old theyre getting past me they laugh at us old boys thought old pendennis and he was not far wrong the times and manners which he admired were pretty nearly gonethe gay young men larked him irreverently whilst the serious youth had a grave pity and wonder at him which would have been even more painful to bear had the old gentleman been aware of its extent but he was rather simple his examination of moral questions had never been very deep it had never struck him perhaps until very lately that he was otherwise than a most respectable and rather fortunate man is there no old age but his without reverence did youthful folly never jeer at other bald pates for the past two or three years he had begun to perceive that his day was wellnigh over and that the men of the new time had begun to reign  after a rather unsuccessful autumn season then during which he was faithfully followed by mr morgan his nephew arthur being engaged as we have seen at clavering it happened that major pendennis came back for a while to london at the dismal end of october when the fogs and the lawyers come to town who has not looked with interest at those loaded cabs piled boxes and crowded children rattling through the streets on the dun october evenings stopping at the dark houses where they discharge nurse and infant girls matron and father whose holidays are over yesterday it was france and sunshine or broadstairs and liberty today comes work and a yellow fog and ye gods what a heap of bills there lies in masters study and the clerk has brought the lawyers papers from chambers and in half an hour the literary man knows that the printers boy will be in the passage and mr smith with that little account that particular little account has called presentient of your arrival and has left word that he will call tomorrow morning at ten who amongst us has not said goodbye to his holiday returned to dun london and his fate surveyed his labours and liabilities laid out before him and been aware of that inevitable little account to settle smith and his little account in the morning symbolise duty difficulty struggle which you will meet let us hope friend with a manly and honest heartand you think of him as the children are slumbering once more in their own beds and the watchful housewife tenderly pretends to sleep  old pendennis had no special labours or bills to encounter on the morrow as he had no affection at home to soothe him he had always money in his desk sufficient for his wants and being by nature and habit tolerably indifferent to the wants of other people these latter were not likely to disturb him but a gentleman may be out of temper though he does not owe a shilling and though he may be ever so selfish he must occasionally feel dispirited and lonely he had had two or three twinges of gout in the countryhouse where he had been staying the birds were wild and shy and the walking over the ploughed fields had fatigued him deucedly the young men had laughed at him and he had been peevish at table once or twice he had not been able to get his whist of an evening and in fine was glad to come away in all his dealings with morgan his valet he had been exceedingly sulky and discontented he had sworn at him and abused him for many days past he had scalded his mouth with bad soup at swindon he had left his umbrella in the railroad carriage at which piece of forgetfulness he was in such a rage that he cursed morgan more freely than ever both the chimneys smoked furiously in his lodgings and when he caused the windows to be flung open he swore so acrimoniously that morgan was inclined to fling him out of window too through that opened casement the valet swore after his master as pendennis went down the street on his way to the club  bayss was not at all pleasant the house had been new painted and smelt of varnish and turpentine and a large streak of white paint inflicted itself on the back of the old boys furcollared surtout the dinner was not good and the three most odious men in all londonold hawkshaw whose cough and accompaniments are fit to make any man uncomfortable old colonel gripley who seizes on all the newspapers and that irreclaimable old bore jawkins who would come and dine at the next table to pendennis and describe to him every innbill which he had paid in his foreign tour each and all of these disagreeable personages and incidents had contributed to make major pendennis miserable and the club waiter trod on his toe as he brought him his coffee never alone appear the immortals the furies always hunt in company they pursued pendennis from home to the club and from the club home  whilst the major was absent from his lodgings morgan had been seated in the landladys parlour drinking freely of hot brandyandwater and pouring out on mrs brixham some of the abuse which he had received from his master upstairs mrs brixham was mr morgans slave he was his landladys landlord he had bought the lease of the house which she rented he had got her name and her sons to acceptances and a bill of sale which made him master of the luckless widows furniture the young brixham was a clerk in an insurance office and morgan could put him into what he called quod any day mrs brixham was a clergymans widow and mr morgan after performing his duties on the first floor had a pleasure in making the old lady fetch him his bootjack and his slippers she was his slave the little black profiles of her son and daughter the very picture of tiddlecot church where she was married and her poor dear brixham lived and died was now morgans property as it hung there over the mantelpiece of his backparlour morgan sate in the widows backroom in the excurates old horsehair studychair making mrs brixham bring supper for him and fill his glass again and again  the liquor was bought with the poor womans own coin and hence morgan indulged in it only the more freely and he had eaten his supper and was drinking a third tumbler when old pendennis returned from the club and went upstairs to his rooms mr morgan swore very savagely at him and his bell when he heard the latter and finished his tumbler of brandy before he went up to answer the summons  he received the abuse consequent on this delay in silence nor did the major condescend to read in the flushed face and glaring eyes of the man the anger under which he was labouring the old gentlemans footbath was at the fire his gown and slippers awaiting him there morgan knelt down to take his boots off with due subordination and as the major abused him from above kept up a growl of maledictions below at his feet thus when pendennis was crying confound you sir mind that strapcurse you dont wrench my foot off morgan sotto voce below was expressing a wish to strangle him drown him and punch his head off  the boots removed it became necessary to divest mr pendennis of his coat and for this purpose the valet had necessarily to approach very near to his employer so near that pendennis could not but perceive what mr morgans late occupation had been to which he adverted in that simple and forcible phraseology which men are sometimes in the habit of using to their domestics informing morgan that he was a drunken beast and that he smelt of brandy  at this the man broke out losing patience and flinging up all subordination im drunk am i im a beast am i im dd am i you infernal old miscreant shall i wring your old head off and drownd yer in that pail of water do you think im agoin to bear your confounded old harrogance you old wigsby chatter your old hivories at me do you you grinning old baboon come on if you are a man and can stand to a man ha you coward knives knives  if you advance a step ill send it into you said the major seizing up a knife that was on the table near him go downstairs you drunken brute and leave the house send for your book and your wages in the morning and never let me see your insolent face again this dd impertinence of yours has been growing for some months past you have been growing too rich you are not fit for service get out of it and out of the house  and where would you wish me to go pray out of the ouse asked the man and wont it be equal convenient tomorrow mornintootyfay mame shose sivvaplay munseer  silence you beast and go cried out the major  morgan began to laugh with rather a sinister laugh look yere pendennis he said seating himself since ive been in this room youve called me beast brute dog and dd me havent you how do you suppose one man likes that sort of talk from another how many years have i waited on you and how many damns and cusses have you given me along with my wages do you think a mans a dog that you can talk to him in this way if i choose to drink a little why shouldnt i ive seen many a gentleman drunk formly and peraps have the abit from them i aint agoin to leave this house old feller and shall i tell you why the house is my house every stick of furnitur in it is mine excep your old traps and your showerbath and your wigbox ive bought the place i tell you with my own industry and perseverance i can show a hundred pound where you can show a fifty or your damned supersellious nephew either ive served you honourable done everythink for you these dozen years and im a dog am i im a beast am i thats the language for gentlemen not for our rank but ill bear it no more i throw up your service im tired on it ive combed your old wig and buckled your old girths and waistbands long enough i tell you dont look savage at me im sitting in my own chair in my own room atelling the truth to you ill be your beast and your brute and your dog no more major pendennis alf pay  the fury of the old gentleman met by the servants abrupt revolt had been shocked and cooled by the concussion as much as if a sudden showerbath or a pail of cold water had been flung upon him that effect produced and his anger calmed morgans speech had interested him and he rather respected his adversary and his courage in facing him as of old days in the fencingroom he would have admired the opponent who hit him  you are no longer my servant the major said and the house may be yours but the lodgings are mine and you will have the goodness to leave them tomorrow morning when we have settled our accounts i shall remove into other quarters in the meantime i desire to go to bed and have not the slightest wish for your further company  well have a settlement dont you be afraid morgan said getting up from his chair i aint done with you yet nor with your family nor with the clavering family major pendennis and that you shall know  have the goodness to leave the room sirim tired said the major  hah youll be more tired of me afore youve done answered the man with a sneer and walked out of the room leaving the major to compose himself as best he might after the agitation of this extraordinary scene  he sate and mused by his fireside over the past events and the confounded impudence and ingratitude of servants and thought how he should get a new man how devilish unpleasant it was for a man of his age and with his habits to part with a fellow to whom he had been accustomed how morgan had a receipt for bootvarnish which was incomparably better and more comfortable to the feet than any he had ever tried how very well he made muttonbroth and tended him when he was unwell gad its a hard thing to lose a fellow of that sort but he must go thought the major he has grown rich and impudent since he has grown rich he was horribly tipsy and abusive tonight we must part and i must go out of the lodgings dammy i like the lodgings im used to em its very unpleasant at my time of life to change my quarters and so on mused the old gentleman the showerbath had done him good the testiness was gone the loss of the umbrella the smell of paint at the club were forgotten under the superior excitement confound the insolent villain thought the old gentleman he understood my wants to a nicety he was the best servant in england he thought about his servant as a man thinks of a horse that has carried him long and well and that has come down with him and is safe no longer how the deuce to replace him where can he get such another animal  in these melancholy cogitations the major who had donned his own dressinggown and replaced his head of hair a little grey had been introduced into the coiffure of late by mr truefitt which had given the majors head the most artless and respectable appearance in these cogitations we say the major who had taken off his wig and put on his nighthandkerchief sate absorbed by the fireside when a feeble knock came at his door which was presently opened by the landlady of the lodgings  god bless my soul mrs brixham cried out the major startled that a lady should behold him in the simple appareil of his nighttoilet itits very late mrs brixham  i wish i might speak to you sir said the landlady very piteously  about morgan i suppose he has cooled himself at the pump cant take him back mrs brixham impossible id determined to part with him before when i heard of his dealings in the discount businessi suppose youve heard of them mrs brixham my servants a capitalist begad  oh sir said mrs brixham i know it to my cost i borrowed from him a little money five years ago and though i have paid him many times over i am entirely in his power i am ruined by him sir everything i had is his hes a dreadful man  eh mrs brixham tout pisdevlish sorry for you and that i must quit your house after lodging here so long theres no help for it i must go  he says we must all go sir sobbed out the luckless widow he came downstairs from you just nowhe had been drinking and it always makes him very wickedand he said that you had insulted him sir and treated him like a dog and spoken to him unkindly and he swore he would be revenged andand i owe him a hundred and twenty pounds sirand he has a bill of sale of all my furnitureand says he will turn me out of my house and send my poor george to prison he has been the ruin of my family that man  devlish sorry mrs brixham pray take a chair what can i do  could you not intercede with him for us george will give half his allowance my daughter can send something if you will but stay on sir and pay a quarters rent in advance  my good madam i would as soon give you a quarter in advance as not if i were going to stay in the lodgings but i cant and i cant afford to fling away twenty pounds my good madam im a poor halfpay officer and want every shilling i have begad as far as a few pounds goessay five poundsi dont sayand shall be most happy and that sort of thing and ill give it you in the morning with pleasure butbut its getting late and i have made a railroad journey  gods will be done sir said the poor woman drying her tears i must bear my fate  and a devlish hard one it is and most sincerely i pity you mrs brixham iill say ten pounds if you will permit me good night  mr morgan sir when he came downstairs and whenwhen i besought him to have pity on me and told him he had been the ruin of my family said something which i did not well understandthat he would ruin every family in the housethat he knew something would bring you down tooand that you should pay him for youryour insolence to him ii must own to you that i went down on my knees to him sir and he said with a dreadful oath against you that he would have you on your knees  meby gad that is too pleasant where is the confounded fellow  he went away sir he said he should see you in the morning oh pray try and pacify him and save me and my poor boy and the widow went away with this prayer to pass her night as she might and look for the dreadful morrow  the last words about himself excited major pendennis so much that his compassion for mrs brixhams misfortunes was quite forgotten in the consideration of his own case  me on my knees thought he as he got into bed confound his impudence who ever saw me on my knees what the devil does the fellow know gad ive not had an affair these twenty years i defy him and the old compaigner turned round and slept pretty sound being rather excited and amused by the events of the daythe last day in bury street he was determined it should be for its impossible to stay on with a valet over me and a bankrupt landlady what good can i do this poor devil of a woman ill give her twenty poundtheres warringtons twenty pound which he has just paidbut whats the use shell want more and more and more and that cormorant morgan will swallow all no dammy i cant afford to know poor people and tomorrow ill say goodbyeto mrs brixham and mr morgan     chapter lxix in which the major neither yields his money nor his life   early next morning pendenniss shutters were opened by morgan who appeared as usual with a face perfectly grave and respectful bearing with him the old gentlemans clothes cans of water and elaborate toilet requisites  its you is it said the old fellow from his bed i shant take you back again you understand  i ave not the least wish to be took back agin major pendennis mr morgan said with grave dignity nor to serve you nor hany man but as i wish you to be comftable as long as you stay in my house i came up to do whats nessary and once more and for the last time mr james morgan laid out the silver dressingcase and strapped the shining razor  these offices concluded he addressed himself to the major with an indescribable solemnity and said thinkin that you would most likely be in want of a respectable pusson until you suited yourself i spoke to a young man last night who is ere  indeed said the warrior in the tentbed  he ave lived in the fust famlies and i can wouch for his respectability  you are monstrous polite grinned the old major and the truth is that after the occurrences of the previous evening morgan had gone out to his own club at the wheel of fortune and there finding frosch a courier and valet just returned from a foreign tour with young lord cubley and for the present disposable had represented to mr frosch that he morgan had a devil of a blow hup with his own govnor and was goin to retire from the business haltogether and that if frosch wanted a tempory job he might probbly have it by applying in bury street  you are very polite said the major and your recommendation i am sure will have every weight  morgan blushed he felt his master was achaffin of him the man have awaited on you before sir he said with great dignity lord de la pole sir gave him to his nephew young lord cubley and he have been with him on his foring tour and not wishing to go to fitzurse castle which froschs chest is delicate and he cannot bear the cold in scotland he is free to serve you or not as you choose  i repeat sir that you are exceedingly polite said the major come in froschyou will do very wellmr morgan will you have the great kindness to  i shall show him what is nessary sir and what is customry for you to wish to ave done will you please to take breakfast ere or at the club major pendennis  with your kind permission i will breakfast here and afterwards we will make our little arrangements  if you please sir  will you now oblige me by leaving the room  morgan withdrew the excessive politeness of his exemployer made him almost as angry as the majors bitterest words and whilst the old gentleman is making his mysterious toilet we will also modestly retire  after breakfast major pendennis and his new aidedecamp occupied themselves in preparing for their departure the establishment of the old bachelor was not very complicated he encumbered himself with no useless wardrobe a bible his mothers a road book pens novel calf elegant and the duke of wellingtons despatches with a few prints maps and portraits of that illustrious general and of various sovereigns and consorts of this country and of the general under whom major pendennis had served in india formed his literary and artistical collection he was always ready to march at a few hours notice and the cases in which he had brought his property into his lodgings some fifteen years before were still in the lofts amply sufficient to receive all his goods these the young woman who did the work of the house and who was known by the name of betty to her mistress and of slavey to mr morgan brought down from their restingplace and obediently dusted and cleaned under the eyes of the terrible morgan his demeanour was guarded and solemn he had spoken no word as yet to mrs brixham respecting his threats of the past night but he looked as if he would execute them and the poor widow tremblingly awaited her fate  old pendennis armed with his cane superintended the package of his goods and chattels under the hands of mr frosch and the slavey burned such of his papers as he did not care to keep flung open doors and closets until they were all empty and now all boxes and chests were closed except his desk which was ready to receive the final accounts of mr morgan  that individual now made his appearance and brought his books as i wish to speak to you in privick peraps you will ave the kindness to request frosch to step downstairs he said on entering  bring a couple of cabs frosch if you pleaseand wait downstairs until i ring for you said the major morgan saw frosch downstairs watched him go along the street upon his errand and produced his books and accounts which were simple and very easily settled  and now sir said he having pocketed the cheque which his exemployer gave him and signed his name to his book with a flourish and now that accounts is closed between us sir he said i porpose to speak to you as one man to anothermorgan liked the sound of his own voice and as an individual indulged in public speaking whenever he could get an opportunity at the club or the housekeepers roomand i must tell you that im in possession of certing infamation  and may i inquire of what nature pray asked the major  its valuble information major pendennis as you know very well i

major aghast no more than lady clavering than miss amory does  tell that to the marines major replied the valet that cock wont fight with me  do you doubt my word you villain  no bad language i dont care one twopenceapny whether your words true or not i tell you i intend this to be a nice little annuity to me major for i have every one of you and i aint such a fool as to let you go i should say

and which had accompanied him in many a campaign one more word you scoundrel and ill shoot you like a mad dog stopby jove ill do it now youll assault me will you youll strike at an old man will you you lying coward kneel down and say your prayers sir for by the lord you shall die  the majors face glared with rage at his adversary who looked terrified before him for a moment and at the next with a shriek of murder sprang towards the open window under which a policeman happened to be on his beat murder police bellowed mr morgan  to his surprise major pendennis wheeled away the table and walked to the other window which was also open he beckoned the policeman come up here policeman he said and then went and placed himself against the door  you miserable sneak he said to morgan the pistol hasnt been loaded these fifteen years as you would have known very well if you had not been such a coward that policeman is coming and i will have him up and have your trunks searched i have reason to believe that you are a thief sir i know you are ill swear to the things  you gave em to meyou gave em to me cried morgan  the major laughed well see he said and the guilty valet remembered some fine lawnfronted shirtsa certain goldheaded canean operaglass which he had forgotten to bring down and of which he had assumed the use along with certain articles of his masters clothes which the old dandy neither wore nor asked for  policeman x entered followed by the seared mrs brixham and her maidofallwork who had been at the door and found some difficulty in closing it against the street amateurs who wished to see the row the major began instantly to speak  i have had occasion to discharge this drunken scoundrel he said both last night and this morning he insulted and assaulted me i am an old man and took up a pistol you see it is not loaded and this coward cried out before he was hurt i am glad you are come i was charging him with taking my property and desired to examine his trunks and his room  the velvet cloak you aint worn these three years nor the weskits and i thought i might take the shirts and ii take my hoath i intended to put back the hoperaglass roared morgan writhing with rage and terror  the man acknowledges that he is a thief the major said calmly he has been in my service for years and i have treated him with every kindness and confidence we will go upstairs and examine his trunks  in those trunks mr morgan had things which he would fain keep from public eyes mr morgan the billdiscounter gave goods as well as money to his customers he provided young spendthrifts with snuff boxes and pins and jewels and pictures and cigars and of a very doubtful quality those cigars and jewels and pictures were their display at a policeoffice the discovery of his occult profession and the exposure of the majors property which he had appropriated indeed rather than stolenwould not have added to the reputation of mr morgan he looked a piteous image of terror and discomfiture  hell smash me will he thought the major ill crush him now and finish with him  but he paused he looked at poor mrs brixhams scared face and he thought for a moment to himself that the man brought to bay and in prison might make disclosures which had best be kept secret and that it was best not to deal too fiercely with a desperate man  stop he said policeman ill speak with this man by himself  do you give mr morgan in charge said the policeman  i have brought no charge as yet the major said with a significant look at his man  thank you sir whispered morgan very low  go outside the door and wait there policeman if you pleasenow morgan you have played one game with me and you have not had the best of it my good man no begad youve not had the best of it though you had the best hand and youve got to pay too now you scoundrel  yes sir said the man  ive only found out within the last week the game which you have been driving you villain young de boots of the blues recognised

an insurance clerk her son have paid you fifty pounds a year ever since and you have got a bill of sale of her furniture and her note of hand for a hundred and fifty pounds she told me so last night by jove sir youve bled that poor woman enough  i wont give it up said morgan if i do im  policeman cried the major  you shall have the bill said morgan youre not going to take money of me and you a gentleman  i shall want you directly said the major to x who here entered and who again withdrew  no my good sir the old gentleman continued i have not any desire to have further pecuniary transactions with you but we will draw out a little paper which you will have the kindness to sign no stopyou shall write it you have improved immensely in writing of late and have now a very good hand you shall sit down and write if you pleasethere at that tablesolet me seewe may as well have the date write bury street st jamess october 21 18  and mr morgan wrote as he was instructed and as the pitiless old major continued  i james morgan having come in extreme poverty into the service of arthur pendennis esquire of bury street st jamess a major in her majestys service acknowledge that i received liberal wages and board wages from my employer during fifteen yearsyou cant object to that i am sure said the major  during fifteen years wrote morgan  in which time by my own care and prudence the dictator resumed i have managed to amass sufficient money to purchase the house in which my master resides and besides to effect other savings amongst other persons from whom i have had money i may mention my present tenant mrs brixham who in consideration of sixty pounds advanced by me five years since has paid back to me the sum of two hundred and fifty pounds sterling besides giving me a note of hand for one hundred and twenty pounds which i restore to her at the desire of my late master major arthur pendennis and therewith free her furniture of which i had a bill of salehave you written  i think if this pistol was loaded id blow your brains out said morgan  no you wouldnt you have too great a respect for your valuable life my good man the major answered let us go on and begin a new sentence  and having in return for my masters kindness stolen his property from him which i acknowledge to be now upstairs in my trunks and having uttered falsehoods regarding his and other honourable families i do hereby in consideration of his clemency to me express my regret for uttering these falsehoods and for stealing his property and declare that i am not worthy of belief and that i hopeyes begadthat i hope to amend for the future signed james morgan  im dd if i sign it said morgan  my good man it will happen to you whether you sign or no begad said the old fellow chuckling at his own wit there i shall not use this you understand unlessunless i am compelled to do so mrs brixham and our friend the policeman will witness it i dare say without reading it and i will give the old lady back her note of hand and say which you will confirm that she and you are quits i see there is frosch come back with the cab for my trunks i shall go to an hotelyou may come in now policeman mr morgan and i have arranged our little dispute if mrs brixham will sign this paper and you policeman will do so i shall be very much obliged to you both mrs brixham you and your worthy landlord mr morgan are quits i wish you joy of him let frosch come and pack the rest of the things  frosch aided by the slavey under the calm superintendence of mr morgan carried major pendenniss boxes to the cabs in waiting and mrs brixham when her persecutor was not by came and asked a heavens blessing upon the major her preserver and the best and quietest and kindest of lodgers and having given her a finger to shake which the humble lady received with a curtsey and over which she was ready to make a speech full of tears the major cut short that valedictory oration and walked out of the house to the hotel in jermyn street which was not many steps from morgans door  that individual looking forth from the parlourwindow discharged anything but blessings at his parting guest but the stout old boy could afford not to be frightened at mr morgan and flung him a look of great contempt and humour as he strutted away with his cane  major pendennis had not quitted his house of bury street many hours and mr morgan was enjoying his otium in a dignified manner surveying the evening fog and smoking a cigar on the doorsteps when arthur pendennis esq the hero of this history made his appearance at the wellknown door  my uncle out i suppose morgan he said to the functionary knowing full well that to smoke was treason in the presence of the major  major pendennis is hout sir said morgan with gravity bowing but not touching the elegant cap which he wore major pendennis have left this ouse today sir and i have no longer the honour of being in his service sir  indeed and where is he  i believe he ave taken tempory lodgings at coxs otel in jummin street said mr morgan and added after a pause are you in town for some time pray sir are you in chambers i should like to have the honour of waiting on you there and would be thankful if you would favour me with a quarter of an hour  do you want my uncle to take you back asked arthur insolent and goodnatured  i want no such thing id see him the man glared at him for a minute but he stopped no sir thank you he said in a softer voice its only with you that i wish to speak on some business which concerns you and perhaps you would favour me by walking into my house  if it is but for a minute or two i will listen to you morgan said arthur and thought to himself i suppose the fellow wants me to patronise him and he entered the house a card was already in the front windows proclaiming that apartments were to be let and having introduced mr pendennis into the diningroom and offered him a chair mr morgan took one himself and proceeded to convey some information to him of which the reader has already had cognisance     chapter lxx in which pendennis counts his eggs   our friend had arrived in london on that day only though but for a brief visit and having left some fellowtravellers at an hotel to which he had convoyed them from the west he hastened to the chambers in lamb court which were basking in as much sun as chose to visit that dreary but not altogether comfortless building freedom stands in lieu of sunshine in chambers and templars grumble but take their ease in their inn pens domestic announced to him that warrington was in chambers too and of course arthur ran up to his friends room straightway and found it as of old perfumed with the pipe and george once more at work with his newspapers and reviews the pair greeted each other with the rough cordiality which young englishmen use one to another and which carries a great deal of warmth and kindness under its rude exterior warrington smiled and took his pipe out of his mouth and said well young one pen advanced and held out his hand and said how are you old boy and so this greeting passed between two friends who had not seen each other for months alphonse and frederic would have rushed into each others arms and shrieked ce bon coeur ce cher alphonse over each others shoulders max and wilhelm would have bestowed half a dozen kisses scented with havannah upon each others mustachios well young one how are you old boy is what two britons say after saving each others lives possibly the day before tomorrow they will leave off shaking hands and only wag their heads at one another as they come to breakfast each has for the other the very warmest confidence and regard each would share his purse with the other and hearing him attacked would break out in the loudest and most enthusiastic praise of his friend but they part with a mere goodbye they meet with a mere howdyoudo and they dont write to each other in the interval curious modesty strange stoical decorum of english friendship yes we are not demonstrative like those confounded foreigners says hardman who not only shows no friendship but never felt any all his life long  been in switzerland says pen  yes says warrington  couldnt find a bit of tobacco fit to smoke till we came to strasburg where i got some caporal the mans mind is full very likely of the great sights which he has seen of the great emotions with which the vast works of nature have inspired it but his enthusiasm is too coy to show itself even to his closest friend and he veils it with a cloud of tobacco he will speak more fully of confidential evenings however and write ardently and frankly about that which he is shy of saying the thoughts and experience of his travel will come forth in his writings as the learning which he never displays in talk enriches his style with pregnant allusion and brilliant illustration colours his generous eloquence and points his wit  the elder gives a rapid account of the places which he has visited in his tour he has seen switzerland north italy and the tyrolhe has come home by vienna and dresden and the rhine he speaks about these places in a shy sulky voice as if he had rather not mention them at all and as if the sight of them had rendered him very unhappy the outline of the elder mans tour thus gloomily sketched out the young one begins to speak he has been in the countryvery much boredcanvassing uncommonly slowhe is here for a day or two and going on toto the neighbourhood of tunbridge wells to some friends that will be uncommonly slow too how hard it is to make an englishman acknowledge that he is happy  and the seat in parliament pen have you made it all right asks warrington  all rightas soon as parliament meets and a new writ can be issued clavering retires and i step into his shoes says pen  and under which king does bezonian speak or die asked warrington do we come out as liberal conservative or as government man or on our own hook  hem there are no politics now every mans politics at least are pretty much the same i have not got acres enough to make me a protectionist nor could i be one i think if i had all the land in the county i shall go pretty much with government and in advance of them upon some social questions which i have been getting up during the vacationdont grin you old cynic i have been getting up the blue books and intend to come out rather strong on the sanitary and colonisation questions  we reserve to ourselves the liberty of voting against government though we are generally friendly we are however friends of the people avant tout we give lectures at the clavering institute and shake bands with the intelligent mechanics we think the franchise ought to be very considerably enlarged at the same time we are free to accept office some day when the house has listened to a few crack speeches from us and the administration perceives our merit  i am not moses said pen with as usual somewhat of melancholy in his voice i have no laws from heaven to bring down to the people from the mountain i dont belong to the mountain at all or set up to be a leader and reformer of mankind my faith is not strong enough for that nor my vanity nor my hypocrisy great enough i will tell no lies george that i promise you and do no more than coincide in those which are necessary and pass current and cant be got in without recalling the whole circulation give a man at least the advantage of his sceptical turn if i find a good thing to say in the house i will say it a good measure i will support it a fair place i will take it and be glad of my luck but i would no more flatter a great man than a mob and now you know as much about my politics as i do what call have i to be a whig whiggism is not a divine institution why not vote with the liberal conservatives they have done for the nation what the whigs would never have done without them who converted boththe radicals and the country outside i think the morning post is often right and punch is often wrong i dont profess a call but take advantage of a chance parlons dautre chose  the next thing at your heart after ambition is love i suppose warrington said how have our young loves prospered are we going to change our condition and give up our chambers are you going to divorce me arthur and take unto yourself a wife  i suppose so she is very goodnatured and lively she sings and she dont mind smoking shell have a fair fortunei dont know how muchbut my uncle augurs everything from the begums generosity and says that she will come down very handsomely and i think blanche is devlish fond of me said arthur with a sigh  that means that we accept her caresses and her money  havent we said before that life was a transaction pendennis said i dont pretend to break my heart about her i have told her pretty fairly what my feelings areandand have engaged myself to her and since i saw her last and for the last two months especially whilst i have been in the country i think she has been growing fonder and fonder of me and her letters to me and especially to laura seem to show it mine have been simple enoughno raptures nor vows you understandbut looking upon the thing as an affaire faite and not desirous to hasten or defer the completion  and laura how is she warrington asked frankly  laura george said pen looking his friend hard in the faceby heaven laura is the best and noblest and dearest girl the sun ever shone upon his own voice fell as he spoke it seemed as if he could hardly utter the words he stretched out his hand to his comrade who took it and nodded his head  have you only found out that now young un warrington said after a pause  who has not learned things too late george cried arthur in his impetuous way gathering words and emotion as he went on whose life is not a disappointment who carries his heart entire to the grave without a mutilation i never knew anybody who was happy quite or who has not had to ransom himself out of the hands of fate with the payment of some dearest treasure or other lucky if we are left alone afterwards when we have paid our fine and if the tyrant visits us no more suppose i have found out that i have lost the greatest prize in the world now that it cant be minethat for years i had an angel under my tent and let her goam i the only oneah dear old boy am i the only one and do you think my lot is easier to bear because i own that i deserve it shes gone from us gods blessing be with her she might have stayed and i lost her its like undine isnt it george  she was in this room once said george  he saw her therehe heard the sweet low voicehe saw the sweet smile and eyes shining so kindlythe face remembered so fondlythought of in what nightwatchesblest and loved alwaysgone now a glass that had held a nosegaya bible with helens handwritingwere all that were left him of that brief flower of his life say it is a dream say it passes better the recollection of a dream than an aimless waking from a blank stupor  the two friends sate in silence a while each occupied with his own thoughts and aware of the others pen broke it presently by saying that he must go and seek for his uncle and report progress to the old gentleman the major had written in a very bad humour the major was getting old i should like to see you in parliament and snugly settled with a comfortable house and an heir to the name before i make my bow show me these the major wrote and then let old arthur pendennis make room for the younger fellows he has walked the pall mall pave long enough  there is a kindness about the old heathen said warrington he cares for somebody besides himself at least for some other part of himself besides that which is buttoned into his own coatfor you and your race he would like to see the progeny of the pendennises multiplying and increasing and hopes that they may inherit the land the old patriarch blesses you from the club window of bayss and is carried off and buried under the flags of st jamess church in sight of piccadilly and the cabstand and the carriages going to the levee it is an edifying ending  the new blood i bring into the family mused pen is rather tainted if i had chosen i think my fatherinlaw amory would not have been the progenitor i should have desired for my race nor my grandfatherinlaw snell nor our oriental ancestors by the way who was amory amory was lieutenant of an indiaman blanche wrote some verses about him about the storm the mountain wave the seamans grave the gallant father and that sort of thing amory was drowned commanding a country ship between calcutta and sydney amory and the begum werent happy together she has been unlucky in her selection of husbands the good old lady for between ourselves a more despicable creature than sir francis clavering of clavering park baronet never never legislated for his country broke in warrington at which pen blushed rather  by the way at baden said warrington i found our friend the chevalier strong in great state and wearing his orders he told me that he had quarrelled with clavering of whom he seemed to have almost as bad an opinion as you have and in fact i think though i will not be certain confided to me his opinion that clavering was an utter scoundrel that fellow bloundell who taught you cardplaying at oxbridge was with strong and time i think has brought out his valuable qualities and rendered him a more accomplished rascal than he was during your undergraduateship but the king of the place was the famous colonel altamont who was carrying all before him giving flies to the whole society and breaking the bank it was said  my uncle knows something about that fellowclavering knows something about him theres something louche regarding him but come i must go to bury street like a dutiful nephew and taking his hat pen prepared to go  i will walk too said warrington and they descended the stairs stopping however at pens chambers which as the reader has been informed were now on the lower story  here pen began sprinkling himself with eaudecologne and carefully scenting his hair and whiskers with that odoriferous water  what is the matter youve not been smoking is it my pipe that has poisoned you growled warrington  i am going to call upon some women said pen imim going to dine with em they are passing through town and are at an hotel in jermyn street  warrington looked with goodnatured interest at the young fellow dandifying himself up to a pitch of completeness and appearing at length in a gorgeous shirtfront and neckcloth fresh gloves and glistening boots george had a pair of thick highlows and his old shirt was torn about the breast and ragged at the collar where his blue beard had worn it  well young un said he simply i like you to be a buck somehow when i walk about with you it is as if i had a rose in my buttonhole and you are still affable i dont think there is any young fellow in the temple turns out like you and i dont believe you were ever ashamed of walking with me yet  dont laugh at me george said pen  i say pen continued the other sadly if you writeif you write to laura i wish you would say god bless her from me  pen blushed and then looked at warrington and thenand then burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughing  im going to dine with her he said i brought her and lady rockminster up from the country todaymade two days of itslept last night at bathi say george come and dine too i may ask any one i please and the old lady is constantly talking about you  george refused george had an article to write george hesitated and oh strange to say at last he agreed to go it was agreed that they should go and call upon the ladies and they marched away in high spirits to the hotel in jermyn street once more the dear face shone upon him once more the sweet voice spoke to him and the tender hand pressed a welcome  there still wanted half an hour to dinner you will go and see your uncle now mr pendennis old lady rockminster said you will not bring him to dinnernohis old stories are intolerable and i want to talk to mr warrington i daresay he will amuse us i think we have heard all your stories we have been together for two whole days and i think we are getting tired of each other  so obeying her ladyships orders arthur went downstairs and walked to his uncles lodgings     chapter lxxi fiat justitia   the dinner was served when arthur returned and lady rockminster began to scold him for arriving late but laura looking at her cousin saw that his face was so pale and scared that she interrupted her imperious patroness and asked with tender alarm what had happened was arthur ill  arthur drank a large bumper of sherry i have heard the most extraordinary news i will tell you afterwards he said looking at the servants he was very nervous and agitated during the dinner dont tramp and beat so with your feet under the table lady rockminster said you have trodden on fido and upset his saucer you see mr warrington keeps his boots quiet  at the dessertit seemed as if the unlucky dinner would never be overlady rockminster said this dinner has been exceedingly stupid i suppose something has happened and that you want to speak to laura i will go and have my nap i am not sure that i shall have any teano good night mr warrington you must come again and when there is no business to talk about and the old lady tossing up her head walked away from the room with great dignity  george and the others had risen with her and warrington was about to go away and was saying good night to laura who of course was looking much alarmed about her cousin when arthur said pray stay george you should hear my news too and give me your counsel in this case i hardly know how to act in it  its something about blanche arthur said laura her heart beating and her cheek blushing as she thought it had never blushed in her life  yesand the most extraordinary story said pen when i left you to go to my uncles lodgings i found his servant morgan who has been with him so long at the door and he said that he and his master had parted that morning that my uncle had quitted the house and had gone to an hotelthis hotel i asked for him when i came in but he was gone out to dinner morgan then said that he had something of a most important nature to communicate to me and begged me to step into the house his house it is now it appears the scoundrel has saved a great deal of money whilst in my uncles service and is now a capitalist and a millionaire for what i know well i went into the house and what do you think he told me this must be a secret between us allat least if we can keep it now that it is in possession of that villain blanches father is not dead he has come to life again the marriage between clavering and the begum is no marriage  and blanche i suppose is her grandfathers heir said warrington  perhaps but the child of what a father amory is an escaped convictclavering knows it my uncle knows itand it was with this piece of information held over clavering in terrorem that the wretched old man got him to give up his borough to me  blanche doesnt know it said laura nor poor lady clavering  no said pen blanche does not even know the history of her father she knew that he and her mother had separated and had heard as a child from bonner her nurse that mr amory was drowned in new south wales he was there as a convict not as a shipscaptain as the poor girl thought lady clavering has told me that they were not happy and that her husband was a bad character she would tell me all she said some day and i remember her saying to me with tears in her eyes that it was hard for a woman to be forced to own that she was glad to hear her husband was dead and that twice in her life she should have chosen so badly what is to be done now the man cant show and claim his wife death is probably over him if he discovers himself return to transportation certainly but the rascal has held the threat of discovery over clavering for some time past and has extorted money from him time after time  it is our friend colonel altamont of course said warrington i see all now  if the rascal comes back continued arthur morgan who knows his secret will use it over himand having it in his possession proposes to extort money from us all the dd rascal supposed i was cognisant of it said pen white with anger asked me if i would give him an annuity to keep it quiet threatened me me as if i was trafficking with this wretched old begums misfortune and would extort a seat in parliament out of that miserable clavering good heavens was my uncle mad to tamper in such a conspiracy fancy our mothers son laura trading on such a treason  i cant fancy it dear arthur said laura seizing arthurs hand and kissing it  no broke out warringtons deep voice with a tremor he surveyed the two generous and loving young people with a pang of indescribable love and pain no our boy cant meddle with such a wretched intrigue as that arthur pendennis cant marry a convicts daughter and sit in parliament as member for the hulks you must wash your hands of the whole affair pen you must break off you must give no explanations of why and wherefore but state that family reasons render a match impossible it is better that those poor women should fancy you false to your word than that they should know the truth besides you can get from that dog claveringi can fetch that for you easily enough an acknowledgment that the reasons which you have given to him as the head of the family are amply sufficient for breaking off the union dont you think with me laura he scarcely dared to look her in the face as he spoke any lingering hope that he might haveany feeble hold that he might feel upon the last spar of his wrecked fortune he knew he was casting away and he let the wave of his calamity close over him pen had started up whilst he was speaking looking eagerly at him he turned his head away he saw laura rise up also and go to pen and once more take his hand and kiss it she thinks so toogod bless her said george  her fathers shame is not blanches fault dear arthur is it laura said very pale and speaking very quickly suppose you had been married would you desert her because she had done no wrong are you not pledged to her would you leave her because she is in misfortune and if she is unhappy wouldnt you console her our mother would had she been here and as she spoke the kind girl folded her arms round him and buried her face upon his heart  our mother is an angel with god pen sobbed out and you are the dearest and best of womenthe dearest the dearest and the best teach me my duty pray for me that i may do itpure heart god bless yougod bless you my sister  amen groaned out warrington with his head in his hands she is right he murmured to himself she cant do any wrong i thinkthat girl indeed she looked and smiled like an angel many a day after he saw that smilesaw her radiant face as she looked up at pensaw her putting back her curls blushing and smiling and still looking fondly towards him  she leaned for a moment her little fair hand on the table playing on it and now and now she said looking at the two gentlemen  and what now asked george  and now we will have some tea said miss laura with her smile  but before this unromantic conclusion to a rather sentimental scene could be suffered to take place a servant brought word that major pendennis had returned to the hotel and was waiting to see his nephew upon this announcement laura not without some alarm and an appealing look to pen which said behave yourself wellhold to the right and do your dutybe gentle but firm with your unclelaura we say with these warnings written in her face took leave of the two gentlemen and retreated to her dormitory warrington who was not generally fond of tea yet grudged that expected cup very much why could not old pendennis have come in an hour later well an hour sooner or later what matter the hour strikes at last the inevitable moment comes to say farewell the hand is shaken the door closed and the friend gone and the brief joy over you are alone in which of those many windows of the hotel does her light beam perhaps he asks himself as he passes down the street he strides away to the smokingroom of a neighbouring club and there applies himself to his usual solace of a cigar men are brawling and talking loud about politics operagirls horseracing the atrocious tyranny of the committeebearing this sacred secret about him he enters into this brawl talk away each louder than the other rattle and crack jokes laugh and tell your wild stories it is strange to take ones place and part in the midst of the smoke and din and think every man here has his secret ego most likely which is sitting lonely and apart away in the private chamber from the loud game in which the rest of us is joining  arthur as he traversed the passages of the hotel felt his anger rousing up within him he was indignant to think that yonder old gentleman whom he was about to meet should have made him such a tool and puppet and so compromised his honour and good name the old fellows hand was very cold and shaky when arthur took it he was coughing he was grumbling over the fire frosch could not bring his dressinggown or arrange his papers as that dd confounded impudent scoundrel of a morgan the old gentleman bemoaned himself and cursed morgans ingratitude with peevish pathos  the confounded impudent scoundrel he was drunk last night and challenged me to fight him pen and begad at one time i was so excited that i thought i should have driven a knife into him and the infernal rascal has made ten thousand pound i believeand deserves to be hanged and will be but curse him i wish he could have lasted out my time he knew all my ways and dammy when i rang the bell the confounded thief brought the thing i wantednot like that stupid german lout and what sort of time have you had in the country been a good deal with lady rockminster you cant do better she is one of the old schoolvieille ecole bonne ecole hey dammy they dont make gentlemen and ladies now and in fifty years youll hardly know one man from another but theyll last my time i aint long for this business i am getting very old pen my boy and gad i was thinking today as i was packing up my little library theres a bible amongst the books that belonged to my poor mother i would like you to keep that pen i was thinking sir that you would most likely open the box when it was your property and the old fellow was laid under the sod sir and the major coughed and wagged his old head over the fire  his agehis kindness disarmed pens anger somewhat and made arthur feel no little compunction for the deed which he was about to do he knew that the announcement which he was about to make would destroy the darling hope of the old gentlemans life and create in his breast a woful anger and commotion  heyheyim off sir nodded the elder but id like to read a speech of yours in the times before i gomr pendennis said unaccustomed as i am to public speakinghey sir hey arthur begad you look devlish well and healthy sir i always said my brother jack would bring the family right you must go down into the west and buy the old estate sir nec tenui penna hey well rise again sirrise again on the wingand begad i shouldnt be surprised that you will be a baronet before you die  his words smote pen and it is i he thought that am going to fling down the poor old fellows aircastle well it must be here goesii went into your lodgings at bury street though i did not find you pen slowly beganand i talked with morgan uncle  indeed the old gentlemans cheek began to flush involuntarily and he muttered the cats out of the bag now begad  he told me a story sir which gave me the deepest surprise and pain said pen  the major tried to look unconcerned whatthat story aboutaboutwhatdyoucallem hey  about miss amorys fatherabout lady claverings first husband and who he is and what  hema devlish awkward affair said the old man rubbing his nose iive been aware of thatehconfounded circumstance for some time  i wish i had known it sooner or not at all said arthur gloomily  he is all safe thought the senior greatly relieved gad i should have liked to keep it from you altogetherand from those two poor women who are as innocent as unborn babes in the transaction  you are right there is no reason why the two women should hear it and i shall never tell themthough that villain morgan perhaps may arthur said gloomily he seems disposed to trade upon his secret and has already proposed terms of ransom to me i wish i had known of the matter earlier sir it is not a very pleasant thought to me that i am engaged to a convicts daughter  the very reason why i kept it from youmy dear boy but miss amory is not a convicts daughter dont you see miss amory is the daughter of lady clavering with fifty or sixty thousand pounds for a fortune and her fatherinlaw a baronet and country gentleman of high reputation approves of the match and gives up his seat in parliament to his soninlaw what can be more simple  is it true sir  begad yes it is true of course its true amorys dead i tell you he is dead the first sign of life he shows he is dead he cant appear we have him at a deadlock like the fellow in the playthe critic heydevlish amusing play that critic monstrous witty man sheridan and so was his son by gad sir when i was at the cape i remember  the old gentlemans garrulity and wish to conduct arthur to the cape perhaps arose from a desire to avoid the subject which was nearest his nephews heart but arthur broke out interrupting himif you had told me this tale sooner i believe you would have spared me and yourself a great deal of pain and disappointment and i should not have found myself tied to an engagement from which i cant in honour recede  no begad weve fixed youand a man whos fixed to a seat in parliament and a pretty girl with a couple of thousand a year is fixed to no bad thing let me tell you said the old man  great heavens sir said arthur are you blind cant you see  see what young gentleman asked the other  see that rather than trade upon this secret of amorys arthur cried out i would go and join my fatherinlaw at the hulks see that rather than take a seat in parliament as a bribe from clavering for silence i would take the spoons off the table see that you have given me a felons daughter for a wife doomed me to poverty and shame cursed my career when it might have beenwhen it might have been so different but for you dont you see that we have been playing a guilty game and have been overreachedthat in offering to marry this poor girl for the sake of her money and the advancement she would bring i was degrading myself and prostituting my honour  what in heavens name do you mean sir cried the old man  i mean to say that there is a measure of baseness which i cant pass arthur said i have no other words for it and am sorry if they hurt you i have felt for months past that my conduct in this affair has been wicked sordid and worldly i am rightly punished by the event and having sold myself for money and a seat in parliament by losing both  how do you mean that you lose either shrieked the old gentleman who the devils to take your fortune or your seat away from you by g clavering shall give em to you you shall have every shilling of eighty thousand pounds  ill keep my promise to miss amory sir said arthur  and begad her parents shall keep theirs to you  not so please god arthur answered i have sinned but heaven help me i will sin no more i will let clavering off from that bargain which was made without my knowledge i will take no money with blanche but that which was originally settled upon her and i will try to make her happy you have done it you have brought this on me sir but you knew no better and i forgive  arthurin gods namein your fathers who by heavens was the proudest man alive and had

dear boy dont fling this chance away its the making of you youre sure to get on youll be a baronet its three thousand a year dammy on my knees there i beg of you dont do this  and the old man actually sank down on his knees and seizing one of arthurs hands looked up piteously at him it was cruel to remark the shaking hands the wrinkled and quivering face the old eyes weeping and winking the broken voice ah sir said arthur with a groan you have brought pain enough on me spare me this you have wished me to marry blanche i marry her for gods sake sir rise i cant bear it  youyou mean to say that you will take her as a beggar and be one yourself said the old gentleman rising up and coughing violently  i look at her as a person to whom a great calamity has befallen and to whom i am promised she cannot help the misfortune and as she had my word when she was prosperous i shall not withdraw it now she is poor i will not take claverings seat unless afterwards it should be given of his free will i will not have a shilling more than her original fortune  have the kindness to ring the bell said the old gentleman i have done my best and said my say and im a devlish old fellow andandit dont matter andand shakspeare was rightand cardinal wolseybegadand had i but served my god as ive served youyes on my knees by jove to my own nephewi mightnt have beengood night sir you neednt trouble yourself to call again  arthur took his hand which the old man left to him it was quite passive and clammy he looked very much oldened and it seemed as if the contest and defeat had quite broken him  on the next day he kept his bed and refused to see his nephew     chapter lxxii in which the decks begin to clear   when arrayed in his dressinggown pen walked up according to custom to warringtons chambers next morning to inform his friend of the issue of the last nights interview with his uncle and to ask as usual for georges advice and opinion mrs flanagan the laundress was the only person whom arthur found in the dear old chambers george had taken a carpetbag and was gone his address was to his brothers house in suffolk packages addressed to the newspaper and review for which he wrote lay on the table awaiting delivery  i found him at the table when i came the dear gentleman mrs flanagan said writing at his papers and one of the candles was burned out and hard as his bed is he wasnt in it all night sir  indeed having sat at the club until the brawl there became intolerable to him george had walked home and had passed the night finishing some work on which he was employed and to the completion of which he bent himself with all his might the labour was done and the night was worn away somehow and the tardy november dawn came and looked in on the young man as he sate over his desk in the next days paper or quarters review many of us very likely admired the work of his genius the variety of his illustration the fierce vigour of his satire the depth of his reason there was no hint in his writing of the other thoughts which occupied him and always accompanied him in his worka tone more melancholy than was customary a satire more bitter and impatient than that which he afterwards showed may have marked the writings of this period of his life to the very few persons who knew his style or his name we have said before could we know the mans feelings as well as the authors thoughtshow interesting most books would bemore interesting than merry i suppose harlequins face behind his mask is always grave if not melancholycertainly each man who lives by the pen and happens to read this must remember if he will his own experiences and recall many solemn hours of solitude and labour what a constant care sate at the side of the desk and accompanied him fever or sickness were lying possibly in the next room a sick child might be there with a wife watching over it terrified and in prayer or grief might be bearing him down and the cruel mist before the eyes rendering the paper scarce visible as he wrote on it and the inexorable necessity drove on the pen what man among us has not had nights and hours like these but to the manly heartsevere as these pangs are they are endurable long as the night seems the dawn comes at last and the wounds heal and the fever abates and rest comes and you can afford to look back on the past misery with feelings that are anything but bitter  two or three books for reference fragments of tornup manuscript drawers open pens and inkstand lines half visible on the blottingpaper a bit of sealingwax twisted and bitten and broken into sundry piecessuch relics as these were about the table and pen flung himself down in georges empty chairnoting things according to his wont or in spite of himself there was a gap in the bookcase next to the old college plato with the boniface arms where helens bible used to be he has taken that with him thought pen he knew why his friend was gone dear dear old george  pen rubbed his hand over his eyes oh how much wiser how much better how much nobler he is than i he thought where was such a friend or such a brave heart where shall i ever hear such a frank voice and kind laughter where shall i ever see such a true gentleman no wonder she loved him god bless him what was i compared to him what could she do else but love him to the end of our days we will be her brothers as fate wills that we can be no more well be her knights and wait on her and when were old well say how we loved her dear dear old george  when pen descended to his own chambers his eye fell on the letterbox of his outer door which he had previously overlooked and there was a little note to a p esq in georges wellknown handwriting george had put into pens box probably as he was going away     dear peni shall be halfway home when you breakfast and intend    to stay over christmas in norfolk or elsewhere    i have my own opinion of the issue of matters about which we talked    in j st yesterday and think my presence de trop                                           vale          g w    give my very best regards and adieux to your cousin   and so george was gone and mrs flanagan the laundress ruled over his empty chambers  pen of course had to go and see his uncle on the day after their colloquy and not being admitted he naturally went to lady rockminsters apartments where the old lady instantly asked for bluebeard and insisted that he should come to dinner  bluebeard is gone pen said and he took out poor georges scrap of paper and handed it to laura who looked at itdid not look at pen in return but passed the paper back to him and walked away pen rushed into an eloquent eulogium upon his dear old george to lady rockminster who was astonished at his enthusiasm she had never heard him so warm in praise of anybody and told him with her usual frankness that she didnt think it had been in his nature to care so much about any other person  as mr pendennis was passing in waterloo place in one of his many walks to the hotel where laura lived and whither duty to his uncle carried arthur every day arthur saw issuing from messrs gimcracks celebrated shop an old friend who was followed to his brougham by an obsequious shopman bearing parcels the gentleman was in the deepest mourning the brougham the driver and the horse were in mourning grief in easy circumstances and supported by the comfortablest springs and cushions was typified in the equipage and the little gentleman its proprietor  what foker hail foker cried out penthe reader no doubt has likewise recognised arthurs old schoolfellowand he held out his hand to the heir of the late lamented john henry foker esq the master of logwood and other houses the principal partner in the great brewery of foker and co the greater portion of fokers entire  a little hand covered with a glove of the deepest ebony and set off by three inches of a snowy wristband was put forth to meet arthurs salutation the other little hand held a little morocco case containing no doubt something precious of which mr foker had just become proprietor in messrs gimcracks shop pens keen eyes and satiric turn showed him at once upon what errand mr foker had been employed and he thought of the heir in horace pouring forth the gathered wine of his fathers vats and that human nature is pretty much the same in regent street as in the via sacra  le roi est mort vive le roi said arthur  ah said the other yes thank youvery much obliged how do you do penvery busygoodbye and he jumped into the black brougham and sate like a little black care behind the black coachman he had blushed on seeing pen and shown other signs of guilt and perturbation which pen attributed to the novelty of his situation and on which he began to speculate in his usual sardonic manner  yes so wags the world thought pen the stone closes over harry the fourth and harry the fifth reigns in his stead the old ministers at the brewery come and kneel before him with their books the draymen his subjects fling up their red caps and shout for him what a grave deference and sympathy the bankers and the lawyers show there was too great a stake at issue between those two that they should ever love each other very cordially as long as one man keeps another out of twenty thousand a year the younger must be always hankering after the crown and the wish must be the father to the thought of possession thank heaven there was no thought of money between me and our dear mother laura  there never could have been you would have spurned it cried laura why make yourself more selfish than you are pen and allow your mind to own for an instant that it would have entertained suchsuch dreadful meanness you make me blush for you arthur you make me her eyes finished this sentence and she passed her handkerchief across them  there are some truths which women will never acknowledge pen said and from which your modesty always turns away i do not say that i ever knew the feeling only that i am glad i had not the temptation is there any harm in that confession of weakness  we are all taught to ask to be delivered from evil arthur said laura in a low voice i am glad if you were spared from that great crime and only sorry to think that you could by any possibility have been led into it but you never could and you dont think you could your acts are generous and kind you disdain mean actions you take blanche without money and without a bribe yes thanks be to heaven dear brother you could not have sold yourself away i knew you could not when it came to the day and you did not praise bebe where praise is due why does this horrid scepticism pursue you my arthur why doubt and sneer at your own heartat every ones oh if you knew the pain you give mehow i lie awake and think of those hard sentences dear brother and wish them unspoken unthought  do i cause you many thoughts and many tears laura asked arthur the fulness of innocent love beamed from her in reply a smile heavenly pure a glance of unutterable tenderness sympathy pity shone in her faceall which indications of love and purity arthur beheld and worshipped in her as you would watch them in a child as one fancies one might regard them in an angel  ii dont know what i have done he said simply to have merited such regard from two such women it is like undeserved praise lauraor too much good fortune which frightens oneor a great post when a man feels that he is not fit for it ah sister how weak and wicked we are how spotless and full of love and truth heaven made you i think for some of you there has been no fall he said looking at the charming girl with an almost paternal glance of admiration you cant help having sweet thoughts and doing good actions dear creature they are the flowers which you bear  and what else sir asked laura i see a sneer coming over your face what is it why does it come to drive all the good thoughts away  a sneer is there i was thinking my dear that nature in making you so good and loving did very well but  but what what is that wicked but and why are you always calling it up  but will come in spite of us but is reflection but is the sceptics familiar with whom he has made a compact and if he forgets it and indulges in happy daydreams or building of aircastles or listens to sweet music let us say or to the bells ringing to church but taps at the door and says master i am here you are my master but i am yours go where you will you cant travel without me i will whisper to you when you are on your knees at church i will be at your marriage pillow i will sit down at your table with your children i will be behind your deathbed curtain that is what but is pen said  pen you frighten me cried laura  do you know what but came and said to me just now when i was looking at you but said if that girl had reason as well as love she would love you no more if she knew you as you arethe sullied selfish being which you knowshe must part from you and could give you no love and no sympathy didnt i say he added fondly that some of you seem exempt from the fall love you know but the knowledge of evil is kept from you  what is this you young folks are talking about asked lady rockminster who at this moment made her appearance in the room having performed in the mystic retirement of her own apartments and under the hands of her attendant those elaborate toiletrites without which the worthy old lady never presented herself to public view mr pendennis you are always coming here  it is very pleasant to be here arthur said and we were talking when you came in about my friend foker whom i met just now and who as your ladyship knows has succeeded to his fathers kingdom  he has a very fine property he has fifteen thousand a year he is my cousin he is a very worthy young man he must come and see me said lady rockminster with a look at laura  he has been engaged for many years past to his cousin lady  lady ann is a foolish little chit lady rockminster said with much dignity and i have no patience with her she has outraged every feeling of society she has broken her fathers heart and thrown away fifteen thousand a year  thrown away what has happened asked pen  it will be the talk of the town in a day or two and there is no need why i should keep the secret any longer said lady rockminster who had written and received a dozen letters on the subject i had a letter yesterday from my daughter who was staying at drummington until all the world was obliged to go away on account of the frightful catastrophe which happened there when mr foker came home from nice and after the funeral lady ann went down on her knees to her father said that she never could marry her cousin that she had contracted another attachment and that she must die rather than fulfil her contract poor lord rosherville who is dreadfully embarrassed showed his daughter what the state of his affairs was and that it was necessary that the arrangements should take place and in fine we all supposed that she had listened to reason and intended to comply with the desires of her family but what has happenedlast thursday she went out after breakfast with her maid and was married in the very church in drummington park to mr hobson her fathers own chaplain and her brothers tutor a redhaired widower with two children poor dear rosherville is in a dreadful way he wishes henry foker should marry alice or barbara but alice is marked with the smallpox and barbara is ten years older than he is and of course now the young man is his own master he will think of choosing for himself the blow on lady agnes is very cruel she is inconsolable she has the house in grosvenor street for her life and her settlement which was very handsome have you not met her yes she dined one day at lady claveringsthe first day i saw you and a very disagreeable young man i thought you were but i have formed you we have formed him havent we laura where is bluebeard let him come that horrid grindley the dentist will keep me in town another week  to the latter part of her ladyships speech arthur gave no ear he was thinking for whom could foker be purchasing those trinkets which he was carrying away from the jewellers why did harry seem anxious to avoid him could he be still faithful to the attachment which had agitated him so much and sent him abroad eighteen months back psha the bracelets and presents were for some of harrys old friends of the opera or the french theatre rumours from naples and paris rumours such as are borne to club smokingrooms had announced that the young man had found distractions or precluded from his virtuous attachment the poor fellow had flung himself back upon his old companions and amusementsnot the only man or woman whom society forces into evil or debars from good not the only victim of the worlds selfish and wicked laws  as a good thing when it is to be done cannot be done too quickly laura was anxious that pens marriage intentions should be put into execution as speedily as possible and pressed on his arrangements with rather a feverish anxiety why could she not wait pen could afford to do so with perfect equanimity but laura would hear of no delay she wrote to pen she implored pen she used every means to urge expedition it seemed as if she could have no rest until arthurs happiness was complete  she offered herself to dearest blanche to come and stay at tunbridge with her when lady rockminster should go on her intended visit to the reigning house of rockminster and although the old dowager scolded and ordered and commanded laura was deaf and disobedient she must go to tunbridge she would go to tunbridge she who ordinarily had no will of her own and complied smilingly with anybodys whim and caprices showed the most selfish and obstinate determination in this instance the dowager lady must nurse herself in her rheumatism she must read herself to sleep if she would not hear her maid whose voice croaked and who made sad work of the sentimental passages in the novelslaura must goand be with her new sister in another week she proposed with many loves and regards to dear lady clavering to pass some time with dearest blanche  dearest blanche wrote instantly in reply to dearest lauras no 1 to say with what extreme delight she should welcome her sister how charming it would be to practise their old duets together to wander oer the grassy sward and amidst the yellowing woods of penshurst and southborough blanche counted the hours till she should embrace her dearest friend  laura no 2 expressed her delight at dearest blanches affectionate reply she hoped that their friendship would never diminish that the confidence between them would grow in after years that they should have no secrets from each other that the aim of the life of each would be to make one person happy  blanche no 2 followed in two days how provoking their house was very small the two spare bedrooms were occupied by that horrid mrs planter and her daughter who had thought proper to fall ill she always fell ill in countryhouses and she could not or would not be moved for some days  laura no 3 it was indeed very provoking l had hoped to hear one of dearest bs dear songs on friday but she was the more consoled to wait because lady r was not very well and liked to be nursed by her poor major pendennis was very unwell too in the same hoteltoo unwell even to see arthur who was constant in his calls on his uncle arthurs heart was full of tenderness and affection she had known arthur all her life she would answeryes even in italics she would answerfor his kindness his goodness and his gentleness  blanche no 3 what is this most surprising most extraordinary letter from a p what does dearest laura know about it what has happened what what mystery is enveloped under his frightful reserve  blanche no 3 requires an explanation and it cannot be better given than in the surprising and mysterious letter of arthur pendennis     chapter lxxiii mr and mrs sam huxter   dear blanche arthur wrote you are always reading and dreaming pretty dramas and exciting romances in real life are you now prepared to enact a part of one and not the pleasantest part dear blanche that in which the heroine takes possession of her fathers palace and wealth and introducing her husband to the loyal retainers and faithful vassals greets her happy bridegroom with all of this is mine and thinebut the other character that of the luckless lady who suddenly discovers that she is not the princes wife but claude melnottes the beggars that of alnaschars wife who comes in just as her husband has kicked over the tray of porcelain which was to be the making of his fortunebut stay alnaschar who kicked down the china was not a married man he had cast his eye on the viziers daughter and his hopes of her went to the ground with the shattered bowls and teacups  will you be the viziers daughter and refuse and laugh to scorn alnaschar or will you be the lady of lyons and love the penniless claude melnotte i will act that part if you like i will love you my best in return i will do my all to make your humble life happy for humble it will be at least the odds are against any other conclusion we shall live and die in a poor prosy humdrum way there will be no stars and epaulettes for the hero of our story i shall write one or two more stories which will presently be forgotten i shall be called to the bar and try to get on in my profession perhaps some day if i am very lucky and work very hard which is absurd i may get a colonial appointment and you may be an indian judges lady meanwhile i shall buy back the pall mall gazette the publishers are tired of it since the death of poor shandon and will sell it for a small sum warrington will be my right hand and write it up to a respectable sale i will introduce you to mr finucane the subeditor and i know who in the end will be mrs finucanea very nice gentle creature who has lived sweetly through a sad life and we will jog on i say and look out for better times and earn our living decently you shall have the operaboxes and superintend the fashionable intelligence and break your little heart in the poets corner shall we live over the officesthere are four very good rooms a kitchen and a garret for laura in catherine street in the strand or would you like a house in the waterloo roadit would be very pleasant only there is that halfpenny toll at the bridge the boys may go to kings college maynt they does all this read to you like a joke  ah dear blanche it is no joke and i am sober and telling the truth our fine daydreams are gone our carriage has whirled out of sight like cinderellas our house in belgravia has been whisked away into the air by a malevolent genius and i am no more a member of parliament than i am a bishop on his bench in the house of lords or a duke with a garter at his knee you know pretty well what my property is and your own little fortune we may have enough with those two to live in decent comfort to take a cab sometimes when we go out to see our friends and not to deny ourselves an omnibus when we are tired but that is all is that enough for you my little dainty lady i doubt sometimes whether you can bear the life which i offer youat least it is fair that you should know what it will be if you say yes arthur i will follow your fate whatever it may be and be a loyal and loving wife to aid and cheer youcome to me dear blanche and may god help me so that i may do my duty to you if not and you look to a higher station i must not bar blanches fortunei will stand in the crowd and see your ladyship go to court when you are presented and you shall give me a smile from your chariot window i saw lady mirabel going to the drawingroom last season the happy husband at her side glittered with stars and cordons all the flowers in the garden bloomed in the coachmans bosom will you have these and the chariot or walk on foot and mend your husbands stockings  i cannot tell you nowafterwards i might should the day come when we may have no secrets from one anotherwhat has happened within the last few hours which has changed all my prospects in life but so it is that i have learned something which forces me to give up the plans which i had formed and many vain and ambitious hopes in which i had been indulging i have written and despatched a letter to sir francis clavering saying that i cannot accept his seat in parliament until after my marriage in like manner i cannot and will not accept any larger fortune with you than that which has always belonged to you since your grandfathers death and the birth of your halfbrother your good mother is not in the least awarei hope she never may beof the reasons which force me to this very strange decision they arise from a painful circumstance which is attributable to none of our faults but having once befallen they are as fatal and irreparable as that shock which overset honest alnaschars porcelain and shattered all his hopes beyond the power of mending i write gaily enough for there is no use in bewailing such a hopeless mischance we have not drawn the great prize in the lottery dear blanche but i shall be contented enough without it if you can be so and i repeat with all my heart that i will do my best to make you happy  and now what news shall i give you my uncle is very unwell and takes my refusal of the seat in parliament in sad dudgeon the scheme was his poor old gentleman and he naturally bemoans its failure but warrington laura and i had a council of war they know this awful secret and back me in my decision you must love george as you love what is generous and upright and noble and as for laurashe must be our sister blanche our saint our good angel with two such friends at home what need we care for the world without or who is member for clavering or who is asked or not asked to the great balls of the season  to this frank communication came back the letter from blanche to laura and one to pen himself which perhaps his own letter justified you are spoiled by the world blanche wrote you do not love your poor blanche as she would be loved or you would not offer thus lightly to take her or to leave her no arthur you love me nota man of the world you have given me your plighted troth and are ready to redeem it but that entire affection that love whole and abiding wherewhere is that vision of my youth i am but a pastime of your life and i would be its allbut a fleeting thought and i would be your whole soul i would have our two hearts one but ah my arthur how lonely yours is how little you give me of it you speak of our parting with a smile on your lip of our meeting and you care not to hasten it is life but a disillusion then and are the flowers of our garden faded away i have wepti have prayedi have passed sleepless hoursi have shed bitter bitter tears over your letter to you i bring the gushing poesy of my beingthe yearnings of the soul that longs to be lovedthat pines for love love love beyond allthat flings itself at your feet and cries love me arthur your heart beats no quicker at the kneeling appeal of my loveyour proud eye is dimmed by no tear of sympathyyou accept my souls treasure as though twere dross not the pearls from the unfathomable deeps of affection not the diamonds from the caverns of the heart you treat me like a slave and bid me bow to my master is this the guerdon of a free maidenis this the price of a lifes passion ah me when was it otherwise when did love meet with aught but disappointment could i hope fond fool to be the exception to the lot of my race and lay my fevered brow on a heart that comprehended my own foolish girl that i was one by one all the flowers of my young life have faded away and this the last the sweetest the dearest the fondly the madly loved the wildly cherishedwhere is it but no more of this heed not my bleeding heartbless you bless you always arthur  i will write more when i am more collected my racking brain renders thought almost impossible i long to see laura she will come to us directly we return from the country will she not and you cold one  b   the words of this letter were perfectly clear and written in blanches neatest hand upon her scented paper and yet the meaning of the composition not a little puzzled pen did blanche mean to accept or to refuse his polite offer her phrases either meant that pen did not love her and she declined him or that she took him and sacrificed herself to him cold as he was he laughed sardonically over the letter and over the transaction which occasioned it he laughed to think how fortune had jilted him and how he deserved his slippery fortune he turned over and over the musky giltedged riddle it amused his humour he enjoyed it as if it had been a funny story  he was thus seated twiddling the queer manuscript in his hand joking grimly to himself when his servant came in with a card from a gentleman who wished to speak to him very particularly and if pen had gone out into the passage he would have seen sucking his stick rolling his eyes and showing great marks of anxiety his old acquaintance mr samuel huxter  mr huxter on particular business pray beg mr huxter to come in said pen amused rather and not the less so when poor sam appeared before him  pray take a chair mr huxter said pen in his most superb manner in what way can i be of service to you  i had rather not speak before the flunkbefore the man mr pendennis on which mr arthurs attendant quitted the room  im in a fix said mr huxter gloomily  indeed  she sent me to you continued the young surgeon  what fanny is she well i was coming to see her but i have had a great deal of business since my return to london  i heard of you through my governor and jack hobnell broke in huxter i wish you joy mr pendennis both of the borough and the lady sir fanny wishes you joy too he added with something of a blush  theres many a slip between the cup and the lip who knows what may happen mr huxter or who will sit in parliament for clavering next session  you can do anything with my governor continued mr huxter you got him clavering park the old boy was very much pleased sir at your calling him in hobnell wrote me so do you think you could speak to the governor for me mr pendennis  and tell him what  ive gone and done it sir said huxter with a particular look  youyou dont mean to say you haveyou have done any wrong to that dear little creature sir said pen starting up in a great fury  i hope not said huxter with a hangdog look but ive married her and i know there will be an awful shindy at home it was agreed that i should be taken into partnership when i had passed the college and it was to have been huxter and son but i would have it confound it its all over now and the old boys wrote me that hes coming up to town for drugs he will be here tomorrow and then it must all come out  and when did this event happen asked pen not over well pleased most likely that a person who had once attracted some portion of his royal good graces should have transferred her allegiance and consoled herself for his loss  last thursday was five weeksit was two days after miss amory came to shepherds inn huxter answered  pen remembered that blanche had written and mentioned her visit i was called in huxter said i was in the inn looking after old coss leg and about something else too very likely and i met strong who told me there was a woman taken ill in chambers and went up to give her my professional services it was the old lady who attends miss amoryher housekeeper or some such thing she was taken with strong hysterics i found her kicking and screaming like a good onein strongs chamber along with him and colonel altamont and miss amory crying and as pale as a sheet and altamont fuming abouta regular kickup they were two hours in the chambers and the old woman went whooping off in a cab she was much worse than the young one i called in grosvenor place next day to see if i could be of any service but they were gone without so much as thanking me and the day after i had business of my own to attend toa bad business too said mr huxter gloomily but its done and cant be undone and we must make the best of it  she has known the story for a month thought pen with a sharp pang of grief and a gloomy sympathythis accounts for her letter of today she will not implicate her father or divulge his secret she wishes to let me off from the marriageand finds a pretextthe generous girl  do you know who altamont is sir asked huxter after the pause during which pen had been thinking of his own affairs fanny and i have talked him over and we cant help fancying that its mrs lightfoots first husband come to life again and she who has just married a second perhaps lightfoot wont be very sorry for it sighed huxter looking savagely at arthur for the demon of jealousy was still in possession of his soul and now and more than ever since his marriage the poor fellow fancied that fannys heart belonged to his rival  let us talk about your affairs said pen show me how i can be of any service to you huxter let me congratulate you on your marriage i am thankful that fanny who is so good so fascinating so kind a creature has found an honest man and a gentleman who will make her happy show me what i can do to help you  she thinks you can sir said huxter accepting pens proffered hand and im very much obliged to you im sure and that you might talk over my father and break the business to him and my mother who always has her back up about being a clergymans daughter fanny aint of a good family i know and not up to us in breeding and thatbut shes a huxter now  the wife takes the husbands rank of course said pen  and with a little practice in society continued huxter imbibing his stick shell be as good as any girl in clavering you should hear her sing and play on the piano did you ever old bows taught her and shell do on the stage if the governor was to throw me over but id rather not have her there she cant help being a coquette mr pendennis she cant help it dammy sir ill be bound to say that two or three of the bartholomew chaps that ive brought into my place are sitting with her now even jack linton that i took down as my best man is as bad as the rest and she will go on singing and making eyes at him its what bows says if there were twenty men in a room and one not taking notice of her she wouldnt be satisfied until the twentieth was at her elbow  you should have her mother with her said pen laughing  she must keep the lodge she cant see so much of her family as she used i cant you know sir go on with that lot consider my rank in life said huxter putting a very dirty hand up to his chin  au fait said mr pen who was infinitely amused and concerning whom mutato nomine and of course concerning nobody else in the world the fable might have been narrated  as the two gentlemen were in the midst of this colloquy another knock came to pens door and his servant presently announced mr bows the old man followed slowly his pale face blushing and his hand trembling somewhat as he took pens he coughed and wiped his face in his checked cotton pockethandkerchief and sate down with his hands on his knees the sunshining on his bald head pen looked at the homely figure with no small sympathy and kindness this man too has had his griefs and his wounds arthur thought this man too has brought his genius and his heart and laid them at a womans feet where she spurned them the chance of life has gone against him and the prize is with that creature yonder fannys bridegroom thus mutely apostrophised had winked meanwhile with one eye at old bows and was driving holes in the floor with the cane which he loved  so we have lost mr bows and here is the lucky winner pen said looking hard at the old man  here is the lucky winner sir as you say  i suppose you have come from my place asked huxter who having winked at bows with one eye now favoured pen with a wink of the othera wink which seemed to say infatuated old boyyou understandover head and ears in love with her poor old fool  yes i have been there ever since you went away it was mrs sam who sent me after you who said that she thought you might be doing something stupidsomething like yourself huxter  theres as big fools as i am growled the young surgeon  a few praps said the old man not many let us trust yes she sent me after you for fear you should offend mr pendennis and i daresay because she thought you wouldnt give her message to him and beg him to go and see her and she knew i would take her errand did he tell you that sir  huxter blushed scarlet and covered his confusion with an imprecation pen laughed the scene suited his bitter humour more and more  i have no doubt mr huxter was going to tell me arthur said and very much flattered i am sure i shall be to pay my respects to his wife  its in charterhouse lane over the bakers on the right hand side as you go from st johns street continued bows without any pity you know smithfield mr pendennis st johns street leads into smithfield doctor johnson has been down the street many a time with ragged shoes and a bundle of pennyalining for the gents magazine you literary gents are better off noweh you ride in your cabs and wear yellow kid gloves now  i have known so many brave and good men fail and so many quacks and impostors succeed that you mistake me if you think i am puffed up by my own personal good luck old friend arthur said sadly do you think the prizes of life are carried by the most deserving and set up that mean test of prosperity for merit you must feel that you are as good as i i have never questioned it it is you that are peevish against the freaks of fortune and grudge the good luck that befalls others its not the first time you have unjustly accused me bows  perhaps you are not far wrong sir said the old fellow wiping his bald forehead i am thinking about myself and grumbling most men do when they get on that subject heres the fellow thats got the prize in the lottery heres the fortunate youth  i dont know what you are driving at huxter said who had been much puzzled as the above remarks passed between his two companions  perhaps not said bows drily mrs h sent me here to look after you and to see that you brought that little message to mr pendennis which you didnt you see and so she was right women always are they have always a reason for everything why sir he said turning round to pen with a sneer she had a reason even for giving me that message i was sitting with her after you left us very quiet and comfortable i was talking away and she was mending your shirts when your two young friends jack linton and bob blades looked in from bartholomews and then it was she found out that she had this message to send you neednt hurry yourself she dont want you back again theyll stay these two hours i daresay  huxter arose with great perturbation at this news and plunged his stick into the pocket of his paletot and seized his hat  youll come and see us sir wont you he said to pen youll talk over the governor wont you sir if i can get out of this place and down to clavering  you will promise to attend me gratis if ever i fall ill at fairoaks will you huxter pen said goodnaturedly i will do anything i can for you i will come and see mrs huxter immediately and we will conspire together about what is to be done  i thought that would send him out sir bows said dropping into his chair again as soon as the young surgeon had quitted the room and its all true sirevery word of it she wants you back again and sends her husband after you she cajoles everybody the little devil she tries it on you on me on poor costigan on the young chaps from bartholomews shes got a little court of em already and if theres nobody there she practises on the old german baker in the shop or coaxes the black sweeper at the crossing  is she fond of that fellow asked pen  there is no accounting for likes and dislikes bows answered  yes she is fond of him and having taken the thing into her head she would not rest until she married him they had their banns published at st clements and nobody heard it or knew any just cause or impediment and one day she slips out of the porters lodge and has the business done and goes off to gravesend with lothario and leaves a note for me to go and explain all things to her ma bless you the old woman knew it as well as i did though she pretended ignorance and so she goes and im alone again i miss her sir tripping along that court and coming for her singing lesson and ive no heart to look into the porters lodge now which looks very empty without her the little flirting thing and i go and sit and dangle about her lodgings like an old fool she makes em very trim and nice though gets up all huxters shirts and clothes cooks his little dinner and sings at her business like a little lark whats the use of being angry i lent em three pound to go on with for they havent got a shilling till the reconciliation and pa comes down  when bows had taken his leave pen carried his letter from blanche and the news which he had just received to his usual adviser laura it was wonderful upon how many points mr arthur who generally followed his own opinion now wanted another persons counsel he could hardly so much as choose a waistcoat without referring to miss bell if he wanted to buy a horse he must have miss bells opinion all which marks of deference tended greatly to the amusement of the shrewd old lady with whom miss bell lived and whose plans regarding her protegee we have indicated  arthur produced blanches letter then to laura and asked her to interpret it laura was very much agitated and puzzled by the contents of the note  it seems to me she said as if blanche is acting very artfully  and wishes so to place matters that she may take me or leave me is it not so  it is i am afraid a kind of duplicity which does not augur well for your future happiness and is a bad reply to your own candour and honesty arthur do you know i think i thinki scarcely like to say what i think said laura with a deep blush but of course the blushing young lady yielded to her cousins persuasion and expressed what her thoughts were it looks to me arthur as if there might bethere might be somebody else said laura with a repetition of the blush  and if there is broke in arthur and if i am free once again will the best and dearest of all women  you are not free dear brother laura said calmly you belong to another of whom i own it grieves me to think ill but i cant do otherwise it is very odd that in this letter she does not urge you to tell her the reason why you have broken arrangements which would have been so advantageous to you and avoids speaking on the subject she somehow seems to write as if she knows her fathers secret  pen said yes she must know it and told the story which he had just heard from huxter of the interview at shepherds inn  it was not so that she described the meeting said laura and going to her desk produced from it that letter of blanches which mentioned her visit to shepherds inn another disappointmentonly the chevalier strong and a friend of his in the room this was all that blanche had said but she was bound to keep her fathers secret pen laura added and yet and yetit is very puzzling  the puzzle was this that for three weeks after this eventful discovery blanche had been only too eager about her dearest arthur was urging as strongly as so much modesty could urge the completion of the happy arrangements which were to make her arthurs for ever and now it seemed as if something had interfered to mar these happy arrangementsas if arthur poor was not quite so agreeable to blanche as arthur rich and a member of parliamentas if there was some mystery at last she said  tunbridge wells is not very far off is it arthur hadnt you better go and see her  they had been in town a week and neither had thought of that simple plan before     chapter lxxiv shows how arthur had better have taken a returnticket   the train carried arthur only too quickly to tunbridge though he had time to review all the circumstances of his life as he made the brief journey and to acknowledge to what sad conclusions his selfishness and waywardness had led him here is the end of hopes and aspirations thought he of romance and ambitions where i yield or where i am obstinate i am alike unfortunate my mother implores me and i refuse an angel say i had taken her forced on me as she was laura would never have been an angel to me i could not have given her my heart at anothers instigation i never could have known her as she is had i been obliged to ask another to interpret her qualities and point out her virtues i yield to my uncles solicitations and accept on his guarantee blanche and a seat in parliament and wealth and ambition and a career and seefortune comes and leaves me the wife without the dowry which i had taken in compensation of a heart why was i not more honest or am i not less so it would have cost my poor old uncle no pangs to accept blanches fortune whencesoever it came he cant even understand he is bitterly indignant heartstricken almost at the scruples which actuate me in refusing it i dissatisfy everybody a maimed weak imperfect wretch it seems as if i am unequal to any fortune i neither make myself nor any one connected with me happy what prospect is there for this poor little frivolous girl who is to take my obscure name and share my fortune i have not even ambition to excite me or selfesteem enough to console myself much more her for my failure if i were to write a book that should go through twenty editions why i should be the very first to sneer at my reputation say i could succeed at the bar and achieve a fortune by bullying witnesses and twisting evidence is that a fame which would satisfy my longings or a calling in which my life would be well spent how i wish i could be that priest opposite who never has lifted his eyes from his breviary except when we were in reigate tunnel when he could not see or that old gentleman next him who scowls at him with eyes of hatred over his newspaper the priest shuts his eyes to the world but has his thoughts on the book which is his directory to the world to come his neighbour hates him as a monster tyrant persecutor and fancies burning martyrs and that pale countenance looking on and lighted up by the flame these have no doubts these march on trustfully bearing their load of logic  would you like to look at the paper sir here interposed the stout gentleman it had a flaming article against the order of the blackcoated gentleman who was travelling with them in the carriage and pen thanked him and took it and pursued his reverie without reading two sentences of the journal  and yet would you take either of those mens creeds with its consequences he thought ah me you must bear your own burthen fashion your own faith think your own thoughts and pray your own prayer to what mortal ear could i tell all if i had a mind or who could understand all who can tell anothers shortcomings lost opportunities weigh the passions which overpower the defects which incapacitate reasonwhat extent of truth and right his neighbours mind is organised to perceive and to dowhat invisible and forgotten accident terror of youth chance or mischance of fortune may have altered the whole current of life a grain of sand may alter it as the flinging of a pebble may end it who can weigh circumstances passions temptations that go to our good and evil account save one before whose awful wisdom we kneel and at whose mercy we ask absolution here it ends thought pen this day or tomorrow will wind up the account of my youth a weary retrospect alas a sad history with many a page i would fain not look back on but who has not been tired or fallen and who has escaped without scars from that struggle and his head fell on his breast and the young mans heart prostrated itself humbly and sadly before that throne where sits wisdom and love and pity for all and made its confession what matters about fame or poverty he thought if i marry this woman i have chosen may i have strength and will to be true to her and to make her happy if i have children pray god teach me to speak and to do the truth among them and to leave them an honest name there are no splendours for my marriage does my life deserve any i begin a new phase of it a better than the last may it be i pray heaven  the train stopped at tunbridge as pen was making these reflections and he handed over the newspaper to his neighbour of whom he took leave while the foreign clergyman in the opposite corner still sate with his eyes on his book pen jumped out of the carriage then his carpetbag in hand and briskly determined to face his fortune  a fly carried him rapidly to lady claverings house from the station and as he was transported thither arthur composed a little speech which he intended to address to blanche and which was really as virtuous honest and wellminded an oration as any man of his turn of mind and under his circumstances could have uttered the purport of it wasblanche i cannot understand from your last letter what your meaning is or whether my fair and frank proposal to you is acceptable or no i think you know the reason which induces me to forgo the worldly advantages which a union with you offered and which i could not accept without as i fancy being dishonoured if you doubt of my affection here i am ready to prove it let smirke be called in and let us be married out of hand and with all my heart i purpose to keep my vow and to cherish you through life and to be a true and a loving husband to you  from the fly arthur sprang out then to the halldoor where he was met by a domestic whom he did not know the man seemed to be surprised at the approach of the gentleman with the carpetbag which he made no attempt to take from arthurs hands her ladyships not at home sir the man remarked  i am mr pendennis arthur said where is lightfoot  lightfoot is gone answered the man my lady is out and my orders was  i hear miss amorys voice in the drawingroom said arthur take the bag to a dressingroom if you please and passing by the porter he walked straight towards that apartment from which as the door opened a warble of melodious notes issued  our little siren was at her piano singing with all her might and fascinations master clavering was asleep on the sofa indifferent to the music but near blanche sat a gentleman who was perfectly enraptured with her strain which was of a passionate and melancholy nature  as the door opened the gentleman started up with hullo the music stopped with a little shriek from the singer frank clavering woke up from the sofa and arthur came forward and said what foker how do you do foker he looked at the piano and there by miss amorys side was just such another purpleleather box as he had seen in harrys hand three days before when the heir of logwood was coming out of a jewellers shop in waterloo place it was opened and curled round the white satin cushion within was oh such a magnificent serpentine bracelet with such a blazing ruby head and diamond tail  how dedo pendennis said foker blanche made many motions of the shoulders and gave signs of unrest and agitation and she put her handkerchief over the bracelet and then she advanced with a hand which trembled very much to greet pen  how is dearest laura she said the face of foker looking up from his profound mourningthat face so piteous and puzzled was one which the readers imagination must depict for himself also that of master frank clavering who looking at the three interesting individuals with an expression of the utmost knowingness had only time to ejaculate the words heres a jolly go and to disappear sniggering  pen too had restrained himself up to that minute but looking still at foker whose ears and cheeks tingled with blushes arthur burst out into a fit of laughter so wild and loud that it frightened blanche much more than any the most serious exhibition  and this was the secret was it dont blush and turn away foker my boy why man you are a pattern of fidelity could i stand between blanche and such constancycould i stand between miss amory and fifteen thousand a year  it is not that mr pendennis blanche said with great dignity it is not money it is not rank it is not gold that moves me but it is constancy it is fidelity it is a whole trustful loving heart offered to me that i treasureyes that i treasure and she made for her handkerchief but reflecting what was underneath it she paused i do not disown i do not disguisemy life is above disguiseto him on whom it is bestowed my heart must be for ever barethat i once thought i loved youyes thought i was beloved by you i own how i clung to that faith how i strove i prayed i longed to believe it but your conduct alwaysyour own words so cold so heartless so unkind have undeceived me you trifled with the heart of the poor maiden you flung me back with scorn the troth which i had plighted i have explained allall to mr foker  that you have said foker with devotion and conviction in his looks  what all said pen with a meaning look at blanche it is i am in fault is it well well blanche be it so i wont appeal against your sentence and bear it in silence i came down here looking to very different things heaven knows and with a heart most truly and kindly disposed towards you i hope you may be happy with another as on my word it was my wish to make you so and i hope my honest old friend here will have a wife worthy of his loyalty his constancy and affection indeed they deserve the regard of any womaneven miss blanche amory shake hands harry dont look askance at me has anybody told you that i was a false and heartless character  i think youre a foker was beginning in his wrath when blanche interposed  henry not a wordi pray you let there be forgiveness  youre an angel by jove youre an angel said foker at which blanche looked seraphically up to the chandelier  in spite of what has passed for the sake of what has passed i must always regard arthur as a brother the seraph continued we have known each other years we have trodden the same fields and plucked the same flowers together arthur henry i beseech you to take hands and to be friends forgive youi forgive you arthur with my heart i do should i not do so for making me so happy  there is only one person of us three whom i pity blanche arthur said gravely and i say to you again that i hope you will make this good fellow this honest and loyal creature happy  happy o heavens said harry he could not speak his happiness gushed out at his eyes she dont knowshe cant know how fond i am of her andand who am i a poor little beggar and she takes me up and says shell try and iilove me i aint worthy of so much happiness give us your hand old boy since she forgives you after your heartless conduct and says she loves you ill make you welcome i tell you ill love everybody who loves her by if she tells me to kiss the ground ill kiss it tell me to kiss the ground i say tell me i love you so you see i love you so  blanche looked up seraphically again her gentle bosom heaved she held out one hand as if to bless harry and then royally permitted him to kiss it she took up the pockethandkerchief and hid her own eyes as the other fair hand was abandoned to poor harrys tearful embrace  i swear that is a villain who deceives such a loving creature as that said pen  blanche laid down the handkerchief and put hand no 2 softly on fokers head which was bent down kissing and weeping over hand no 1 foolish boy she said it shall be loved as it deserves who could help loving such a silly creature  and at this moment frank clavering broke in upon the sentimental trio  i say pendennis he said  well frank  the man wants to be paid and go back hes had some beer  ill go back with him cried pen goodbye blanche god bless you foker old friend you know neither of you want me here he longed to be off that instant  stayi must say one word to you one word in private if you please blanche said you can trust us together cant you henry the tone in which the word henry was spoken and the appeal ravished foker with delight trust you said he oh who wouldnt trust you come along franky my boy  lets have a cigar said frank as they went into the hall  she dont like it said foker gently  law bless youshe dont mind pendennis used to smoke regular said the candid youth  it was but a short word i had to say said blanche to pen with great calm when they were alone you never loved me mr pendennis  i told you how much said arthur i never deceived you  i suppose you will go back and marry laura continued blanche  was that what you had to say said pen  you are going to her this very night i am sure of it there is no denying it you never cared for me  et vous  et moi cest different i have been spoilt early i cannot live out of the world out of excitement i could have done so but it is too late if i cannot have emotions i must have the world you would offer me neither one nor the other you are blase in everything even in ambition you had a career before you and you would not take it you give it upfor whatfor a betise for an absurd scruple why would you not have that seat and be such a puritain why should you refuse what is mine by right by right entendezvous  you know all then said pen  only within a month but i have suspected ever since baymouthnimporte since when it is not too late he is as if he had never been and there is a position in the world before you yet why not sit in parliament exert your talent and give a place in the world to yourself to your wife i take celuila il est bon il est riche il estvous le connaissez autant que moi enfin think you that i would not prefer un homme qui fera parler de moi if the secret appears i am rich a millions how does it affect me it is not my fault it will never appear  you

ce lache mari cette lache societeretournons a mon pere  the pirate would have wearied you like the rest said pen  eh il me faut des emotions said blanche pen had never seen her or known so much about her in all the years of their intimacy as he saw and knew now though he saw more than existed in reality for this young lady was not able to carry out any emotion to the full but had a sham enthusiasm a sham hatred a sham love a sham taste a sham grief each of which flared and shone very vehemently for an instant but subsided and gave place to the next sham emotion     chapter lxxv a chapter of matchmaking   upon the platform at tunbridge pen fumed and fretted until the arrival of the evening train to london a full halfhoursix hours it seemed to him but even this immense interval was passed the train arrived the train sped on the london lights came in viewa gentleman who forgot his carpetbag in the train rushed at a cab and said to the man drive as hard as you can go to jermyn street the cabman although a hansomcabman said thank you for the gratuity which was put into his hand and pen ran up the stairs of the hotel to lady rockminsters apartments laura was alone in the drawingroom reading with a pale face by the lamp the pale face looked up when pen opened the door may we follow him the great moments of life are but moments like the others your doom is spoken in a word or two a single look from the eyes a mere pressure of the hand may decide it or of the lips though they cannot speak  when lady rockminster who has had her afterdinner nap gets up and goes into her sittingroom we may enter with her ladyship  upon my word young people are the first words she says and her attendant makes wondering eyes over her shoulder and well may she say so and well may the attendant cast wondering eyes for the young people are in an attitude and pen in such a position as every young lady who reads this has heard tell of or has seen or hopes or at any rate deserves to see  in a word directly he entered the room pen went up to laura of the pale face who had not time even to say what back so soon and seizing her outstretched and trembling hand just as she was rising from her chair fell down on his knees before her and said quickly i have seen her she has engaged herself to harry fokerandand now laura  the hand gives a pressurethe eyes beam a replythe quivering lips answer though speechless pens head sinks down in the girls lap as he sobs out come and bless us dear mother and arms as tender as helens once more enfold him  in this juncture it is that lady rockminster comes in and says upon my word young people beck leave the room what do you want poking your nose in here  pen starts up with looks of triumph still holding lauras hand she is consoling me for my misfortune maam he says  what do you mean by kissing her hand i dont know what you will be next doing  pen kissed her ladyships i have been to tunbridge he says and seen miss amory and find on my arrival thatthat a villain has transplanted me in her affections he says with a tragedy air  is that all is that what you were whimpering on your knees about says the old lady growing angry you might have kept the news till tomorrow  yesanother has superseded me goes on pen but why call him villain he is brave he is constant he is young he is wealthy he is beautiful  what stuff are you talking sir cried the old lady what has happened  miss amory has jilted me and accepted henry foker esq i found her warbling ditties to him as he lay at her feet presents had been accepted vows exchanged these ten days harry was old mrs planters rheumatism which kept dearest laura out of the house he is the most constant and generous of men he has promised the living of logwood to lady anns husband and given her a splendid present on her marriage and he rushed to fling himself at blanches feet the instant he found he was free  and so as you cant get blanche you put up with laura is that it sir asked the old lady  he acted nobly laura said  i acted as she bade me said pen never mind how lady rockminster but to the best of my knowledge and power and if you mean that i am not worthy of laura i know it and pray heaven to better me and if the love and company of the best and purest creature in the world can do so at least i shall have these to help me  hm hm replied the old lady to this looking with rather an appeased air at the young people it is all very well but i should have preferred bluebeard  and now pen to divert the conversation from a theme which was growing painful to some parties present bethought him of his interview with huxter in the morning and of fanny boltons affairs which he had forgotten under the immediate pressure and excitement of his own and he told the ladies how huxter had elevated fanny to the rank of wife and what terrors he was in respecting the arrival of his father he described the scene with considerable humour taking care to dwell especially upon that part of it which concerned fannys coquetry and irrepressible desire of captivating mankind his meaning being you see laura i was not so guilty in that little affair it was the girl who made love to me and i who resisted as i am no longer present the little siren practises her arts and fascinations upon others let that transaction be forgotten in your mind if you please or visit me with a very gentle punishment for my error  laura understood his meaning under the eagerness of his explanations if you did any wrong you repented dear pen she said and you know she added with meaning eyes and blushes that i have no right to reproach you  hm grumbled the old lady i should have preferred bluebeard  the past is broken away the morrow is before us i will do my best to make your morrow happy dear laura pen said his heart was humbled by the prospect of his happiness it stood awestricken in the contemplation of her sweet goodness and purity he liked his wife better that she had owned to that passing feeling for warrington and laid bare her generous heart to him and shevery likely she was thinking how strange it is that i ever should have cared for another i am vexed almost to think i care for him so little am so little sorry that he is gone away oh in these past two months how i have learned to love arthur i care about nothing but arthur my waking and sleeping thoughts are about him he is never absent from me and to think that he is to be mine mine and that i am to marry him and not to be his servant as i expected to be only this morning for i would have gone down on my knees to blanche to beg her to let me live with him and nowoh it is too much oh mother mother that you were here indeed she felt as if helen were thereby her actually though invisibly a halo of happiness beamed from her  she moved with a different step and bloomed with a new beauty arthur saw the change and the old lady rockminster remarked it with her shrewd eyes  what a sly demure little wretch you have been she whispered to laurawhile pen in great spirits was laughing and telling his story about huxterand how you have kept your secret  how are we to help the young couple said laura of course miss laura felt an interest in all young couples as generous lovers always love other lovers  we must go and see them said pen  of course we must go and see them said laura i intend to be very fond of fanny let us go this instant lady rockminster may i have the carriage  go nowwhy you stupid creature it is eleven oclock at night mr and mrs huxter have got their nightcaps on i dare say and it is time for you to go now good night mr pendennis  arthur and laura begged for ten minutes more  we will go tomorrow morning then i will come and fetch you with martha  an earls coronet said pen who no doubt was pleased himself will have a great effect in lamb court and smithfield staylady rockminster will you join us in a little conspiracy  how do you mean conspiracy young man  will you please to be a little ill tomorrow and when old mr huxter arrives will you let me call him in if he is put into a good humour at the notion of attending a baronet in the country what influence wont a countess have on him when he is softenedwhen he is quite ripe we will break the secret upon him bring in the young people extort the paternal benediction and finish the comedy  a parcel of stuff said the old lady take your hat sir come away miss theremy head is turned another way good night young people and who knows but the old lady thought of her own early days as she went away on lauras arm nodding her head and humming to herself  with the early morning came laura and martha according to appointment and the desired sensation was let us hope effected in lamb court whence the three proceeded to wait upon mr and mrs samuel huxter at their residence in charterhouse lane  the two ladies looked at each other with great interest and not a little emotion on fannys part she had not seen her guardian as she was pleased to call pen in consequence of his bequest since the event had occurred which had united her to mr huxter  samuel told me how kind you had been she said you were always very kind mr pendennis andand i hope your friend is better who was took ill in shepherds inn maam  my name is laura said the other with a blush i amthat is i wasthat is i am arthurs sister and we shall always love you for being so good to him when he was ill and when we live in the country i hope we shall see each other and i shall be always happy to hear of your happiness fanny  we are going to do what you and huxter have done fannywhere is huxter what nice snug lodgings youve got what a pretty cat  while fanny is answering these questions in reply to pen laura says to herselfwell now really is this the creature about whom we were all so frightened what could he see in her shes a homely little thing but such manners well she was very kind to himbless her for that  mr samuel had gone out to meet his pa mrs huxter said that the old gentleman was to arrive that day at the somerset coffeehouse in the strand and fanny confessed that she was in a sad tremor about the meeting if his parent casts him off what are we to do she said i shall never pardon myself for bringing ruing on my usbands ead you must intercede for us mr arthur if mortal man can you can bend and influence mr huxter senior fanny still regarded pen in the light of a superior being that was evident no doubt arthur thought of the past as he marked the solemn little tragedyairs and looks the little ways the little trepidations vanities of the little bride as soon as the interview was over entered messrs linton and blades who came of course to visit huxter and brought with them a fine fragrance of tobacco they had watched the carriage at the bakers door and remarked the coronet with awe they asked of fanny who was that uncommonly heavy swell who had just driven off and pronounced the countess was of the right sort and when they heard that it was mr pendennis and his sister they remarked that pens father was only a sawbones and that he gave himself confounded airs they had been in huxters company on the night of his little altercation with pen in the back kitchen  returning homewards through fleet street and as laura was just stating to pens infinite amusement that fanny was very well but that really there was no beauty in herthere might be but she could not see itas they were locked near temple bar they saw young huxter returning to his bride the governor had arrived was at the somerset coffeehousewas in tolerable goodhumoursomething about the railway but he had been afraid to speak aboutabout that business would mr pendennis try it on  pen said he would go and call at that moment upon mr huxter and see what might be done huxter junior would lurk outside whilst that awful interview took place the coronet on the carriage inspired his soul also with wonder and old mr huxter himself beheld it with delight as he looked from the coffeehouse window on that strand which it was always a treat to him to survey  and i can afford to give myself a lark sir said mr huxter shaking hands with pen of course you know the news we have got our bill sir we shall have our branch lineour shares are up sirand we buy your three fields along the brawl and put a pretty penny into your pocket mr pendennis  indeedthat was good news pen remembered that there was a letter from mr tatham at chambers these three days but he had not opened the communication being interested with other affairs  i hope you dont intend to grow rich and give up practice said pen we cant lose you at clavering mr huxter though i hear very good accounts of your son my friend dr goodenough speaks most highly of his talents it is hard that a man of your eminence though should be kept in a country town  the metropolis would have been my sphere of action sir said mr huxter surveying the strand but a man takes his business where he finds it and i succeeded to that of my father  it was my fathers too said pen i sometimes wish i had followed it  you sir have taken a more lofty career said the old gentleman you aspire to the senate and to literary honours you wield the poets pen sir and move in the circles of fashion we keep an eye upon you at clavering we read your name in the lists of the select parties of the nobility why it was only the other day that my wife was remarking how odd it was that at a party at the earl of kidderminsters your name was not mentioned to what member of the aristocracy may i ask does that equipage belong from which i saw you descend the countess dowager of rockminster how is her ladyship  her ladyship is not very well and when i heard that you were coming to town i strongly urged her to see you mr huxter pen said old huxter felt if he had a hundred votes for clavering he would give them all to pen  there is an old friend of yours in the carriagea clavering lady toowill you come out and speak to her asked pen the old surgeon was delighted to speak to a coroneted carriage in the midst of the full strand he ran out bowing and smiling huxter junior dodging about the district beheld the meeting between his father and laura saw the latter put out her hand and presently after a little colloquy with pen beheld his father actually jump into the carriage and drive away with miss bell  there was no room for arthur who came back laughing to the young surgeon and told him whither his parent was bound during the whole of the journey that artful laura coaxed and wheedled and cajoled him so adroitly that the old gentleman would have granted her anything and lady rockminster achieved the victory over him by complimenting him on his skill and professing her anxiety to consult him what were her ladyships symptoms should he meet her ladyships usual medical attendant mr jones was called out of town he should be delighted to devote his very best energies and experience to her ladyships service  he was so charmed with his patient that he wrote home about her to his wife and family he talked of nothing but lady rockminster to samuel when that youth came to partake of beefsteak and oystersauce and accompany his parent to the play there was a simple grandeur a polite urbanity a highbred grace about her ladyship which he had never witnessed in any woman her symptoms did not seem alarming he had prescribedspir ammon aromat with a little spir menth pip and orangeflower which would be all that was necessary  miss bell seemed to be on the most confidential and affectionate footing with her ladyship she was about to form a matrimonial connexion all young people ought to marry such were her ladyships words and the countess condescended to ask respecting my own family and i mentioned you by name to her ladyship sam my boy i shall look in tomorrow when if the remedies which i have prescribed for her ladyship have had the effect which i anticipate i shall probably follow them up by a little spir lavend compand so set my noble patient up what is the theatre which is most frequented by theby the higher classes in town hey sam and to what amusement will you take an old country doctor tonight hey sir  on the next day when mr huxter called in jermyn street at twelve oclock lady rockminster had not yet left her room but miss bell and mr pendennis were in waiting to receive him lady rockminster had had a most comfortable night and was getting on as well as possible how had mr huxter amused himself at the theatre with his son what a capital piece it was and how charmingly mrs oleary looked and sang it and what a good fellow young huxter was liked by everybody an honour to his profession he has not his fathers manners i grant you or that oldworld tone which is passing away from us but a more excellent sterling fellow never lived he ought to practise in the country whatever you do sir said arthurhe ought to marryother people are going to do soand settle  the very words that her ladyship used yesterday mr pendennis he ought to marry sam should marry sir  the town is full of temptations sir continued pen the old gentleman thought of that houri mrs oleary  there is no better safeguard for a young man than an early marriage with an honest affectionate creature  no better sir no better  and love is better than money isnt it  indeed it is said miss bell  i agree with so fair an authority said the old gentleman with a bow  andand suppose sir pen said that i had a piece of news to communicate to you  god bless my soul mr pendennis what do you mean asked the old gentleman  suppose i had to tell you that a young man carried away by an irresistible passion for an admirable and most virtuous young creaturewhom everybody falls in love withhad consulted the dictates of reason and his heart and had married suppose i were to tell you that that man is my friend that our excellent our truly noble friend the countess dowager of rockminster is truly interested about him and you may fancy what a young man can do in life when that family is interested for him suppose i were to tell you that you know himthat he is herethat he is  sam married god bless my soul sir you dont mean that  and to such a nice creature dear mr huxter  her ladyship is charmed with her said pen telling almost the first fib which he has told in the course of this story  married the rascal is he thought the old gentleman  they will do it sir said pen and went and opened the door mr and mrs samuel huxter issued thence and both came and knelt down before the old gentleman the kneeling little fanny found favour in his sight there must have been some thing attractive about her in spite of lauras opinion  will never do so any more sir said sam  get up sir said mr huxter and they got up and fanny came a little nearer and a little nearer still and looked so pretty and pitiful that somehow mr huxter found himself kissing the little cryinglaughing thing and feeling as if he liked it  whats your name my dear he said after a minute of this sport  fanny papa said mrs samuel     chapter lxxvi exeunt omnes   our characters are all a month older than they were when the lastdescribed adventures and conversations occurred and a great number of the personages of our story have chanced to reassemble at the little country town where we were first introduced to them frederic lightfoot formerly maitre dhotel in the service of sir francis clavering of clavering park bart has begged leave to inform the nobility and gentry of shire that he has taken that wellknown and comfortable hotel the clavering arms in clavering where he hopes for the continued patronage of the gentlemen and families of the county this ancient and wellestablished house mr lightfoots manifesto states has been repaired and decorated in a style of the greatest comfort gentlemen hunting with the dumplingbeare hounds will find excellent stabling and looseboxes for horses at the clavering arms a commodious billiardroom has been attached to the hotel and the cellars have been furnished with the choicest wines and spirits selected without regard to expense by c l commercial gentlemen will find the clavering arms a most comfortable place of resort and the scale of charges has been regulated for all so as to meet the economical spirit of the present times  indeed there is a considerable air of liveliness about the old inn the clavering arms have been splendidly repainted over the gateway the coffeeroom windows are bright and fresh and decorated with christmas holly the magistrates have met in petty sessions in the cardroom of the old assembly the farmers ordinary is held as of old and frequented by increased numbers who are pleased with mrs lightfoots cuisine her indian curries and mulligatawny soup are especially popular major stokes the respected tenant of fairoaks cottage captain glanders hp and other resident gentry have pronounced in their favour and have partaken of them more than once both in private and at the dinner of the clavering institute attendant on the incorporation of the readingroom and when the chief inhabitants of that flourishing little town met together and did justice to the hostesss excellent cheer the chair was taken by sir francis clavering bart supported by the esteemed rector dr portman the vice chair being ably filled by barker esq supported by the rev j simcoe and the rev s jowls the enterprising head of the ribbon factory in clavering and chief director of the clavering and chatteris branch of the great western railway which will be opened in another year and upon the works of which the engineers and workmen are now busily engaged  an interesting event which is likely to take place in the life of our talented townsman arthur pendennis esq has we understand caused him to relinquish the intentions which he had of offering himself as a candidate for our borough and rumour whispers says the chatteris champion clavering agriculturist and baymouth fishermanthat independent county paper so distinguished for its unswerving principles and loyalty to the british oak and so eligible a medium for advertisementsrumour states says the c c c a and b f that should sir francis claverings failing health oblige him to relinquish his seat in parliament he will vacate it in favour of a young gentleman of colossal fortune and related to the highest aristocracy of the empire who is about to contract a matrimonial alliance with an accomplished and lovely lady connected by the nearest ties with the respected family at clavering park lady clavering and miss amory have arrived at the park for the christmas holidays and we understand that a large number of the aristocracy are expected and that festivities of a peculiarly interesting nature will take place there at the commencement of the new year  the ingenious reader will be enabled by the help of the above announcement to understand what has taken place during the little break which has occurred in our narrative although lady rockminster grumbled a little at lauras preference for pendennis over bluebeard those who are aware of the latters secret will understand that the young girl could make no other choice and the kind old lady who had constituted herself miss bells guardian was not ill pleased that she was to fulfil the great purpose in life of young ladies and marry she informed her maid of the interesting event that very night and of course mrs beck who was perfectly aware of every single circumstance and kept by martha of fairoaks in the fullest knowledge of what was passing was immensely surprised and delighted mr pendenniss income is so much the railroad will give him so much more he states miss bell has so much and may probably have a little more one day for persons in their degree they will be able to manage very well and i shall speak to my nephew pynsent who i suspect was once rather attached to herbut of course that was out of the question oh of course my lady i should think so indeednot that you know anything whatever about it or have any business to think at all on the subjecti shall speak to george pynsent who is now chief secretary of the tape and sealing wax office and have mr pendennis made something and beck in the morning you will carry down my compliments to major pendennis and say that i shall pay him a visit at one oclockyes muttered the old lady the major must be reconciled and he must leave his fortune to lauras children  accordingly at one oclock the dowager lady rockminster appeared at major pendenniss who was delighted as may be imagined to receive so noble a visitor the major had been prepared if not for the news which her ladyship was about to give him at least with the intelligence that pens marriage with miss amory was broken off the young gentleman bethinking him of his uncle for the first time that day it must be owned and meeting his new servant in the hall of the hotel asked after the majors health from mr frosch and then went into the coffeeroom of the hotel where he wrote a halfdozen lines to acquaint his guardian with what had occurred dear uncle he said if there has been any question between us it is over now i went to tunbridge wells yesterday and found that somebody else had carried off the prize about which we were hesitating miss a without any compunction for me has bestowed herself upon harry foker with his fifteen thousand a year i came in suddenly upon their loves and found and left him in possession  and youll be glad to hear tatham writes me that he has sold three of my fields at fairoaks to the railroad company at a great figure i will tell you this and more when we meet and am always your affectionatea p  i think i am aware of what you were about to tell me the major said with a most courtly smile and bow to pens ambassadress it was a very great kindness of your ladyship to think of bringing me the news how well you look how very good you are how very kind you have always been to that young man  it was for the sake of his uncle said lady rockminster most politely  he has informed me of the state of affairs and written me a nice noteyes a nice note continued the old gentleman and i find he has had an increase to his fortuneyes and all things considered i dont much regret that this affair with miss amory is manquee though i wished for it once in fact all things considered i am very glad of it  we must console him major pendennis continued the lady we must get him a wife the truth then came across the majors mind and he saw for what purpose lady rockminster had chosen to assume the office of ambassadress  it is not necessary to enter into the conversation which ensued or to tell at any length how her ladyship concluded a negotiation which in truth was tolerably easy there could be no reason why pen should not marry according to his own and his mothers wish and as for lady rockminster she supported the marriage by intimations which had very great weight with the major but of which we shall say nothing as her ladyship now of course much advanced in years is still alive and the family might be angry and in fine the old gentleman was quite overcome by the determined graciousness of the lady and her fondness for laura nothing indeed could be more bland and kind than lady rockminsters whole demeanour except for one moment when the major talked about his boy throwing himself away at which her ladyship broke out into a little speech in which she made the major understand what poor pen and his friends acknowledge very humbly that laura was a thousand times too good for him laura was fit to be the wife of a kinglaura was a paragon of virtue and excellence and it must be said that when major pendennis found that a lady of the rank of the countess of rockminster seriously admired miss bell he instantly began to admire her himself  so that when herr frosch was requested to walk upstairs to lady rockminsters apartments and inform miss bell and mr arthur pendennis that the major would receive them and laura appeared blushing and happy as she hung on pens arm the major gave a shaky hand to one and the other with unaffected emotion and cordiality and then went through another salutation to laura which caused her to blush still more happy blushes bright eyes beaming with the light of love the storyteller turns from this group to his young audience and hopes that one day their eyes may all shine so  pen having retreated in the most friendly manner and the lovely blanche having bestowed her young affections upon a blushing bridegroom with fifteen thousand a year there was such an outbreak of happiness in lady claverings heart and family as the good begum had not known for many a year and she and blanche were on the most delightful terms of cordiality and affection the ardent foker pressed onwards the happy day and was as anxious as might be expected to abridge the period of mourning which had put him in possession of so many charms and amiable qualities of which he had been only as it were the heirapparent not the actual owner until then the gentle blanche everything that her affianced lord could desire was not averse to gratify the wishes of her fond henry lady clavering came up from tunbridge milliners and jewellers were set to work and engaged to prepare the delightful paraphernalia of hymen lady clavering was in such a good humour that sir francis even benefited by it and such a reconciliation was effected between this pair that sir francis came to london sate at the head of his own table once more and appeared tolerably flush of money at his billiardrooms and gamblinghouses again one day when major pendennis and arthur went to dine in grosvenor place they found an old acquaintance established in the quality of majordomo and the gentleman in black who with perfect politeness and gravity offered them their choice of sweet or dry champagne was no other than mr james morgan the chevalier strong was one of the party he was in high spirits and condition and entertained the company with accounts of his amusements abroad  it was my lady who invited me said strong to arthur under his voicethat fellow morgan looked as black as thunder when i came in he is about no good here i will go away first and wait for you and major pendennis at hyde park gate  mr morgan helped major pendennis to his greatcoat when he was quitting the house and muttered something about having accepted a temporary engagement with the clavering family  i have got a paper of yours mr morgan said the old gentleman  which you can show if you please to sir francis sir and perfectly welcome said mr morgan with downcast eyes im very much obliged to you major pendennis and if i can pay you for all your kindness i will  arthur overheard the sentence and saw the look of hatred which accompanied it suddenly cried out that he had forgotten his handkerchief and ran upstairs to the drawingroom again foker was still there still lingering about his siren pen gave the siren a look full of meaning and we suppose that the siren understood meaning looks for when after finding the veracious handkerchief of which he came in quest he once more went out the siren with a laughing voice said oh arthurmr pendennisi want you to tell dear laura something and she came out to the door  what is it she asked shutting the door  have you told harry do you know that villain morgan knows all  i know it she said  have you told harry  no no she said you wont betray me  morgan will said pen  no he wont said blanche i have promised himnimporte wait until after our marriageoh until after our marriageoh how wretched i am said the girl who had been all smiles and grace and gaiety during the evening  arthur said i beg and implore you to tell harry tell him now it is no fault of yours he will pardon you anything tell him tonight  and give her thisil est lawith my love please and i beg your pardon for calling you back and if she will be at madame crinolines at halfpast three and if lady rockminster can spare her i should so like to drive with her in the park and she went in singing and kissing her little hand as morgan the velvetfooted came up the carpeted stair  pen heard blanches piano breaking out into brilliant music as he went down to join his uncle and they walked away together arthur briefly told him what he had done what was to be done he asked  what is to be done begad said the old gentleman what is to be done but to leave it alone begad let us be thankful said the old fellow with a shudder that we are out of the business and leave it to those it concerns  i hope to heaven shell tell him said pen  begad shell take her own course said the old man miss amory is a devlish wideawake girl sir and must play her own cards and im doosid glad you are out of itdoosid glad begad whos this smoking oh its mr strong again he wants to put in his oar i suppose i tell you dont meddle in the business arthur  strong began once or twice as if to converse upon the subject but the major would not hear a word he remarked on the moonlight on apsley house the weather the cabstandsanything but that subject he bowed stiffly to strong and clung to his nephews arm as he turned down st jamess street and again cautioned pen to leave the affair alone it had like to have cost you so much sir that you may take my advice he said  when arthur came out of the hotel strongs cloak and cigar were visible a few doors off the jolly chevalier laughed as they met im an old soldier too he said i wanted to talk to you pendennis i have heard of all that has happened and all the chops and changes that have taken place during my absence i congratulate you on your marriage and i congratulate you on your escape tooyou understand me it was not my business to speak but i know this that a certain party is as arrant a littlewellwell never mind what you acted like a man and a trump and are well out of it  i have no reason to complain said pen i went back to beg and entreat poor blanche to tell foker all i hope for her sake she will but i fear not there is but one policy strong there is but one  and lucky he that can stick to it said the chevalier that rascal morgan means mischief he has been lurking about our chambers for the last two months he has found out that poor mad devil amorys secret he has been trying to discover where he was he has been pumping mr bolton and making old costigan drunk several times he bribed the inn porter to tell him when we came back and he has got into claverings service on the strength of his information he will get very good pay for it mark my words the villain  where is amory asked pen  at boulogne i believe i left him there and warned him not to come back i have broken with him after a desperate quarrel such as one might have expected with such a madman and im glad to think that he is in my debt now and that i have been the means of keeping him out of more harms than one  he has lost all his winnings i suppose said pen  no he is rather better than when he went away or was a fortnight ago he had extraordinary luck at baden broke the bank several nights and was the fable of the place he lied himself there with a fellow by the name of bloundell who gathered about him a society of all sorts of sharpers male and female russians germans french english amory got so insolent that i was obliged to thrash him one day within an inch of his life i couldnt help myself the fellow has plenty of pluck and i had nothing for it but to hit out  and did he call you out said pen  you think if i had shot him i should have done nobody any harm no sir i waited for his challenge but it never came and the next time i met him he begged my pardon and said strong i beg your pardon you whopped me and you served me right i shook hands but i couldnt live with him after that i paid him what i owed him the night before said strong with a blush i pawned everything to pay him and then i went with my last ten florins and had a shy at the roulette if i had lost i should have let him shoot me in the morning i was weary of my life by jove sir isnt it a shame that a man like me who may have had a few bills out but who never deserted a friend or did an unfair action shouldnt be able to turn his hand to anything to get bread i made a good night sir at roulette and ive done with that im going into the wine business my wifes relations live at cadiz i intend to bring over spanish wine and hams theres a fortune to be made by it sira fortuneheres my card if you want any sherry or hams recollect ned strong is your man and the chevalier pulled out a handsome card stating that strong and company shepherds inn were sole agents of the celebrated diamond manzanilla of the duke of garbanzos grandee of spain of the first class and of the famous toboso hams fed on acorns only in the country of don quixote come and taste em sircome and try em at my chambers you see ive an eye to business and by jove this time ill succeed  pen laughed as he took the card i dont know whether i shall be allowed to go to bachelors parties he said you know im going to  but you must have sherry sir you must have sherry  i will have it from you depend on it said the other and i think you are very well out of your other partnership that worthy altamont and his daughter correspond i hear pen added after a pause  yes she wrote him the longest rigmarole letters that i used to read the sly little devil and he answered under cover to mrs bonner he was for carrying her off the first day or two and nothing would content him but having back his child but she didnt want to come as you may fancy and he was not very eager about it here the chevalier burst out in a laugh why sir do you know what was the cause of our quarrel and boxing match there was a certain widow at baden a madame la baronne de la cruchecassee who was not much better than himself and whom the scoundrel wanted to marry and would but that i told her he was married already i dont think that she was much better than he was i saw her on the pier at boulogne the day i came to england  and now we have brought up our narrative to the point whither the announcement in the chatteris champion had already conducted us  it wanted but very very few days before that blissful one when foker should call blanche his own the clavering folks had all pressed to see the most splendid new carriage in the whole world which was standing in the coachhouse at the clavering arms and shown in grateful return for drink commonly by mr fokers headcoachman madame fribsby was occupied in making some lovely dresses for the tenants daughters who were to figure as a sort of bridesmaids chorus at the breakfast and marriage ceremony and immense festivities were to take place at the park upon this delightful occasion  yes mr huxter yes a happy tenantry its countrys pride will assemble in the baronial hall where the beards will wag all the ox shall be slain and the cup theyll drain and the bells shall peal quite genteel and my fatherinlaw with the tear of sensibility bedewing his eye shall bless us at his baronial porch that shall be the order of proceedings i think mr huxter and i hope we shall see you and your lovely bride by her husbands side and what will you please to drink sir mrs lightfoot madam you will give to my excellent friend and bodysurgeon mr huxter mr samuel huxter mrcs every refreshment that your hostel affords and place the festive amount to my account and mr lightfoot sir what will you take though youve had enough already i think yes ha  so spoke harry foker in the bar of the clavering arms he had apartments at that hotel and had gathered a circle of friends round him there he treated all to drink who came he was hailfellow with every man he was so happy he danced round madame fribsby mrs lightfoots great ally as she sate pensive in the bar he consoled mrs lightfoot who had already begun to have causes of matrimonial disquiet for the truth must be told that young lightfoot having now the full command of the cellar had none over his own unbridled desires and was tippling and tipsy from morning till night and a piteous sight it was for his fond wife to behold the big youth reeling about the yard and coffeeroom or drinking with the farmers and tradesmen his own neat wines and carefully selected stock of spirits  when he could find time mr morgan the butler came from the park and took a glass at the expense of the landlord of the clavering arms he watched poor lightfoots tipsy vagaries with savage sneers mrs lightfoot felt always doubly uncomfortable when her unhappy spouse was under his comrades eye but a few months married and to think he had got to this madame fribsby could feel for her madame fribsby could tell her stories of men every bit as bad she had had her own woes too and her sad experience of men so it is that nobody seems happy altogether and that theres bitters as mr foker remarked in the cup of every mans life and yet there did not seem to be any in his the honest young fellow it was brimming over with happiness and goodhumour  mr morgan was constant in his attentions to foker and yet i dont like him somehow said the candid young man to mrs lightfoot he always seems as if he was measuring me for my coffin somehow painlaws afraid of him painlaws ahem never mind but mainlaws a trump mrs lightfoot  indeed my lady was and mrs lightfoot owned with a sigh that perhaps it had been better for her had she never left her mistress  no i do not like thee dr fell the reason why i cannot tell continued mr foker and he wants to be taken as my head man blanche wants me to take him why does miss amory like him so  did miss blanche like him so the notion seemed to disturb mrs lightfoot very much and there came to this worthy landlady another cause for disturbance a letter bearing the boulogne postmark was brought to her one morning and she and her husband were quarrelling over it as foker passed down the stairs by the bar on his way to the park his custom was to breakfast there and bask a while in the presence of armida then as the company of clavering tired him exceedingly and he did not care for sporting he would return for an hour or two to billiards and the society of the clavering arms then it would be time to ride with miss amory and after dining with her he left her and returned modestly to his inn  lightfoot and his wife were quarrelling over the letter what was that letter from abroad why was she always having letters from abroad who wrote emhe would know he didnt believe it was her brother it was no business of his it was a business of his and with a curse he seized hold of his wife and dashed at her pocket for the letter  the poor woman gave a scream and said well take it just as her husband seized on the letter and mr foker entered at the door she gave another scream at seeing him and once more tried to seize the paper lightfoot opened it shaking her away and an enclosure dropped down on the breakfasttable  hands off man alive cried little harry springing in dont lay hands on a woman sir the man that lays his hand upon a woman save in the way of kindness is ahallo its a letter for miss amory whats this mrs lightfoot  mrs lightfoot began in piteous tones of reproach to her husbandyou unmanly to treat a woman so who took you off the street oh you coward to lay your hand upon your wife why did i marry you why did i leave my lady for you why did i spend eight hundred pound in fitting up this house that you might drink and guzzle  she gets letters and she wont tell me who writes letters said mr lightfoot with a muzzy voice its a family affair sir will you take anything sir  i will take this letter to miss amory as i am going to the park said foker turning very pale and taking it up from the table which was arranged for the poor landladys breakfast he went away  hes comindammy whos acomin whos j a mrs lightfootcurse me whos j a cried the husband  mrs lightfoot cried out be quiet you tipsy brute do and running to her bonnet and shawl threw them on saw mr foker walking down the street took the bylane which skirts it and ran as quickly as she could to the lodgegate clavering park foker saw a running figure before him but it was lost when he got to the lodgegate he stopped and asked who was that who had just come in mrs bonner was it he reeled almost in his walk the trees swam before him he rested once or twice against the trunks of the naked limes  lady clavering was in the breakfastroom with her son and her husband yawning over his paper good morning harry said the begum heres letters lots of letters lady rockminster will be here on tuesday instead of monday and arthur and the major come today and laura is to go to dr portmans and come to church from there andwhats the matter my dear what makes you so pale harry  where is blanche asked harry in a sickening voicenot down yet  blanche is always the last said the boy eating muffins shes a regular dawdle she is when youre not here she lays in bed till lunchtime  be quiet frank said the mother  blanche came down presently looking pale and with rather an eager look towards foker then she advanced and kissed her mother and had a face beaming with her very best smiles on when she greeted harry  how do you do sir she said and put out both her hands  im ill answered harry iive brought a letter for you blanche  a letter and from whom is it pray voyons she said  i dont knowi should like to know said foker  how can i tell until i see it asked blanche  has mrs bonner not told you he said with a shaking voicetheres some secret you give her the letter lady clavering  lady clavering wondering took the letter from poor fokers shaking hand and looked at the superscription as she looked at it she too began to shake in every limb and with a scared face she dropped the letter and running up to frank clutched the boy to her and burst out with a sobtake that awayits impossible its impossible  what is the matter cried blanche with rather a ghastly smile the letter is only fromfrom a poor pensioner and relative of ours  its not true its not true screamed lady clavering no my frankis it clavering  blanche had taken up the letter and was moving with it towards the fire but foker ran to her and clutched her armi must see that letter he said give it me you

rowdy which is the thing so no more my dear little betsy till we meet from your affectionate father j amory altamont  read it lady clavering it is too late to keep it from you now said poor foker and the distracted woman having cast her eyes over it again broke out into hysterical screams and convulsively grasped her son  they have made an outcast of you my boy she said theyve dishonoured your old mother but im innocent frank before god im innocent i didnt know this mr foker indeed indeed i didnt  im sure you didnt said foker going up and kissing her hand  generous generous harry cried out blanche in an ecstasy but he withdrew his hand which was upon her side and turned from her with a quivering lip thats different he says  it was for her sakefor her sake harry again miss amory is in an attitude  there was something to be done for mine said foker i would have taken you whatever you were everythings talked about in london i knew that your father had come toto grief you dont think it wasit was for your connexion i married you d it all ive loved you with all my heart and soul for two years and youve been playing with me and cheating me broke out the young man with a cry oh blanche

out lady clavering take her take everything i have its all hers you know at my death this boys disinheritedmaster frank who had been looking as scared at the strange scene here burst into a loud cry

darling come to your poor old mother well hide ourselves but were honest yes we are honest  all this while a strange feeling of exultation had taken possession of blanches mind that month with poor harry had been a weary month to her all his fortune and splendour scarcely sufficed to make the idea of himself supportable she was wearied of his simple ways and sick of coaxing and cajoling him  stay mamma stay madam she cried out with a gesture which was always appropriate though rather theatrical i have no heart have i i keep the secret of my mothers shame i give up my rights to my halfbrother and my bastard brother yes my rights and my fortune i dont betray my father and for this i have no heart ill have my rights now and the laws of my country shall give them to me i appeal to my countrys lawsyes my countrys laws the persecuted one returns this day i desire to go to my father and the little lady swept round her hand and thought that she was a heroine  you will will you cried out clavering with one of his usual oaths im a magistrate and dammy ill commit him heres a chaise coming perhaps its him let him come  a chaise was indeed coming up the avenue and the two women shrieked each their loudest expecting at that moment to see altamont arrive  the door opened and mr morgan announced major pendennis and mr pendennis who entered and found all parties engaged in this fierce quarrel a large screen fenced the breakfastroom from the hall and it is probable that according to his custom mr morgan had taken advantage of the screen to make himself acquainted with all that occurred  it had been arranged on the previous day that the young people should ride and at the appointed hour in the afternoon mr fokers horses arrived from the clavering arms but miss blanche did not accompany him on this occasion pen came out and shook hands with him on the doorsteps and harry foker rode away followed by his groom in mourning the whole transactions which have occupied the most active part of our history were debated by the parties concerned during those two or three hours many counsels had been given stories told and compromises suggested and at the end harry foker rode away with a sad god bless you from pen there was a dreary dinner at clavering park at which the lately installed butler did not attend and the ladies were both absent after dinner pen said i will walk down to clavering and see if he is come and he walked through the dark avenue across the bridge and road by his own cottagethe once quiet and familiar fields of which were flaming with the kilns and forges of the artificers employed on the new railroad works and so he entered the town and made for the clavering arms  it was past midnight when he returned to clavering park he was exceedingly pale and agitated is lady clavering up yet he asked yes she was in her own sittingroom he went up to her and there found the poor lady in a piteous state of tears and agitation  it is iarthur he said looking in and entering he took her hand very affectionately and kissed it you were always the kindest of friends to me dear lady clavering he said i love you very much i have got some news for you  dont call me by that name she said pressing his hand you were always a good boy arthur and its kind of you to come nowvery kind you sometimes look very like your ma my dear  dear good lady clavering arthur repeated with particular emphasis something very strange has happened  has anything happened to him gasped lady clavering oh its horrid to think i should be glad of ithorrid  he is well he has been and is gone my dear lady dont alarm yourselfhe is gone and you are lady clavering still  is it true what he sometimes said to me she screamed outthat he  he was married before he married you said pen he has confessed it tonight he will never come back there came another shriek from lady clavering as she flung her arms round pen and kissed him and burst into tears on his shoulder  what pen had to tell through a multiplicity of sobs and interruptions must be compressed briefly for behold our prescribed limit is reached and our tale is coming to its end with the branch coach from the railroad which had succeeded the old alacrity and perseverance amory arrived and was set down at the clavering arms he ordered his dinner at the place under his assumed name of altamont and being of a jovial turn he welcomed the landlord who was nothing loth to a share of his wine having extracted from mr lightfoot all the news regarding the family at the park and found from examining his host that mrs lightfoot as she said had kept his counsel he called for more wine of mr lightfoot and at the end of this symposium both being greatly excited went into mrs lightfoots bar  she was there taking tea with her friend madame fribsby and lightfoot was by this time in such a happy state as not to be surprised at anything which might occur so that when altamont shook hands with mrs lightfoot as an old acquaintance the recognition did not appear to him to be in the least strange but only a reasonable cause for further drinking the gentlemen partook then of brandyandwater which they offered to the ladies not heeding the terrified looks of one or the other  whilst they were so engaged at about six oclock in the evening mr morgan sir francis claverings new man came in and was requested to drink he selected his favourite beverage and the parties engaged in general conversation  after a while mr lightfoot began to doze mr morgan had repeatedly given hints to mrs fribsby to quit the premises but that lady strangely fascinated and terrified it would seem or persuaded by mrs lightfoot not to go kept her place her persistence occasioned much annoyance to mr morgan who vented his displeasure in such language as gave pain to mrs lightfoot and caused mr altamont to say that he was a rum customer and not polite to the sex  the altercation between the two gentlemen became very painful to the women especially to mrs lightfoot who did everything to soothe mr morgan and under pretence of giving a pipelight to the stranger she handed him a paper on which she had privily written the words he knows you go there may have been something suspicious in her manner of handing or in her guests of reading the paper for when he got up a short time afterwards and said he would go to bed morgan rose too with a laugh and said it was too early to go to bed  the stranger then said he would go to his bedroom morgan said he would show him the way  at this the guest said come up ive got a brace of pistols up there to blow out the brains of any traitor or skulking spy and glared so fiercely upon morgan that the latter seizing hold of lightfoot by the collar and waking him said john amory i arrest you in the queens name stand by me lightfoot this capture is worth a thousand pounds  he put forward his hand as if to seize his prisoner but the other doubling his fist gave morgan with his left hand so fierce a blow on the chest that it knocked him back behind mr lightfoot that gentleman who was athletic and courageous said he would knock his guests head off and prepared to do so as the stranger tearing off his coat and cursing both of his opponents roared to them to come on  but with a piercing scream mrs lightfoot flung herself before her husband whilst with another and louder shriek madame fribsby ran to the stranger and calling out armstrong johnny armstrong seized hold of his naked arm on which a blue tattooing of a heart and m f were visible  the ejaculation of madame fribsby seemed to astound and sober the stranger he looked down upon her and cried out its polly by jove  mrs fribsby continued to exclaim this is not amory this is johnny armstrong my wickedwicked husband married to me in st martins church mate on board an indiaman and he left me two months after the wicked wretch this is john armstrongheres the mark on his arm which he made for me  the stranger said i am john armstrong sure enough polly im john armstrong amory altamontand let em all come on and try what they can do against a british sailor hurray whos for it  morgan still called out arrest him but mrs lightfoot said arrest him arrest you you mean spy what stop the marriage and ruin my lady and take away the clavering arms from us  did he say hed take away the clavering arms from us asked mr lightfoot turning round hang him ill throttle him  keep him darling till the coach passes to the up train itll be here now directly  d him ill choke him if he stirs said lightfoot and so they kept morgan until the coach came and mr amory or armstrong went away back to london  morgan had followed him but of this event arthur pendennis did not inform lady clavering and left her invoking blessings upon him at her sons door going to kiss him as he was asleep it had been a busy day  we have to chronicle the events of but one day more and that was a day when mr arthur attired in a new hat a new blue frockcoat and blue handkerchief in a new fancy waistcoat new boots and new shirtstuds presented by the right honourable the countess dowager of rockminster made his appearance at a solitary breakfasttable in clavering park where he could scarce eat a single morsel of food two letters were laid by his worships plate and he chose to open the first which was in a round clerklike hand in preference to the second more familiar superscription  note 1 ran as follows   garbanzos wine company shepherds innmonday  my dear pendennisin congratulating you heartily upon the event which is to make you happy for life i send my very kindest remembrances to mrs pendennis whom i hope to know even longer than i have already known her and when i call her attention to the fact that one of the most necessary articles to her husbands comfort is pure sherry i know i shall have her for a customer for your worships sake  but i have to speak to you of other than my own concerns yesterday afternoon a certain j a arrived at my chambers from clavering which he had left under circumstances of which you are doubtless now aware in spite of our difference i could not but give him food and shelter and he partook freely both of the garbanzos amontillado and the toboso ham and he told me what had happened to him and many other surprising adventures the rascal married at sixteen and has repeatedly since performed that ceremonyin sydney in new zealand in south america in newcastle he says first before he knew our poor friend the milliner he is a perfect don juan  and it seemed as if the commendatore had at last overtaken him for as we were at our meal there came three heavy knocks at my outer door which made our friend start i have sustained a siege or two here and went to my usual place to reconnoitre thank my stars i have not a bill out in the world and besides those gentry do not come in that way i found that it was your uncles late valet morgan and a policeman i think a sham policeman and they said they had a warrant to take the person of john armstrong alias amory alias altamont a runaway convict and threatened to break in the oak  now sir in my own days of captivity i had discovered a little passage along the gutter into bows and costigans window and i sent jack alias along this covered way not without terror of his life for it had grown very cranky and then after a parley let in mons morgan and friend  the rascal had been instructed about that covered way for he made for the room instantly telling the policeman to go downstairs and keep the gate and he charged up my little staircase as if he had known the premises as he was going out of the window we heard a voice that you know from bowss garret saying who are ye and hwhat the divvle are ye at youd betther leave the gutther bedad theres a man killed himself already  and as morgan crossing over and looking into the darkness was trying to see whether this awful news was true he took a broomstick and with a vigorous dash broke down the pipe of communicationand told me this morning with great glee that he was reminded of that aisy sthratagem by remembering his dorling emilie when she acted the pawrt of cora in the pleeand by the bridge in pezawro bedad i wish that scoundrel morgan had been on the bridge when the general tried his sthratagem  if i hear more of jack alias i will tell you he has got plenty of money still and i wanted him to send some to our poor friend the milliner but the scoundrel laughed and said he had no more than he wanted but offered to give anybody a lock of his hair farewellbe happy and believe me always truly yours e strong   and now for the other letter said pen dear old fellow and he kissed the seal before he broke it   warrington tuesday  i must not let the day pass over without saying a god bless you to both of you may heaven make you happy dear arthur and dear laura i think pen that you have the best wife in the world and pray that as such you will cherish her and tend her the chambers will be lonely without you dear pen but if i am tired i shall have a new home to go to in the house of my brother and sister i am practising in the nursery here in order to prepare for the part of uncle george farewell make your wedding tour and come back to your affectionate g w   pendennis and his wife read this letter together after doctor portmans breakfast was over and the guests were gone and when the carriage was waiting amidst the crowd at the doctors outer gate but the wicket led into the churchyard of st marys where the bells were pealing with all their might and it was here over helens green grass that arthur showed his wife georges letter for which of those twofor grief was it or for happiness that lauras tears abundantly fell on the paper and once more in the presence of the sacred dust she kissed and blessed her arthur  there was only one marriage on that day at clavering church for in spite of blanches sacrifices for her dearest mother honest harry foker could not pardon the woman who had deceived her husband and justly argued that she would deceive him again he went to the pyramids and syria and there left his malady behind him and returned with a fine beard and a supply of tarbooshes and nargillies with which he regales all his friends he lives splendidly and through pens mediation gets his wine from the celebrated vintages of the duke of garbanzos  as for poor cos his fate has been mentioned in an early part of this story no very glorious end could be expected to such a career morgan is one of the most respectable men in the parish of st jamess and in the present political movement has pronounced himself like a man and a briton and bowson the demise of mr piper who played the organ at clavering little mrs sam hunter who has the entire command of doctor portman brought bows down from london to contest the organloft and her candidate carried the chair when sir francis clavering quitted this worthless life the same little indefatigable canvasser took the borough by storm and it is now represented by arthur pendennis esq blanche amory it is well known married at paris and the saloons of madame la comtesse de montmorenci de valentinois were amongst the most suivis of that capital the duel between the count and the young and fiery representative of the mountain alcide de mirobo arose solely from the latter questioning at the club the titles borne by the former nobleman madame de montmorenci de valentinois travelled after the adventure and bungay bought her poems and published them with the countesss coronet emblazoned on the countesss work  major pendennis became very serious in his last days and was never so happy as when laura was reading to him with her sweet voice or listening to his stories for this sweet lady is the friend of the young and the old and her life is always passed in making other lives happy  and what sort of a husband would this pendennis be many a reader will ask doubting the happiness of such a marriage and the fortune of laura the querists if they meet her are referred to that lady herself who seeing his faults and wayward moodsseeing and owning that there are men better than heloves him always with the most constant affection his children or their mother have never heard a harsh word from him and when his fits of moodiness and solitude are over welcome him back with a neverfailing regard and confidence his friend is his friend stillentirely heartwhole that malady is never fatal to a sound organ and george goes through his part of godpapa perfectly and lives alone if mr pens works have procured him more reputation than has been acquired by his abler friend whom no one knows george lives contented without the fame if the best men do not draw the great prizes in life we know it has been so settled by the ordainer of the lottery we own and see daily how the false and worthless live and prosper while the good are called away and the dear and young perish untimelywe perceive in every mans life the maimed happiness the frequent falling the bootless endeavour the struggle of right and wrong in which the strong often succumb and the swift fail we see flowers of good blooming in foul places as in the most lofty and splendid fortunes flaws of vice and meanness and stains of evil and knowing how mean the best of us is let us give a hand of charity to arthur pendennis with all his faults and shortcomings who does not claim to be a hero but only a man and a brother   the end
