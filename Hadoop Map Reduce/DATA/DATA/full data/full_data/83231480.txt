83231480	on the advisableness of improving natural knowledge   by thomas h huxley  1    this time two hundred years agoin the beginning of january 1666those of our forefathers who inhabited this great and ancient city took breath between the shocks of two fearful calamities one not quite past although its fury had abated the other to come  within a few yards of the very spot on which we are assembled so the tradition runs that painful and deadly malady the plague appeared in the latter months of 1664 and though no new visitor smote the people of england and especially of her capital with a violence unknown before in the course of the following year the hand of a master has pictured what happened in those dismal months and in that truest of fictions the history of the plague year defoe shows death with every accompaniment of pain and terror stalking through the narrow streets of old london and changing their busy hum into a silence broken only by the wailing of the mourners of fifty thousand dead by the woful denunciations and mad prayers of fanatics and by the madder yells of despairing profligates  but about this time in 1666 the deathrate had sunk to nearly its ordinary amount a case of plague occurred only here and there and the richer citizens who had flown from the pest had returned to their dwellings the remnant of the people began to toil at the accustomed round of duty or of pleasure and the stream of city life bid fair to flow back along its old bed with renewed and uninterrupted vigour  the newly kindled hope was deceitful the great plague indeed returned no more but what it had done for the londoners the great fire which broke out in the autumn of 1666 did for london and in september of that year a heap of ashes and the indestructible energy of the people were all that remained of the glory of fivesixths of the city within the walls  our forefathers had their own ways of accounting for each of these calamities they submitted to the plague in humility and in penitence for they believed it to be the judgment of god but towards the fire they were furiously indignant interpreting it as the effect of the malice of manas the work of the republicans or of the papists according as their prepossessions ran in favour of loyalty or of puritanism  it would i fancy have fared but ill with one who standing where i now stand in what was then a thickly peopled and fashionable part of london should have broached to our ancestors the doctrine which i now propound to youthat all their hypotheses were alike wrong that the plague was no more in their sense divine judgment than the fire was the work of any political or of any religious sect but that they were themselves the authors of both plague and fire and that they must look to themselves to prevent the recurrence of calamities to all appearance so peculiarly beyond the reach of human controlso evidently the result of the wrath of god or of the craft and subtlety of an enemy  and one may picture to ones self how harmoniously the holy cursing of the puritan of that day would have chimed in with the unholy cursing and the crackling wit of the rochesters and sedleys and with the revilings of the political fanatics if my imaginary plain dealer had gone on to say that if the return of such misfortunes were ever rendered impossible it would not be in virtue of the victory of the faith of laud or of that of milton and as little by the triumph of republicanism as by that of monarchy but that the one thing needful for compassing this end was that the people of england should second the effort of an insignificant corporation the establishment of which a few years before the epoch of the great plague and the great fire had been as little noticed as they were conspicuous  some twenty years before the outbreak of the plague a few calm and thoughtful students banded themselves together for the purpose as they phrased it of improving natural knowledge the ends they proposed to attain cannot be stated more clearly than in the words of one of the founders of the organization  our business was precluding matters of theology and state affairs to discourse and consider of philosophical enquiries and such as related thereuntoas physick anatomy geometry astronomy navigation staticks magneticks chymicks mechanicks and natural experiments with the state of these studies and their cultivation at home and abroad we then discoursed of the circulation of the blood the valves in the veins the venae lacteae the lymphatic vessels the copernican hypothesis the nature of comets and new stars the satellites of jupiter the oval shape as it then appeared of saturn the spots on the sun and its turning on its own axis the inequalities and selenography of the moon the several phases of venus and mercury the improvement of telescopes and grinding of glasses for that purpose the weight of air the possibility or impossibility of vacuities and natures abhorrence thereof the torricellian experiment in quicksilver the descent of heavy bodies and the degree of acceleration therein with divers other things of like nature some of which were then but new discoveries and others not so generally known and embraced as now they are with other things appertaining to what hath been called the new philosophy which from the times of galileo at florence and sir francis bacon lord verulam in england hath been much cultivated in italy france germany and other parts abroad as well as with us in england  the learned dr wallis writing in 1696 narrates in these words what happened half a century before or about 1645 the associates met at oxford in the rooms of dr wilkins who was destined to become a bishop and subsequently coming together in london they attracted the notice of the king and it is a strange evidence of the taste for knowledge which the most obviously worthless of the stuarts shared with his father and grandfather that charles the second was not content with saying witty things about his philosophers but did wise things with regard to them for he not only bestowed upon them such attention as he could spare from his poodles and his mistresses but being in his usual state of impecuniosity begged for them of the duke of ormond and that step being without effect gave them chelsea college a charter and a mace crowning his favours in the best way they could be crowned by burdening them no further with royal patronage or state interference  thus it was that the halfdozen young men studious of the new philosophy who met in one anothers lodgings in oxford or in london in the middle of the seventeenth century grew in numerical and in real strength until in the latter part the royal society for the improvement of natural knowledge had already become famous and had acquired a claim upon the veneration of englishmen which it has ever since retained as the principal focus of scientific activity in our islands and the chief champion of the cause it was formed to support  it was by the aid of the royal society that newton published his principia if all the books in the world except the philosophical transactions were destroyed it is safe to say that the foundations of physical science would remain unshaken and that the vast intellectual progress of the last two centuries would be largely though incompletely recorded nor have any signs of halting or of decrepitude manifested themselves in our own times as in dr walliss days so in these our business is precluding theology and state affairs to discourse and consider of philosophical enquiries but our mathematick is one which newton would have to go to school to learn our staticks mechanicks magneticks chymicks and natural experiments constitute a mass of physical and chemical knowledge a glimpse at which would compensate galileo for the doings of a score of inquisitorial cardinals our physick and anatomy have embraced such infinite varieties of being have laid open such new worlds in time and space have grappled not unsuccessfully with such complex problems that the eyes of vesalius and of harvey might be dazzled by the sight of the tree that has grown out of their grain of mustard seed  the fact is perhaps rather too much than too little forced upon ones notice nowadays that all this marvellous intellectual growth has a no less wonderful expression in practical life and that in this respect if in no other the movement symbolized by the progress of the royal society stands without a parallel in the history of mankind  a series of volumes as bulky as the transactions of the royal society might possibly be filled with the subtle speculations of the schoolmen not improbably the obtaining a mastery over the products of mediaeval thought might necessitate an even greater expenditure of time and of energy than the acquirement of the new philosophy but though such work engrossed the best intellects of europe for a longer time than has elapsed since the great fire its effects were writ in water so far as our social state is concerned  on the other hand if the noble first president of the royal society could revisit the upper air and once more gladden his eyes with a sight of the familiar mace he would find himself in the midst of a material civilization more different from that of his day than that of the seventeenth was from that of the first century and if lord brounckers native sagacity had not deserted his ghost he would need no long reflection to discover that all these great ships these railways these telegraphs these factories these printingpresses without which the whole fabric of modern english society would collapse into a mass of stagnant and starving pauperismthat all these pillars of our state are but the ripples and the bubbles upon the surface of that great spiritual stream the springs of which only he and his fellows were privileged to see and seeing to recognise as that which it behoved them above all things to keep pure and undefiled  it may not be too great a flight of imagination to conceive our noble revenant not forgetful of the great troubles of his own day and anxious to know how often london had been burned down since his time and how often the plague had carried off its thousands he would have to learn that although london contains tenfold the inflammable matter that it did in 1666 though not content with filling our rooms with woodwork and light draperies we must needs lead inflammable and explosive gases into every corner of our streets and houses we never allow even a street to burn down and if he asked how this had come about we should have to explain that the improvement of natural knowledge has furnished us with dozens of machines for throwing water upon fires any one of which would have furnished the ingenious mr hooke the first curator and experimenter of the royal society with ample materials for discourse before half a dozen meetings of that body and that to say truth except for the progress of natural knowledge we should not have been able to make even the tools by which these machines are constructed and further it would be necessary to add that although severe fires sometimes occur and inflict great damage the loss is very generally compensated by societies the operations of which have been rendered possible only by the progress of natural knowledge in the direction of mathematics and the accumulation of wealth in virtue of other natural knowledge  but the plague my lord brounckers observation would not i fear lead him to think that englishmen of the nineteenth century are purer in life or more fervent in religious faith than the generation which could produce a boyle an evelyn and a milton he might find the mud of society at the bottom instead of at the top but i fear that the sum total would be a deserving of swift judgment as at the time of the restoration and it would be our duty to explain once more and this time not without shame that we have no reason to believe that it is the improvement of our faith nor that of our morals which keeps the plague from our city but again that it is the improvement of our natural knowledge  we have learned that pestilences will only take up their abode among those who have prepared unswept and ungarnished residences for them their cities must have narrow unwatered streets foul with accumulated garbage their houses must be illdrained illlighted illventilated their subjects must be illwashed illfed illclothed the london of 1665 was such a city the cities of the east where plague has an enduring dwelling are such cities we in later times have learned somewhat of nature and partly obey her because of this partial improvement of our natural knowledge and of that fractional obedience we have no plague because that knowledge is still very imperfect and that obedience yet incomplete typhus is our companion and cholera our visitor but it is not presumptuous to express the belief that when our knowledge is more complete and our obedience the expression of our knowledge london will count her centuries of freedom from typhus and cholera as she now gratefully reckons her two hundred years of ignorance of that plague which swooped upon her thrice in the first half of the seventeenth century  surely there is nothing in these explanations which is not fully borne out by the facts surely the principles involved in them are now admitted among the fixed beliefs of all thinking men surely it is true that our countrymen are less subject to fire famine pestilence and all the evils which result from a want of command over and due anticipation of the course of nature than were the countrymen of milton and health wealth and wellbeing are more abundant with us than with them but no less certainly is the difference due to the improvement of our knowledge of nature and the extent to which that improved knowledge has been incorporated with the household words of men and has supplied the springs of their daily actions  granting for a moment then the truth of that which the depreciators of natural knowledge are so fond of urging that its improvement can only add to the resources of our material civilization admitting it to be possible that the founders of the royal society themselves looked for no other reward than this i cannot confess that i was guilty of exaggeration when i hinted that to him who had the gift of distinguishing between prominent events and important events the origin of a combined effort on the part of mankind to improve natural knowledge might have loomed larger than the plague and have outshone the glare of the fire as a something fraught with a wealth of beneficence to mankind in comparison with which the damage done by those ghastly evils would shrink into insignificance  it is very certain that for every victim slain by the plague hundreds of mankind exist and find a fair share of happiness in the world by the aid of the spinning jenny and the great fire at its worst could not have burned the supply of coal the daily working of which in the bowels of the earth made possible by the steam pump gives rise to an amount of wealth to which the millions lost in old london are but as an old song  but spinning jenny and steam pump are after all but toys possessing an accidental value and natural knowledge creates multitudes of more subtle contrivances the praises of which do not happen to be sung because they are not directly convertible into instruments of creating wealth when i contemplate natural knowledge squandering such gifts among men the only appropriate comparison i can find for her is to liken her to such a peasant woman as one sees in the alps striding ever upward heavily burdened and with mind bent only on her home but yet without effort and without thought knitting for her children now stockings are good and comfortable things and the children will undoubtedly be much the better for them but surely it would be shortsighted to say the least of it to depreciate this toiling mother as a mere stockingmachinea mere provider of physical comforts  however there are blind leaders of the blind and not a few of them who take this view of natural knowledge and can see nothing in the bountiful mother of humanity but a sort of comfortgrinding machine according to them the improvement of natural knowledge always has been and always must be synonymous with no more than the improvement of the material resources and the increase of the gratification of men  natural knowledge is in their eyes no real mother of mankind bringing them up with kindness and if need be with sternness in the way they should go and instructing them in all things needful for their welfare but a sort of fairy godmother ready to furnish her pets with shoes of swiftness swords of sharpness and omnipotent aladdins lamps so that they may have telegraphs to saturn and see the other side of the moon and thank god they are better than their benighted ancestors if this talk were true i for one should not greatly care to toil in the service of natural knowledge i think i would just as soon be quietly chipping my own flint axe after the manner of my forefathers a few thousand years back as be troubled with the endless malady of thought which now infests us all for such reward but i venture to say that such views are contrary alike to reason and to fact those who discourse in such fashion seem to me to be so intent upon trying to see what is above nature or what is behind her that they are blind to what stares them in the face in her  i should not venture to speak thus strongly if my justification were not to be found in the simplest and most obvious factsif it needed more than an appeal to the most notorious truths to justify my assertion that the improvement of natural knowledge whatever direction it has taken and however low the aims of those who may have commenced ithas not only conferred practical benefits on men but in so doing has effected a revolution in their conceptions of the universe and of themselves and has profoundly altered their modes of thinking and their views of right and wrong i say that natural knowledge seeking to satisfy natural wants has found the ideas which can alone still spiritual cravings i way that natural knowledge in desiring to ascertain the laws of comfort has been driven to discover those of conduct and to lay the foundations of a new morality  let us take these points separately and first what great ideas has natural knowledge introduced into mens minds  i cannot but think that the foundations of all natural knowledge were laid when the reason of man first came face to face with the facts of nature when the savage first learned that the fingers of one hand are fewer than those of both that it is shorter to cross a stream than to head it that a stone stops where it is unless it be moved and that it drops from the hand which lets it go that light and heat come and go with the sun that sticks burn away to a fire that plants and animals grow and die that if he struck his fellowsavage a blow he would make him angry and perhaps get a blow in return while if he offered him a fruit he would please him and perhaps receive a fish in exchange when men had acquired this much knowledge the outlines rude though they were of mathematics of physics of chemistry of biology of moral economical and political science were sketched nor did the germ of religion fail when science began to bud listen to words which though new are yet three thousand years old      when in heaven the stars about the moon     look beautiful when all the winds are laid     and every height comes out and jutting peak     and valley and the immeasurable heavens     break open to their highest and all the start     shine and the shepherd gladdens in his heart 2  if the halfsavage greek could share our feelings thus far it is irrational to doubt that he went further to find as we do that upon that brief gladness there follows a certain sorrowthe little light of awakened human intelligence shines so mere a spark amidst the abyss of the unknown and unknowable seems so insufficient to do more than illuminate the imperfections that cannot be remedied the aspirations that cannot be realized of mans own nature but in this sadness this consciousness of the limitation of man this sense of an open secret which he cannot penetrate lies the essence of all religion and the attempt to embody it in the forms furnished by the intellect is the origin of the higher theologies  thus it seems impossible to imagine but that the foundations of all knowledgesecular or sacredwere laid when intelligence dawned though the superstructure remained for long ages so slight and feeble as to be compatible with the existence of almost any general view respecting the mode of governance of the universe no doubt from the first there were certain phenomena which to the rudest mind presented a constancy of occurrence and suggested that a fixed order ruled at any rate among them i doubt if the grossest of fetish worshippers ever imagined that a stone must have a god within it to make it fall or that a fruit had a god within it to make it taste sweet with regard to such matters as these it is hardly questionable that mankind from the first took strictly positive and scientific views  but with respect to all the less familiar occurrences which present themselves uncultured man no doubt has always taken himself as the standard of comparison as the centre and measure of the world nor could he well avoid doing so and finding that his apparently uncaused will has a powerful effect in giving rise to many occurrences he naturally enough ascribed other and greater events to other and greater volitions and came to look upon the world and all that therein is as the product of the volitions of persons like himself but stronger and capable of being appeased or angered as he himself might be soothed or irritated through such conceptions of the plan and working of the universe all mankind have passed or are passing and we may now consider what has been the effect of the improvement of natural knowledge on the views of men who have reached this stage and who have begun to cultivate natural knowledge with no desire but that of increasing gods honour and bettering mans estate  for example what could seem wiser from a mere material point of view more innocent from a theological one to an ancient people than that they should learn the exact succession of the seasons as warnings for their husbandmen or the position of the stars as guides to their rude navigators but what has grown out of this search for natural knowledge of so merely useful a character you all know the reply astronomywhich of all sciences has filled mens minds with general ideas of a character most foreign to their daily experience and has more than any other rendered it impossible for them to accept the beliefs of their fathers astronomywhich tells them that this so vast and seemingly solid earth is but an atom among atoms whirling no man knows whither through illimitable space which demonstrates that what we call the peaceful heaven above us is but that space filled by an infinitely subtle matter whose particles are seething and surging like the waves of an angry sea which opens up to us infinite regions where nothing is known or ever seems to have been known but matter and force operating according to rigid rules which leads us to contemplate phenomena the very nature of which demonstrates that they must have had a beginning and that they must have an end but the very nature of which also proves that the beginning was to our conceptions of time infinitely remote and that the end is as immeasurably distant  but it is not alone those who pursue astronomy who ask for bread and receive ideas what more harmless than the attempt to lift and distribute water by pumping it what more absolutely and grossly utilitarian but out of pumps grew the discussions about natures abhorrence of a vacuum and then it was discovered that nature does not abhor a vacuum but that air has weight and that notion paved the way for the doctrine that all matter has weight and that the force which produces weight is coextensive with the universein short to the theory of universal gravitation and endless force while learning how to handle gases led to the discovery of oxygen and to modern chemistry and to the notion of the indestructibility of matter  again what simpler or more absolutely practical than the attempt to keep the axle of a wheel from heating when the wheel turns round very fast how useful for carters and gig drivers to know something about this and how good were it if any ingenious person would find out the cause of such phenomena and thence educe a general remedy for them such an ingenious person was count rumford and he and his successors have landed us in the theory of the persistence or indestructibility of force and in the infinitely minute as in the infinitely great the seekers after natural knowledge of the kinds called physical and chemical have everywhere found a definite order and succession of events which seem never to be infringed  and how has it fared with physick and anatomy have the anatomist the physiologist or the physician whose business it has been to devote themselves assiduously to that eminently practical and direct end the alleviation of the sufferings of mankindhave they been able to confine their vision more absolutely to the strictly useful i fear they are worst offenders of all for if the astronomer has set before us the infinite magnitude of space and the practical eternity of the duration of the universe if the physical and chemical philosophers have demonstrated the infinite minuteness of its constituent parts and the practical eternity of matter and of force and if both have alike proclaimed the universality of a definite and predicable order and succession of events the workers in biology have not only accepted all these but have added more startling theses of their own for as the astronomers discover in the earth no centre of the universe but an eccentric speck so the naturalists find man to be no centre of the living world but one amidst endless modifications of life and as the astronomer observes the mark of practically endless time set upon the arrangements of the solar system so the student of life finds the records of ancient forms of existence peopling the world for ages which in relation to human experience are infinite  furthermore the physiologist finds life to be as dependent for its manifestation on particular molecular arrangements as any physical or chemical phenomenon and whenever he extends his researches fixed order and unchanging causation reveal themselves as plainly as in the rest of nature  nor can i find that any other fate has awaited the germ of religion arising like all other kinds of knowledge and out of the action and interaction of mans mind with that which is not mans mind it has taken the intellectual coverings of fetishism or polytheism of theism or atheism of superstition or rationalism with these and their relative merits and demerits i have nothing to do but this it is needful for my purpose to say that if the religion of the present differs from that of the past it is because the theology of the present has become more scientific than that of the past because it has not only renounced idols of wood and idols of stone but begins to see the necessity of breaking in pieces the idols built up of books and traditions and finespun ecclesiastical cobwebs and of cherishing the noblest and most human of mans emotions by worship for the most part of the silent sort at the altar of the unknown and unknowable  such are a few of the new conceptions implanted in our minds by the improvement of natural knowledge men have acquired the ideas of the practically infinite extent of the universe and of its practical eternity they are familiar with the conception that our earth is but an infinitesimal fragment of that part of the universe which can be seen and that nevertheless its duration is as compared with our standards of time infinite they have further acquired the idea that man is but one of innumerable forms of life now existing in the globe and that the present existences are but the last of an immeasurable series of predecessors moreover every step they have made in natural knowledge has tended to extend and rivet in their minds the conception of a definite order of the universewhich is embodied in what are called by an unhappy metaphor the laws of natureand to narrow the range and loosen the force of mens belief in spontaneity or in changes other than such as arise out of that definite order itself whether these ideas are well or ill founded is not the question no one can deny that they exist and have been the inevitable outgrowth of the improvement of natural knowledge and if so it cannot be doubted that they are changing the form of mens most cherished and most important convictions  and as regards the second pointthe extent to which the improvement of natural knowledge has remodelled and altered what may be termed the intellectual ethics of menwhat are among the moral convictions most fondly held by barbarous and semibarbarous people  they are the convictions that authority is the soundest basis of belief that merit attaches to a readiness to believe that the doubting disposition is a bad one and scepticism a sin that when good authority has pronounced what is to be believed and faith has accepted it reason has no further duty there are many excellent persons who yet hold by these principles and it is not my present business or intention to discuss their views all i wish to bring clearly before your minds is the unquestionable fact that the improvement of natural knowledge is effected by methods which directly give the lie to all these convictions and assume the exact reverse of each to be true  the improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to acknowledge authority as such for him scepticism is the highest of duties blind faith the one unpardonable sin and it cannot be otherwise for every great advance in natural knowledge has involved the absolute rejection of authority the cherishing of the keenest scepticism the annihilation of the spirit of blind faith and the most ardent votary of science holds his firmest convictions not because the men he most venerates hold them not because their verity is testified by portents and wonders but because his experience teaches him that whenever he chooses to bring these convictions into contact with their primary source naturewhenever he thinks fit to test them by appealing to experiment and to observationnature will confirm them the man of science has learned to believe in justification not by faith but by verification  thus without for a moment pretending to despise the practical results of the improvement of natural knowledge and its beneficial influence on material civilization it must i think be admitted that the great ideas some of which i have indicated and the ethical spirit which i have endeavoured to sketch in the few moments which remained at my disposal constitute the real and permanent significance of natural knowledge  if these ideas be destined as i believe they are to be more and more firmly established as the world grows older if that spirit be fated as i believe it is to extend itself into all departments of human thought and to become coextensive with the range of knowledge if as our race approaches its maturity it discovers as i believe it will that there is but one kind of knowledge and but one method of acquiring it then we who are still children may justly feel it our highest duty to recognise the advisableness of improving natural knowledge and so to aid ourselves and our successors in their course towards the noble goal which lies before mankind
