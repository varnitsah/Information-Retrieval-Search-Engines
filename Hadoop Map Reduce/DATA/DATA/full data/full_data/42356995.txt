42356995	history of friedrich ii of prussia  frederick the great  by thomas carlyle  volume vii     book vii  fearful shipwreck of the doublemarriage project  febnov 1730     chapter i  england sends the excellency hotham to berlin  things therefore are got to a deadlock at berlin rebellious womankind peremptorily refuse weissenfels and take to a bed of sickness inexpugnable there for the moment baireuth is but a weak middle term and there are disagreements on it answer from england affirmative or even negative we have yet none promptly affirmative that might still avail and be an honorable outcome perhaps better pause till that arrive and declare itselffriedrich wilhelm knows nothing of the villa mission of the urgencies that have been used in england but in present circumstances he can pause for their answer     majesty and crownprince with him make a run to dresden  to outward appearance friedrich wilhelm having written that message to baireuth seems easier in mind quiet with the queen though dangerous for exploding if wilhelmina and the prince come in view wilhelmina mostly squats prince who has to be in view gets slaps and strokes daily journellement says the princessor almost daily for the rest it is evident enough weissenfels if not got passed through the female parliament is thrown out on the second reading and so is at least finished ought we not to make a run to dresden therefore and apprise the polish majesty short run to dresden is appointed for february 18th fassmann p 404 and the princeroyal perhaps suspected of meditating something and safer in his fathers company than elsewhere is to go wilhelmina had taken leave of him night of the 17th in her majestys apartment and was in the act of undressing for bed whenjudge of a young princesss terror and surprise  there stept into the anteroom visible in the halflight there a most handsome little cavalier dressed not succinctly as colonel of the potsdam giants but in magnificent french stylei gave a shriek not knowing who it was and hid myself behind a screen madam de sonsfeld my governess not less frightened than myself ran out to see what audacious person at such undue hour it could be but she returned next moment accompanying the cavalier who was laughing heartily and whom i recognized for my brother his dress so altered him he seemed a different person he was in the best humor possible  i am come to bid you farewell once more my dear sister said he and as i know the friendship you have for me i will not keep you ignorant of my designs i go and do not come back i cannot endure the usage i suffer my patience is driven to an end it is a favorable opportunity for flinging off that odious yoke i will glide out of dresden and get across to england where i do not doubt i shall work out your deliverance too when i am got thither so i beg you calm yourself we shall soon meet again in places where joy shall succeed our tears and where we shall have the happiness to see ourselves in peace and free from these persecutions wilhelmina i 205  wilhelmina stood stupefied in silence for some momentsargued long with her brother finally got him to renounce those wild plans or at least postpone them and give her his word that he would attempt nothing on the present occasion this small dresden excursion of february 1730 passed accordingly without accident it was but the prelude to a much grander visit now agreed upon between the neighboring majesties for there is a grand thing in the wind something truly sublime of the scenicmilitary kind which has not yet got a name but shall soon have a worldwide onecamp of muhlberg camp of radewitz or however to be namedwhich his polish majesty will hold in those saxon parts in a month or two a thing that will astonish all the world we may hope and where the king and prince of prussia are to attend as chief guests  it was during this brief absence in february or directly after friedrich wilhelm had returned that queen sophie had that fit of real sickness we spoke of scarcely was his majesty got home when the queen rather ambiguous in her sicknesses of late fell really and dangerously ill so that friedrich wilhelm at last recognizing it for real came hurrying in from potsdam wept loud and abundantly poor man declared in private he would not survive his feekin and for her sake solemnly pardoned wilhelmina and even fritztill the symptoms mended wilhelmina i 306     how villa was received in england  meanwhile dr villa in england has sped not ill villas eloquence of truth the grumkowreichenbach correspondence in st mary axe these two things produce their effect these on the one hand and then on the other certain questionable aspects of fleury after that fine soissons catastrophe to the kaiser and certain interior quarrels in the english ministry partly grounded thereonon the whole why should not we detach friedrioh wilhelm from the kaiser if we could and comply with a royal sister think they at st jamess  political men take some interest in the question why neglect your prince of wales grumbles the public it is a solid protestant match eligible for prince fred and uswhy bother with the kaiser and his german puddles asks walpole once detach prussia from him the kaiser will perhaps sit still and leave the world and us free of his pragmatics and his sanctions and apanagesquit of him german puddles answers townshend dubitativelywho has gained favor at headquarters by going deeply into said puddles and is not so ardent for the prussian match and indeed is gradually getting into quarrel with walpole and queen caroline coxe i 332339 these things are all favorable to dr villa  in fact there is one of those political tempests dreadful to the teapot were it not experienced in them going on in england at this timewhat we call a change of ministrydaily crisis laboring towards fulfilment or brewing itself ripe townshend and walpole have had how many weeks ago coxe does not tell us that meeting in colonel selwyns which ended in their clutching at swords nay almost at coatcollars ib p 335 honorable brothersinlaw but the good sister who used to reconcile them is now dead their quarrels growing for some years past are coming to a head when the firm used to be townshend and walpole all was well when it had to become walpole and townshend all was not well said walpole afterwards  things had already gone so far that townshend brought chesterfield over from the hague last autumna baron de montesquieu with the esprit de lois in his head sailed with lord chesterfield on that occasion and is now in england for two yearsbut chesterfield could not be made secretary industrious duke of newcastle stuck so close by that office and by the skirts of walpole chesterfield and townshend versus walpole colonel stanhope harrington and the pelhams the prussian match is a card in that game and dr villas eloquence of truth is not lost on queen caroline who in a private way manages as always to rule pretty supreme in it  there lies in the statepaper office close by despatch prussian london 8th february os 17291730 without date or signature a loose detached bit of writing in scholastic style but brief and to the purpose which is evidently the memorial of villa but as it teaches us nothing that we do not already know it need not be inserted here the man we can perceive farther continued useful in those official quarters answering questions about prussia helping in the stmaryaxe decipherings and in other small ways for some time longer after which he vanishes again from all recordwhether to teach english farther or live on some modicum of pension granted no man knows poor old dove let out upon the deluge in serge gown he did bring back a bit of olive so to speakhad the presage but held as it did in noahs case  in a word the english sovereignties and ministries have determined that an envoy extraordinary one hotham they think of with the due solemnity be sent straightway to berlin to treat of those interesting matters and officially put the question there whom dubourgay is instructed to announce to his prussian majesty with salutation from this court as dubourgay does straightway with a great deal of pleasure despatches london 8th february berlin 2d march 1780 how welcome to his majesty we need not say  and indeed after such an announcement 1st march 1730 the day of it they fell into cheerful dialogue and the brigadier had some frank conversation with his majesty about the arbitration commission then sitting at brunswick and european affairs in general conversation which is carefully preserved for us in the brigadiers despatch of the morrow it never was intrinsically of much moment and is now fallen very obsolete and altogether of none but as a glance at firsthand into the dim old thoughts of friedrich wilhelm the reader may take it with him  the king said next that though we made little noise yet he knew well our designwas to kindle a fire in other parts of lower germany to which i answered that if his majesty would give me favorable hearing i could easily persuade him of the peaceable intentions of our allies well says he the emperor will abandon the netherlands and who will be master of them i see the day when you will make france so powerful that it will be difficult to bring them to reason againdubourgay if the emperor abandoned the netherlands they would be governed by their own magistrate and defended by their own militia as to the french we are too well persuaded of the benefit of our allies to upon which the king of prussia said it appeared plainly we had a mind to dispose as we pleased of kingdoms and provinces in italy so that probably our next thought would be to do the same in germanydubourgay the allotments made in favor of don carlos have been made with the consent of the emperor and the whole empire we could not suffer a longer interruption of our commerce with spain for the sake of the small difference between the treaty of seville and the quadruple alliance in regard to the garrisonto the introducing of spanish garrisons at once into parma and piacenza which was the special thunderbolt of the late soissons catastrophe or treaty of sevillewell then says his prussian majesty you must allow then there is an infraction of the quadruple alliance and that the emperor will make war i hope not said i but if so a tenyears war in conjunction with the allies of seville never would be so bad as the interruption of our commerce with old and new spain for one year  the king of prussias notion about our disposing of provinces in germany adds dubourgay is i believe an insinuation of seckendorf who i doubt not has made him believe we intended to do so with respect to berg and julich  very probablybut hotham is getting under way hopeful to spoil that game prussian majesty we see is not insensible to so much honor and brightens into hopefulness and fine humor in consequence what radiancy spread over the queens side of the house we need not say the tobaccoparliament is like to have a hard taskfriedrich wilhelm privately is well inclined to have his daughter married with such outlooks if it can be done the marriage of the crownprince into such a family would also be very welcome onlyonlythere are considerations on that side there are reasons still more there are whims feelings of the mind towards an unloved heirapparent upon these latter chiefly lie the hopes of seckendorf and the tobaccoparliament  what the tobaccoparliaments specific insinuations and deliberations were in this alarming interim no hansard gives us a hint faint and timid they needed at first to be such unfavorable winds having risen blowing off at a sad rate the smoke of that abstruse institutionjarnibleu snuffles the feldzeugmeister to himself but si deus est nobiscum as grumkow exclaims once to his beautiful reichenbach or nosti as he calls him in their slang or cipher language if god is with us who can prevail against us for the grumkow can quote scripture nay solaces himself with it which is a feat beyond what the devil is competent to     excellency hotham arrives in berlin  the special envoy to be sent to berlin on this interesting occasion is a dignified yorkshire baronet sir charles hotham colonel of the horsegrenadiers he has some post at court too and is still in his best years his wife is chesterfields sister he is withal a kind of soldier as we seea man of many sabretashes at least and acquainted with cavalrydrill as well as the practices of goldsticks his father was a general officer in the peterborough spanish wars these are his eligibilities recommending him at berlin and to official men at home family is old enough hothams of scarborough in the east riding old as wilhelmus bastardus and subsists to our own day this sir charles is lineal son of the hothams who lost their heads in the civil war and he is so to speak lineal uncle of the lords hotham that now are for the rest a handsome figure prompt in french and much the gentleman so far has villa sped  hotham got to berlin on sunday 2d april 1730 he had lingered a little waiting to gather up some skirts of that reichenbachgrumkow correspondence and have them ready to show in the proper quarter for that is one of the chief arrows in his quiver but here he is at last and on monday he is introduced at charlottenburg to the prussian majesty and finds an abundant welcome to himself and his preliminaries marriage into that fine high country magnifike land will be welcome to my daughter i believe as flowers in may to me also how can it be other than welcomefarther instructions you say yes surely and terms honorable on both sides only say nothing of it i had rather tell the girl myself ranke i 284 to that frank purport spoke his majestyand invites the excellency hotham to stay dinner  great dinner at charlottenburg accordingly monday 3d april 1730 the two english excellencies hotham and dubourgay then general borck knyphausen grumkow seckendorf and otherswhere says hotham giving despatch about it we all got immoderately drunk of which dinner there is sordid narrative from grumkow to his nosti to his reichenbach in cant speech still visible through st mary axe were it worth much attention from us passages of wit loaded with allusion flew round the table a german ducat is change for an english halfguinea and the like sprightly things nay at one time hothams back being turned they openly drinkhis majesty in a state of exhilaration having blabbed the secretto the health of wilhelmina princess of wales upon which the whole palace of charlottenburg now bursts into tripudiation the very valets cutting capers making somersetsand rushing off with the news to berlin observable only that hotham and dubourgay sat silent in the tripudiation with faces diplomatically grave several points to be settled first no hallooing till we are out of the wood  news came to berlin schloss doubtless at full gallop which would only take a quarter of an hour this is wilhelminas experience of it afternoon of monday 3d of april 1730 in the schloss of berlintowards sunset some ornamental seam in ones hand  i was sitting quiet in my apartment busy with work and some one reading to me when the queens ladies rushed in with a torrent of domestics in the rear who all bawled out putting one knee to the ground they were come to salute the princess of wales i fairly believed these poor people had lost their wits they would not cease overwhelming me with noise and tumult their joy was so great they knew not what they did when the farce had lasted some time they at last told mewhat our readers know what the demure wilhelmina professes she cared next to nothing about i was so little moved by it that i answered going on with my work is that all which greatly surprised them a while afterwards my sisters and several ladies came also to congratulate me i was much loved and i felt more delighted at the proofs each gave me of that than at what occasioned them in the evening i went to the queens you may readily conceive her joy on my first entrance she called me her dear princess of wales and addressed madam de sonsfeld as milady this latter took the liberty of hinting to her that it would be better to keep quiet that the king having yet given no notice of this business might be provoked at such demonstration and that the least trifle could still ruin all her hopes the countess finkenstein joining her remonstrances to sonsfelds the queen though with regret promised to moderate herself wilhelmina i 215  this is the effulgent flamingpoint of the longagitated english match which we have so often caught in a bitterly smoking condition the king indeed spoke nothing of it to us on his return to berlin in a day or two says wilhelmina which we thought strange but everybody considered it certain nothing but the details left to settle hotham had daily conferences with the king every post brought letters from the prince of wales of which wilhelmina saw severalthis for one specimen general purport of the whole i conjure you my dear hotham get these negotiations finished i am madly in love amoureux comme un fou and my impatience is unequalled ib i 218 wilhelmina thought these sentiments very romantic on the part of prince fred who had never seen me knew me only by reputeand answered his romances and him with tiffs of laughter in a prettily fleecing manner  effulgent flamepointwhich was of very brief duration indeed and which sank soon into bitterer smoke than ever down almost to the choking state there are now six weeks of diplomatic history at the court of berlin which end far otherwise than they began weeks wellnigh indecipherable so distracted are they by blackart and abstruse activities above ground and below and so distractedly recorded for us of which if it be humanly possible we must try to convey some faint notion to mankind     chapter ii  language of birds excellency hotham proves unavailing  already next morning after that grand dinner at charlottenburg friedrich wilhelm awakening with his due headache thought and was heard saying he had gone too far those gloomy looks of hotham and dubourgay on the occasion they are a sad memento that our joyance was premature the english mean the doublemarriage and friedrich wilhelm is not ready and never fairly was for more than the single wilhelmina princess of wales yes with all my heart but friedrich to an english princesshm naand in a day more instruction to his ministers 5th april cited by ranke i 285 n plainly no and there it finally rests or if rocked about always settles there again  and why notruly as regarded crownprince friedrichs marriage the question had its real difficulties and then still more it had its imaginary and the subterranean activities were busy the witnesses contemporaneous and other assign three reasons or considerations and quasireasons which the tobaccoparliament and friedrich wilhelms lively fancy could insist upon it till they became irrefragable  first his rooted discontent with the crownprince some even say his jealousy of the crownprinces talents render it unpleasant to think of promoting him in any way second natural german loyalty enlivened by the hope of julich and berg attaching friedrich wilhelm to the kaisers side of things repels him with a kind of horror from the antikaiser or frenchenglish side marry my daughter if you like i shall be glad to salute her as princess of wales but no union in your treatyofseville operations in politics go you your own road if that is it while i go mine no tying of us by double or other marriages to go one road third the magnificence of those english regardless of expense insinuates the tobaccoparliament they will send their grand princess hither with no end of money brought up in grandeur to look down on the like of us she can dazzle she can purchase in the end may there not be a crownprince party capable of extinguishing your majesty here in your own court and making prussia a bit of england all eyes being turned to such sumptuous princess and her crownprinceheirapparent or rising sun as we may call him  these really are three weighty almost dreadful considerations to a poetictempered king and smoking parliament out of which there is no refuge except indeed this plain fourth one no hurry about fritzs marriage friedrich wilhelm to reichenbach 13th may infra he is but eighteen gone evidently too young for housekeeping thirty is a good time for marrying there is thank god no lack of royal lineage i have two other princesand another just at hand if i knew it  to all which there is to be added that everrecurring invincible gravitation towards the kaiser and also towards julich and berg by means of himwell acted on by the tobaccoparliament for the space of those six weeks during which accordingly almost from the first day after that hotham dinner of april 3d the answer of the royal mind with superficial fluctuations always is wilhelmina at once if you choose likely enough we might agree about crownprince friedrich too if once all were settled but of the doublemarriage at this present time hore nit ranke i 285 n i will have nothing to say and as the english answer steadily both or nonemeaning indeed to draw prussia away from the kaisers leadingstrings and out of his present enchanted condition under the two blackartists he has about him the negotiation sinks again into a mere smoking and extinct or plainly extinguishing state  the grumkownosti cipher correspondence might be reckoned as another efficient cause though in fact it was only a big concomitant symptom much depended on by both parties and much disappointing both in the way of persuading or perverting friedrich wilhelms judgment about england this deeplaid piece of machinery does not seem to have done much if anything and hotham who with the english court had calculated on it on their detection of it as the grand means of blowing grumkow out of the field produced a far opposite result on trying as we shall see that was a bit of heavy ordnance which disappointed everybody seized by the enemy before it could do any mischief enemy turned it round on the inventor fired it off on the inventor andit exploded through the touchhole singeing some peoples whiskers nothing more     a peep into the nostigrumkow correspondence caught up in st mary axe  would the reader wish to look into this nostigrumkow correspondence at all i advise him not good part of it still lies in the paperoffice here prussian despatches vols xl xli in a fragmentary state so much of it as they had caught up and tried to make use offar too much likely to be published by the prussian dryasdust in coming time but a more sordid mass of eavesdroppings kitchenashes and floorsweepings collected and interchanged by a pair of treacherous flunkies big bullying flunky and little trembling cringing one grumkow and reichenbach was never got together out of a gentlemans household to no idlest reader armed even with barnacles and holding mouth and nose can the stirringup of such a dustbin be long tolerable but the amazing problem was this editors doomed to spell the event into clearness if he could and put dates physiognomy and outline to it by help of such flunkysanscritthat nostigrumkow correspondence as we now have it in the paperofficeinterpretable only by acres of british despatches by incondite dateless helpless prussian books printed blotches of human stupor as smelfungus calls them how gladly would one return them all to st mary axe there to lie through eternity it is like holding dialogue with a rookery asking your way perhaps in flight for life as was partly my own case by colloquy with successive or even simultaneous rookeries reader have you tried such a thing an adventure never to be spoken of again when once done  wilhelmina pretends to give quotations wilhelmina i 233235 from this subterranean grumkowreichenbach correspondence but hers are only extracts from some description or remembrance hardly one word is close to the original though here and there some outline or shadow of a real passage is traceable what fractional elements capable of gaining some vestige of meaning when laid together in their cosmic order i could pick from the circumambient immensity not cosmic are here for the readers behoof let him skip if like myself he is weary for the substance of the story is elsewhere given or perhaps he has the curiosity to know the speech of birds with abridgment by occasional change of phrase above all by immense omissionhere in specimen is something like what the rookery says to poor friedrich wilhelm and us through st mary axe and the copyists in the foreign office friedrich wilhelm reads it hotham gives him reading of it some weeks hence we not till generations afterwards i abridge to the utmostwill mark in single commas what is not abridgment but exact translationwith rigorous attention to dates and my best fidelity to any meaning there may be   to nosti the socalled excellenz reichenbach in london  gumkow from berlin loquitur reichenbach listening with both his ears words caught up in st mary axe  berlin 3d march 1730 the time has now come when reichenbach must play his game let him write that the heads of the opposition who play austria as a card in parliament are in consternation walpole having hinted to them that he was about to make friends with the king of prussia that by means of certain ministers at berlin and by other subterranean channels autres souterrains his prussian majesty had been brought to a disposition of that kind knyphausen borck and others will be much obliged to reichenbach for so writing that reichenbach knows they intend sending a minister to berlin but is certain enough as perhaps they are his prussian majesty will not let himself be lured or caught in the trap but that the very rumor of its being possible for him to change from austria would be an infinite gain to the english ministrysalvation of them in fact in the parliamentary cockpit that they had already given out in the way of rumor how sure they were of the court of berlin whenever it came to the point that reichenbach had tried to learn from 73 an indecipherable what the real result from berlin was and did not think it much though the walpole people all hanging so perilously upon prussia for their existence affected a great gayety and indeed felt what a gain it was even to have renewed the negotiation with his prussian majesty here is a king likely to get himself illuminated at firsthand upon english affairs by ministers lying abroad for him and lying at home  and so the king concludes grumkow will think reichenbach is a witch sorvier to be so well informed about all that and will redouble the good opinion he has of reichenbach and so if reichenbach second my ideas we will pack borck and knyphausen about their business and will do the king faithful servicehaving some of us our private 500 pounds a year from austria for doing it the king perceives only too well that the queens sickness is but sham momerie judge of the effect that has i am yours entirely tout a vous i wait in great impatience to hear your news upon all this for i inform you accurately how the land lies here so that it only depends upon yourself to shine and to pass for a miracle of just insightsorcier or witch at guessing mysteries grumkow calls it again he continues in another missive  berlin 7th march let us give the original for a line or two queen sophie will soon rise from her bed of sickness were this marriage done la mere du princeroyal affecte toujours detre bien mal mais des que laffaire entre le prince de galles et la princesseroyale sera faite on la verra bientot sur pied it will behoove that reichenbach signify to the princeroyals father that all this affair has been concocted at berlin with borck and by 71 an indecipherable with knyphausen and 103 an indecipherable that they never lose sight of an alliance with the english princess and the prince of prussia and flatter themselves the princeroyal of prussia will accompany the princessroyal wilhelmina on her marriage there in a word that all turns on this latter point marriage of the princeroyal as well and that villa has given so favorable a description of this prince that the english princess will have him at what price soever nosti can also allege the affair of 100whom we at last decipher to be lord harrington once colonel stanhope of soissons of the madrid embassy of the descent on vigo a distinguished new lord with whom newcastle hopes to shove out townshendlord harrington and the division among the ministersgreat question shall the firm be townshend and walpole or walpole and townshend just going on brewing towards decision in which the prussian doublemarriage is really a kind of card and may by nosti be represented as a trump card  the whole town of berlin said this villa was dismissed by order of the king for he taught the eldest princess english but i see well it was borck 107 an indecipherable knyphausen and dubourgay that despatched him to give a true picture of the situation here and if nosti has written to his majesty to the same effect as he does to his friend despatch to majesty has not yet come under friends eye on the queen of englands views about the princeroyal of prussia it will answer marvellously cela vient a merveille i have apprised seckendorf of all that nosti writes to me for the rest nosti may perfectly assure himself that the king never will abandon reichenbach and if the princeroyal sudden fate interfering had the reins in his handin that case seckendorf promises to reichenbach on the part of the kaiser all or more than all he can lose by the accession of the prince monsieur reichenbach may depend upon that prussian despatches vol xl the second of these two letters is copied we perceive by villa who transmits it to hothams secretary at berlin with great hopes from it letter unsigned adds villa point signee first was transmitted by townshendfollowing are transmitted by c c it is in that way they have got into the statepaper officeas enclosures in the varions despatches that carried them out to berlin to serve as diplomatic ammunition there  slave reichenbach at london when this missive comes to hand is busy copying scandal according to former instructions for behoof of his prussian majesty and my bashaw grumkow for example   to the herr grumkow at berlin  excellenz reichenbach loquitursnatched in st mary axe  london 10th march 1730  reichenbach has told his prussian majesty today by a courier who is to pass through brussels austrian kinskys courier no doubt what amours the prince of wales dissolute fred has on hand at present with actresses and operagirls the king of prussia will undoubtedly be astonished the affair merits some attention at presentespecially from an excellenz like me  missive body of important grumkow instructions just read by us comes to hand  london 14th march 1730 reichenbach will write by the first ordinary so they name post in those days all that glumkow orders reichenbach sees well they mean to play the deuce here jouent le diable a quatre ici but reichenbach will tell his prussian majesty what grumkow finds fit good excellenz reichenbach flatters himself the king will remain firm and not let his enemies deceive him if grumkow and seckendorf have opportunity they may tell his prussian majesty that the whole design of this court is to render his country a province dependent on england when once the princessroyal of england shall be wedded to the princeroyal of prussia the english by that means will form such a party at berlin that they will altogether tie his prussian majestys hands a comfortable piece of news to his prussian majesty in tobaccoparliament reichenbach will assuredly be vigilant depend on his answering grumkow always by the first post  continuesturning his rookbill towards majesty now same date 14th march same time place and bird   to his prussian majesty from excellenz reichenbach   ps i had closed this letter when a person of confidence came in the fact being my grumkows missive of instructions came in or figuratively speaking my grumkow himself and undertook to give me in a few days a thorough insight into the intrigues which are concealed under the sending of this new minister hotham to berlin which and how they have been concocted he says it will astonish me to hear of all this i shall immediately inform your majesty in a letter of my own hand being ever eager to serve your majesty alone  hotham is now fairly gone weeks ago concluded to be now in berlinto the horror of both rooks here is a croak from nosti   to the herr grumkow at berlin  london april 1730  hotham is no such conjurer as they fancy in berlinsingular enough how these english are given to undervalue the germans whilst we in germany overvalue them avons une idee trop vaste they trap petite there is for instance lord chesterfield passes here for a fairenough kind of man bon homme and is a favorite with the king not with walpole or the queen if nosti knew it but nobody thinks him such a prodigy as you all do in germanywhich latter bit of germanism is an undoubted fact curious enough to the english and to the germans that now read in extinct books  hotham as we said got to berlin on the 2d of april from berlin comes thereupon at great length sordid description by grumkow of that initiatory hotham dinner april third with fearful details of the blazing favor hotham is in which his majesty when hotham hands it to him in due time will read with painful interest as reichenbach now doesbut which to us is all mere puddle omissible in this place  to which sad strophe there straightway follows due antistrophe reichenbach croaking responsiveand we are to note the rooks always speak in the third person and by ambiguous periphrasis never once say i or you unless forced by this editor for brevitys sake to do it reichenbach from his perch thus hoarsely chants  to the herr grumkow at berlin  london 11th april reichenbach est coupdefoudreis struck by lightningto hear these berlin newsand expresses in the style of a whipt dog his sorrows uncertainties and terrors on the occasion struck with lightning feel myself quite ill and not in a condition to write much today it requires another head than mine to veer round so often changer si souvent de systame in fine nosti est au bout de son latin is at his wits end poor devil both majesties have spoken openly of the favorable news from berlin funds rose in consequence new minister walpole come to the top of the firm townshend soon to withdraw impatient of the bottom is allpowerful now o tempora o mores i receive universal congratulations and have to smile in a ghastly manner the king and queen despise me i put myself in their way last levee bowing to the ground but they did not even condescend to look notre grand petitmaitre little george the olympian jove of these parts passed on as if i had not been there chesterfield they say is to go in great pomp as ambassador extraordinary and fetch the princess over andalas in short once i was haphaphappy but now im meeserable  london 14th april slave reichenbaoh cannot any longer write secret letters to his prussian majesty according to the old strain of your prescribing but must stand by his vacant official despatches the scene being entirely changed he also must change his manner of writingpoor knave he will have to inform his majesty however by and by though it is not safe at presentfor examplethat his britannic majesty is becoming from day to day more hated by all the world and that the prince of wales is no longer liked by the public as at first because he begins to give himself airs and takes altogether the manners of his britannic majesty that is to say of a puppy petitmaitre let my amiable grumkow be aware of that  yes let him be aware of that to his comfortand still more and all readers along with him of what follows  reichenbach likewise with great confidence informs the greatest confidant he has in the world same amiable glumkow that he has discovered within this day or two a tremendous fact known to our readers some time ago that the princeroyal of prussia has given his written assurances to the queen here never to many anybody in the world except the princess amelia of england happen what will prussian majesty will read this with a terrible interest much nearer to him than it is to us in consideration of which promise the queen of england is understood falsely to have answered that they should at present ask only the princessroyal of prussia for their prince of wales and let the doublemarriage be seemingly as his prussian majesty wishes it monsieur de reichenbaoh did not speak of this to his prussian majesty feeling it too dangerous just now  lord townshend is still at his place in the country rainham in norfolk but it is said he will soon come to town having heard the great news that they had already got his prussian majesty by the nose reichenbach forgets if he already told grumkow that the rumor runs lord chesterfield in quality of ambassador to berlin is to bring the princess wilhelmina over hitheryou did already poor confused wretch unusually bewildered and under frightful eclipse at present  continues after four days  april 18th  lord stratford to me an unknown lordship and heads of opposition would like to ascertain what hothams offer to the king of prussia is  truly yes they mean to ask in parliament as poor gamblers in that cockpit are wont and why did not you make the offer sooner then friendship with his prussian majesty last year would have saved the whole of that large waterspout about the meadows of clamei nay need we a few months ago have spent such loads of gold subsidizing those hessians and danes against him the treasures of this country go a strange road mr speaker what is the use of our industries and riches heavens yes what but we continue to excerpt and interpret  reichenbach has said nothing of this to his prussian majesty reichenbach has not too dangerous in own present downpressed statethough amazingly exact always in news and attached to his prussian majesty as mortal seldom was need he fear their new hotham then does not fear hotham not he him being a man so careful of truth in his news dare not however now send any intelligence about the royal family here prussian majesty having ordered him not to write gossip like a spiteful woman what is he to do instruct him o my amiable  know for the rest and be aware of it o amiable that queen caroline here is of opinion the amiable grumkow should be conciliated and that queen sophie and hotham are understood to have been trying it do not abandon me o amiable nay i know you will not you and seckendorf never though i am a poor man  have found out a curious story histoire fort crieuseabout one of prince freds amourettes story which this editor in the name of the whole human species will totally suppress and sweep into the cesspool to herald reichenbach thither except only that this corollary by the duchess of kendal may be appended to the thing  duchess of kendal hoppole emerita now gone to devotion whom we know piously turns up her eyes at such doings thinks the princess wilhelmina will have a bad life of it with fred and that she will need the wisdom of solomon to get on here not a good bargain this prince fred and his sister a dissolute fellow he not liked by the public i should hope then as to princess amelia she who was always haughty begins to give herself airs upon the princeroyal of prussia she is as illtempered as her father and still more given to backbiting plus railleuse and will greatly displease the potsdam majesty  these are cheering thoughts but what is to become of nosti faithful to his grumkow to his seckendorfto his pair of sheepstealers poor dog but if trouble riseoh at least do not hang me ye incomparable pair     the hotham despatches  slave nostis terrors could he see behind the scenes are without foundation the tremendous hotham negotiation all ablaze at that charlottenburg dinner is sunk low enough into the smoking state threatening to go out altogether smoke there may still be perceptible vestiges of smoke which indeed for a long time fitfully continued but at the time while nosti quaking in every joint of him writes these terrors hotham perceives that his errand is vain that properly there has as good as extinction supervened april 3d was the flamepoint which lasted in its brightness only for a few days or hours april is not gone or half gone when flaming has quite ceased and the use of bellows never so judicious is becoming desperate and long before the end of may no red is to be seen in the affair at all and the very bellows are laid down  hereare the epochs riddled out of such a mass of extinct rubbish as human nature seldom had to deal withhere are certain extracts in a greatly condensed state from the authentic voluminous hotham despatches and responseswhich may conveniently interrupt the nosti babblement at this point   to my lord townshend at london  excellency hotham loquitur in a greatly condensed form  berlin 12th april 1730  of one or two noteworthy points i have to apprise your lordship so soon as his majesty was sober he found that he had gone too far at that grand dinner of monday 3d and was in very bad humor in consequence crownprince has written from potsdam to his sister no doubt i am left here lest the english wind get at me de peur que le vent anglais ne me touchat saw king at parade who was a little vague is giving matters his consideration majesty has said to borck and knyphausen if they want the doublemarriage and to detach me from the kaiser let them propose something about julich and berg sits the wind in that quarter king has said since to one marschall a privatesecretary who is in our interest i hate my son and my son hates me we are best asunderlet them make him statthalter viceregent of hanover with his princess commission might be made out in the princess amelias name proper conditions tied and so onknyphausen suggests it could be done knyphausen is true to us but he stands alone not alone but cannot much help does not even stir in the nosti or stmaryaxe affair as yet  prince friedrich to be statthalter in hanover with his english princess that would save the expense of an establishment for him at home that has been suggested by the knyphausen or english party and no doubt it looked flattering to his prussian majesty for moments this may be called epoch first after that grand charlottenburg dinner  then as to the nosti affair in which knyphausen does not stir as yetthe fact is it was only put into knyphausens hands the day before yesterday as we soon discover and knyphausen is not so sure about it as some are that hotham despatch is of wednesday 12th april and not till yesterday could guy dickens report performance of the other important thing captain guy dickens a brisk handy military man secretary to dubourgay this good while past has duly received from headquarters the successive nostigrumkow documents caught up in st mary axe has now delivered them to knyphausen to be laid before his prussian majesty in a good hour and would fain tuesday april 11th hope some result from this step not for almost a month does hotham himself say anything of it to the prussian majesty good hour for knyphausen not having come but now in regard to that hanover statthaltership hear townshendcondensed but not nearly so much so my lord being a succinct man who sticks always creditably to the point   to the excellency hotham at berlin from lord townshend  london 27th april yes you shall have the hanover viceregency we will set up the crownprince friedrich in hanover as desired but will give the commission to our own princess that being more convenient for several reasons crownprince furthermore must promise to come over to england when we require him item may repay us our expenses hereafter as to marriageportions we will give none with our princess nor ask any with theirs both marriages or none ann so enough  alas nothing came of this prussian majesty in spite of thrift perceiving that for several reasons it would not do meanwhile grumkow we learn from a secret source nosti supra 18th april p 185 infra p 101 has been considerably courted by botham and her prussian majesty queen caroline having signified from england that they ought to gain that knavewhat price did he charge for himself but this also proves quite unavailing never came to pricing and sohear hotham once more   to lord townshend at london from excellency hotham  berlin 18th april  grumkow is a thorn in my side one would like to do him some service in return cannot you stop an original letter of his we have only deciphered copies as yet to that reichenbach or nosti strong enough to break his backthey will try hotham continues in next despatch  berlin 22d april dined with the king again crownprince was present dreadfully dejectedat which one cannot help being moved there is something so engaging in the prince and everybody says so much good of him hear hotham who again three days after says of our fritz if i am not much mistaken this young prince will one day make a very considerable figure wish we could manage the marriage but this grumkow thiscannot they contrive to send an original strong enough  alas from the same secret source we learn within a week that grumkows back is very strong the tobaccoparliament in full blast again and seckendorfs couriers galloping to vienna with the best news nay his majesty looks expressly sour upon hotham or does not look at all will not even speak when he sees himfor a reason we shall hear nosti infra 29th april p 191 can it be thought that any liberality in use of the bellows or other fireimplements will now avail with his majesty   second and last peep into the nostigrumkow correspondence caught up in st mary axe  but at this point let our two rooks recommence a little nosti on the 18th we left quaking in every joint of himand good news was almost at the door had afflicted nosti known it grumkows strain suppressed by us here all this while is in general almost ever since the blaze of that hotham dinner went off into repentant headache pshaw dont fear nay after a fortnight or so it is again steady we are all right tobaccoparliament and the royal imagination making such progress this is still but the third week since that grand dinner at charlottenburg   to the excellenz reichenbach at london from grumkow  berlin 22d april king wants to get rid of the princess wilhelmina who is grown lean ugly with pimples on her face qui est devenue maigre laide couperosee this is one of the sentences wilhelmina has got hold of wilhelmina i 234dog will nobody horsewhip that lie out of himjudge what a treat that will be to a prince of wales who has his amourettes all is right nosti is it not  berlin 25th april king declared to seckendorf yesterday again he might write to the kaiser that while he lived nothing should ever part his majesty from the kaiser and his cause that the french dare not attack luxembourg as is threatened and if they do upon which seckendorf despatched a courier to vienna  as to hotham he explains himself upon nothingstalks about with his nose in the air as if there were nothing farther to be explained i spoke yesterday of the single match wilhelmina and prince of wales king answered even of the single match devil fly away with itor a still coarser phrase  meanwhile the queen though at the end of her eighth month is cheery as a fish in water wilhelmina has this too in a disfigured state i 233 and always forms grand project of totally ruining seckendorf by knyphausens and other help hotham yesterday glancing at nosti no doubt said to the sieur de potsdam cant phrase for the king that great princes were very unlucky to have ministers that durst not show themselves in good society for the result was they sent nothing but false news and rumors picked up in coffeehouses  coffeehouses answers reichenbach by and by reichenbach is in english society of the first distinction and receives visits from lords and dukes this all the world knowsto be nothing like the case as townshend too has occasionally mentioned  at any rate continues grumkow the queens husband said aside to nostis friend i see he is glancing at reichenbach but he wont make much of that cynically speaking ne fera que de leau claire hotham is by no means a man of brilliant mind and his manners are rough but ginkel the dutchman is cleverer plus souple and much better liked by nostis master  antistrophe soon follows london raven is himself againnosti loquitur  london 25th april  king has written to me i am to report to him any talk there may be in the court here about his majesty my amiable and his seckendorf need they ask if nosti will and in a way to give them pleasure  strophe allegro by the berlin raven or rook who has not yet heard the abovegrumkow loquitur  berlin 29th april  wrong not to write entertaining news of the english court as heretofore king likes it  what you say of the princeroyal of prussias writing to the queen of england is very curious and you did well to say nothing of it to the father the thing being of extreme delicacy and the proof difficult but it seems likely and i insinuated something of it to his majesty the day before yesterday 27th april 1730 therefore one momentary glance of hansard into the tobaccoparliament as of a thing i had learned from a spy such my pretence o nostispy who is the intimate friend of knyphausen and plays traitor you may fancy that it struck terribly yes and his majesty has looked sour upon hotham ever since and passed above an hour in colloquy with seckendorf and me in sight both of english hotham and dutch ginkel without speaking to them  it was true enough what nosti heard of the queens fair speeches and hothams to the friend of nosti but it is all ended the queens weeks ago being in vain hotham too after some civilities seems now indifferent enfin afin he always writes it copying the indistinct gurgle of his own horsedialectafin filouterie tout pure whole of it thimblerig on their part  admirable story that of prince freds amourette sent to the cesspool by us herald of reichenbach thither let his majesty know it by all means what the duchess of kendal lean tall female in expensive brocades with gilt prayerbooks visible in the body to nosti at that time what the duchess of kendal says to you is perfectly just and as the princess wilhelmina is very illlooking laidehow dare you say so dog i believe she will have a bad life of it the prince of wales being accustomed to daintier meats yes truly she will as the duchess says need to be wiser than solomon to conciliate the humors down there la bas with the genius of his prussian majesty and queenas for your princess amelia depend upon it while the commandant of potsdam lives she will never get hold of the princeroyal though he is so furiously taken with the britannic majesties  continues in answer to a nosti caw caw which we omit  berlin 2d maywish you had not told the king so positively that the english say it shall be double match or none hotham said to the swedish ambassador reichenbach walking in the dark would give himself a fine knock on the nose aurait un furieux pied de nez when or if the thing was done quite otherwise have a caution what you write  pooh pooh hotham must have said if not when swede is quite astrayand indeed we will here leave off and shut down this magazine of rubbish right glad to wash ourselves wholly from it in three waters forevermore possibly enough the prussian dryasdust will one day print it in extenso and with that lucidity of comment and arrangement which is peculiar to him exasperated readers will then see whether i have used them ill or not according to the opportunity there washere at any rate my reader shall he free of it indeed he may perceive the negotiation was by this time come to a safe point the nostigrumkows triumphant and the interest of the matter mainly out farther transient anxieties this amiable couple hadtraceable in that last short croak from grumkowlest the english might consent to that of the singlemarriage in the mean time which the english never did or meant to do for example this other screech of nosti which shall be his final lastscreech  london 12th maylord townshend alarmingly hinted to me better have done with your grumkowandseckendorf speculations the illintentioned are perfectly sure to be found out at the end of the account and their tools will get ruined along with them nosti endeavored to talk big in reply but he shakes in his shoes nevertheless and with a heart full of distraction exclaims now save yourselves save meif hotham speak of the singlemarriage only it is certain the princeroyal must mean to run away and so make it a double one in time  yes indeed but these were transient terrors the day is our own my grumkow yes our own my nostiand so our colloquy of rookeries shall be suppressible henceforth     his majesty gets sight of the stmaryaxe documents but nothing follows from it  we have only to add what hotham reports berlin may 6th that he has had an interview with his majesty and spoken of the stmaryaxe affair knyphausen having found a moment to lay it before his majesty so that the above excerpts from st mary axe all but the last twothe above and many more suppressed by usare in his majestys hands and he is busy studying them will it is likely produce them in an amazed tobaccoparliament one of these evenings  what the emotions of the royal breast were during the perusal of this extraordinary dialogue of birds which has come to him through st mary axe manifold probably manifold questionable but not tragical or not immediately so certainly it is definable as the paltriest babble no treason visible in it nor constructive treason but it painfully indicates were his majesty candid that his majesty is subject to spies in his own house nay that certain parties do seem to fancy they have got his majesty by the nose and are piping tunes with an eye to his dancing thereto this is a painful thought which i believe does much agitate his majesty now and afterwardsa painful thought or suspicion rising sometimes in that temperament of his to the pitch of the horrible i believe it occasionally ever henceforth keeps haunting the highly poetic temperament of his majesty nor ever quits him again at all stalking always now and then through the vacant chambers of his mind in what we may call the nightseason or time of solitude and hypochondriacal reflectionthough in busy times again in daylight so to speak he impatiently casts it from him poor majesty  but figure grumkow figure the tobaccoparliament when majesty laid these papers on the table a hansard of that night would be worth reading there is thunderous note of interrogation on his majestys facewhat a glimmer in the hard puckery eyes of feldzeugmeister seckendorf jarnibleu no doubt an excessively astonished parliament nothing but brass of face will now serve the principal honorable gentleman there but in that happily he is not wanting  of course grumkow denies the letters pointblank mere forgeries these of the english court plotting to ruin your majestys faithful servant and bring in other servants they will like better may have written to reichenbach nay indeed has this or that trifling thing but those copyists in st mary axe decipheringgarbling manufacturing till they make a romance of italas your majesty nay at any rate what are the letters grumkow can plead that they are the foolishest insignificant rubbish of courtgossip not tending any bad road if they have a tendency that they are adapted to the nature of the beast and of the situationthis he will carefully abstain from remarking  we have no hansard of this session all is conjecture and tobaccosmoke what we know is not the least effect except an internal trouble was produced on the royal mind by the stmaryaxe discovery some question there might well be inarticulately as yet of grumkows fidelity at least of his discretion seeds of suspicion as to grumkow which may sprout up by and by resolution to keep ones eye on grumkow but the first practical fruit of the matter is fierce jealousy that the english and their clique do really wish to interfere in our ministerial appointments so that for the present grumkow is firmer in his place than ever and privately we need not doubt the matter continues painful to his majesty  one thing is certain precisely a week after his majestymuch fluctuating in mind evidently for the document has been changed three or four times within fortyeight hourspresents his final answer to hotham which runs to this effect outrageous as hotham defines it  1 for hanover and your great liberality on that score much obliged but upon reconsideration think it will not do 2 marriage first prince of wales to wilhelminaconsent with pleasure 3 marriage second crownprince friedrich with your ameliafor that also we are extremely wishful and trust it will one day take effect but first these sevilletreaty matters and differences between the kaiser and allied english and french will require to be pulled straight that done we will treat about the terms of marriage second one indispensable will bethat the english guarantee our succession in julich and berg hothams despatch 18th may 1730  outrageous indeedcrownprince sends along with this a loving message by hotham of earnestly deprecating tenor to the britannic majesty begs his britannic majesty not to reject the kings proposals whatever they may bethis for poor sister wilhelminas sake for though he the crownprince was determined to lose his life sooner than marry anybody but the princess amelia yet if this negotiation were broken off his father would go to extremities to force him and his poor sister into other engagementswhich alas what can it avail with the britannic majesty in regard to such outrageous propositions from the prussian  britannic majestys ministry as always answers by return of couriermay 22d both marriages or none seville has no concern with both more than with one ditto julich and bergof which latter indeed we know nothingnor aside to hotham mean to know despatch whitehall 11th may 22d by ns whereby hotham perceives that it is as good to throw away the bellows and consider the matter extinct hotham makes ready for an excursion into saxony to a thing called camp of radewitz or encampment of radewitz a military spectacle of neverimagined magnificence to be given by august the strong there whither all the world is crowdingand considers any business he had at berlin to be as good as done  evidently friedrich wilhelm has not been much wrought upon by the stmaryaxe documents one week they have been revolving in the royal mind part of a week in the smoking parliament we know not what day they were laid on the table there but it must have been a grand occurrence within those wallsand this already may 13th is the result arrived at propositions changed three or four times within fortyeight hours and definable at last as outrageous which induce hotham to lay down the bellows and prepare to go his ways our stmaryaxe discovery seems to have no effect at all  one other public result there is from it and as yet one only reichenbach from certain causes thereto moving us aus gewissen uns dazu bewegenden grunden gets a formal letter of recall ostensible letter dated berlin 13th may and signed friedrich wilhelm which the english may read for their comfort only that along with this of the same date and signature intended for reichenbachs comfort the same leather bag brings a private letter which dickens or another has contrived to get sight of and copy apprising reichenbach that unostensibly his proceedings are approved of that he is to continue at his post till further orders all the same and keep watch on these marriages about which there is such debating in the world wovon in der welt so viel debattirt wird things being still in the same state as half a year ago that is to say i am ready for my daughters marriage with the prince of wales but for my son he is too young yet und hat es damit keine eile weil ich gottlob noch zwei sohne hab nor is there any haste as i have thank god two other sonsand a third coming if i knew itbesides one indispensable condition will be that the english guarantee julich and berg which perhaps they are not in the least hurry for either  what does the english court think of that dated berlin 13th may it is the same day when his majestys matured proposals changed thrice or oftener within the fortyeight hours were handed to hotham for transmission to his court an interesting leather bag this ordinary from berlin reichenbach we observe will get his share of it some ten days after that alarming rebuke from townshend and it will relieve the poor wretch from his worst terrors go on with your eavesdroppings as before you alarmed wretchthere does one degenfeld by and by a man of better quality and on special haste as we shall see come and supersede poor nosti and send him homethere they give nosti some exiguous pension with hint to disappear forevermore which he does leaving only these stmaryaxe documents for his lifemark in the history of mankind  what the english answer to his majestys proposals of berlin may 13th was we have already seendated london 22d may probably few hours after the courier arrived hotham well anticipating what it would be had already as we phrased it laid down the bellows left the negotiation as essentially extinctand was preparing for the camp at radewitz britannic majesty being anxious to hear what friedrioh wilhelm and august the strong have on hand there  the king of prussias unsteadiness and want of resolution writes hotham berlin 20th may will hinder him from being either very useful to his friends or very formidable to his enemies and from the same place just about quitting it for radewitz he writes again exactly a week after berlin 27th may to enclose copy of a remarkable letter remarkable to us alsobut which he knows and we cannot influence the english answer now close at hand here is the copied letter copied in guy dickenss hand from which we translateand also will give the original french in this instance for behoof of the curious   to his excellency the chevalier hotham  potsdam end of may 1730  monsieurje crois que cest de la derniere importance que je vous ecrive et je suis assez triste davoir des chases a vous dire que je devrois cacher a toute la terre mais il faut franchir ce mauvais pas la et vous comptant de mes amis je me resouds plus facilement a vous le dire cest que je suis traite dune maniere inouie du roi et que je sais qua present ils se trament de terribles choses contre moi touchant certaines lettres que jai ecrites lhiver passe dont je crois que vous serez informe enfin pour vous parler franchement la vraie raison que le roi a de ne vouloir point donner les mains a ce mariage est quil me veut toujours tenir sur un bas pied et me faire enrager toute sa vie quand lenvie lui en prend ainsi il ne laccordera jamais si lon consent de votre cote que cette princesse soit aussi traitee ainsi vous pouvez comprendre aisement que je serai fort triste de rendre malheureuse une personne que jestime et de rester toujours dans le meme etat ou je suis pour moi done je crois quil vaudroit mieux finir le mariage de ma soeur ainsi auparavant et ne point demander au roi seulement des assurances sur mon sujet dautant plus que sa parole ny fait rien suffit que je reitere les promesses que jai deja fait au roi mon oncle de ne prendre jamais dautre epouse que sa seconde fille la princess amelie je suis une personne de parole qui pourra faire reussir ce que javance pourvu que lon se fie a moi je vous le promets et a present vous pouvez en avertir votre cour et je saurai tenir ma promesse je suis toujours tout a vous  frederic  statepaper office prussian despatches vol xli enclosed in sir charles hothams despatch berlin 27th16th may 1730  monsieuri believe it is of the last importance that i should write to you and i am very sad to have things to say which i ought to conceal from all the earth but one must take that bad leap and reckoning you among my friends i the more easily resolve to open myself to you  the case is this i am treated in an unheardof manner by the king and i know there are terrible things in preparation against me touching certain letters which i wrote last winter of which i believe you are informed in a word to speak frankly to you the real secret reason why the king will not consent to this marriage is that he wishes to keep me on a low footing constantly and to have the power of driving me mad whenever the whim takes him throughout his life thus he never will give his consent if it were possible that you on your side could consent that your princess too should be exposed to such treatment you may well comprehend that i should be very sad to bring misery on a person whom i esteem and to remain always in the same state as now  for my own part therefore i believe it would be better to conclude my sisters marriage in the first place and not even to ask from the king any assurances in regard to mine the rather as his word has nothing to do with it it is enough that i here reiterate the promises which i have already made to the king my uncle never to take another wife than his second daughter the princess amelia i am a person of my word and shall be able to bring about what i set forth provided there is trust put in me i promise it you and now you may give your court notice of it and i shall manage to keep my promise i remain yours always  the crownprince for wilhelminas sake and everybodys is extremely anxious they should agree to the single marriage in the interim but the english courtperhaps for no deep reason perhaps chiefly because little george had the whim of standing grandly immovable upon his first offernever would hear of that which was an angry thought to the crownprince in after times as we sometimes notice  here to the like effect is another fragment from his royal highness copied in the dickens hand and enclosed in the same despatch from hothamgiving us a glance into the inner workshop of his royal highness and his hidden assiduities and endeavorings at that time   vous pouvez croire que je ferai tout ce que je peux pour faire reussir mon plan mais lon nen remarquera rien em dehorsque lon men laisse agir en suite je ferai bien moi seul reussir le reste je finis la par vous assurer encore monsieur que je suis tout a vous   frederic prince r   you may believe i will exert all my resources to succeed in my plan but there will be no outward sign visibleleave me to act in this way i will myself successfully bring it through i end by again assuring you monsieur that i am yours alwayswhich again produces no effect the english answer being steadily both marriages or none  and this then is what the hotham mission is come to good dubourgay is home recalled about a month ago for the sake of his health townshends polite despatch to him whitehall 21st april 1730good old gentleman never to be heard of in diplomatic history more dubourgay went in the first days of may and the month is not out when hotham is off to the camp of radewitz leaving his negotiation as it were extinct to the visible regret of the berlin public generally to the grievous disappointment of queen sophie of the crownprince and some othersnot to speak of wilhelminas feelings which are unknown to us  regretful berlin wilhelmina and mamma among the others had by accident in these dejected circumstances a strange sign from the heavens provided them one nightif we may be permitted to notice it here monday 29th mayand poor queen sophie we observe withal is in the hands of the monthly nurse since tuesday last prince ferdinand her last child father of him whose fate lay at jenz seventysix years afterwards born 23d may 1730     st peters church in berlin has an accident  monday 29th may 1730 friedrich wilhelm and the crownprince and party were at potsdam so far on their way towards radewitz all is peaceable at potsdam that night but it was a night of wild phenomena at berlin or rather of one wild phenomenon the burning of the sanctpeters kirche which held the whole city awake and in terror for its life dim fassmann becomes unusually luminous on this affair probably an eyewitness to it poor old soul and enables us to fish up one old night of berlin city and its vanished populations into clear view again if we like  for two years back berlin had been diligently building a nonplusultra of steeples to that fine church of st peters highest steeple of them all one of the steeples of the world in a mannerand berlin was now near ending it tower or shaft has been complete some time interior fittings going on and is just about to get its ultimate apex a crownroyal set on it by way of finis for his majesty the great aedile was much concerned in the thing and had given materials multifarious helps three incomparable bells especially were his gift melodious old bells of distinguished tone bigger than the great bell of erfurt than tom of lincolnor as brief popular rumor has it the biggest bells in the world at least of such a tone these bells are hung silent but ready in their upper chamber of the tower and the gigantic crown or apex is to go on then will the basketwork of scaffolding be peeled away and the steeple stretch high and grand into the air for ages it is hoped  far otherwise on monday evening between eight and nine there gathered thunder over berlin wild tumult of the elements thunderbolt thrice in swift succession struck the unfinished steeple in the hood of which men thereupon noticed a light as of a star or sparkle of the sun and straightway in spite of the raintorrents there burst out blazes of flame blazes unquenchable grand yet perilous to behold the firedrums beat the alarmbells clanged and ceased not all berlin struggling there all night in vain such volumes of smoke the heavens were black as if you had hung them with mortcloth such roaring cataracts of flame you could have picked up a copper doit at the distance of 800 yardshissss what hissing far aloft is that that is the incomparable big bells melting there they vanish their fine tones never to be tried more and ooze through the redhot ruin hushshsht the last sound heard from them and the stem for holding that immense crownroyalit is a bar and bars of iron weighing sixteen hundredweight down it comes thundering crashing through the belly of st peters the fall of it like an earthquake all round and still the firedrums beat and from all surviving steeples of berlin goes the clangor of alarm none but the very young children can have slept that night says our vigilant old friend  wind was awake too kindling the neighboring streetsstorming towards the powdermagazine where labor innumerable artillerymen busy with hides from the tanpits with stabledung and other material speed to them we will say forty dwellinghouses went but not the powdermagazine not berlin utterly so to speak by the powdermagazine on the morrow st peters and neighborhood lay black but still inwardly burning not for three days more could the ruins be completely quenched  that was the news for friedrich wilhelm before sunrise on the point of his departure for muhlberg and king augusts scenic exhibitions hmbut we must go all the same we will rebuild it said heand truly he did so and the polite king august sorry to hear of the peterskirche gave him excellent sandstone from the quarries of pirna says fassmann great blocks came boating down the elbe from that notable saxon switzerland country notable to readers here in time coming and are to be found as ashlar in the modern st peters at berlin a fact which the reader till pirna be better known to him may remember if he likes fassmann pp 406409  and now let us to radewitz without delay     chapter iii  camp of radewitz  the camp of muhlberg called more properly the camp of radewitz towards which friedrich wilhelm with english hotham and many dignitaries are now gone was one of the sublimest scenic military exhibitions in the history of the world leaving all manner of imitation tournaments modern tintournaments out of sight and perhaps equalling the field of the cloth of gold or barbarossas mainz tournament in ancient times it lasted for a month regardless of expensejune month of the year 1730and from far and wide the idle of mankind ran by the thousand to see it shall the thing be abolished utterlyas perhaps were proper had not our crownprince been there with eyes very open to it and yet with thoughts very shutor shall some flying trace of the big zero be given riddling or screening certain cartloads of heavy old german printed rubbish chiefly the terrible compilation called heldenstaats und lebensgeschichte des c friedrichs des andern history heroical political and biographical of friedrich the second frankfurt and leipzig 17591760 vol i first half pp 171210 there are ten thick and thin halfvolumes and perhaps more one of the most hideous imbroglios ever published under the name of bookwithout vestige of index and on paper that has no margin and cannot stand inkyet with many curious articles stuffed blindly into the awful belly of it like jewels into a ragsack or into ten ragsacks all in one with far more authenticity than you could expect in such case let us call it for brevity heldengeschichte in future references to omit the hotham despatches we obtained the following shovelful of authentic particulars perhaps not quite insupportable to existing mankind  the exact size of the camp of radewitz i nowhere find measured but to judge on the map at p 214 it must have covered with its appendages some ten or twelve square miles of ground all on the elbe right bank of the elbe town of muhlberg chief town of the district lying some ten miles northwest then

kurfurst johann friedrich the magnanimous having been surprised the day before at public worship in the abovementioned town of muhlberg and completely beaten by kaiser karl the fifth and his spaniards and duke of alba did on monday 25th april 1547 ride forth as prisoner to meet the said kaiser and had the worst reception from him poor man take pity on me o god this is what it is come to the magnanimous beaten kurfurst was heard murmuring as he rode at sight of the kaiser he dismounted pulled off his ironplated gloves knelt and was for humbly taking the kaisers hand to kiss it kaiser would not kaiser looked thunderous tornado on him with hands rigidly in the vertical direction the magnanimous kurfurst arose therefore doffed his hat greatmightiest grossmachtigster allgracious

devotion in cheap countries of agreeable climate see pollnitz  memoirs c whoever is curious about her  crownprince friedrich doubtless looking at this flowerbed of human nature and the reward of happy daring paid by beauty has vivid images of princess amelia and her viceregency of hanover bright princess and viceregency divided from him by bottomless gulfs which need such a swim as that of leander across the material hellespont was but a trifle toin which of the villages hotham and dickens lodged i did not learn or inquire nor are their copious despatches chronicling these sublime phenomena from day to day for behoof of st jamess other than entirely inane to us at this time but one thing we do learn from them our crownprince escaping the paternal vigilance was secretly in consultation with dickens or with hotham through dickens and this in the most tragic humor on his side in such effulgences of luxury and scenic grandeur how sad an attendant is black carenay foul misusage not to be borne by human nature accurate professor ranke has read somewheredoes not comfortably say where nor comfortably give the least datethis passage or what authorizes him to write it in that pleasurecamp of muhlberg where the eyes of so many strangers were directed to him the crownprince was treated like a disobedient boy and one time even with strokes korperlich misshandelt to make him feel he was only considered as such the enraged king who never weighed the consequences of his words added mockery to his manual outrage he said had i been treated so by my father i would have blown my brains out but this fellow has no honor he takes all that comes ranke neun bucher preussischer geschichte berlin 1847 i 297 einmal korperlich misshandelt why did not the professor give us time occasion circumstances and name of some eyewitness for the fact which stands reported in the like fashion in all manner of histories we shall otherwise find to be abundantly certain and it produced conspicuous definite results it is as it were the one fact still worth human remembrance in this expensive radewitz and its fooleries and is itself left in that vague inert stateirremediable at present  beaten like a slave while lodged while figuring about like a royal highness in this sumptuous manner it appears clearly the poor prince did hereupon in spite of his word given to wilhelmina make up his mind to run ingenious ranke forgetting again to date knows from the archives that friedrich went shortly afterwards to call on graf von hoym one day speaking to graf von hoym who is saxon firstminister and factotum of the arrangements here he took occasion cursorily to ask could not a glimpse of leipzig among all these fine things be had order for horses to or at leipzig for a couple of officers lieutenant keith and selfquietly without fuss of passes and the like herr grafthe herr graf glances into it with eyes which have a twinkle in them schwerlich royal highness they are very strict about passes do not try it royal highness ranke ib forster i 365 and more especially iii 4 seckendorfs narrative there and friedrich did desist in that direction poor youth but tried it the more in others very busy in deep secrecy corresponding with lieutenant katte at berlin consulting tragically with captain guy dickens herewhether any hint or whisper came to the prussian majesty from graf von hoym lieutenant keith was shortly after sent to wesel to mind his soldiering there far down the rhine country in the garrison of wesel wilhelmina told us lately supra p 149 keith had been sent to wesel but she has misdated as usual better there than colleaguing with a fritz and suggesting to him idle truancies or worse  with katte at berlin the desperate prince has concocted another scheme of flight this hoym one being impossible scheme executable by katte and him were this radewitz once over and as for his consultations with guy dickens the result of them is captain dickens on the 16th of june with eyes brisk enough and lips well shut sets out from radewitz express for london this is what i read as abstract of hothams despatch 16th june 1730 which dickens is to deliver with all caution at st jamess crownprince has communicated to dickens his plan of escape could no longer bear the outrages of his father is to attend his father to anspath shortly journey to the reich of which we shall hear anon and they are to take a turn to stuttgard which latter is not very far from strasburg on the french side of the rhine to strasburg he will make his escape stay six weeks or a couple of months that his mother be not suspected and will then proceed to england hopes england will take such measures as to save his sister from ruin these are his fixed resolutions what will england do in such abstruse casecaptain dickens speeds silently with his despatch will find lord harrington not townshend any more resigned 15th may 1730 despatch to hotham as farewell of that date will copiously open his lips to harrington on matters prussian a brisk military man in the prime of his years who might do as prussian envoy himself if nothing great were going on harringtons final response will take some deliberating  hotham meanwhile resumes his report as we too must do of the scenic exhibitionsand we can well fancy is getting weary of it wishing to be home rather as his business here seems ended preceding despatch of 16th june one day he mentions a rumor inane high rumors being prevalent in such a place rumor circulated here to which i do not give the slightest credit that the princeroyal of prussia is to have one of the archduchesses perhaps maria theresa herself which might indeed have saved immensities of trouble to the whole world as well as to the pair in question and have made a very different history for germany and the rest of us fancy it but for many reasons change of religion had there been no other it was an impossible notion may be thinks hotham that the court of vienna throws out this bait to continue the kings delusionor a snuffle from seckendorf without the court may have given it currency in so inane an element as radewitz  of the terrific shambattles conducted by weissenfels on one side and wackerbarth on the other of the charges of cavalry play of artillery threatening to end in a very doomsday round the pavilion and the ladies and the royalties assembled on the balconies there who always go to dinner safe when victory has declared itself i shall say nothing nor of that supreme attack on the intrenchments blowingup of the very bridges cavalry posted in the woods host doing its very uttermost against host with unheardof expenditure of gunpowder and learned manoeuvre in which the fleet of shallops on the elbe rigged mostly in silk took part and the bucentaur with all its cannon words fail on such occasions i will mention only that assiduous king august had arranged everything like the king of playhousemanagers was seen early in the morning driving his own curricle all about in vigilant supervision and inspection crossed the tubbridge or perhaps the floatbridge not yet blown up in a wurstwagen giving himself what proved well founded the assurance of success for this great dayand finally that on the morrow there occurred an illumination and display of fireworks the like of which is probably still a desideratum  for the bucentaur and fleet were all hung with colored lamplets headquarters hauptlager and armylager ditto ditto gleaming upwards with their golden light into the silver of the summer twilightand all this is still nothing to the scene there is across the elbe on our southeast corner you behold that palace of the genii wings turrets mainbody battlements it is a gigantic wooden frame on which two hundred carpenters have been busy for above six months ever since christmas last two hundred carpenters and how many painters i cannot say but they have smeared six thousand yards of linen canvas which is now nailed up hung with lamps begirt with fireworks no end of rocketserpents catherinewheels with cannon and fieldmusic near and far to correspondand is now evening of the 24th june 1730 shining to men and gods pinnacles turrets tablatures tipt with various fires and emblems all is there  small map in heremissing  symbolic painting six hundred yards of it glowing with inner light and legible to the very owls arms now piled useless pax with her appurtenances mars resting in that canvas on trophies of laurel honorably won and there is an inscription done in lamplets every letter taller than a man were you close upon it sic fulta manebit thus supported it will standthe it being either pax peace or domus the geniipalace itself as your weak judgment may lead you to interpret delicate allusions every letter bigger than a man it may be read almost at wittenberg i should think flaming as pica written on the sky from the steepletops there thus supported it will stand and pious mortals murmur hope so i am sureand the cannons fire almost without ceasing and the fieldmusic guided by telegraphs bursts over all the scene at due moments and the catherinewheels fly hissing and the bucentaur and silk brigantines glide about like living flambeausand in fact you must fancy such a sight king august tired to the bone and seeing all successful retired about midnight friedrich wilhelm stood till the finale saxon crownprince and he in a window of the highest house in promnitz our young fritz and the margraf of anspach they also in a neighboring window 24th25th june heldengeschichte above spoken of i 200 stood till the finale two in the morning when the very sun was not far from rising  or is not the ultimate closing day perhaps still notabler a day of universal eating debauchee king august had a touch of genuine human goodhumor in him poor devil and had the best of stomachs eighty oxen fat as christmas were slain and roasted subsidiary viands i do not count that all the world might have one good dinner the soldiers divided into proper sections had cut trenches raised flat mounds laid planks and so by trenching and planking had made at once table and seat wood well secured on turf at the end of every table rose a triglyph two strong wooden posts with lintel on the lintel stood spiked the oxs head oxs hide hanging beneath it as drapery and on the two sides of the two posts hung free the four roasted quarters of said ox from which the common man joyfully helped himself three measures of beer he had and two of winewhich unless the measures were miraculously small we may take to be abundance thus they in two long rows 30000 of them by the tale dine joyfully sub dio the two majesties and two crownprinces rode through the ranks as dinner went on king of prussia forever and caps into the airat length they retire to their own hauptquartier where themselves dining they can still see the soldiers dine or at least drink their three measures and two dine yea dine abundantly let all mortals have one good dinner  royal dinner is not yet done when a new miracle appears on the field the largest cake ever baked by the sons of adam drawn into the headquarter about an hour ago on a wooden frame with tent over it by a team of eight horses tent curtaining it guarded by cadets now the tent is struck and offsaw mortals ever the like it is fourteen ells kleine ellen long by six broad and at the centre half an ell thick baked by machinery how otherwise could peel or roller act on such a cake there are five thousand eggs in it thirtysix bushels berlin measure of sound flour one tun of milk one tun of yeast one ditto of butter crackers gingerbreadnuts for fillet or trimming run all round plainly the prince of cakes a carpenter with gigantic knife handle of it resting on his shoulderhead of the board of works giving word of commandenters the cake by incision cuts it up by plan by successive signal from the board of works what high person would not keep for himself to say nothing of eating some fraction of such a nonpareil there is cut and come again for all carpenter advances by main trench and by side trenches steadily to word of command  i mention as another trait of the poor devil of an august full of goodhumor after all that he and his royalties and big lordships having dined he gave the still groaning table with all its dishes to be scrambled for by the janizaries janizaries imitationturk valetaille who speedily made clearancemany a bit of precious meissen porcelain going far down in society by that means  royal dinner done the colonel and officers of every regiment ranked in high order with weapons drawn preceded by their respective bands of music came marching up the hill to pay their particular respects to the majesty of prussia majesty of prussia promised them his favor everlasting as requested drank a glass of wine to each party steady your majesty who all responded by glasses of wine and threw the glasses aloft with shouts sixty pieces of artillery speaking the while and the bands of music breathing their sweetesttill it was done and his majesty still steady on his feet he could stand a great deal of wine  and now well the cake is not done many cubic yards of cake are still left and the very corporals can do no more let the army scramble army whipt it away in no time and now alas nowthe time is come for parting it is ended all things end not for about an hour could the herrschaften lordships and minor sovereignties fairly tear themselves away under wailing music and with the due emotion  the prussian royalties and select few took boat down the river on the morrow towards lichtenburg huntingpalace for one days slaughtering of game they slaughtered there about one thousand living creatures all driven into heaps for themsix hundred of red game of the stag species four hundred black or of the boar ditto they left all these creatures dead dined immensely then did go sorrowfully sated crownprince friedrich in his own carriage in the rear papa in his preceding by a few minutes all the wood horns or french horns wailing sad adieuand hurried towards berlin through the ambrosial night 28th june 1730 heldengeschichte i 205  and so it is all ended and august the strongwhat shall we say of august history must admit that he attains the maximum in several things maximum of physical strength can break horseshoes nay halfcrowns with finger and thumb maximum of sumptuosity really a polite creature no man of his means so regardless of expense maximum of bastards three hundred and fiftyfour of them probably no mortal ever exceeded that quantity lastly he has baked the biggest bannock on record cake with 5000 eggs in it and a tun of butter these things history must concede to him poor devil he was full of goodhumor too and had the best of stomachs his amputated greattoe does not mend out upon it the world itself is all so amputated and not like mending august the strong dilapidated at fiftythree is fast verging towards a less expensive country and in three years hence will be lodged gratis and need no cook or flunky of either sex  this camp of radewitz says smelfungus one of my antecessors finishing his long narrative of it this camp is nothing and after all this expense of king augusts and mine it flies away like a dream but alas were the congresses of cambrai and soissons was the lifelong diplomacy of kaiser karl or the history of torpid moribund europe in those days much of a something the pragmatic sanction with all its protocolling has fled like the temporary playhouse of king august erected there in the village of strohme much talk noise and imaginary interest about both but both literally have become zero were always zero as well talk about the one as the otherthen why not silence about both my friend smelfnngus he answers that truly is the thing to be aimed atand if we had once got our own out of both let both be consumed with fire and remain a handful of inarticulate black ashes forevermore heavens will i of all men object  smelfungus says elsewhere  the moral to be derived perhaps the chief moral visible at present from all this section of melancholy history is modern diplomacy is nothing mind well your own affairs leave those of your neighbors well alone the pragmatic sanction breaking fritzs friedrich wilhelms sophies wilhelminas english amelias and i know not how many private hearts and distracting with vain terrors and hopes the general soul of europe for fiveandtwenty years fell at once into dust and vapor and went wholly towards limbo on the stormwinds doing nothing for or against any mortal friedrich wilhelms 80000 welldrilled troops remained very actual with their firelocks and iron ramrods and did a thing or two there being a captain over them friedrich wilhelms directorium welldrilled prussian downing street every man steady at his duty and no wind to be wasted where silence was better did likewise very authentically remainand still remains nothing of genuine and human that friedrich wilhelm did but remained and remains an inheritance not the smallest item of it lost or losableand the rude foolish boorking singular enough is found to be the only one that has gained by the game     chapter iv  excellency hotham quits berlin in haste  while the camp at radewitz is dissolving itself in this manner in the last days of june captain guy dickens the oracles at windsor having given him their response as to prince friedrichs wild project is getting under way for berlin againwhither also hotham has returned to wait for dickenss arrival and directly thereupon come home dickens is henceforth to do the british diplomacy here any diplomacy there can well be dickens once installed hotham will right gladly wash his hands of this negotiation which he considers to be as good as dead for a longish while past first however he has one unexpected adventure to go through in berlin of most unexpected celebrity in the world this once succinctly set forth history will dismiss him to the shades of private life  guy dickens arriving we can guess about the 8th or 9th of july brings two important documents with him to berlin first the english response in the shape of instructions to himself which may be ostensible in the proper quarter in regard to the crownprinces project of flight into england response which is no other than might have been expected in the circumstances britannic majesty sorry extremely for the crownprinces situation ready to do anything in reason to alleviate it better wait however prussian majesty will surely perhaps relent a little then also the affairs of europe are in a ticklish state better wait as to that of taking temporary refuge in france britannic majesty thinks that will require a mature deliberation mure deliberation not even time now for inquiry of the french court how they would take it which his britannic majesty thinks an indispensable preliminaryand so terminates the meaning we perceive is in sum hm you wont surely dont at least dont yet but dryasdust and any readers who have patience can here take the original paper which is written in french or french of stratford at the bow probably that the crownprince if needful might himself read it one of these days  monsieur guy dickens pourrait donner au prince les assurances les plus fortes de la compassion que le roi a du triste etat ou il se trouve et du desir sincere de sa majeste de concourir par tout ce qui dependra delle a len tirer m guy dickens pourrait lui communiquer en meme terns les instructions donnees a monsieur hotham our answer to the outrageous propositions which amounts to nothing and may be spared the reader et lui marquer quon avait lieu desperer que sa majeste prussienne ne refuserait pas au moins de sexpliquer un peu plus en detail quelle na fait jusquici quen attendant les suites que cette negociation pourrait avoir sa majeste etait davis que le prince ferait bien de differer un peu lexecution de son dessein connu que la situation ou les affaires de leurope se trouvaient dans ce moment critique ne paraissait pas propre a lexecution dun dessein de cette nature que pour ce qui est de lintention ou le prince a temoigne etre de se retirer en france sa majeste croit quelle demande une mure deliberation et que le peu de tems qui reste ne promet pas meme quon puisse sinformer de ce que la cour de france pourrait penser ladessus dont sa majeste trouvait cependant absolument necessaire de lassurer avant de pouvoir conseiller a un prince qui lui est si cher de se retirer en ce pays la prussian despatches vol xii no date or signature bound up along with harringtons despatch windsor 20th june 1st july 1730on the morrow of which day we may fancy captain dickens took the road for berlin againwhere we auspiciously see him on monday 10th july probably a night or two after his arrival this is document first of no concernment to hotham at this stage but only to us and our crownprince document second would at one time have much interested hotham it is no other than a grumkow original seized at st mary axe such as hotham once solicited strong enough to break grumkows back hotham now scarcely hopes it will be strong enough no matter he presents it as bidden on introducing dickens as successor monday 10th july he puts the document into his prussian majestys hand andthe result was most unexpected here is hothams despatch to lord harrington which it will be our briefest method to give with some minimum of needful explanation intercalated here and there   to the lord harrington from sir charles hotham  berlin 30th june 11th july 1730  my lordthough the conduct of his prussian majesty has been such for some time past that one ought to be surprised at nothing he doesit is nevertheless with great concern that i now have to acquaint your lordship with an extravagancy of his which happened yesterday monday 10th july 1730  the king of prussia had appointed me to be with him about noon with captain guy dickens who has just returned from england on what secret message your lordship knowswe both attended his prussian majesty and i presented captain guy dickens to him who delivered his credentials after which the king talked to us a quarter of an hour about indifferent matters seeing him in a very good humor i took that opportunity of telling him that as general grumkow had denied his having held a secret correspondence with reichenbach or having written the letters i had some time ago delivered to his majesty i was now ordered by the king my master to put into his hands an original letter of general grumkowwhere is that original letter ask some minute readers minute readers the ipsissimum corpus of it is lost to mankind official copy of it lies safe here in the statepaper office prussian despatches volume xli without date of its own but near a despatch dated 20th june 1730 has adjoined to it an autograph jotting by george second to the effect yes send it and also some preliminary scribbles by newcastle to the like purport no date of its own we say though by internal evidence and light of fassmann p 404 it is conclusively datable berlin 20th may if anybody cared to date it the letter mentions lightly that pretended discovery the stmaryaxe one laid on the table of tobaccoparliament 6th may or soon after innocent trifles all i wrote hope you burnt them nevertheless according to promise yours to me i did burn as they came and will defy the devil to produce brags of his majestys fine spiritsand is jotting and all as insignificant a letter as any other portion of the rookery colloquy though its fate was a little more distinguished prussian dryasdust is expected to give it in facsimile one daysurely no british undersecretary will exercise an unwise discretion and forbid him that small pleasurewhich was an undeniable proof of all the rest and could not but convince his prussian majesty of the truth of themwell  he took the letter from me cast his eye upon it and seeing it to be grumkows hand said to me with all the anger imaginable fancy the thunderburst messieurs jai eu assez de ces choses la threw the letter upon the ground and immediately turning his back went out of the room and shut the door upon usprobably with a slam and that is the naked truth concerning this celebrated intercepted letter majesty answered explosivelyhis poor heart being in a burdened and grieved condition not unlike growing a haunted onei have had enough of that stuff before pitched the new specimen away and stormily whirled out with a slam of the door that he stamped with his foot is guessable that he lifted his foot as if to kick the honorable english excellency wilhelmina i 228 which the english excellency never could have stood but must have died on the spotof this though several books have copied it from wilhelmina there is no vestige of evidence and the case is bad enough without this  your lordship will easily imagine that captain guy dickens and i were not a little astonished at this most extraordinary behavior i took up the letter he had thrown upon the floor ipsissimum corpus of it lost to mankind last seen going into hothams pocket in this manner and returning home immediately wrote one to his prussian majesty of which a copy is here enclosedlet us read that essential piece sound substance in very stiff indifferent french of stratfordwhich may as well be made english at once   to his majesty the king of prussia  sireit is with the liveliest grief that i find myself under the necessityafter what has passed today at the audience i had of your majesty where i neither did nor said anything in regard to that letter of monsieur grumkows or to putting it into your majestys hands that was not by my masters orderit is i say sire with the liveliest grief that i am obliged to inform your majesty of the necessity there lies on me to despatch a courier to london to apprise the king my master of an incident so surprising as the one that has just happened for which reason i beg supplie your majesty will be pleased to cause the necessary orders for posthorses to be furnished me not only for the said courier but also for myselfsince after what has just happened it is not proper for me to prolong my stay here faire un plus long sejour ici  i have the honor to be your majestys c c c  charles hotham   about two hours afterwards general borck came to me and told me he was in the utmost affliction for what had happened and beseeched me to have a little patience and that he hoped means would be found to make up the matter to me afterwards he communicated to me by word of mouth the answer the king of prussia had given to the last orders i had received by captain guy dickensorders come home immediately to which the answer is conceivable  i told him that after the treatment i had received at noon and the affront put upon the king my masters character i could no longer receive nor charge myself with anything that came from his prussian majesty that as to what related to me personally it was very easily made up but having done nothing but in obedience to the king my masters orders it belonged to him only to judge what satisfaction was due for the indignity offered to his character wherefore i did not look upon myself as authorized to listen to any expedients till i knew his majestys pleasure upon the matter  in the evening general borck wrote a letter to captain guy dickens and two to me the copies of which are enclosedfear not reader the purport of them was to desire that i would take no farther notice of what had happened and that the king of prussia desired i would come and dine with him next dayengaged otherwise your majesty next day the answer to these letters i also enclose to your lordshipreader not to be troubled with it i excused myself from dining with the king of prussia not thinking myself at liberty to appear any more at court till i received his majestys my own kings commands and told general borck that i looked upon myself as indispensably obliged to acquaint the king my master with everything that had passed it being to no purpose to think of concealing it since the thing was already become public and would soon be known in all the courts of europe  this my lord is the true state of this unaccountable accident you will see by general borcks letter that the king of prussia being now returned to his senses is himself convinced of the extravagancy of this proceeding and was very desirous of having it concealedwhich was impossible for the whole town knew it an hour after it had happened  as to my own part i am not a little concerned at this unfortunate incident as it was impossible to foresee this fit of madness in the king of prussia there was no guarding against it and after it had happened i thought i could do no less than resent it in the manner i have donewithout prostituting the character with which the king has been pleased to honor me i hope however this affair will be attended with no ill consequences for the king of prussia himself is at present so ashamed of his behavior that he says he will order count degenfeld graf von degenfeld going at a leisurely pace to remove nosti from his perch among you supra p 197 to hasten his journey to england with orders to endeavor to make up the affair immediately  as i had already received the kings orders by captain guy dickens to return home forthwith i thought after what had happened the sooner i left this place the better and the rather because it might be proper i should make a report of it to his majesty i shall therefore set out a few hours after this messenger and will make all the expedition possible  the king of prussia sets out for anspach on saturday next11th july is tuesday saturday next will be 15th july which proves correct fassmann p 410 i am with the utmost respect my lord your lordships most obedient and most humble servant  charles hotham  statepaper office prussian despatches vol xli no sooner was the door slammed to than his majesty began to repent at sight of the demand for posthorses he repented bitterly sent borck to ask hotham to dinner with what success we have seen sent borck to negotiate to correspond to consult with dickens to do his utmost in pacifying hotham all which correspondence exists but is not worth giving borcks remonstrances are in rugged soldierlike style full of earnestness and friendliness do not wreck upon trifles a noble interest we have in common king is jealous about foreign interference with his ministers but meant nothing i tell you it is nothing ihotham is polite goodtempered but remains inflexible with myself on my own score it were soon settled or is already settled but with the king my masterno expedient but posthorses the diplomatist world of berlin is in a fuss queen sophie and the minister of denmark with other friendly ministers how busy all day this day and the next they spent in comings and goings wilhelmina i 229 230 advising hotham to relent hotham could not relent the crownprince himself writes urged by a message from his mother crownprince sends katte off from potsdam with this billet ib i 230 if this be a correct copy to translate from   to his excellency monsieur the chevalier hotham  potsdam 11th july 1730  monsieurhaving learned by m de leuvener the danish minister a judicious wellaffected man what the king my fathers ultimate intentions are i cannot doubt but you will yield to his desires think monsieur that my happiness and my sisters depend on the resolution you shall take and that your answer will mean the union or the disunion forever of the two houses i flatter myself that it will be favorable and that you will yield to my entreaties i never shall forget such a service but recognize it all my life by the most perfect esteem with which i now am tout a vous  frederic   this billet katte delivers but to this also hotham remains inexorable polite hopeful even no harm will come degenfeld will go i myself will help when at home but for the present no resource but posthorses which they at last yield him the very posthorses ready to weep  and so hotham spirited judicious english gentleman rolls off homewards wednesday 12th dickens a few hours after his courierand retires honorably into the shades of private life steady there thenceforth he has not been successful in berlin surely his negotiation is now out in all manner of senses long ago to use our former ignoble figure he had laid down the bellows though there was still smoke traceable but now by this grumkow letter he has as it were struck the poker through the business and that dangerous manoeuvre not proving successful has been fatal and final queen sophie and certain others may still flatter themselves but it is evident the negotiation is at last complete what may lie in flight to england and rash desperate measures which queen sophie trembles to think of we do not know but by regular negotiation this thing can never be  it is darkly apprehended the crownprince still meditates flight the maternal heart and wilhelminas are grieved to see lieutenant katte so much in his confidencecould wish him a wiser councillor in such predicaments and emergencies katte is greatly flattered by the princes confidence even brags of it in society with his foolish loose tongue poor youth he is of dissolute ways has plenty of it unwise intellect little of the wise kind and is still under the years of discretion towards wilhelmina there is traceable in him somethingsomething as of almost loving a bright particular star or of thriceprivately worshipping it for his own behoof and wilhelmina during the late radewitz time when mamma gave four apartments or royal soirees weekly was severe upon him and inaccessible in these court soirees a rash young fool carries a loose tonguestill worse has a miniature recognizable as wilhelmina and would not give it up either for the queens majesty or methousand and thousand pardons high ladies both my loose tongue shall be locked but these two miniatures the prince and princess royal i copied them from two the prince had lent me and has got back ask me not for thesenever oh i cannot everupon which wilhelmina had to take a high attitude and pass him speechless in the soirees the foolish fellowand yet one is not heartily angry either only reserved in the soirees and anxious about ones brother in such hands  friedrich wilhelm repents much that hotham explosion is heard saying that he will not again treat in person with any envoy from foreign parts being of too hot temper but will leave his ministers to do it dickenss despatch berlin 22d july ns 1730 to queen sophie he says coldly wilhelminas marriage then is off an end to it abbess of herford good protestant refuge for unprovided females of quality which is in our gift let her be abbess thereand writes to the then extant abbess to make wilhelmina coadjutress or heirapparent to that chiefnunship nay what is still more mortifying my brother says on the whole i had better had not i the cruel brother but indeed the desperatefor things are mounting to a pitch in this household  queen sophies thoughtsthey are not yet of surrender that they will never be while a breath of life is left to queen sophie and her project we may fancy queen sophies mood nor can his majesty be in a sweet temper his vexations lately have been many first england is now off not offandon as formerly that comfortable possibility hanging always in ones thoughts is fairly gone and now we have nothing but the kaiser to depend on for julich and berg and the other elements of our salvation in this world then the stmaryaxe discoveries harassing shadows of suspicion that will rise from them and the unseemly hotham catastrophe and ones own blame in it womankind and household still virtually rebellious and all things going awry majesty is in the worst humorbullies and outrages his poor crownprince almost worse than ever there have been rattanshowers hideous to think of descending this very week guy dickenss despatch 18th july 1730 on the fine head and far into the high heart of a royal young man who cannot in the name of manhood endure and must not in the name of sonhood resist and vainly calls to all the gods to teach him what he shall do in this intolerable inextricable state of matters  fate and these two blackartists have driven friedrich wilhelm nearly mad and he in turn is driving everybody so he more than suspects friedrich of an intention to fly which is horrible to friedrich wilhelm and yet he bullies him occasionally as a spiritless wretch for bearing such treatment cannot you renounce the heirapparentship then your little brother is a fine youth give it up and go unmolested to thein fact to the devil cannot youif your majesty against the honor of my mother declare that i am not your eldest son yes so not otherwise ever modestly but steadily persists the young man whenever this expedient is proposed to himas perhaps it already sometimes is whereat the desperate father can only snort indignantly futile a case growing nearly desperate desperate yes on all hands unless one had the high mast above alluded to with two pulleys and ropes and could see a certain pair of scoundrels mount rapidly thither what hope is there for anybody a violent crisis does not last however that is one certainty in it either these agonistic human beings young and old will all die all go to bedlam with their intolerable woes or else something of explosive nature will take place among them the maddest boil unless it kill you with its torments does at length burst and become an abscess  of course captain dickens the instant hotham was gone hastened privily to see the crownprince saw katte and him at the gate of the potsdam palace at midnight wilhelmina ranke i 301 or in some other less romantic wayread him the windsor paper of instructions known to us and preached from that text no definite countenance from england the reverse rather your highness seeshow can there be give it up your highness at least delay itcrownprince does not give it up a whit whether he delays it we shall see  a busy week for the crownprince and katte this of the hotham catastrophe who have many consultations the journey to anspach being on saturday next crownprince has given him in keeping a writingcase with private letters 1000 ducats of money money raised by loan by picking jewels off some miniatures of honor and the like sore methods katte has his very coat a gray topcoat or travelling roquelaure in keepingand their schemes are many off we must and will be by some opportunity could not katte get a recruiting furlough leave to go into the reich on that score and join one there lieutenant keith is at wesel ready always ready into france into holland england if the english would notthere is war to be in italy say all the newspapers why not a campaign as volunteers in italy till we saw how matters went anything and all things are preferable to ignominy like this no dog could endure it     chapter v  journey to the reich  on saturday the 15th july 1730 early in the morning as his wont was friedrich wilhelm with a small train of official military persons rolled off from potsdam towards leipzig on that same journey of his towards anspach and the reich to anspach to see our poor young daughter lately married there therefrom we can have a run into the reich according to circumstances in this wide route there lie many courts and scenes which it might behoove us to look into courts needing to be encouraged to stand for the kaisers rights against those english french and intrusive foreigners of the seville treaty we may hope at least to ease our own heavy mind and have the chaff somewhat blown out of it by this rushing through the open atmospheresuch so far as i can gather were friedrich wilhelms objects in this journey which turned out to be a more celebrated one than he expected the authentic records of it are slight the rumors about it have been many forster iii 111 contains seckendorfs narrative as sent to vienna preuss iv 470 a prussian relatio ex actis these are the only two original pieces which i have seen excerpts of others correct doubtless but not in a very distinct condition occur in ranke i 294340 after painful sifting through mountains of dust and ashes for a poor cinder of a fact here and there our duty is to tell the english reader one good time what certainties or available cinders have anywhere turned up crownprince friedrich it has been decided after some consultation shall go with his majesty better he go with us to be under our own eyes lest he run away or do other mischief old general buddenbrock old colonel waldau and lieutenantcolonel rochow travel in the same carriage with the prince are to keep a strict watch over him one of them at least to be always by him old general buddenbrock a grim but human old military gentleman who has been in all manner of wars he fought at steenkirk even and in the siege of namur under dutch william stood through malplaquet and much else under marlborough did the siege of stralsund too and descent on rugen there which was not his first acquaintance with karl of sweden and is a favorite old friend of friedrich wilhelms a good old gentleman though very strict now hard on sixty he is chief of the three  old waldau not younger though still only colonel of horse likewise celebrates the malplaquet anniversary a pomeranian man and silent smoker in the tabagie well seen by the master there to these two elderly authorities lieutenantcolonel rochow still only about forty and probably sharper of eye is adjoined as active partner i conclude the prince and buddenbrock ride face forward buddenbrock can tell him about so many things if he is conversable about dutch william about charles xii whose polish fights he witnessed as an envoy from berlin long ago a colonel krocher i find is general manager of the journeyand it does not escape notice that friedrich probably out of youthful curiosity seems always very anxious to know to the uttermost settled point where our future stages are to be his royal highness laid in a fair stock of district maps especially of the rhine countries at leipzig too forster iii 2 and is assiduous in studying themevidently very desirous to know the face of germany the rhine countries in particular  potsdam wittenberg leipzig the wheels rush rapidly on stage succeeding stage and early in the afternoon we are at leipzignever looking out at luthers vestiges or karl vs or thinking about luther which thou and i good english reader would surely have done in crossing wittenberg and the birthplace of protestantism at leipzig we were thinking to have dined at the peters gate therewhere at least fresh horses are and a topographic crownprince can send hastily to buy mapsa general hopfgarten commandant of the town is out with the military honors he has as we privately know an excellent dinner ready in the pleissenburg fortress yonder fassmann p 410but he compliments to a dreadful extent harangues and compliments in no end of florid inflated tautologic ornamental balderdash repeating and again repeating what a neverimagined honor it is in particular saying three times over how the majesty of saxony king august had he known would have wished for wings to fly hither and bowing to the very ground as if in the polish manner he wished to clasp your feet said friedrich wilhelm afterwards i can fancy friedrich wilhelm somewhat startled how at the first mention of this idea of big august with his lame foot taking wing and coming like a gigantic partridge with lame foot and cockedhat friedrich wilhelm grinned how at the second mention and polish threat of your feet friedrich wilhelm who hates all lies and cares not for salutations in the marketplace jerks himself impatiently and saves his feet at the third mention clear it is friedrich wilhelm utters the word anspannen horsesand in very truth takes to the road again hungry indeed but still angrier leaving hopfgarten bent into the shape of a parabola and his grand dinner cooling futile in what tragic humor we can imagine ib p 411 why has no prussian painter done that scene let another chodowiecki when another comes try whether he cannot  friedrich wilhelm regretted the dinner regretted to hurt the good mans feelings but could stand it no longer he rushes off for meuselwitz where seckendorf with at least silence and some cold collation instead of dinner is awaiting him twenty miles off is meuselwitz up the flat valley of the pleisse river towards altenburg through a region memorable were we not so hungry famed fights have had their arena here lutzen the top of its churchsteeple visible on your right it is there where the great gustavus fell two hundred years ago on that wide champaign a kind of bullring of the nations how many fights have been and will be altenburg one does not see tonight happy were we but at meuselwitz a few miles nearer and had seen what dinner the old feldzeugmeister has  dinner enough we need not doubt the old feldzeugmeister has a big line schloss at meuselwitz his by unexpected inheritance with uncommonly fine gardens with a good old wife moreover blithe though childlessand he is capable of lighting more than one candle when a king comes to visit him doubtless the man hurls his thrift into abeyance and blazes out with conspicuous splendor on this occasion a beautiful castle indeed this meuselwitz of his the towers of altenburg visible in the distance altenburg where kunz von kauffungen stole the two little princes centuries agowhere we do not mean to pause at this time on the morrow morningunless they chose to stay over sunday which i cannot affirm or denyseckendorf also has made his packages and joins himself to friedrich wilhelms august travelling party doing here a portion of the long space length of the terrestrial equator in all which he is fated to accomplish in the way of riding with that monarch  from meuselwitz through altenburg gera saalfeld to coburg is our next days journey up one fork of the leipzig pleisse then across the leipzig elster these streams now dwindling to brooks leading us up to the watershed or central hillcountries between the mayn and saale rivers where the same shower will run partly on this hand northward by the elster pleisse or other labyrinthic course into the saale into the elbe and partly on the other hand will flow southward into the mayn and so after endless windings in the fir mountains fichtelgebirge get by frankfurt into the rhine at mainz mayn takes the south end of your shower saale takes the northor farther east yonder shower will roll down into the same grand elbe river by the mulde over which the old dessauer is minded to build a new stone bridge wallenstein and others as well as time have ruined many bridges there that is the line of the primeval mountains and their everflowing raincourses in those parts  at gera dim old towndoes not your royal highness well know the gera bond geraische vertrag duhan did not forget to inform you of that it is the cornerstone of the house of brandenburgs advancement in the world here by your august ancestors the law of primogeniture was settled and much rubbish was annihilated in the house of brandenburg eldest son always to inherit the electorate unbroken after anspach and baireuth no more apanages upon any cause or pretext whatsoever and these themselves to lapse irrevocable to the main or electoral house should they ever fall vacant again fine fruit of the decisive sense that was in the hohenzollerns of their fine talent for annihilating rubbishwhich feat if a man can do it and keep doing it will more than most others accelerate his course in this world it was in this dim old town of gera in the year 1598 by him that had the twentythree children that the gera bond was brought to parchment but indeed it was intrinsically only a renewal more solemnly sanctioned of albert achilless haus ordnung houseorder done in 1478 above a century earlier  but see we are under way again his prussian majesty rushes forward without pause will stop nowhere except where business demands no majesty of his day travels at such a speed orlamunde an hour henceyour royal highness has heard of orlamunde and its famed counts of a thousand years back when kaiser redbeard was in the world and the junior hohenzollern tired of hawking came down from the hills to him orlamunde orlamouth is not far off on our right and this itself is the orla this pleasant streamlet we are now quitting which has borne us company for some time this too will get into the saale and be at magdeburg quite beyond the dessauers bridge early tomorrow ha here at last is saalfeld town and schloss and the incipient saal itself his serene highness saalfeldcoburgs little rezidenzprobably his majesty will call on him in passing i have no doubt he does and transacts the civilities needful  christian ernst whose schloss this is a gentleman of his majestys age born 1683 married an amiable fraulein not of quality whom indeed the kaiser has ennobled he lives herei think courting the shade rather and rules conjointly with his younger brother or halfbrother franz josias who resides at coburg dukes of saalfeldcoburg such is their style and in good part their possession though it is well known to this travelling party and the world there has been a lawsuit about coburg this halfcentury and more and though somewhere about 200 conclusa michaelis i 524 518 busching erdbeschreibung  vi 2464 oertel t 74 hubner t 166 or decrees

or what he spakeexcept perhaps encourage christian ernst to stand by a kaisers majesty against these french insolences and the native german spanish english derelictions of dutywe are left to the vaguest guess of fancy and must get on to coburg for the night  at coburg in its snug valley under the festung or hill castlewhere martin luther sat solitary during the diet of augsburg diet known to us our old friend margraf george of anspach hypothetically laying his head on the block there and the great kaiser karl v practically burning daylight with pitiable spilling of wax in the corpuschristi procession there antea vol v p 197where martin luther sat solitary and wrote that celebrated letter about 16 crows holding their parliament all round and how the pillars of the world were never seen by anybody and yet the world is held up in these dumb continents of spaceat coburg we will not doubt his majesty found franz josias at home and illuminated to receive him franz josias a hearty man of thirtyfive he too will stand by the kaiser in these coming storms with a weak contingent truly perhaps some score or two of fighters but many a little makes a mickleremark however two points of a merely genealogical nature first that franz josias has or rather is going to have a younger son friedrich josias 17371815 who in some sixty years hence will become dreadfully celebrated in the streets of paris as austrian coburg the austrian coburg of robespierre and company an immeasurable terror and portentnot much harm in him either when he actually comes with nothing but the duke of york and dunkirk for accompanimentto those revolutionary french of 17921794 this is point first point second is perhaps still more interesting this namely that franz josias has an eldest son boy of six when friedrich wilhelm makes his visita grandsons grandson of whom is at this day prince of wales among the english people and to me a subject of intense reflection now and then  from coburg friedrich wilhelm after pause again unknown rushed on to bamberg new scenes and ever new opening on the eyes of our young hero and his papa the course is down the valley of the itz one of the many little valleys in the big slope of the rodach for the waters are now turned and all streams and brooks are gurgling incessantly towards the mayn towards frankfurt mainz and the rhinefar enough from the saale mulde or the old dessauers bridge today towards rotterdam and the uttermost dutch swamps today near upon bamberg we cross the mayn itself red mayn and white conjoined coming from culmbach and baireuthmark that your highness a country of pleasant hills and vines and in an hour hence through thick fir woodseach side of your road horribly decked with gibbeted thieves swinging aloft pollnitz memoirs and letters english translation london 1745 i 209 let me say again this is a different book from the memoirs of pollnitz and a still different from the memoiren or memoirs of brandenburg by pollnitz such the excellence of nomenclature in that old foolyou arrive at bamberg chief of bishoprics the venerable town whose bishop famous in old times is like an archbishop and gets his pallium direct from the popemuch good may it do him is bound however to give up his territory if the kaiser elected is landlessfar enough from likely now and so you are at last fairly in the mayn valley river mayn itself a little step to northlong course and many wide windings between you and mainz or frankfurt not to speak of rotterdam and the ultimate dutch swamps  at bamberg why should a prussian majesty linger except for picturesque or for mere baiting purposes at bamberg are certain fat catholic canons in indolent opulent circumstances and a couple of sublime palaces without any bishop in them at present nor indeed does one much want papist bishops wherever they get their pallium of them as well keep to windward thinks his majesty and indeed there is no bishop here the present bishop of bambergone of those von schonborns counts sometimes cardinals common in that fat officeis a kaisers minister of state lives at vienna enveloped in red tape as well as red hat and stockings and needs no exhortation in the kaisers favor let us yoke again and gofir woods all round and dead malefactors blackening in the wind this latter point i know of the then bamberg and have explanation of it namely that the princebishop though a humane catholic is obliged to act so his small domain borders on some six or seven bigger sovereignties and being ecclesiastical is made a cesspool to the neighboring scoundrelism which state of things this prince bishop has said shall cease young friedrich may look therefore and old friedrich wilhelm and suite and make of it what they can  bamberg through erlangen to nurnberg so runs the way at erlangen there loiters now recruiting a certain rittmeister von katte cousin to our potsdam lieutenant and confidant to him this transit of the majesty and crownprince must be an event like few in that stagnant place french refugees are in erlangen busy building new straight streets no university as yetnay a high dowager of baireuth is in it somewhat exuberant lady friend weissenfelss sister on whom friedrich wilhelm must call in passing this high widow of baireuth is not mother of the present heirapparent there who will wed our wilhelmina one dayah no his mother was divorced for weighty reasonshubner t 181 and his father yet lives in the single state a comparatively prosperous gentleman these four years last past successor since four years past of this ladys husband who was his cousingerman dreadfully poor before that the present margraf of baireuth as we once explained but now things are looking up with him again some jingle of money heard in the coffers of the man and his eldest prince a fine young fellow only apt to stammer a little when agitated is at present doing the return part of the grand tourcoming home by geneva they say  rittmeister von katte i doubt not witnesses this transit of the incognito majesty this call upon the exuberant dowager but can have little to say to it he i hope he is getting tall recruits here in the reich that will be the useful point for him he is our lieutenant kattes cousin an elder and wiser man than the lieutenant a reichsgrafs and fieldmarshals nephew he ought to get advanced in his professionand can hope to do so when he has deserved it not sooner at all in that thricefortunate country let the rittmeister here keep himself well apart from what is not his business and look out for tall men  bamberg is halfwayhouse between coburg and nurnberg whole distance of coburg and nurnbergsay a hundred and odd milesis only a fair days driving for a rapid king and at nurnberg surely we must lodge for a night and portion of a day if not for more on the morrow it is but a thirtyfive miles drive to anspach pleasant in the summer evening after all the sights in this old nurnberg city of the noricans noricorum burgun trading staple of the german world in old days toyshop of the german world in these new albert durers and hans sachs citymortals infinitely indifferent to friedrich wilhelm but is it not the seedground of the hohenzollerns this nurnberg memorable above cities to a prussian majesty yes there in that old white castle now very peaceable they dwelt considerably liable to bickerings and mutinous heats and needed all their skill and strength to keep matters straight it is now upon seven hundred years since the cadet of hohenzollern gave his hawk the slip patted his dog for the last time and came down from the roughalp countries hitherward and found favor not unmerited i fancy with the great kaiser redbeard and the fair heiress of the vohburgs and in fact with the earth and with the heavens in some degree a loyal clever and gallant kind of young fellow if your majesty will think much has grown and waned since that time but the hohenzollerns ever since are on the waxing handunless this accursed treaty of seville and these english matches put a stop to them  alas it is not likely friedrich wilhelm in the hurry and grating whirl of things had many poetic thoughts in him or pious aurora memories from the past ages instead of grumbly dusty provocations from the presenthis feeling haste mainly and need of getting through the very crownprince i should guess was as good as indifferent to this antique cadet of the hohenzollerns and looked on nurnberg and the old white castle with little but ennui the princess of england and black cares on her beautiful account and his own possess him too exclusively but in truth we do not even know what day they arrived or departed much less what they did or felt in that old city we know only that the pleasant little town of anspach with its huge unfinished schloss lay fiveandthirty miles away and that thither was the next and quasifinal bit of driving southwestward thirtyfive miles through fine summer hills and dales climbing always gently on the southward hand still drained by the mayn river by the regnitz and other tributaries of the maynhalfway is heilsbronn not heilbronn the wellknown much larger town in wurtemberg 80 or 100 miles to westward both names which are applied to still other places signify healthwell or even holywellthese two words healthy and holy what is very remarkable being the same in old teutonic speech with its old monastery where the bones of our hohenzollern forefathers rest and albert achilless skull with no sutures visible on the gloomy churchwalls their memorials are still legible as for the monastery itself margraf george tour memorable reformation friend abolished thatpurged the monks away and put schoolmasters in their stead who were long of good renown in those parts but have since gone to erlangen so to speak the july sunset streaming over those old spires of heilsbronn might awaken thoughts in a prussian majesty were he not in such haste  at anspach what a thricehospitable youthfully joyful welcome from the young married couple there margravine frederika is still not quite sixteen beautiful as day and rather foolish fancy her joy at sight of papas majesty and brother fritz and how she dances about and perhaps bakes pastries of the finest anspach flour ah did you send me berlin sausages then you untrue papa well i will bake for you wont isarah herself not more loyally whom we read of in genesis that time the angels entered her tent in a hungry condition  anspach as we hint has an unfinished palace of a size that might better beseem paris or london palace begun by former margraves left off once and again for want of cash stands there as a sad monument of several thingsthe young family living meanwhile in some solid comfortable wing or adjacent edifice of natural dimensions they are so young as we say and not too wise by and by they had a son and then a second son which latter came to manhood to old age and made some noise in the foolish parts of the newspaperswinding up finally at hammersmith as we often explainand was the last of the anspachbaireuth margraves i have heard farther that frederika did not want for temper as the hohenzollerns seldom do that her husband likewise had his own stock of it rather scant of wisdom withal and that their life was not quite symphonious alwaysespecially cash being short the dowager margravine margrafs mother had governed with great prudence during her sons long minority i think she is now since the marriage gone to reside at her wittwensitz dowagerseat of feuchtwang twenty miles southwest of us but may have come up to welcome the majesties into these parts very beautiful i hear still almost young and charming though there is a mortal malady upon her which she knows of pollnitz memoirs and letters i 209 date 29th september 1729needs watching before believing here are certain seckendorfs too this is the feldzeugmeisters native countryand there are resources for a royal travellingparty how long the royal party stayed at anspach i do not know nor what they did thereexcept that crownprince friedrich is said to have privately asked the young margraf to lend him a pair of ridinghorses and say nothing of it who suspecting something wrong was obliged to make protestations and refuse  as to the crownprince there is no doubt but here at last things are actually coming to a crisis with him to say truth it has been the young mans fixed purpose ever since he entered on this journey nay was ever since that ignominy in the camp of radewitz to run awayand indeed all this while he has measures going on with katte at berlin of the nowornever sort rash young creatures elder of them hardly above fiveandtwenty yet not good at contriving measures but what then human nature cannot stand this always and it is time there were an end of deliberating can we ever have such a chance againwhat i find of certain concerning friedrich while at anspach is that there comes by way of erlangen guided forward from that place by the rittmeister von katte a certain messenger and message which proved of deep importance to his royal highness the messenger was lieutenant kattes servant who has come express from berlin hither he inquired on the road as he was bidden at erlangen of masters cousin the experienced rittmeister where his royal highness at present was that he might deliver a letter to him the masters cousin who answered naturally at anspach knew nothing and naturally could get to know nothing of what the message in this letter was but he judged from crossquestionings added to dim whispering rumors he had heard that it was questionable probably in an extreme degree wherefore along with his cousin the lieutenants messenger to anspach the rittmeister forwarded a note of his own to lieutenantcolonel rochow of this purport as a friend i warn you have a watchful eye on your high chargeand for his own share determined to let nothing escape him in his corner of the matter this note to rochow and the berlin letter for the crownprince reach anspach by the same hand lieutenant kattes express conscious of nothing delivering them both rochow and the rittmeister though the poor prince does not know it are broad awake to all movements he and the rash lieutenant may make  lieutenant katte in this letter now arrived complains that he never yet can get recruiting furlough whether it be by accident or that rochow has given my colonel a hint no furlough yet to be had will at worst come without furlough and in spite of all men and things whenever wanted onlywesel still if i might advise this is the substance of kattes message by express date must be the end of july 1730 but neither date nor letter is now anywhere producible except from hearsay  deeply pondering these things what shall the poor prince do from canstatt close by stuttgard a town on our homeward routefrom canstatt where katte was to appear in disguise had the furlough been got one might have slipt away across the hills it is but eighty miles to strasburg through the kniebiss pass where the murg the kinzig and the intricate winding mountain streams and valleys start rhineward a labyrinthic rockandforest country where pursuit or tracking were impossible near by strasburg is count rothenburgs chateau good rothenburg long minister in berlinwho saw those profossen or scavengerexecutioners in french costume long since and was always good to memight not that be a method lieutenant keith indeed is in wesel waiting only a signal suppose he went to the hague and took soundings there what welcome we should have no not till we have actually run beware of making noisethe poor prince is in unutterable perplexity can only answer katte by that messenger of his to the effect date and letter burnt like the former doubt is on every hand doubtand yet certainty will write again before undertaking anything  and there is no question he did write again more than once letters by the post which his faithful lieutenant katte in berlin received one of which however stuck on the road and this oneby some industry of postmasters spirited into vigilance as is likeliest though others say by mere misaddressing by want of berlin on the addressfell into the hands of vigilant rittmeister katte at erlangen who grew pale in reading it and had to resolve on a painful thing this was i suppose among the last letters of the series and must have been dated as i guess about the 29th of july 1730 but they are now all burnt huddled rapidly into annihilation and one cannot say  certain it is that the royal travellingparty left anspach in a few days to go southward still by the oettingen country towards augsburg fassmann p 410 feuchtwang wet wang not durrwang or dry wang is the first stage here lives the dowager margravine of anspach here the prince does some inconceivably small fault lets a knife which he is handing to or from the serene lady fall ranke i 304 from a letter the prince had written to katte who as she is weak may suffer by the jingle for which friedrich wilhelm bursts out on him like the irish rebellionto the silent despair of the poor prince the poor prince meditates desperate resolutions but has to keep them strictly to himself  doubtless the buddenbrock trio good old military gentlemen would endeavor to speak comfort to him when they were on the road again here is nordlingen your highness where bernhard of weimar for his overhaste got so beaten in the thirtyyears war would not wait till the swedes were rightly gathered what general if he have reinforcement at hand would not wait for it the waters now you observe run all into the wornitz into the donau it is a famed warcountry this known to me well in my young eugenemarlborough dayshm ha yes for the prince is preoccupied with black cares and thinks blenheim and the schellenberg businesses befell long since and were perhaps simple to what he has now on hand that feuchtwang scene it would appear has brought him to a resolution there is a young page keith of the party lieutenant keith of wesels brother of this page keith who is often busy about horses he cautiously makes question what help may be in him a willing mind traceable in this poor lad but his terrors great  to donauworth from anspach through feuchtwang and nordlingen is some seventy or eighty miles at donauworth one surely ought to lodge and see the schellenberg on the morrow nay drive to the field of hochstadt blenheim blindheim which is but a few miles farther up the river buddenbrock was there and anhaltdessau for their very sake were there nothing farther one surely ought to go such was the probability a visit to blenheim field in passing and surely somewhere in those heartrending masses of historical rubbish i did at last find express evanescent mention of the factbut cannot now say wherethe exact record or conceivable image of which would have been a perceptible pleasure to us alas in those dim dreary books all whirling dismal round ones soul like vortices of dim brandenburg sand how should anything human be searched out and mentioned to us and a thousand things nothuman be searched out and eternally suppressed from us for the sake of that i please myself figuring young friedrich looking at the vestiges of marlborough even in a preoccupied uncertain manner your majesty too this is the very schellenberg or jinglehill this hill we are now skirting on highways on swift wheels which overhangs donauworth our restingplace this hot july evening yes your majesty here was a feat of storming donepang pangsuch a noise as never jingled on that hill before like doomsday come and a herohead to rule the doomsday and turn it to heroic marching music a very pretty feat of war your majesty his majesty well knows it feat of his marlboroughs doing famed everywhere for the twentysix years last past and will go to see the schellenberg and its lines the great duke is dead four years sank sadly eclipsed under tears of dotage of his own and under human stupidity of other mens but buddenbrock is still living anhaltdessau and others of us are still alive a little while  hochstadt itselfblenheim as the english call it meaning blindheim the other village on the fieldis but a short way up the river well worth such a detour by what way they drove to the field of honor and back from it i do not know but there northward towards the heights is the little wood where anhaltdessau stood at bay like a molossian dog of consummate military knowledge and saved the fight in eugenes quarter of it that is visible enough and worth looking at visible enough the rolling donau marlboroughs place the narrow ground the bordering hills all green at this seasonand down old buddenbrocks cheek end anhalts there would roll an iron tear or two augsburg is but some thirty miles off once we are across the donauby the bridge of donauworth or the ferry of hochstadtswift travellers in a long day the last of july are soon enough at augsburg  as for friedrich haunted and whipt onwards by that scene at feuchtwang he is inwardly very busy during this latter part of the route probably there is some progress towards gaining page keith lieutenant keith of wesels brother some hope that page keith at the right moment can be gained the lieutenant at wesel is kept duly advised to lieutenant katte at berlin friedrich now writes i should judge from donauworth or augsburg that he has had a scene at feuchtwang that he can stand it no longer that canstatt being given up as katte cannot be there to go across the kniebiss with us we will endure till we are near enough the rhine once in the rhineland in some quiet town there handy for speyer for french landausay sinzheim last stage hitherward of heidelberg but this we do not writethere might it not be be somewhere it shall and must you katte the instant you hear that we are off speed you towards the hague ask for m le comte dalberville you will know that gentleman when you see him keith our wesel friend will have taken the preliminary soundingsand i tell you count dalberville or news of him will be there bring the greatcoat with you and the other things especially the 1000 gold ducats count dalberville at the hague if all have gone rightnay if anything go wrong cannot he once across the rhine take refuge in the convents in those catholic regions nobody under the scapulary will suspect such a heretic as him speed silence vigilance and so adieu a letter of such purport friedrich did write which letter moreover the lieutenant katte received it was not this it was another that stuck upon the road and fell into the rittmeisters hand this is the young princes ultimate fixed project brought to birth by that slight accident of dropping the knife at feuchtwang ranke i 304 and hanging heavy on his mind during this augsburg drive at augsburg furthermore he bought in all privacy red cloth of quantity to make a topcoat red the gray being unattainable in kattes hands in all privacy though the watchful rochow had full knowledge of it all the same     chapter vi  journey homewards from the reich catastrophe on journey homewards  the travelling majesty of prussia went diligently up and down investigating ancient augsburg saw i doubt not the fuggerei or ancient hospice of the fuggerswho were once weavers in those parts and are now princes and were known to entertain charles v with fires of cinnamon nay with transient flames of bankbills on one old occasion saw all the fuggeries i doubt not the ancient lutherandmelanchthon relics diethalls and notabilities of this renowned free townperhaps remembered margraf george and loudvoiced kurfurst joachim with the bottlenose our direct ancestor though mistaken in opinion on some points who were once so audible there  one passing phenomenon we expressly know he saw a human not a historically important one driving through the streets from place to place his majesty came athwart some questionable quaint procession ribbony perhaps musical majesty questioned it a wedding procession your majestywill the bride step out then and let us see how she is dressed vom herzen gern will have the honor bride stept out with blusheshandsome we will hope majesty surveyed her on the streets of augsburg having a human heart in him and says fassmann as if with insidious insinuation is said to have made her a present she went her way fulfilled her destiny in an anonymous manner friedrich wilhelm loudly named in the world did the like and their two orbits never intersected againsome fortyfive miles south of augsburg up the wertach river more properly up the mindel river lies mindelheim once a name known in england and in prussia once the duke of marlboroughs principality given him by a grateful kaiser joseph taken from him by a necessitous kaiser karl josephs brother that now is i know not if his majesty remembers that transaction now while in these localities but know well if he does he must think it a shabby one  on the same day 1st august 1730 we quit augsburg set out fairly homewards again the route bends westward this time towards frankfurtonmayn there yachts are to be ready and mere sailing thenceforth gallantly down the rhinestreamsuch a yachtvoyage in the summer weather with no tourists yet infesting itto end happily we will hope at wesel in the review of regiments and other business first stage first pause is to be at ludwigsburg and the wicked old duke of wurtembergs thither first from augsburg we cross the donau at dillingen at gunzberg or i know not where and by tomorrows sunset being rapid travellers find ourselves at ludwigsburgclear through canstatt stuttgard and certainly no katte waiting there safe across the intermediate uplands here are we fairly in the neckar country in the basin of the rhine again and old duke eberhard ludwig of wurtemberg bidding us kindly welcome poor old bewildered creature who has become the talk of germany in those times will english readers consent to a momentary glance into his affairs and him strange things are going on at lndwigsburg nay the origin of ludwigsburg and that the duke should be there and not at stuttgard is itself strange let us take this excerpt headed ludwigsburg in 1730 and then hasten on  ludwigsburg in 1730  duke eberhard ludwig now an elderly gentleman of fiftyfour has distinguished himself in his long reign not by political obliquities and obstinacies though those also were not wanting but by matrimonial and amatory which have rendered him conspicuous to his fellowscreatures and still keep him mentionable in history briefly and for a sad reason duke eberhard ludwig was duly wedded to an irreproachable princess of badendurlach johanna elizabeth upwards of thirty years ago and he duly produced one son in consequence with other good results to himself and her but in course of time duke eberhard ludwig took to consorting with bad creatures took in fact to swashing about at random in the pool of amatory iniquity as if there had been no law known or of the least validity in that matter  perceiving which a certain young fellow gravenitz by name who had come to him from the mecklenbnrg regions by way of pushing fortune and had got some pageship or the like here in wurtemberg recollected that he had a young sister at home pretty and artful who perhaps might do a stroke of work here he sends for the young sister very pretty indeed and a gentlewoman by birth though penniless he borrows clothes for her by onerous contract with the haberdashers it is said being poor to a degree he easily gets her introduced to the ducal soirees bids hershe knows what to do right well she knows what catches with her piquant face the dull eye of eberhard ludwig kindles eberhard ludwig and will not for something quench him not she at all how can she your serene highness ask her not a virtuous young lady she and come of a stainless familyin brief she hooks she of all the fishes in the pool this lumber of a duke enchants him keeps him hooked and has made such a pennyworth of him for the last twenty years and more as germany cannot match michaelis iii 440 her brother gravenitz the page has become count gravenitz the prime minister or chief of the governing cabal she countess gravenitz and autocrat of wurtemberg loaded with wealth with socalled honors she and hers there go they flaunting skyhigh none else admitted to more than the liberty of breathing in silence in this duchythe poor duke eberhard ludwig making no complaint obedient as a child to the bidding of his gravenitz he is become a mere enchanted simulacrum of a duke bewitched under worse than thessalian spells without faculty of willing except as she wills his people and he the plaything of this circe or hecate that has got hold of him so it has lasted for above twenty years gravenitz has become the wonder of germany and requires on these bad grounds a slight mention in human history for some time to come certainly it is by the gravenitz alone that eberhard ludwig is remembered and yet down since ulrich with the thumb ulricus pollex right thumb bigger than left died ad 1265 michaelis iii 262 which of those serene abstruse beutelsbachers always an abstruse obstinate set has so fixed himself in your memory  most persons in wurtemberg for quiets sake have complied with the gravenitz though not without protest and sometimes spoken protest thus the right reverend osiander let us name osiander head of the church in wurtemberg flatly refused to have her name inserted in the public prayers is not she already prayed for said osiander do we not say deliver us from evil said the indignant protestant man and there is one other person that never will comply with her the lawful wife of eberhard ludwig serene lady she has had a sad existence of it the voice of her wrongs audible to little purpose this long while in heaven and on earth but it is not in the power of reward or punishment to bend her female will in the essential point divorce your highness when i am found guilty yes till then never your highness never never in steady crescendo toneso that his highness is glad to escape again and drop the subject on which the serene lady again falls silent gravenitz in fact hopes always to be wedded with the right nay were it only with the left hand and this serene lady stands like a fateful monument irremovably in the way the serene lady steadily inhabits her own wing of the ducal house would not exchange it for the palace of aladdin looks out there upon the grand equipages high doings impure splendors of her duke and his gravenitz with a cleareyed silence which seems to say more eloquently than words mene mene you are weighed in the land of wurtemberg or under the sun is no reward or punishment that can abate this silence speak of divorce the answer is as above leave divorce lying there is silence looking forth cleareyed from that particular wing of the palace on things which the gods permit for a time  cleareyed silence which as there was no abating of it grew at last intolerable to the two sinners let us remove said the gravenitz since her serene highness will not build a new charming palacesay at our hunting seat among those pleasant hills in the waiblingen regionand take the court out thither and they have done so in these late bad years taking out with them by degrees all the courtier gentry all the raths government boards public businesses and building new houses for them there from 1727 to 1730 was this latter removal a huntinglodge of eberhard ludwigs building and named by him lugwigsburg stood here since 1705 nucleus of the subsequent palace with its pheasantries its favoritas c c the place had originally been monastic busching erdbeschreibung vi 1519 founding in fact a second capital for wurtemberg with what distress sulky misery and disarrangement to stuttgard and the old capital readers can fancy there it stands that ludwigsburg the second capital of wurtemberg some ten or twenty miles from stuttgard the first a lasting memorial of circe gravenitz and her ludwig has not she by her incantations made the stone houses dance out hither it remains to this day a pleasant town and occasional residence of sovereignty waiblingen within an hours ride has got memorability on other groundswhat reader has not heard of ghibellines meaning waiblingens and in another hour up the river you will come to beutelsbach itself where ulrich with the thumb had his abode better luck to him and generated this lover of the gravenitz and much other nonsense loud now and then for the last four centuries in the world  there is something of abstruse in all these beutelsbachers from ulrich with the thumb downwards a mute ennui an inexorable obstinacy a certain streak of natural gloom which no illumination can abolish veracity of all kinds is great in them sullen passive courage plenty of it active courage rarer articulate intellect defective hence a strange stiff perversity of conduct visible among them often marring what wisdom they haveit is the royal stamp of fate put upon these men what are called fateful or fated men such as are often seen on the top places of the world making an indifferent figure there something of this i doubt not is concerned in eberhard ludwigs fascination and we shall see other instances farther down in this history  but so for twenty years the absurd duke transformed into a mere porcus by his circe in that scandalous miraculous manner has lived and so he still lives and his serene wife equally obstinate is living at stuttgard happily out of his sight now one son a weakly man who had one heir but has now none is her only comfort his wife is a prussian margravine friedrich wilhelms halfaunt and cultivates calvinism in the lutheran country this husband of hers he too has an abstruse life not likely to last we need not doubt the fates are busy and the evil demons with those poor fellowbeings nay it is said the circe is becoming much of a hecate now if the bewitched duke could see it she is getting haggard beyond the power of rouge her mind any mind she has more and more filled with spleen malice and the dregs of pride run sour a disgusting creature testifies one exofficial gentleman once a hofrath under her but obliged to run for life and invoke free press in his defence apologie de monsieur forstner de breitembourg c paris

ugly as one in spite of painttoujours un lavement a ses trousses good heavens  but here is the august prussian travellingparty shove aside your bewitchments and bewilderments hang a decent screen over many things poor eberhard ludwig who is infinitely the gentleman bestirs himself a good deal to welcome old royal friends nor do we hear that the least thing went awry during this transit of the royalties field of blenheim says your majesty ah mefor eberhard ludwig knows that ground stood the worldbattle there and so much has come and gone since then ah me indeed  friedrich wilhelm and he have met before this and have much to tell one another treaty of seville by no means their only topic nay the flood of cordiality went at length so far that at last friedrich wilhelm the conscientious king came upon the most intimate topics gravenitz the word of god scandal to the protestant religion no likely heir to your dukedom clear peril to your own soul is not her serene highness an unexceptionable lady heroic under sore woes and your wedded wife above allmna and might bring heirs too only forty come octoberah duke ah friend avisez la fin eberhard ludwig consider the end of it all we are growing old fellows now the duke i conceive who was rather a fat little man blushed blue then red and various colors at length settling into steady pale as it were indicating anthracitic whiteheat it is certain he said at length with emphasis i will and he did so by and by friedrich wilhelm sent a messenger to stuttgard to do his reverence to the high injured lady there perhaps to show her afar off some ray of hope if she could endure eberhard ludwig raised to a whiteheat perceives that in fact he is heartily tired of this circehecate that in fact she has long been an intolerable nightmare to him could he but have known it  and his royal highness the crownprince all this while well yes his royal highness has got a court tailor at ludwigsburg and in all privacy seen well by rochow has had the augsburg red cloth cut into a fine upper wrappage over coat or roquelaure for himself intending to use the same before long thus they severally the father and the son these are their known acts at ludwigsburg that the father persuaded eberhard ludwig of the gravenitz enormity and that the son got his red topcoat ready on thursday 3d of august late in the afternoon as i perceive they well entertained depart towards mannheim kurpfalz elector palatine old karl philip of the pfalzs place hope to be there on the morrow some time if all go well gloomy much enlightened eberhard takes leave of them with abstruse but grateful feelings will stand by the kaiser and dismiss that gravenitz nightmare by the first opportunity  as accordingly he did next summer going on a visit northward specially to berlin there for some three weeks till 9th june 1731 with a suite of above fifty persons fassmann pp 421 422 he left order that the gravenitz was to be got out of his sight safe stowed away before his return which by the proper officers military certain of them was accomplishedby fixed bayonets at last and not without futile demur on the part of the gravenitz poor eberhard ludwig he published in the pulpits that he was now minded to lead a better lifehad time now been left him same year 1731 november being come gloomy eberhard ludwig lost not unexpectedly his one sonthe one grandson was gone long since the serene steadfast duchess now had her duke again what was left of him but he was fallen into the sere and yellow leaf in two years more he died childless 31st october 1733 michaelis iii 441 and his cousin karl alexander an austrian feldmarschall of repute succeeded in wurtemberg with whom we may transiently meet in time coming with whom and perhaps less pleasantly with certain of his children for they continue to this daywith the old abstruse element still too traceable in them  old karl philip kurfurst of the pfalz towards whom friedrich wilhelm is now driving with intent to be there tomorrow evening is not quite a stranger to readers here and to friedrich wilhelm he is much the reverse perhaps too much this is he who ran away with poor prince sobieskis bride from berlin at starting in life who fell upon his own poor protestant heidelbergers and their church of the holy ghost being himself papist ever since that slap on the face to his ancestor and who has been in many quarrels with friedrich wilhelm and others a high expensive sovereign gentleman this old karl philip not i should suppose the pleasantest of men to lodge with one apprehends he cannot be peculiarly well disposed to friedrich wilhelm after that sad heidelberg passage of fence twelve or eleven years ago not to mention the inextricable julichandberg business which is a standing controversy between them  poor old kurfurst he is now within a year of seventy he has had crosses and losses terrible campaignings against the turk in old times and always such a stock of quarrels at home as must have been still worse to bear a life of perpetual arguing squabbling and battlingones neighbors being such an unreasonable set brabbles about heidelberg catechism and church of the holy ghost so that foreign kings interfered shaking their whips upon us then brabbles about boundaries about inheritances and detached properties very manyclearly mine were the neighbors reasonable in fact this sovereign old gentleman has been in the kaisers courts or even on the edge of fight oftener than most other men and it is as if that first adventure of the sobieski wedding turned topsyturvy had been symbolical of much that followed in his life  we remember that unpleasant heidelberg affair how hopeful it once looked fact done church of the holy ghost fairly ours your corpus evangelicorum fallen quasidead and nothing now for it but protocolling by diplomatists pleading in the diets by men in bombazine never like ending at allwhen friedrich wilhelm did suddenly end it suddenly locked up his own catholic establishments and revenues and quietly inexorable put the key in his pocket as it were drew his own whip with a will you whip my jewand we had to cower out of the affair kaiser himself ordering us in a most humiliated manner readers can judge whether kurpfalz was likely to have a kindly note of friedrich wilhelm in that corner of his memory the poor man felt so disgusted with heidelberg he quitted it soon after he would not go to dusseldorf in the bergandjulich quarter as his forefathers used to do but set up his abode at mannheim where he still is friedrich wilhelm who was far from meaning harm or insolence in that heidelberg affair hopes there is no grudge remaining but so stand the facts it is towards mannheim not towards heidelberg that we are now travellingfor the rest this scheme of reprisals or whipping your jew if you whip mine answered so well friedrich wilhelm has used it or threatened to use as the real method ever since where needful and has saved thereby much bombazine eloquence and confusion to mankind on several occasions  but the worst between these two high gentlemen is that julichandberg controversy which is a sore still running and beyond reach of probable surgery old karl philip has no male heir and is like to be what he indeed proved the last of the neuberg electors palatine what trouble there rose with the first of them about that sad business and how the then brandenburger much wrought upon smote the then neuburger across the very face and drove him into catholicism we have not forgotten how can we everit is one hundred and sixteen years since that afterdinner scene and o heavens what bickering and brabbling and confused negotiation there has been lawyers pens going almost continually ever since shadowing out the mutual darkness of sovereignties and from time to time the military implements brandishing themselves though loath generally to draw blood for a hundred and sixteen yearsbut the final bargain lying on parchment in the archives of both parties and always acknowledged as final was to this effect you serene neuburg keep what you have got we serene brandenburg the like cleve with detached pertinents ours julichandberg mainly yours and let us live in perpetual amity on that footing and note only furthermore when our line fails the whole of these fine duchies shall be yours if your line fail ours that was the plain bargain done solemnly in 1624 and again more solemnly and brought to parchment with signature in 1666 as friedrich wilhelm knows too well and now the very case is about to occur this old man childless at seventy is the last of the neuburgs may not one reasonably pretend that a bargain should be kept  tush answers old karl philip always bargain and will not hear reason against himself on the subject not even when the kaiser asks himas the kaiser really did after that wusterhausen treaty but could get only negatives karl philip has no romantic ideas of justice or of old parchments tying up a man karl philip had one daughter by that dear radzivil princess sobieskis stolen bride and he never by the dear radzivil or her dear successor see buchholz i 61 n had any son or other daughter that lived to wed one daughter we say a firstborn extremely precious to him her he married to the young fortunate sulzbach cousin karl joseph heirapparent of sulzbach who by all laws was to succeed in the pfalz as wellkarl philip thinking furthermore he and she please heaven shall hold fast by dusseldorf too and that fine julichandberg territory which is mine bargains such was and is the old mans inflexible notion alas this one daughter died lately and her husband lately she in 1728 he in 1729 their eldest daughter was born 1721 hubner t 140 michaelis ii 101 123 again leaving only daughters will not this change the notion not a whitthough friedrich wilhelm may have fondly hoped it by possibility might not a whit karl philip cherishes his little granddaughter now a child of nine as he did her mother and her mothers mother hopes one day to see her wedded as he did to a new heirapparent of the pfalz and sulzbach and for her behoof will hold fast by berg and julich and part with no square inch of it for any parchment  what is friedrich wilhelm to do seek justice for himself by his 80000 men and the iron ramrods apparently he will not get it otherwise he is loath to begin that terrible game if indeed europe do take fire as is likely at seville or elsewherebut in the meanwhile how happy if negotiation would but serve alas and if the kaiser england holland and the others could be brought to guarantee meas indeed they should to avoid a casus belli and some of them have said they will friedrich wilhelm tried this julichandberg problem by the pacific method all his life strenuously and without effect result perhaps was coming nevertheless at the distance of another hundred yearsone thing i know whatever rectitude and patience whatever courage perseverance or other human virtue he has put into this or another matter is not lost not it nor any fraction of it to friedrich wilhelm and his sons sons but will well avail him and them if not soon then later if not in berg and julich then in some other quarter of the universe which is a wide entity and a longlived courage your majesty  so stand matters as friedrich wilhelm journeys towards mannheim human politeness will have to cloak well and keep well down a good many prickly points in the visit ahead alas poor friedrich wilhelm has got other matter to think of by the time we arrive in mannheim     catastrophe on journey homewards  the royal party quitting ludwigsburgon thursday 3d august 1730 some hours after dinner as i calculate ithad but a rather short journey before them journey to a place called sinzheim some fifty or sixty miles a long way short of heidelberg the kings purpose being to lodge in that dilapidated silent town of sinzheim and leave both heidelberg and mannheim with their civic noises for the next days work sinzheim such was the program as the prince and others understood it but by some accident or on better calculation it was otherwise decided in the royal mind not at sinzheim intricate decayed old town shall we lodge tonight but five or six miles short of it in the naturally silent village of steinfurth where good clean empty barns are to be found which latter is a favorite method of his majesty fond always of free air and the absence of fuss shakedowns a temporary cooking apparatus plenty of tobacco and a tub to wash in this is what man requires and this without difficulty can be got his majestys tastes are simple simple and yet good and human here is a small royal order which i read once and ever since rememberthough the reference is now blown away and lost in those unindexed sibylline farragos the terror of human naturelet us copy it from memory till some deliverer arise with finger on page

right there were this a deliberate touring party but this is a rapid driving one knows nothing about stauffen cares nothingwe cannot fancy friedrich remembered barbarossa at all or much regarded

lodging in the waste inns there or good clean barns of a promising character are to be had nearer than there we absolutely do not go to sinzheim tonight we are to stop at steinfurth a small quiet hamlet with barns four or five miles short of that this was a great disappointment to the princeand some say a highly momentous circumstance in his history might perhaps have succeeded at sinzheim

favor us silence and all ye good genii  on friday morning 4th august 1730 usual hour of starting 3 am not being yet came the royal party lies asleep in two clean airy barns facing one another in the village of steinfurth barns facing one another with the heidelberg highway and village green asleep in front between them compare wilhelmina i 259 her account of the flight heard it from my brotherand report it loosely after a dozen years for it is little after two in the morning the dawn hardly beginning to break prince friedrich with his trio of vigilance buddenbrock waldau rochow lies in one barn majesty with his seckendorf and party is in the other apparently all still locked in sleep not all prince friedrich for example is awakethe trio is indeed audibly asleep unless others watch for them their six eyes are closed friedrich cautiously rises dresses takes his money his new red roquelaure unbolts the barndoor and walks out trio of vigilance is sound asleep and knows nothing alas trio of vigilance while its own six eyes are closed has appointed another pair to watch  gummersbach the valet comes to rochows bolster hst herr oberstlieutenant please awaken prince royal is up has on his topcoat and is gone out of doors rochow starts to his habiliments or perhaps has them ready on in a minute or two rochow also is forth into the gray of the morningfinds the young prince actually on the green there in his red roquelaure leaning pensively on one of the travelling carriages guten morgen ihro konigliche hoheit ranke 1 305fancy such a salutation to the young man page keith at this moment comes with a pair of horses too whither with the nags sirrah rochow asked with some sharpness keith seeing how it was answered without visible embarrassment herr they are mine and kunz the pages horses which i suppose is true ready at the usual hour keith might addhis majesty does not go till five this morningback to the stables beckoned rochow and according to the best accounts did not suspect anything or affected not to do so  page keith returned trembling in his saddle friedrich strolled towards the other barnat least to be out of rochows company seckendorf emerges from the other barn awake at the common hour how do you like his royal highness in the red roquelaure asks rochow as if nothing had happened was there ever such a baffled royal highness or young bright spirit chained in the bears den in this manner our steinfurth project has gone to water and it is not today we shall get across the rhinenot today nor any other day on that errand strong as our resolutions are for new light in a few hours afterwards pours in upon the project and human finesse or ulterior schemes avail nothing henceforth the crownprinces meditated flight has tried itself and failed here and so that long meditation ends this at steinfurth was all the overact it could ever come to in few hours more it will melt into air and only the terrible consequences will remain  by last nights arrangement the prince with his trio was to set out an hour before his father which circumstance had helped page keith in his excuses naturally the prince had now no wish to linger on the green of steinfurth in such a posture of affairs towards heidelberg then let us see the big tun there allons how the young prince and his trio did this days journey where he loitered what he saw said or thought we have no account it is certain only that his father who set out from steinfurth an hour after him arrived in mannheim several hours before him and in spite of kurfurst karl philips welcome testified the liveliest inquietude on that unaccountable circumstance beautiful rhinestream thricebeautiful trim mannheimyes all is beautiful indeed your serenity but where can the prince be he kept ejaculating and karl philip had to answer what he could of course the prince may be lingering about heidelberg looking at the big tun and other miraclesi had the pleasure to repair that worldfamous tub or tun as your majesty knows which had lain half burnt ever since louis xiv with his firebrand robberies lay upon us and burnt the pfalz in whole small honor to him i repaired the tun kohler munzbelustigungen viii 418424 145152 who gives a view of the worlds wonder lying horizontal with stairs running up to it big tuns of that kind were not uncommon in germany and had uses if multiplex dues of wine were to be paid in natura the heidelberg the biggest of them is small to the whitbreadandcompany for portersale in our time it is probably the successfulest feat i did hitherto and well worth looking at had your majesty had timeja wohlbut he came away an hour before methe polite karl philip at length sent off one of his own equerries to ride towards heidelberg or even to steinfurth if needful and see what was become of the prince this official person met the prince all in order at no great distance and brought him safe to papas presence again  why papa was in such a fuss about this little circumstance truly there has something come to papas knowledge since he started perhaps since he arrived at mannheim page keith who rides always behind the kings coach has ridden this day in an agony of remorse and terror and at length probably in mannheim once his majesty is got to his apartments or now that he finds his majesty so anxious there has fallen on his knees and with tears and obtestations made a clean breast page keith has confessed that the crownprince and he were to have been in speyer or farther at this time of the day flying rapidly into france gods providence alone prevented it pardon pardon slay me your majesty but there is the naked truth and the whole of it and i have nothing more to say hereupon ensues despatch of the equerry and hereupon as we may conjecture the equerrys return with fritz and the trio is an unspeakable relief to friedrich wilhelm  friedrich wilhelm now summons buddenbrock and company straightway shows in a suppressedvolcanic manner with questions and statementsobliged to suppress oneself in foreign hospitable serene houseswhat atrocity of scandal and terror has been on the edge of happening and you three rochow waldau buddenbrock mark it you three are responsible and shall answer i now tell you with your heads death the penalty unless you bring him to our own country againliving or dead added the suppressedvolcano in low metallic tone and the sparkling eyes of him the red tint and rustling gestures make the words too credible to us ranke i 307  what friedrich wilhelm got to speak about with the old kurpfalz during their serene passages of hospitality at mannheim is not very clear to me his prussian majesty is privately in such a desperate humor and the old kurpfalz privately so discrepant on all manner of points especially on the julichandberg point they could talk freely about the old turk campaigns battle of zentha 11th september 1697 eugenes crowning featbreaking of the grand turks back in this world who has staggered about less and less of a terror and outrage more and more of a nuisance growing unbearable ever since that day see hormayr iii 97101 for some description of this useful bit of heroism and prince eugene very freely about the heidelberg tun but it is known old karl philip had his agents at the congress of soissons to secure that bergandjulich interest for the sulzbachs and him directly in the teeth of friedrich wilhelm how that may have gone since the treaty of seville broke out to astonish mankindwill be unsafe to talk about for the rest old karl philip has frankly adopted the pragmatic sanction but then he has likewise privately made league with france to secure him in that julichandberg matter should the kaiser break promiseleague which may much obstruct said sanction nay privately he is casting glances on his bavarian cousin elegant ambitious karl albert kurfurst of baiernare not we all from the same wittelsbach stock cousins from of oldand will undertake for the same julichandbergobject to secure bavaria in its claims on the austrian heritages in defect of heirs male in austria michaelis ii 99101 which runs directly into the throat of said pragmatic sanction and engages to make it mere waste sheepskin so to speak truly old karl philip has his abstruse outlooks this way that way most abstruse politics altogetherand in fact we had better speak of the battle of zentha and the heidelberg tun while this visit lasts  on the morrow saturday august 5th certain frenchmen from the garrison of landau come across to pay their court and dine which race of men friedrich wilhelm does not love and now less than ever gloomily suspicious they may be come on parricide fritzs scoreyou rochow and company keep an eye by night and by day an eye upon him friedrich wilhelm was no doubt glad to get away on the morrow afternoon fairly out into the bergstrasse into the summer breezes and umbrageous woods with all his pertinents still safe about him rushing towards darmstadt through the sunday stillness where he will arrive in the evening time enough sunday evening arrive at darmstadt says seckendorf in forster iii 3 but by mistake calls it the 7th instead of 6th  the old prince of darmstadt ernst ludwig landgraf of hessendarmstadt age now sixtythree has a hoary venerable appearance according to pollnitz but sits a horse well walks well and seems to enjoy perfect healthwhich we are glad to hear of what more concerns us he lives usually quite retired in a small house upon the square in this extremely small metropolis of his and leaves his heirapparent to manage all business in the palace and elsewhere pollnitz memoirs and letters ii 66 poor old gentleman he has the biggest palace almost in the world only he could not finish it for want of funds and it lies there one of the biggest futilities vexatious to look upon no doubt the old gentleman has had vexations plenty of them first and last he is now got disgusted with the affairs of public life and addicts himself very much to turning ivory as the more eligible employment he lives in that small house of his among his turninglathes and ivory shavings dines in said small house at a table for four persons only on sunday and above all on this sunday puts off his apron goes across to the palace dines there in state with his heir and the grandees he has a kinship by affinity to friedrich wilhelm his wife dead long years since mother of this heirapparent was an anspach princess aunt to the now queen caroline of england poor old fellow these insignificancies and that he descends direct from philip the magnanimous of hessen luthers philip who insisted on the supplementary wife are all i know of him and he is somewhat tragic to me there turning ivory in this extremely anarchic world what the passages between him and friedrich wilhelm were on this occasion shall remain conjectural to all creatures friedrich wilhelm said this sunday evening at darmstadt to his own prince still here then i thought you would have been in paris by this timeto which the prince with artificial firmness answered he could certainly if he had wished

behold at frankfurt the trio of vigilance buddenbrock and company horrible to think of signify that we have the kings express orders not to enter the town at all with your royal highness we for our part are to go direct into one of the royal yachts which swing at anchor here and to wait in the same till his majesty have done seeing frankfurt and return to us here is a message for the poor young prince detected prisoner and a volcanic majesty now likely to be in full play when he returnsgilt weathercock on the mayn bridge which one goethe used to look at in the next generationthis and the steepletops of frankfurt especially that steepletop with the grinning skull of the mutinous malefactor on it warning to mankind what mutiny leads to this then is what we are to see of frankfurt and with such a symphony as our thoughts are playing in the background unhappy son unhappy father once more  nay friedrich wilhelm got new lights in frankfurt rittmeister katte had an estafette waiting for him there estafette with a certain letter which the rittmeister had picked up in erlangen and has shot across by estafette to wait his majesty here majesty has read with open eyes and throat letter from the crownprince to lieutenant katte in berlin treasonous flightproject now indisputable as the sun at noonhis majesty stept on board the yacht in such humor as was never seen before detestable rebel and deserter scandal of scandalsit is confidently written everywhere though seckendorf diplomatically keeps silence his majesty hustled and tussled the unfortunate crownprince poked the handle of his cane into his face and made the nose bleednever did a brandenburg face suffer the like of this cried the poor prince driven to the edge of mad ignition and one knows not what when the buddenbrocks at whatever peril interfered got the prince brought on board a different yacht and the conflagration moderated for the moment the yachts get under way towards mainz and down the rhinestream the yachts glide swiftly on the favoring current taking advantage of what wind there may be were we once ashore at wesel in our own countrywait till then thinks his majesty  and so it was on these terms that friedrich made his first acquaintance with the beauties of the rhinereaders can judge whether he was in a temper very open to the picturesque i know not that they paused at mainz or recollected barbarossas worldtournament or the hochheim vineyards at all i see the young mans yacht dashing in swift gallop not without danger through the gap of bingen dancing wildly on the boiling whirlpools of st goar well threading the cliffsthe young man gloomily insensible to danger of life and charm of the picturesque coblenz confluentia the moselle and ehrenbreitstein majesty

confide to seckendorf that he had in very truth meant to run away he could not at the age he was come to stand such indignities actual strokes as in the camp of radewitzand he would have gone long since had it not been for the queen and the princess his sisters sake he could not repent what he had done and if the king did not cease beating him in that manner c he would still do it for loss of his own life such a life as his had grown he cared little his chief misery was that those officers who had known of the thing should come to misfortune by his means if the king would pardon these poor gentlemen he would tell him everything for the rest begged seckendorf to help him in this labyrinthnothing could ever so oblige him as help now and more of the like sort these things he said at bonn to seckendorf the fountain of all his woes ibid what seckendorfs reflections on this his sad handiwork now were we do not know probably he made none being a strongminded casehardened old stager but

spite of the dutch there the lodging is at an hours drive westward from the rhineshorewhere his majesty quitted the river i do not know nor whether the crownprince went to mors with him or waited in his yacht but guess the latter his majesty intends for geldern on the morrow on matters of business thither for the town is his but what would the prince in the present state of things do thereat mors seckendorf found means to address his majesty privately and snuffled into him suggestions of mercy to the repentant prince and to the poor officers whom he was so anxious about well if he will confess everything and leave off his quirks and concealments but i know he wont answered majesty  in that dilapidated castle of morslook at it reader though in the dark we may see it again or the shadow of it

was another item of the same lot besides which we shall hear of old palaces at loo and other dilapidated objects incidentally in time coming  at geldern in the pressure of business next day his majesty got word from wesel that lieutenant keith was not now to be found in wesel was last seen there that we can hear of certain hours before your majestys allgracious order arrived had saddled his own horse came ambling through the brunen gate going out to have a ride he said and did not returnkeith gone scandalous keith whom i pardoned only few weeks ago he too is in the plot will the very army break its oath then his majesty bursts into fire and flame at these new tidings orders that colonel dumoulin our expertest roguetracer go instantly on the scent of keith and follow him till found and caught also on the other hand that the crownprince be constituted prisoner sail down to wesel prisoner in his yacht and await upon the rhine there his majestys arrival formidable omens it is thought  his majesty all business done in geldern drives across to wesel can see fritzs yacht waiting duly in the river and black care hovering over her it is on the evening of the 12th of august 1730 and so his majesty ends this memorable tour into the reich but has not yet ended the gloomy miseries for himself and others which plentifully sprung out of that     chapter vii  catastrophe and majesty arrive in berlin  at berlin dark rumors of this intended flight and actual arrest of the crownprince are agitating all the world especially lieutenant katte and the queen and wilhelmina as we may suppose the first news of it came tragically on the young princess apparently some rumor from frankfurt which she confuses in her aftermemory with the specific news from wesel for her dates here as usual are all awry wilhelmina i 246 preuss i 42 iv 473 seckendorf in forster iii 6  mamma had given a ball in honor of papas birthdaytuesday 15th august 1730and we were all dancing in the fine saloons of monbijou with pretty intervals in the cool boscages and orangeries of the place all of us as happy as could be wilhelmina in particular dancing at an unusual rate we recommenced the ball after supper for six years i had not danced before it was new fruit and i took my fill of it without heeding much what was passing madame bulow who with others of them had worn long faces all night pleading illness when one noticed it said to me several times it is late i wish you had doneeh mon dieu i answered let me have enough of dancing this one new time it may be long before it comes againthat may well be said she i paid no regard but continued to divert myself she returned to the charge half an hour after will you end then said she with a vexed air you are so engaged you have eyes for nothingyou are in such a humor i replied that i know not what to make of itlook at the queen then madam and you will cease to reproach me a glance which i gave that way filled me with terror there sat the queen paler than death in a corner of the room in low conference with sonsfeld and countess finkenstein as my brother was most in my anxieties i asked if it concerned him bulow shrugged her shoulders answering i dont know at all a moment after the queen gave goodnight and got into her carriage with mespeaking no word all the way to the schloss so that i thought my brother must be dead and i myself took violent palpitations and sonsfeld contrary to orders had at last to tell me in the course of the night poor wilhelmina and poor mother of wilhelmina  the fact of arrest and unknown mischief to the prince is taken for certain but what may be the issues of it who besides the prince have been involved in it especially who will be found to have been involved is matter of dire guess to the three who are most interested here lieutenant katte finds he ought to dispose of the princes effects which were intrusted to him of the thousand gold thalers in particular and beyond and before all of the locked writingdesk in which lies the princes correspondence the very queen and princess likely to be concerned in it katte despatches these two objects the money and the little desk in all secrecy to madam finkenstein as to the surest hand with a short note shadowing out what he thinks they are countess finkenstein old general von finkensteins wife and a second mother to the prince she like her husband a sworn partisan of the prince and his mother shall do with these precious and terrible objects what to her own wise judgment seems best  madam finkenstein carries them at once in deep silence to the queen huge dismay on the part of the queen and princess they know too well what letters may be there and there is a seal on the desk and no key to it neither must it in time coming seem to have been opened even if we could now open it a desperate pinch and it must be solved female wit and wilhelmina did solve it by some preeminently acute device of their despair wilhelmina i 253257 and contrived to get the letters out hundreds of letters enough to be our death if read says wilhelmina these letters they burnt and set to writing fast as the pen would go other letters in their stead fancy the mood of these two royal women and the black whirlwind they were in wilhelminas despatch was incredible pen went at the gallop night and day new letters of old dates and of no meaning are got into the desk again the desk closed without mark of injury and shoved aside while it is yet timetime presses his majesty too and the events go at gallop here is a letter from his majesty to a trusty mistress of the robes or whatever she is which let it arrive through what softening media it likes will complete the poor queens despair  my dear frau von kameckefritz has attempted to desert i have been under the necessity to have him arrested i request you to tell my wife of it in some good way that the news may not terrify her and pity an unhappy father  friedrich wilhelm  no date arrived from wesel we conclude sunday 20th august at the palace of berlin preuss i 42  the same post brought an order to the colonel of the gernsdarmes to put that lieutenant katte of his under close confinementwe hope the thoughtless young fellow has already got out of the way he is getting his saddle altered fettling about this and that does not consider what danger he is in this same sunday his major met him on the street of berlin said in a significant tone you still here kattei go this night answered katte but he again put it off did not go this night and the order for his arrest did come in on the morrow morning colonel pannewitz hoping now he was not there went with the rhadamanthine order and finding the unlucky fellow was obliged to execute it katte lies in ward awaiting what may be prepared for him  friedrich wilhelm at wesel has had rough passages with the prince and others on the saturday evening 12th august 1730 preuss iv 473 seckendorf forster iii 6 says 13th but wrong his majesty had the culprit brought on shore to the commandants house for an interview culprit proving less remorseful than was expected and evidently not confessing everything a loud terrible scene ensued which friedrich wilhelm the unhappy father winded up by drawing his sword to run the unnatural son through the body old general mosel commandant of wesel sprang between them sire cut me to death but spare your son and the sword was got back to its scabbard and the prince lodged in a separate room two sentries with fixed bayonets keeping watch over him friedrich wilhelm did not see his face again for twelve months to cometwelve months and three days  military gentlemen of due grimness interrogated the prince next evening seckendorf in forster iii 5 from a paper drawn up by his majesty in the interim prince confesses little did design to get across the rhine to landau thence to strasburg paris in the strictest incognito intended to volunteer there thought he might take french service profoundly incognito and signalize himself in the italian war just expected to break out which might have recovered him some favor from his majesty does not tell clearly where his money came from shy extremely of elucidating katte and keithin fact as we perceive struggles against mendacity but will not tell the whole truth let him lie in ward then and take what doom the laws have appointed for the like of him divine laws are they not well yes your majesty divine and humanor are there perhaps no laws but the human sort completely explicit in this case he is my colonel at least thinks friedrich wilhelm and tried to desert and make others desert if a rebellious crownprince breaking his fathers heart find the laws still inarticulate a deserting colonel of the potsdam regiment finds them speak plain enough let him take the answer they give him  dumoulin in the mean while can make nothing of keith the runaway lieutenant dumoulin with his sagacious organ soon came upon the scent of keith and has discovered these things about him one evening a week before his majesty arrived sunday evening 6th august 1730 relatio ex actis in preuss iv 473 lieutenant keith doubtless smelling something saddled his horse as above mentioned decided to have a ride in the country this fine evening and issued out at the brunen gate of wesel he is on the right bank of the rhine pleasant yellow fields on this hand and that he ambles slowly for a space then gradually awakens into speed into full speed arrives within a couple of hours at dingden a village in the munster territory safe over the prussian border by the shortest line and from dingden rides at more leisure but without losing time into the dutch overyssel region straight towards the hague he must be in the hague said dumoulin to the official persons on arriving thereto meinertshagen the prussian ambassador there seckendorf forster iii 7 and to keppel dutch official gentleman who was once ambassador at berlin prussian ambassador applies and again applies in the highest quarters but we fear they are slack dumoulin discovers that the man was certainly here keppel readily admits he had keith to dinner a few days ago but where keith now is keppel cannot form the least guess  dumoulin suspects he is with lord chesterfield the english ambassador here a light was seen for a night or two in one of the garretrooms of lord chesterfields houseprobably keith readingbut keith is not to be heard of on inquiry there and the very light has now gone out the colonel at least distinguished english lord is gone to england in these days but his german secretary is not gone the house is inviolable impregnable to prussia who knows in spite of the light going out but keith is still there merely with a

first good night for conveying keith to scheveningen and the seaside where a fisherboat was provided for him which carried him frail craft as it was safe across to england once there the authorities took pity on the poor fellowfurnished the modicum of cash and help sent him with admiral norris to assist the portuguese menaced with spanish war at this time among whom he gradually rose to be major of horse friedrich wilhelm cited him by tap of drum three times in wesel and also in the gazettes native and dutch then as he did not come nailed an effigy of him cut in four if i remember on the gallows there and confiscated any property he had keith had more pedigree than property was of poberow in pommern son of poor gentlefolks there he sent no word of himself to prussia for the next ten years so that he had become a kind of myth to many people to his poor mother among the rest who has her tragical surmises about him he will appear again but not to much purpose his brother the page keith is packed into the fusileer regiment at wesel here and there walks sentry unheard of for the rest of his life so much for the keiths preuss friedrich mit seinen verwandten und freunden pp 330

one nearer berlin farther from the frontier would be preferable towards berlin however there is no route all on prussian ground from these divided cleve countries we have to cross a bit of hanover a bit of hessencassel suppose these serene highnesses were to interfere not likely they will interfere answer ancient military men of due grimness at any rate we can go a roundabout road and they need not know that is the method settled on neighborhood of berlin clearly somewhere there must be the place old castle of mittenwalde in the wusterhausen environs let that be the first restingpoint then rochow waldau and the wesel fusileercolonel here sure men with a trooper or two for escort shall conduct the prisoner by treuenbrietzen by circuitous roads swift silent steadyand with vigilance as you shall answerthese preliminaries settled friedrich wilhelm drives off homewards black care riding behind him he reaches berlin sunday 27th august finds a world gone all to a kind of doomsday with him there poor gentleman     scene at berlin on majestys arrival  on sunday evening 27th august 1730 his majesty who had rested overnight at potsdam from his rapid journey drove into berlin between four and five in the afternoon deserter fritz is following under escort of his three military gentlemen at a slower rate and by circuitous routes so as to avoid the territories of hanover and hessentowards mittenwalde in the wusterhausen neighborhood the military gentlemen are vigilant as argus and though pitying the poor prince must be rigorous as rhadamanthus his attempts at escape of which tradition mentions more than one they will not report to papa nor even notice to the prince himself but will take care to render futile one and all his majesty may be secure on that score  the scenes that follow are unusual in royal history and having been reported in the world with infinite noise and censure made up of laughter and horror it will behoove us to be the more exact in relating them as they actually befell very difficult to pull out of that ravelled cartload of chaotic thrums here a thread and there a thread capable of being brought to the straight state and woven into legible narrative but perhaps by that method the mingled laughter and horror will modify itself a little what we can well say is that pity also ought not to be wanting the next six months were undoubtedly by far the wretchedest of friedrich wilhelms life the poor king except that he was not conscious of intending wrong but much the reverse walked in the hollow night of gehenna all that while and was often like to be driven mad by the turn things had taken  here is scene first wilhelmina reports his majestys arrival that sunday afternoon to the following effect she was present in the adventure and not a spectatress only  the queen was alone in his majestys apartment waiting for him as he approached at sight of her in the distance he called out your losel of a son votre indigne fils has ended at last you have done with him or words to that effect what cried the queen you have had the barbarity to kill him yes i tell youbut where is the sealed desk the queen went to her own apartment to fetch it i ran in to her there for a moment she was out of herself wringing her hands crying incessantly and said without ceasing mon dieu mon fils o god my son breath failed me i fell fainting into the arms of madame de sonsfeldthe queen took away the writingcase king tore out the letters and went off upon which the queen came down again to us  we learned from some attendant that at least my brother was not dead the king now came back we all ran to kiss his hands but me he no sooner noticed than rage and fury took possession of him he became black in the face his eyes sparkling fire his mouth foaming infamous canaille said he darest thou show thyself before me go keep thy scoundrel of a brother company and so saying he seized me with one hand slapping me on the face with the otherclenched as a fist poingseveral blows one of which struck me on the temple so that i fell back and should have split my head against a corner of the wainscot had not madame de sonsfeld caught me by the headdress and broken the fall i lay on the ground without consciousness the king in a frenzy was for striking me with his feet had not the queen my sisters and the rest run between and those who were present prevented him they all ranked themselves round me which gave mesdames de kamecke and sonsfeld time to pick me up they put me in a chair in the embrasure of a window threw water on my face to bring me to life which care i lamentably reproached them with death being a thousand times better in the pass things had come to the queen kept shrieking her firmness had quite left her she wrung her hands and ran in despair up and down the room the kings face was so disfigured with rage it was frightful to look upon the little ones were on their knees begging for mewilhelmina i 265267poor little beings what a group amelia the youngest girl about six henri in his bits of trousers hardly over fourfor the rest i perceive this room was on the first or a lower floor and such noises were very audible the guard had turned out at the noise and a crowd was collecting to see and hear move on move on  the king had now changed his tune he admitted that my brother was still alive but vowed horribly he would put him to death and lay me fast within four walls for the rest of my life he accused me of being the princes accomplice whose crime was high treasonalso of having an intrigue of love with katte to whom he said i had borne several children the timid gouvernante flamed up at this unheardof insult that is not true said she fiercely whoever has told your majesty such a thing has told a lie oh spare my brother and i will marry the duke of weissenfels whimpered i but in the great noise he did not hear and while i strove to repeat it louder sonsfeld clapt her handkerchief on my face  hustling aside to get rid of the handkerchief i saw katte crossing the square four soldiers were conducting him to the king trunks my brothers and his own sealed were coming on in the rear pale and downcast he took off his hat to salute mepoor katte to me always so prostrate in silent respect and now so unhappy a moment after the king hearing he was come went out exclaiming now i shall have proof about the scoundrel fritz and the offscouring canaille wilhelmina clear proofs to cut the heads off themthe two hofdames again interfered and one of them kamecke it was rebuked him told him in the tone of a prophetess to take care what he was doing whom his majesty gazed into with astonishment but rather with respect than with anger saying your intentions are good  and so his majesty flung out seeking katte and vanished wilhelmina saw no more of him for about a year after being ordered to her room and kept prisoner there on low diet with sentries guarding her doors and no outlook but the worst horror her imagination pleased to paint  this is the celebrated assault of paternal majesty on wilhelmina the rumor of which has gone into all lands exciting wonder and horror but could not be so exact as this account at first hand naturally the crowd of streetpassengers once dispersed by the guard carried the matter abroad and there was no end of sympathetic exaggerations report ran in berlin for example that the poor princess was killed beaten or trampled to death which we clearly see she was not voltaire in that mass of angry calumnies very mendacious indeed which he calls vie privee du roi de prusse mentions the matter with emphasis and says farther the princess once did him voltaire the honor to show him a black mark she carried on her breast ever afterwhich is likelier to be false than true captain guy dickens the legationary captain who seems a clear ingenuous and ingenious man and of course had access to the highest circles of refined rumor reports the matter about ten days after with several errors in this manner  berlin 5th september 1730 four or five days ago by the almanac nine and directly on his majestys return which dickens had announced a week ago without that fact attached the king dreadfully illtreated wilhelmina in bed not in bed at all whole castle schloss or palace was alarmed guard turned outto clear away the crowd as we perceive not properly a crowd such was not permissible there but a stagnation of the passersby would naturally ensue on that esplanade till the guard turned out and indicated with emphasis move on dickens hears farther that the queen fares no bettersuch is the state of rumor in berlin at present  poor katte had a hard audience of it too he fell at friedrich wilhelms feet and was spurned and canedfor the rest beyond what was already evident had little or nothing to confess intention of flight and of accompanying in flight very undeniable although preliminaries and ulterior conditions of said flight not perfectly known to katte known only that the thought of raising trouble in foreign courts or the least vestige of treason against his majesty had not entered even into their dreams a name or two of persons who had known or guessed of these operations is wrung from kattename of a lieutenant spaen for one who being on guard had admitted katte into potsdam once or twice in disguisefor him and for the like of him of whatever rank or whichever sex let arrests be made out and the scent as with sleuthhounds be diligently followed on all sides and katte stript of his uniform be locked up in the grimmest manner berlin with the rumor of these things is a muchagitated city     chapter viii  sequel to crownprince and friends  as for the crownprince prosecuting his circuitous route he arrives safe at mittenwalde is lodged in the old castle there i think for two nights but the date in these indexless books is blown away again in a room bare of all things with sentries at the door and looks out expecting grumkow and the officials to make assault on him one of these officials a certain gerber fiscal general who as head of prussian fiscals kind of public prosecutor or supreme essence of bailiffs catchpoles and grandjuries all in one wears a red cloakgave the prince a dreadful start red cloak is the berlin hangmans or headsmans dress and poor friedrich had the idea his end had summarily come in this manner soon seeing it was otherwise his spirits recovered perhaps rose by the shock  he fronted grumkow and the officials with a high almost contemptuous look answered promptlyif possible without lying and yet without telling anythingshowed selfpossession pride retorted sometimes have you nothing more to ask grumkow finding there was no way made into anything not even into the secret of the writingcase and the royal womens operations there began at last as wilhelmina says to hint that in his majestys service there were means of bringing out the truth in spite of refractory humors that there was a thing called the rack not yet abolished in his prussian majestys dominions friedrich owned afterwards his blood ran cold however he put on a high look a hangman such as you naturally takes pleasure in talking of his tools and his trade but on me they will not produce any effect i have owned everythingand almost regret to have done so for it is not my part to stand questionings and bandy responses with a coquin comme vous scoundrel like you reports wilhelmina i 280 though we hope the actual term was slightly less candidgrumkow gathered his notes together and went his ways with the man in red cloak and the rest thus finishing the scene in mittenwalde mittenwalde which we used to know long since in our wusterhausen rides with poor duhan little thinking what awaited us there one day  mittenwalde being finished friedrich on monday 6th september 1730 is sent forward to custrin a strong little town in a quiet country some sixty or seventy miles eastward of berlin on the evening of the 5th he finds himself lodged in a strong room of the fortress thereroom consisting af bare walls lighted from far up no furniture not even the needfulest everything indicating that the proud spirit and the iron laws shall here have their duel out at leisure and see which is stronger  his sword was taken from him at wesel sword uniform every mark of dignity all are now gone he is clad in brown prisondress of the plainest cut and cloth his diet is fixed at tenpence a day to be got from the cooks shop six groschen for dinner four for supper order 14th september 1730 in forster i 372 food to be cut for him no knife allowed room is to be opened morning noon and evening on the average not above four minutes each time lights or single tallowlight to be extinguished at seven pm absolute solitude no flute allowed far from it no books allowed except the bible and a prayerbookor perhaps nolteniuss manual if he took a hankering for it there shut out from the babble of fools and conversing only with the dumb veracities with the huge inarticulate meanings of destiny necessity and eternity let the fool of a fritz bethink himself if there is any thought in him there among the bogs of the oder the very sedges getting brown all round him and the very curlews flying off for happier climes let him wait till the question of his doom rather an abstruse question ripen in the royal breast  as for wilhelmina she is close prisoner in her apartments in the berlin palace sentries pacing at every outlet for many months to come wilhelmina almost rather likes it such a dog of an existence has she had hitherto for want of being well let alone she plays reads composes music smuggles letters to and from mammaone in pencil from my brother even o heavens wilhelmina weeps now and then with her good sonsfeld hopes nevertheless there will be some dawn to this ragnarok or general twilight of the gods friedrich wilhelm convinced that england has had a hand in this treason signifies officially to his excellency captain dickens that the english negotiations are concluded that neither in the way of singlemarriage nor of doublemarriage will he have anything more to do with england well answers england who can help it negotiation was not quite of our seeking let it so end dickenss despatch 25th september 1730 and harringtons answer to it of 6th october seckendorf in forster iii 9 23d septembernay at dinner one day seckendorf reports while fritz was on the road to custrin he proposes the toast downfall of england seckendorf in forster iii 11 and would have had the queen drink it who naturally wept but i conjecture could not be made to drink her majesty is a weeping almost brokenhearted woman his majesty a raging almost brokenhearted man seckendorf and grumkow are as it were too victorious and now have their apprehensions on that latter score but they look on with countenances well veiled and touch the helm judiciously in tobaccoparliament intent on the nearest harbor of refuge  her majesty nevertheless steadily persists merely sinks deeper out of sight with her english schemes ducking till the wave go by messages desperate appeals still go through mamsell bulow wilhelminas hofdame and other channels nay wilhelmina thinks there were still intentions on the part of england and that the nonfulfilment of them at the last moment turned on accident english courier arrived some hours too late thinks wilhelmina wilhelmina i 369 384 and preuss and others after her but that is a mistake the negotiation in spite of her majestys endeavors was essentially out england after such a message could not nor did stir farther in the matter  in that writingcase his majesty found what we know nothing but mysterious effects of female art and no light whatever it is a great source of wrath and of sorrow to him that neither in the writingcase nor in kattes or the princes socalled confessions can the thing be seen into a deeper bottom it must have thinks his majesty but knows not what or where to overturn the country belike and fling the kaiser and european balance of power bottom uppermost me they presumably meant to poison he tells seckendorf one day dickenss despatch 16th september 1730 was ever father more careful for his children soul and body anxious to excess to bring them up in orthodox nurture and admonition and this is how they reward me herr feldzeugmeister had he honestly confessed and told me the whole truth at wesel i would have made it up with him quietly there but now it must go its lengths and the whole world shall be judge between us seckendorf forster ubi supra 23d september  his majesty is in a flaming height he arrests punishes and banishes where there is trace of cooperation or connection with deserter fritz and his schemes the bulows brother and sister brother in the kings service sister in wilhelminas respectable goldstick people originally of hanover are hurled out to lithuania and the worlds end let them live in memel and repent as they can minister knyphausen always of english tendencies he with his wifeto whom it is specially hard while general schwerin gallant witty kurt once of mecklenburg stays behindis ordered to disappear and follow his private rural business far off no minister ever more the lieutenant spaen of the giant regiment who kept false watch and did not tell of katte gets cashiering and a year in spandau he wandered elsewhither and came to something afterwards poor spaen preuss i 63 66 bookseller hanau with this bad fritzs books to memel with him also let him deal in more orthodox kinds of literature there  it is dangerous to have lent the crownprince money contrary to the royal edict lucky if loss of your money will settle the account witness french montholieu for one count or whatever he styled himself nailed to the gallows in effigy after he had fled it is dangerous to have spoken kindly to the crownprince or almost to have been spoken to by him doris ritter a comely enough good girl nothing of a beauty but given to music potsdam cantors precentors daughter has chanced to be standing in the door perhaps to be singing within doors once or twice when the prince passed that way prince inquired about her music gave her music spoke a civility as young men willnothing more upon my honor though his majesty believes there was much more and condemns poor doris to be whipt by the beadle and beat hemp for three years rhadamanthus is a strict judge your majesty and might be a trifle better informedpoor doris got out of this sad pickle on her own strength and wedded and did well enoughprince and king happily leaving her alone thenceforth voltaire twenty years after had the pleasure of seeing her at berlin wife of one shommers clerk of the hackneycoach officeread schomer farmer of the berlin hackneycoach enterprise in general decidedly a poor man wife by this time was grown hard enough of feature tall lean looked like a sibyl not the least appearance how she could ever have deserved to be whipt for a prince voltaire oeuvres calumnious vie privee du roi de prusse ii 51 52 preuss i 64 66  the excellent tutor of the crownprince good duhan de jandun for what fault or complicity we know not is hurled off to memel ordered to live thereon what resources is equally unknown apparently his fault was the general one of having miseducated the prince and introduced these french literatures foreign poisonous elements of thought and practice into the mind of his pupil which have ruined the young man for his majesty perceives that there lies the source of it that only total perversion of the heart and judgment first of all can have brought about these dreadful issues of conduct and indeed his majesty understands on credible information that deserter fritz entertains very heterodox opinions opinion on predestination for onewhich is itself calculated to be the very mother of mischief in a young mind inclined to evil the heresy about predestination or the freie gnadenwahl election by free grace as his majesty terms it according to which a man is preappointed from all eternity either to salvation or the opposite which is fritzs notion and indeed is calvins and that of many benighted creatures this editor among them appears to his majesty an altogether shocking one nor would the whole synod of dort or calvin or st augustine in person aided by a thirtyeditor power reconcile his majestys practical judgment to such a tenet what may not deserter fritz say to himself even now or in whatever other deeps of sin he may fall into i was foredoomed to it how could i or how can i help it the mind of his majesty shudders as if looking over the edge of an abyss he is meditating much whether nothing can be done to save the lost fritz at least the soul of him from this horrible delusionhurls forth your fine duhan with his metaphysics to remote memel as the first step and signifies withal though as yet only historically and in a speculative way to finkenstein and kalkstein themselves that their method of training up a young soul to do gods will and accomplish useful work in this world does by no means appear to the royal mind an admirable one his letter to them 3d december 1730 in forster ii 382 finkenstein and kalkstein were always covertly rather of the queens party and now stand reprimanded and in marked disfavor  that the treasonous mystery of this crownprince parricidal it is likely and tending to upset the universe must be investigated to the very bottom and be condignly punished probably with death his majesty perceives too well and also what terrible difficulties formal and essential there will be but whatever become of his perishable life ought not if possible the soul of him to be saved from the claws of satan claws of satan brand from the burning for christ our saviours sake in the name of the most merciful god father son and holy ghost amenso friedrich wilhelm phrases it in those confused old documents and cabinet letters of his forster i 374 379 c which awaken a strange feeling in the attentive reader and show us the ruggedest of human creatures melted into blubbering tenderness and growling huskily something which we perceive is real prayer here has a business fallen out such as seldom occurred before     chapter ix  courtmartial on crownprince and consorts  the rumor of these things naturally fills all minds and occupies all human tongues in berlin and prussia though an edict threatens that the tongues shall be cut out which speak of them in any way dickens of 7th november 1730 and sounds far and wide into foreign courts and countries where there is no such edict friedrich wilhelms conduct looked at from without appears that of a hideous royal ogre or blind anthropophagous polyphemus fallen mad looked at from within where the polyphemus has his reasons and a kind of inner rushlight to enlighten his path and is not bent on maneating but on discipline in spite of difficultiesit is a wild enough piece of humanity not so much ludicrous as tragical never was a royal bear so led about before by a pair of conjuring pipers in the market or brought to such a pass in his dancing for them  general ginkel the dutch ambassador here writes dickens told me of an interview he had with the king being ordered by their high mightinesses to solicit his majesty in this matter king harbors most monstrous wicked designs not fit to be spoken of in words reports ginkel it is certain added he if the king of prussia continue in the mind he is in at present we shall see scenes here as wicked and bloody as any that were ever heard of since the creation of the world will sacrifice his whole family not the crownprince alone everybody except grumkow being as he fancies in conspiracy against him poor enchanted kingand all these things he said with such imprecations and disordered looks foaming at the mouth all the while as it was terrible either to see or hear that is ginkels report as dickens conveys it despatch 7th september 1730 another time on new order a month later when ginkel went again to speak a word for the poor prisoner he found his majesty clothed not in delirious thunder but in sorrowful thick fog ginkel was the less able to judge what the king of prussia meant to do with his son as it was evident the king himself did not know ib 10th october  poor friedrich wilhelm through these months wanders about shifting from room to room in the nighttime like a man possessed by evil fiends orders his carriage for wusterhausen at two in the morning but finds he is no better there and returns drinks a great deal has not gone to bed sober for a month past ib 19th december 1730 one night he comes gliding like a perturbed ghost about midnight with his candle in his hand into the queens apartment says wildly staring he thinks there is something haunting himo feekin erring disobedient wife wilt not thou protect me after all whither can i fly when haunted except to thee feekin like a prudent woman makes no criticism orders that his majestys bed be made up in her apartment till these phenomena cease ib 27th february 1731 a muchagitated royal father  the question what is to be done with this unhappy crownprince a deserter from the army a rebel against the paternal majesty and a believer in the doctrine of election by free grace or that a mans good or ill conduct is foredoomed upon him by decree of godbecomes more intricate the longer one thinks of it seckendorf and grumkow alarmed at being too victorious are set against violent high methods and suggest this and that consideration who is it that can legally try condemn or summon to his bar a crownprince he is prince of the empire as well as your majestys sonwell he is heir of the sovereign majesty in prussia too and colonel in the potsdam guards answers friedrich wilhelm  at length after six or seven weeks of abstruse meditation it is settled in tobaccoparliament and the royal breast that katte and the crownprince as deserters from the prussian army can and shall be tried by courtmartial to that no power on the earth or out of it can have any objection worth attending to let a fair courtmartial of our highest military characters be selected and got ready let that as a voice of rhadamanthus speak upon the two culprits and tell us what is to be done by the middle of october things on friedrich wilhelms side have got so far     crownprince in custrin  poor friedrich meanwhile has had a grim time of it these two months back left alone in coarse brown prisondress within his four bare walls at custrin in uninterrupted unfathomable colloquy with the destinies and the necessities there the kings stern orders must be fulfilled to the letter the crownprince is immured in that manner at berlin there are the wildest rumors as to the state he has fallen into covered with rags and vermin unshaven no comb allowed him lights his own fire says one testimony which captain dickens thinks worth reporting for the truth is no unofficial eye can see the crownprince or know what state he is in and we find in spite of the edict tongues not cut out kept wagging at a high rate people of all ranks are unspeakably indignant at certain heights of the business margravine albert said publicly a tyrant as bad as nero dickens 7th november 2d december 1730  how long the crownprinces defiant humor held out we are not told by the middle of october there comes proposal of entire confession from the prince and though when papa sends deputies accordingly there is next to nothing new confessed and papas anger blazes out again probably we may take this as the turningpoint on his sons part with him of course that mood of mind could not last there is no wildest lion but finding his bars are made of iron ceases to bite them the crownprince there in his horror indignation and despair had a lucid human judgment in him too loyal to facts and well knowing their inexorable nature just sentiments are in this young man not capable of permanent distortion into spasm by any form of injustice laid on them it is not long till he begins to discern athwart this terrible quasiinfernal element that so the facts are and that nothing but destruction and no honor that were not dishonor will be got by not conforming to the facts my father may be a tyrant and driven mad against me well well let not me at least go mad  grumkow is busy on the mild side of the business of course grumkow and all official men grumkow cannot but ask himself this question among others how if the king should suddenly die upon us grumkow is out at custrin and again out explaining to the prince what the enormous situation is how inflexible inexorable and of peril and horror incalculable to mother and sister and self and royal house and that there is one possibility of good issue and only one that of loyally yielding where one cannot resist by degrees some lurid troublous but perceptible lightgleam breaks athwart the black whirlwind of our indignation and despair and saner thoughts begin to insinuate themselves obey thou art not the strongest there are stronger than thou all men the highest among them are called to learn obedience  moreover the first sweep of royal fury being past his majestys stern regulations at custrin began to relax in fulfilment to be obeyed only by those immediately responsible and in letter rather than in spirit even by those president von munchow who is head of the domainkammer chief representative of government at custrin and resides in the fortress there ventures after a little the princes doors being closed as we saw to have an orifice bored through the floor above and thereby to communicate with the prince and sympathetically ask what he can do for him many things books among others are under cunning contrivance smuggled in by the judicious munchow willing to risk himself in such a service for example munchow has a son a clever boy of seven years old who to the wonder of neighbors goes into childspetticoats again and testifies the liveliest desire to be admitted to the prince and bear him company a little surely the law of nocompany does not extend to that of an innocent child the innocent child has a row of pockets all round the inside of his long gown and goes laden miscellaneously like a ship of the desert or cockboat not forbidden to cross the line then there are stools one stool at least indispensable to human nature and the inside of this once you open it is a chestofdrawers containing paper ink new literature and much else no end to munchowa goodwill and his ingenuity is great preuss i 46  a captain fouquet also furthered i think by the old dessauer whose man he is comes to custrin garrison on duty or as volunteer by and by he is an old friend of the princesran off being the dessauers little page to the siege of stralsund long ago to be the dessauers little soldier therea readywitted hottempered highly estimable man and his real duty here is to do the prince what service may be possible he is often with the prince their light is extinguished precisely at seven oclock very well lieutenant he would say you have done your orders to the crownprinces light but his majesty has no concern with captain fouquets candles and thereupon would light a pair nay i have heard of lieutenants who punctually blew out the princes light as a matter of duty and command and then kindled it again as a civility left free to human nature in short his majestys orders can only be fulfilled to the letter commandant lepel and all officers are willing not to see where they can help seeing even in the letter his majestys orders are severe enough     sentence of courtmartial  meanwhile the courtmartial selected with intense study installs itself at copenick and on the 25th of october commences work this deserter crownprince and his accomplices especially katte his chief accomplice what is to be done with them copenick lies on the road to custrin within a mornings drive of berlin there is an ancient palace here and room for a courtmartial que faire ils ont des canons said the old prussian raths wandering about in these woods when gustavus and his swedes were at the door que faire may the new military gentlemen think to themselves here again while the brown leaves rustle down upon them after a hundred years  the court consists of a president lieutenantgeneral schulenburg an elderly malplaquet gentleman of good experience one of the many schulenburgs conspicuous for soldiering and otherwise in those times he is nephew of george is lean mistress who also was a schulenburg originally and conspicuous not for soldiering lean mistress we say not the fat one or cataract of tallow with eyebrows like a cartwheel and dim coaly disks for eyes who was george is halfsister probably not his mistress at all and who now as countess of darlington so called sits at isleworth with good fat pensions and a tame raven comeofwillprobably the soul of george i in some form see walpole reminiscences not this one we saybut the threadpaper duchess of kendal actual exmistress who tore her hair on the road when apoplexy overtook poor george and who now attends chapel diligently poor old anatomy or lean human nailrod for the sake of the english reader searching into what is called history i with indignation endeavor to discriminate these two beings once again that each may be each till both are happily forgotten to all eternity it was the latter lean maypole or nailrod one that was aunt of schulenburg the elderly malplaquet gentleman who now presides at copenick and let the reader remember him for he will turn up repeatedly again  the court consisted farther of three majorgenerals among whom i name only grumkow majorgeneral by rank though more of a diplomatist and blackartist than a soldier and schwerin kurt von schwerin of mecklenburg whom madam knyphausen regrets in her now exile to the country three colonels derschau one of them three lieutenantcolonels three majors and three captains all of whom shall be nameless here lastly come three of the auditor or the judgeadvocate sort mylius the compiler of sad prussian quartos known to some gerber whose red cloak has frightened us once already and the auditor of kattes regiment a complete courtmartial and of symmetrical structure by the rule of threeof whose proceedings we know mainly the result nor seek much to know more this court met on wednesday 25th october 1730 in the little town of copenick and in six days had ended signed sealed and despatched to his majesty and got back to berlin on the tuesday next his majesty who is now at wusterhausen in hunting time finds conclusions to the following effect  accomplices of the crownprince are two first lieutenant keith actual deserter who cannot be caught to be hanged in effigy cut in four quarters and nailed to the gallows at weselgood says his majesty secondly lieutenant katte of the gensdarmes intended deserter not actually deserting and much tempted thereto all things considered perpetual fortress arrest to lieutenant kattenot good this bad this thinks majesty this provokes from his majesty an angry rebuke to the too lax courtmartial rebuke which can still be read in growling unlucid phraseology but with a rhadamanthine idea clear enough in it and with a practical purport only too clear that katte was a sworn soldier of the gensdarmes even or bodyguard of the prussian majesty and did nevertheless in the teeth of his oath worship the rising sun when minded to desert did plot and colleague with foreign courts in aid of said rising sun and of an intended high crime against the prussian majesty itself on rising suns part far from at once revealing the same as duty ordered lieutenant katte to do that kattes crime amounts to hightreason crimen loesoe majestatis that the rule is fiat justitia et pereat mundusand that in brief kattes doom is and is hereby declared to be death death by the gallows and hot pincers is the usual doom of traitors but his majesty will say in this case death by the sword and headsman simply certain circumstances moving the royal clemency to go so far no farther and the courtmartial has straightway to apprise katte of this same and so doing shall say that his majesty is sorry for katte but that it is better he die than that justice depart out of the world preuss i 44  this is the iron doom of katte which no prayer or influence of mortal will avail to alterlest justice depart out of the world kattes father is a general of rank commandant of konigsberg at this moment kattes grandfather by the mothers side old fieldmarshal wartensleben is a man in good favor with friedrich wilhelm and of high esteem and mark in his country for half a century past but all this can effect nothing old wartensleben thinks of the daughter he lost for happily kattes mother is dead long since old wartensleben writes to friedrich wilhelm his mournful letter and friedrich wilhelms mournful but inexorable answer can be read in the histories but show only what we already know  kattes mother fieldmarshal wartenslebens daughter died in 1706 leaving katte only two years old he is now twentysix very young for such grave issues and his fate is certainly very hard poor young soul he did not resist farther or quarrel with the inevitable and inexorable he listened to chaplain muller of the gensdarmes admitted profoundly after his fashion that the great god was just and the poor katte sinful foolish only to be saved by miracle of mercy and piously prepared himself to die on these terms there are three letters of his to his grandfather which can still be read one of them in wilhelminas book wilhelmina i 302 the sound of it like that of dirges borne on the wind wilhelmina evidently pities katte very tenderly in her heart she has a fine royalmaiden kind of feeling to the poor youth he did heartily repent and submit left with chaplain muller a paper of pious considerations admonishing the prince to submit these are kattes last employments in his prison at berlin after sentence had gone forth     kattes end 6th november 1780  on sunday evening 6th november it is intimated to him unexpectedly at the moment that he has to go to custrin and there diecarriage now waiting at the gate katte masters the sudden flurry signifies that all is ready then and so under charge of his old major and two brother officers who and chaplain muller are in the carriage with him a troop of his own old cavalry regiment escorting he leaves berlin rather on sudden summons drives all night towards custrin and immediate death words of sympathy were not wanting to which katte answered cheerily grim faces wore a cloud of sorrow for the poor youth that night chaplain mullers exhortations were fervent and continual and from time to time there were heard hoarsely melodious through the damp darkness and the noise of wheels snatches of devotional singing led by muller  it was in the gray of the winter morning 6th november 1730 that katte arrived in custrin garrison he took kind leave of major and men adieu my brothers good be with you evermoreand about nine oclock he is on the road towards the rampart of the castle where a scaffold stands katte wore by order a brown dress exactly like the princes the prince is already brought down into a lower room to see katte as he passes to see katte die had been the royal order but they smuggled that into abeyance and katte knows he shall see him faithful muller was in the deathcar along with katte and he had adjoined to himself one besserer the chaplain of the garrison in this sad function since arriving here is a glimpse from besserer which we may take as better than nothing  his kattes eyes were mostly directed to god and we muller and i on our part strove to hold his heart up heavenwards by presenting the examples of those who had died in the lordas of gods son himself and stephen and the thief on the crosstill under such discoursing we approached the castle here after long wistful looking about he did get sight of his beloved jonathan royal highness the crownprince at a window in the castle from whom he with the politest and most tender expression spoken in french took leave with no little emotion of sorrow letter to kattes father extract in preuss friedrich mit freunden und verwandten p 7  president munchow and the commandant were with the prince whose emotions one may fancy but not describe seldom did any prince or man stand in such a predicament vain to say and again say in the name of god i ask you stop the execution till i write to the king impossible that as easily stop the course of the stars and so here katte comes cheerful loyalty still beaming on his face death now nigh pardonnezmoi mon cher katte cried priedrich in a tone pardon me dear katte oh that this should be what i have done for youdeath is sweet for a prince i love so well said katte la mort est douce pour un si aimable prince wilhelmina i 307 preuss i 45 and fared onround some angle of the fortress it appears not in sight of friedrich who sank into a faint and had seen his last glimpse of katte in this world  the body lay all day upon the scaffold by royal order and was buried at night obscurely in the common churchyard friends in silence took mark of the place against better timesand kattes dust now lies elsewhere among that of his own kindred  never was such a transaction before or since in modern history cries the angry reader cruel like the grinding of human hearts under millstones like or indeed like the doings of the gods which are cruel though not that alone this is what after much sorting and sifting i could get to know about the definite facts of it commentary not likely to be very final at this epoch the reader himself shall supply at discretion   end of book 7
