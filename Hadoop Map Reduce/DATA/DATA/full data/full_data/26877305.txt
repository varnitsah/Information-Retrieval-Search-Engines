26877305	history of friedrich ii of prussia  frederick the great  by thomas carlyle     book vdoublemarriage project and what element it fell into17231726     chapter i  doublemarriage is decided on  we saw george i at berlin in october 1723 looking out upon his little grandson drilling the cadets there but we did not mention what important errand had brought his majesty thither  visits between hanover and berlin had been frequent for a long time back the young queen of prussia sometimes with her husband sometimes without running often over to see her father who even after his accession to the english crown was generally for some months every year to be met with in those favorite regions of his he himself did not much visit being of taciturn splenetic nature but this once he had agreed to return a visit they had lately made himwhere a certain weighty business had been agreed upon withal which his britannic majesty was to consummate formally by treaty when the meeting in berlin took effect his britannic majesty accordingly is come the business in hand is no other than that thricefamous doublemarriage of prussia with england which once had such a sound in the ear of rumor and still bulks so big in the archives of the eighteenth century which worked such woe to all parties concerned in it and is in fact a firstrate nuisance in the history of that poor century as written hitherto nuisance demanding urgently to be abatedwere that well possible at present which alas it is not to any great degree there being an important young friedrich inextricably wrapt up in it to whom it was of such vital or almost fatal importance without a friedrich the affair could be reduced to something like its real size and recorded in a few pages or might even with advantage be forgotten altogether and become zero more gigantic instance of much ado about nothing has seldom occurred in human annalshad not there been a friedrich in the heart of it  crownprince friedrich is still very young for marriagespeculations on his score but mamma has thought good to take matters in time and so we shall in the next ensuing parts of this poor history have to hear almost as much about marriage as in the foolishest threevolume novel and almost to still less purpose for indeed in that particular friedrichs young life may be called a romance flung hellsoverhead marriage being the one event there round which all events turnbut turn in the inverse or reverse way as if the devil were in them not only towards no happy goal for him or mamma or us but at last towards hardly any goal at all for anybody so mad did the affair growand is so madly recorded in those inextricable dateless chaotic books we have now come to regions of narrative which seem to consist of murky nothingness put on boil not land or water or air or fire but a tumultuously whirling commixture of all the fourof immense extent too which must be got crossed in some human manner courage patience good reader     queen sophie dorothee has taken time by the forelock  already for a dozen years this matter has been treated of queen sophie dorothee ever since the birth of her wilhelmina has had the notion of it and on her first visit afterwards to hanover proposed it to princess carolinequeen caroline of england who was to be and who in due course wasan excellent accomplished brandenburganspach lady familiar from of old in the prussian court you caroline cousin dear have a little prince fritz or let us call him fred since he is to be english little fred who will one day if all go right be king of england he is two years older than my little wilhelmina why should not they wed and the two chief protestant houses and nations thereby be united princess caroline was very willing so was electress sophie the greatgrandmother of both the parties so were the georges father and grandfather of fred little fred himself was highly charmed when told of it even little wilhelmina with her dolls looked pleasantly demure on the occasion so it remained settled in fact though not in form and little fred a florid milkfaced foolish kind of boy i guess made presents to his little prussian cousin wrote bits of loveletters to her and all along afterwards fancied himself and at length ardently enough became her little lover and intendedalways rather a little fellowto which sentiments wilhelmina signifies that she responded with the due maidenly indifference but not in an offensive manner  after our prussian fritzs birth the matter took a still closer form you dear princess caroline you have now two little princesses again either of whom might suit my little fritzchen let us take amelia the second of them who is nearest his age agreed answered princess caroline again agreed answered all the parties interested and so it was settled that the marriage of prussia to england should be a double one fred of hanover and england to wilhelmina fritz of prussia to amelia and children and parents lived thenceforth in the constant understanding that such in due course of years was to be the case though nothing yet was formally concluded by treaty upon it pollnitz memoiren ii 193  queen sophie dorothee of prussia was always eager enough for treaty and conclusion to her scheme true to it she as needle to the pole in all weathers sometimes in the wildest weather poor lady nor did the hanover serene highnesses at any time draw back or falter but having very soon got wafted across to england into new more complex conditions and wider anxieties in that new country they were not so impressively eager as queen sophie on this interesting point electress sophie judicious greatgrandmother was not now there electress sophie had died about a month before queen anne and never saw the english canaan much as she had longed for it george i her son a taciturn rather splenetic elderly gentleman very foreign in england and oftenest rather sulky there and elsewhere was not in a humor to be forward in that particular business  george i had got into quarrel with his prince of wales freds fatherhim who is one day to be george ii always a rather foolish little prince though his wife caroline was wisdoms self in a mannergeorge i had other much more urgent cares than that of marrying his disobedient foolish little prince of waless offspring and he always pleaded difficulties acts of parliament that would be needed and the like whenever sophie dorothee came to visit him at hanover and urge this matter the taciturn inarticulately thoughtful rather sulky old gentleman he had weighty burdens lying on him felt fretted and galled in many ways and had found life electoral and even royal a deceptive sumptuosity little better than a more or less extensive feast of shells next to no real meat or drink left in it to the hungry heart of man wife sitting halffrantic in the castle of ahlden waxing more and more into a grayhaired megaera with whom sophie dorothee under seven seals of secrecy corresponds a little and even the prince of wales is suspected of wishing to correspond a foolish disobedient prince of wales jacobite pretender people with their mar rebellions with their alberoni combinations an english parliament jangling and debating unmelodiously whose very language is a mystery to us nothing but walpole in doglatin to help us through it truly it is not a heavenonearth altogether much as mother sophie and her foolish favorite our disobedient prince of wales might long for it and the hanover tail the robethons bernstorfs fabrices even the blackamoor portersthey are not beautiful either to a taciturn majesty of some sense if he cared about their doings or them voracious plunderous all of them like hounds long hungry got into a rich house which has no master or a mere imaginary one menteris impudentissime said walpole in his doglatin once in our royal presence to one of these official plunderous gentlemen you tell an impudent lieat which we only laughed horace walpole reminiscences of george i and george ii london 1786  his britannic majesty by no means wanted sense had not his situation been incurably absurd in his young time he had served creditably enough against the turks twice commanded the reichsarmy in the marlborough wars and did at least testify his indignation at the inefficient state of it his foreign politics so called were not madder than those of others bremen and verden he had bought a bargain and it was natural to protect them by such resources as he had english or other then there was the worldspectre of the pretender stretching huge over creation like the brockenspectre in hazy weatheragainst whom how protect yourself except by cannonading for the kaiser at messina by rushing into every brabble that rose and hiring the parties with money to fight it out well it was the established method in that matter method not of georges inventing nor did it cease with george as to domestic politics except it were to keep quiet and eat what the gods had provided one does not find that he had anythe sage leibnitz would very fain have followed him to england but for reasons indifferently good could never be allowed if the truth must be told the sage leibnitz had a wisdom which now looks dreadfully like that of a wiseacre in mathematics evenhe did invent the differential calculus but it is certain also he never could believe in newtons system of the universe nor would read the principia at all for the rest he was in quarrel about newton with the royal society here ill seen it is probable by this sage and the other to the hanover official gentlemen devouring their english deadhorse it did not appear that his presence could be useful in these parts guhrauer gottfried freiherr von leibnitz eine biographie breslau 1842 ker of kersland memoirs of secret transactions london 1727  nor are the hanover womankind his majesty has about him quasiwives or not of a soulentrancing character far indeed from that two in chief there are a fat and a lean the lean called maypole by the english populace is duchess of kendal with excellent pension in the english peeragy schulenburg the former german name of her decidedly a quasiwife influential against her will in that sad konigsmark tragedy at hanover long since who is fallen thin and old maypoleor bare hoppole with the leaves all stript lean long hardthough she once had her summer verdures too and still as an old quasiwife or were it only as an old article of furniture has her worth to the royal mind schulenburgs kindred of hers are high in the military line some of whom we may meet  then besides this lean one there is a fat of whom walpole horace who had seen her in boyhood gives description big staring black eyes with rim of circular eyebrow like a coachwheel round its nave very black the eyebrows also vast red face cheeks running into neck neck blending indistinguishably with stomacha mere cataract of fluid tallow skinned over and curiously dizened according to walpoles portraiture this charming creature kielmannsegge by german name was called countess of darlington in this countrywith excellent pension as was natural they all had pensions even queen sophie dorothee i have noticed in our statepaper office has her small pension 800 pounds a year on the irish establishment irish establishment will never miss such a pittance for our poor child and it may be useful over yonderthis kielmannsegge countess of darlington was and is believed by the gossiping english to have been a second simultaneous mistress of his majestys but seems after all to have been his halfsister and nothing more halfsister due to gentleman ernst and a countess platen of bad hanover fame grown dreadfully fat but not without shrewdness perhaps affection and worth something in this dull foreign country mere cataract of animal oils as she has become these two are the amount of his britannic majestys resources in that matter resources surely not extensive after all  his britannic majestys day in st jamess is not of an interesting sort to him and every evening he comes precisely at a certain hour to drink beer seasoned with a little tobacco and the company of these two women drinks diligently in a sipping way says horace and smokes with such dull speech as there may benot till he is drunk but only perceptibly drunkish raised into a kind of cloudy narcotic olympus and opaquely superior to the ills of life in which state he walks uncomplainingly to bed government when it can by any art be avoided he rarely meddles with shows a rugged sagacity where he does and must meddle consigns it to walpole in doglatinlaughs at his mentiris this is the first george first triumph of the constitutional principle which has since gone to such sublime heights among usheights which we at last begin to suspect might be depths leading down all men now ask whitherwards a muchadmired invention in its time that of letting go the rudder or setting a wooden figure expensively dressed to take charge of it and discerning that the ship would sail of itself so much more easily which it will if a peculiarly good seaboat in certain kinds of seafor a time till the sinbad magnetic mountains begin to be felt pulling or the circles of charybdis get you in their sweep and then what an invention it wasthis we say is the new sovereign man whom the english people being in some perplexity about the pope and other points have called in from hanover to walk before them in the ways of heroism and by command and by example guide heavenwards their affairs and them and they hope that he will do it or perhaps that their affairs will go thither of their own accord always a singular people  poor george careless of these ulterior issues has always trouble enough with the mere daily details parliamentary insolences jacobite plottings southsea bubbles and wishes to hunt when he gets over to hanover rather than to make marriagetreaties besides as wilhelmina tells us they have filled him with lies these hanover women and their emissaries your princess wilhelmina is a monster of illtemper crooked in the back and what not say they if there is to be a marriage double or single these improper females must first be persuaded to consent memoires de bareith difficulties enough and there is none to help friedrich wilhelm cares little about the matter though he has given his yesyes since you will  but sophie dorothee is diligent and urgent by all opportunitiesand at length in 1723 the conjuncture is propitious domestic jacobitism in the shape of bishop atterbury has got itself well banished alberoni and his big schemes years ago they are blown into outer darkness charles xii is well dead and of our bremen and verden no question henceforth even the kaisers spectrehunt or spanish duel is at rest for the present and the congress of cambrai is sitting or trying all it can to sit at home or abroad there is nothing not even woods irish halfpence as yet making noise and on the other hand czar peter is rumored not without foundation to be coming westward with some huge armament which whether intended for sweden or not renders a prussian alliance doubly valuable  and so now at last in this favorable aspect of the stars king george over at herrenhausen was by much management of his daughter sophies and after many hitches brought to the mark and friedrich wilhelm came over too ostensibly to bring home his queen but in reality to hear his fatherinlaws compliance to the doublemarriagefor which his prussian majesty is willing enough if others are willing praised be heaven king george has agreed to everything consents one propitious day autumn 1723 day not otherwise datedczar peters armament and the questionable aspects in france perhaps quickening his volitions a little upon which friedrich wilhelm and queen sophie have returned home content in that matter and expect shortly his britannic majestys countervisit to perfect the details and make a treaty of it  his britannic majesty we say has in substance agreed to everything and now in the silence of nature the brown leaves of october still hanging to the trees in a picturesque manner and woods halfpence not yet begun to jingle in the drapiers letters of dean swifthis britannic majesty is expected at berlin at berlin properly at charlottenburg a pleasant rural or suburban palace built by his britannic majestys late noble sister sophie charlotte the republican queen and named after her as was once mentioned a mile or two southwest of that city there they await king georges countervisit  poor wilhelmina is in much trepidation about it and imparts her poor little feelings her anticipations and experiences in readable terms  there came in those weeks one of the duke of gloucesters gentlemen to berlinduke of gloucester is fred our intended not yet prince of wales and if the reader should ever hear of a duke of edinburgh that too is fredduke of gloucesters gentlemen to berlin says wilhelmina the queen had soiree appartement he was presented to her as well as to me he made me a very obliging compliment on his masters part i blushed and answered only by a courtesy the queen who had her eye on me was very angry i had answered the dukes compliments in mere silence and rated me sharply me lava la tete dimportance for it and ordered me under pain of her indignation to repair that fault tomorrow i retired all in tears to my room exasperated against the queen and against the duke i swore i would never marry him would throw myself at the feet and so on as young ladies of vivacious temper in extreme circumstances are wontdid speak however next day to my hanover gentleman about his duke a little though in an embarrassed manner alas i am yet but fourteen gone the 3d of july last tremulous as aspenleaves or say as sheetlightning bottled in one of the thinnest human skins and have no experience of foolish dukes and affairs  meanwhile continues wilhelmina the king of englands time of arrival was drawing nigh we repaired on the 6th of october to charlottenburg to receive him the heart of me kept beating and i was in cruel agitations king george my grandfather and grand uncle arrived on the 8th about seven in the eveningdusky shades already sinking over nature everywhere and all paths growing dim abundant flunkies of course rush out with torches or what is needful the king of prussia the queen and all their suite received him in the court of the palace the apartments being on the groundfloor so soon as he had saluted the king and queen i was presented to him he embraced me and turning to the queen said to her your daughter is very big of her age he gave the queen his hand and led her into her apartment whither everybody followed them as soon as i came in he took a light from the table and surveyed me from head to foot i stood motionless as a statue and was much put out of countenance all this went on without his uttering the least word having thus passed me in review he addressed himself to my brother whom he caressed much and amused himself with for a good while pretty little grandson this your majestyany future of history in this one think you i says wilhelmina took the opportunity of slipping outhopeful to get away but could not the queen having noticed  the queen made me a sign to follow her and passed into a neighboring apartment where she had the english and germans of king georges suite successively presented to her after some talk with these gentlemen she withdrew leaving me to entertain them and saying speak english to my daughter you will find she speaks it very well i felt much less embarrassed once the queen was gone and picking up a little courage i entered into conversation with these english as i spoke their language like my mothertongue i got pretty well out of the affair and everybody seemed charmed with me they made my eulogy to the queen told her i had quite the english air and was made to be their sovereign one day it was saying a great deal on their part for these english think themselves so much above all other people that they imagine they are paying a high compliment when they tell any one he has got english manners  their king my grandpapa had got spanish manners i should say he was of an extreme gravity and hardly spoke a word to anybody he saluted madam sonsfeld my invaluable thricedear governess very coldly and asked her if i was always so serious and if my humor was of the melancholy turn anything but that sire answered the other but the respect she has for your majesty prevents her from being as sprightly as she commonly is he wagged his head and answered nothing the reception he had given me and this question of which i heard gave me such a chill that i never had the courage to speak to himwas merely looked at with a candle by grandpapa  we were summoned to supper at last where this grave sovereign still remained dumb perhaps he was right perhaps he was wrong but i think he followed the proverb which says better hold your tongue than speak badly at the end of the repast he felt indisposed the queen would have persuaded him to quit table they bandied compliments a good while on the point but at last she threw down her napkin and rose the king of england naturally rose too but began to stagger the king of prussia ran up to help him all the company ran bustling about him but it was to no purpose he sank on his knees his peruke falling on one side and his hat or at least his head madam on the other they stretched him softly on the floor where he remained a good hour without consciousness the pains they took with him brought back his senses by degrees at last the queen and the king of prussia were in despair all this while many have thought this attack was a herald of the stroke of apoplexy which came by and bywithin four years from this date and carried off his majesty in a very gloomy manner  they passionately entreated him to retire now continues wilhelmina but he would not by any means he led out the queen and did the other ceremonies according to rule had a very bad night as we learned underhand but persisted stoically nevertheless being a crowned majesty and bound to it he stoically underwent four or three other days of festival sightseeing pleasure so calledamong other sights saw little fritz drilling his cadets at berlinand on the fourth day 12th october 1723 so thinks wilhelmina fairly signed the treaty of the doublemarriage english townshend and the prussian ministry having settled all things wilhelmina memoires de bareith i 83 87in coxe memoirs of sir robert walpole london 1798 ii 266 272 273 are some faint hints from townshend of this berlin journey  signed the treaty thinks wilhelmina all things being settled which is an error on the part of wilhelmina settled many or all things were by townshend and the others but before signing there was parliament to be apprised there were formalities expenditure of time between the cup and the lip such things to interveneand the sad fact is the doublemarriage treaty never was signed at allhowever all things being now settled ready for signing his britannic majesty next morning set off for the gohrde again to try if there were any hunting possible  this authentic glimpse one of the few that are attainable of their first constitutional king let english readers make the most of the act done proved dreadfully momentous to our little friend his grandson and will much concern us  thus at any rate was the treaty of the doublemarriage settled to the point of signingthought to be as good as signed it was at the time when czar peter was making armaments to burn sweden when woods

rotten europe here or theresince these are sufficient to date the transaction for us and what does not stick to our fritz and his affairs it is more pleasant to us to forget than to remember of such an epoch  hereby for the present is a great load rolled from queen sophie dorothees heart one and that the highest of her abstruse negotiations cherished labored in these fourteen years she has brought to a victorious issuehas she not her poor mother once so radiant now so dim and angry shut in the castle of ahlden does not approve this doublemarriage not she for her partas indeed evil to all hanoverian interests is now chiefly her good poor lady and she is growing more and more of a megaera every day with whom sophie dorothee has her own difficulties and abstruse practices but struggles always to maintain under sevenfold secrecy some thread of correspondence and pious filial ministration wherever possible that the poor exasperated mother wretchedest and angriest of women be not quite cut off from the kinship of the living but that some soft breath of pity may cool her burning heart now and then in memoirs of sophia dorothea london 1845 ii 385 393 are certain fractions of this correspondence edited in an amazing manner a dark tragedy of sophies this the bluebeard chamber of her mind into which no eye but her own must ever look     princess amelia comes into the world  in reference to queen sophie and chronologically if not otherwise connected with this doublemarriage treaty i will mention one other thing her majesty had been in fluctuating health all summer unaccountable symptoms turning up in her majestys constitution languors qualms especially a tendency to swelling or increase of size which had puzzled and alarmed her doctors and her friedrich wilhelm on conclusion of the marriagetreaty had been appointed to join his fatherinlaw britannic george at the gohrde in some three weeks time and have a bout of hunting on the 8th of november bedtime being come he kissed his wilhelmina and the rest by way of goodby intending to start very early on the morrowlong journey 150 miles or so to be done all in one day in the dead of the night queen sophie was seized with dreadful colicspangs of colic or who knows whatfriedrich wilhelm is summoned rises in the highest alarm none but the maids and he at hand to help and the colic or whatever it may be gets more and more dreadful  colic o poor sophie it is travail and no colic and a clever young princess is suddenly the result none but friedrich wilhelm and the maid for midwives mother and infant nevertheless doing perfectly well friedrich wilhelm did not go on the morrow but next day laughed ever and anon in loud hahas at the part he had been playing and was very glad and merry how the experienced sophie whose twelfth child this is came to commit such an oversight is unaccountable but the fact is certain and made a merry noise in court circles pollnitz ii 199 wilhelmina i 87 88  the clever little princess now born in this manner is known by name to idle readers she was christened amelia and we shall hear of her in time coming but there was as the circulating libraries still intimate a certain loudspoken braggart of the histrionicheroic sort called baron trenck windy rash and not without mendacity who has endeavored to associate her with his own transcendent and not undeserved illluck hinting the poor princess into a sad fame in that way for which it would now appear there was no basis whatever most condemnable trenckwhom however robespierre guillotined finally and so settled that account and others  of sophie dorothees twelve children including this amelia there are now eight living two boys six girls and after amelia two others boys are successively to come ten in all who grew to be men and women of whom perhaps i had better subjoin a list now that the eldest boy and girl are about to get settled in life and therewith close this chapter

signing or even to burning and giving up the thought of signing alas how far are we yet from that imperial spectrehuntings and the politics of most european cabinets will connect themselves with that and send it wandering wide enoughlost in such a jungle of intrigues pettifoggings treacheries diplomacies domestic and foreign as the course of truelove never got entangled in before  the whole of which extensive cabinet operations covering square miles of paper at this momenthaving nevertheless after ten years of effort ended in absolute zerowere of no worth even to the managers of them and are of less than none to any mortal now or henceforth so that the method of treating them becomes a problem to history to pitch them utterly out of window and out of memory never to be mentioned in human speech again this is the manifest prompting of natureand this were not our poor crownprince and one or two others involved in them would be our ready and thricejoyful course surely the socalled politics of europe in that day are a thing this editor would otherwise with his whole soul forget to all eternity putrid fermentation ending after the endurance of much malodor in mere zero to you and to every one even to the rotting bodies themselvesis there any wise editor that would connect himself with that these are the fields of history which are to be so soon as humanly possible suppressed which only mephistopheles or the bad genius of mankind can contemplate with pleasure  let us strive to touch lightly the chief summits here and there of that intricate most empty mournful businesswhich was really once a fact in practical europe not the mere nightmare of an attorneys dreamand indicate so far as indispensable how the young friedrich friedrichs sister father mother were tribulated almost heartbroken and done to death by means of it     imperial majesty on the treaty of utrecht  kaiser karl vi head of the holy romish empire at this time was a handsome man to look upon whose life full of expense vicissitude futile labor and adventure did not prove of much use to the world describable as a laborious futility rather he was second son of that little leopold the solemn little herr in red stockings who had such troubles frights and runnings to and fro with the sieging turks liberative sobieskis acquisitive louis fourteenths and who at length ended in a sea of futile labor which they call the spanish succession war  this karl second son had been appointed king of spain in that futile business and with much sublimity though internally in an impoverished condition he proceeded towards spain landing in england to get cash for the outfitarrived in spain and roved about there as titularking for some years with the fighting peterboroughs galways stahrembergs but did no good there neither he nor his peterboroughs at length his brother joseph father leopolds successor having died 17th april 1711 karl came home from spain to be kaiser at which point karl would have been wise to give up his titular kingship in spain for he never got nor will get anything but futile labor from hanging to it he did hang to it nevertheless and still at this date of georges visit and long afterwards hangswith notable obstinacy to the woe of men and nations punishment doubtless of his sins and theirs  kaiser karl shrieked mere amazement and indignation when the english tired of fighting for him and it when the english said to their great marlborough enough you sorry marlborough you have beaten louis xiv to the suppleness of washleather at our bidding that is true and that may have had its difficulties but after all we prefer to have the thing precisely as it would have been without any fighting you therefore what is the good of you you are aperson whom we fling out like sweepings now that our eyesight returns and accuse of common stealing go and be  nothing ever had so disgusted and astonished kaiser karl as this treatmentnot of marlborough whom he regarded only as he would have done a pair of military boots or a holsterpistol of superior excellence for the uses that were in himbut of the kaiser karl his own sublime self the heart and focus of political nature left in this manner now when the sordid english and dutch declined spending blood and money for him farther ungrateful sordid inconceivable souls answered karl was there ever since the early christian times such a martyr as you have now made of me so answered karl in diplomatic groans and shrieks to all ends of europe but the sulky english and allies thoroughly tired of paying and bleeding did not heed him made their peace of utrecht peace of utrecht 11th april 1713 peace of rastadt following upon the preliminaries of baden 6th march 1714 with louis xiv who was now beaten supple and karl after a year of indignant protests and futile attempts to fight louis on his own score was obliged to do the like he has lost the spanish crown but still holds by the shadow of it will not quit that if he can help it he hunts much digests well is a sublime kaiser though internally rather poor carrying his head high and seems to himself on some sides of his life a martyred muchenduring man     imperial majesty has got happily wedded  kaiser karl soon after the time of going to spain had decided that a wife would be necessary he applied to caroline of anspach now english princess of wales but at that time an orphaned brandenburganspach princess very beautiful graceful gifted and altogether unprovided for living at berlin under the guardianship of friedrich the first king her young mother had married againhigh enough match to kursachsen elder brother of august the strong august at that time without prospects of the electoratebut it lasted short while carolines mother and saxon stepfather were both now long since dead so she lived at berlin brilliant though unportionedwith the rough cub friedrich wilhelm much following her about and passionately loyal to her as the beast was to beauty whom she did not mind except as a cub loyal to her being five years older than he forster i 107 indigent bright caroline a young lady of fine aquiline features and spirit was applied for to be queen of spain wooer a handsome man who might even be kaiser by and by indigent bright caroline at once answered no she was never very orthodox in protestant theology but could not think of taking up papistry for lucres and ambitions sake be that always remembered on carolines behalf  the spanish majesty next applied at brunswick wolfenbuttel no lack of princesses there princesa elizabeth for instance protestant she too but perhaps not so squeamish old anton ulrich whom some readers know for the idle books longwinded novels chiefly which he wrote was the grandfather of this favored princess a goodnatured old gentleman of the idle ornamental species in whose head most things it is likely were reduced to vocables scribble and sentimentality and only a steady internal gravitation towards praise and pudding was traceable as very real in him anton ulrich affronted more or less by the immense advancement of gentleman ernst and the hanoverian or younger brunswick line was extremely glad of the imperial offer and persuaded his timid granddaughter ambitious too but rather consciencestricken that the change from protestant to catholic the essentials being so perfectly identical in both was a mere trifle that he himself old as he was would readily change along with her so easy was it whereupon the young lady made the big leap abjured her religion 1st may 1707 at bambergwent to spain as queen with sad injury to her complexion but otherwise successfully more or lessand sits now as empress beside her karl vi in a grand enough probably rather dull but not singularly unhappy manner  she a brunswick princess with nephews and nieces who may concern us is kaiserinn to kaiser karl for aught i know of her a kindly simple wife and unexceptionable sovereign majesty of the sort wanted whom let us remember if we meet her again one day i add only of this poor lady distinguished to me by a daughter she had that her mind still had some misgivings about the big leap she had made in the protestantpapist way finding anton ulrich still continue protestant she wrote to him out of spainwhy o honored grandpapa have you not done as you promised ah there must be a taint of mortal sin in it after all upon which the absurdly situated old gentleman did change his religion and is marked as a convert in all manner of genealogies and historiestruly an old literary gentleman ducal and serene restored to the bosom of the church in a somewhat peculiarly ridiculous manner michaelis i 131but to return     imperial majesty and the termagant of spain  ever after the peace of utrecht when england and holland declined to bleed for him farther especially ever since his own peace of rastadt made with louis the year after kaiser karl had utterly lost hold of the crown of spain and had not the least chance to clutch that bright substance again but he held by the shadow of it with a deadly hapsburg tenacity refused for twenty years under all pressures to part with the shadow the spanish hapsburg branch is dead whereupon do not i of the austrian branch sole representative of kaiser karl the fifth claim by the law of heaven whatever he possessed in spain by law of ditto battles of blenheim of malplaquet courtintrigues of mrs masham and the duchess these may bring treaties of utrecht and what you are pleased to call laws of earthbut a hapsburg kaiser knows higher laws if you would do a thousand utrechts and by these spain is his  poor kaiser karl he had a high thought in him really though a most misguided one titular king of men but much bewildered into mere indolent fatuity inane solemnity high sniffing pride grounded on nothing at all a kaiser much sunk in the sediments of his muddy epoch sure enough he was a proud lofty solemn kaiser infinitely the gentleman in air and humor spanish gravities ceremonials reticencesand could in a better scene have distinguished himself by better than mere statuesque immovability of posture dignified endurance of ennui and hapsburg tenacity in holding the grip it was not till 1735 after tusslings and wrenchings beyond calculation that he would consent to quit the shadow of the crown of spain and let europe be at peace on that score  the essence of what is called the european history of this period such history as a period sunk dead in spirit and alive only in stomach can have turns all on kaiser karl and these his clutchings at shadows which makes a very sad surprising history indeed more worthy to be called phenomena of putrid fermentation than struggles of human heroism to vindicate itself in this planet which latter alone are worthy of recording as history by mankind  on the throne of spain beside philip v the melancholic new bourbon louis xivs grandson sat elizabeth farnese a termagant tenacious woman whose ambitious cupidities were not inferior in obstinacy to kaiser karls and proved not quite so shadowy as his elizabeth also wanted several things renunciation of your kaiser karls shadowy claims nay of sundry real usurpations you and your treaties have made on the actual possessions of spainkingdom of sicily for instance netherlands for instance gibraltar for instance but there is one thing which we observe is indispensable throughout to elizabeth farnese the future settlement of her dear boy carlos carlos whom as spanish philips second wife she had given to spain and the world as second or supplementary infant therea troublesome gift to spain and others  this dear boy surely he must have his italian apanages which you have provided for him duchies of parma and piacenza which will fall heirless soon security for these italian apanages such as will satisfy a mother let us introduce spanish garrisons into parma and piacenza at once how else can we be certain of getting those indispensable apanages when they fall vacant on this point elizabeth farnese was positive maternally vehement would take no subterfuge denial or delay let me perceive that i shall have these duchies that first of all or else not that only but numerous other things will be demanded of you  upon which point the kaiser too who loved his duchies and hoped yet to keep them by some turn of the game never could decide to comply whereupon elizabeth grew more and more termagant listened to wild counsels took up an alberoni a ripperda any wandering diplomatic bulldog that offered and let them loose upon the kaiser and her other gainsayers to the terror of mankind lest universal war should supervene she held the kaiser well at bay mankind well in panic and continually there came on all europe for about twenty years a terror that war was just about to break out and the whole world to take fire the history so called of europe went canting from side to side heeling at a huge rate according to the passes and lunges these two giant figures imperial majesty and the termagant of spain made at one anotherfor a twenty years or more till once the duel was decided between them  there came next to no war after all sputterings of war twice over1718 byng at messina as we saw and then in 1727 a second sputter as we are to seebut the neighbors always ran with buckets and got it quenched no war to speak of but such negotiating diplomatizing universal hope universal fear and infinite ado about nothing as were seldom heard of before for except friedrich wilhelm drilling his 50000 soldiers 80000 gradually and gradually even twice that number i see no crowned head in europe that is not with immeasurable apparatus simply doing zero alas in an age of universal infidelity to heaven where the heavenly sun has sunk there occur strange spectrehuntings which is a fact worth laying to heartduel of twenty years with elizabeth farnese about the eventualities of parma and piacensa and the shadow of the lost crown of spain this was the first grand spectrality of kaiser karls existence but this was not the whole of them     imperial majestys pragmatic sanction  kaiser karl meanwhile was rather short of heirs which formed another of his real troubles and involved him in much shadowhunting his wife the serene brunswick empress whom we spoke of above did at length bring him children brought him a boy even but the boy died within the year and on the whole there remained nothing but two daughters maria theresa the elder of them born 1717the prettiest little maiden in the worldno son to inherit kaiser karl under which circumstances kaiser karl produced now in the year 1724 a document which he had executed privately as long ago as 1713 only his privy councillors and other official witnesses knowing of it then 19th april 1713 stenzel iii 5222 and solemnly publishes it to the world as a thing all men are to take notice of all men had notice enough of this imperial bit of sheepskin before they got done with it fiveandtwenty years hence peace of aixlachapelle 1748 a very famous pragmatic sanction now published for the worlds comfort  by which document kaiser karl had formally settled and fixed according to the power he has in the shape of what they call a pragmatic sanction or unalterable ordinance in his imperial house that failing heirsmale his daughters his eldest daughter should succeed him failing daughters his nieces and in short that heirsfemale ranking from their kinship to kaiser karl and not to any prior kaiser should be as good as heirsmale of karls body would have been a pragmatic sanction is the high name he gives this document or the act it represents pragmatic sanction being in the imperial chancery and some others the received title for ordinances of a very irrevocable nature which a sovereign makes in affairs that belong wholly to himself or what he reckons his own rights a rare kind of deed it would seem and all the more solemn in 1438 charles vi of france conceding the gallican church its liberties does it by sanction pragmatique carlos iii of spain in 1759 settling the kingdom of the two sicilies on his third son does the likewhich is the last instance of pragmatic sanction in this world  this pragmatic sanction of kaiser karls executed 19th april 1713 was promulgated gradually now here now there from 1720 to 1724 stenzel pp 522 523in which later year it became universally public and was transmitted to all courts and sovereignties as an unalterable law of things imperial thereby the good man hopes his beautiful little theresa now seven years old may succeed him all as a son would have done in the austrian states and dignities and incalculable damages wars and chances of war be prevented for his house and for all the world  the world incredulous of tomorrow in its lazy way was not sufficiently attentive to this new law of things some who were personally interested as the saxon sovereignty and the bavarian denied that it was just reminded kaiserkarl that he was not the noah or adam of kaisers and that the case of heirsfemale was not quite a new idea on sheepskin no there are older pragmatic sanctions and settlements by prior kaisers of blessed memory under which if daughters are to come in we descended from imperial daughters of older standing shall have a word to sayto this kaiser karl answers steadily with endless argument that every kaiser is a patriarch and first man in such matters and that so it has been pragmatically sanctioned by him and that so it shall and must irrevocably be to the other powers and indolent impartial sovereigns of the world he was lavish in embassies in ardent representations and spared no pains in convincing them that tomorrow would surely come and that then it would be a blessedness to have accepted this pragmatic sanction and see it lying for you as a law of nature to go by and avoid incalculable controversies  this was another vast shadow or confused highpiled continent of shadows to which our poor kaiser held with his customary tenacity to procure adherences and assurances to this dear pragmatic sanction was even more than the shadow of the spanish crown and above all after he had quitted that the one grand business of his life henceforth with which he kept all europe in perpetual travail and diplomacy raying out ambassadors and less ostensible agents with bribes and with entreaties and proposals into every high sovereign court and every low negotiating unweariedly by all methods with all men for it was his eveningsong and his morningprayer the grand meaning of life to him till life ended you would have said the first question he asks of every creature is will you covenant for my pragmatic sanction with me oh agree to it accept that new law of nature when the morrow comes it will be salutary for you  most of the foreign potentates idly accepted the thingas things of a distant contingent kind are acceptedmade treaty on it since the kaiser seemed so extremely anxious only bavaria having heritable claims never would saxony too august the strong being in the like case or a better flatly refused for a long time would not at allexcept for a consideration bright little prince eugene who dictated square miles of letters and diplomacies on the subject letters of a steady depth of dulness which at last grows almost sublime was wont to tell his majesty treatying your majesty a welltrained army and a full treasury that is the only treaty that will make this pragmatic sanction valid but his majesty never would believe so the bright old eugene dictatedor we hope and guess he only gave his clerks some keyword and signed his name in three languages eugenio von savoye to these square miles of dull epistolary matterprobably taking spanish snuff when he had done for he wears it in both waistcoatpocketshas as his portraits still tell us given up breathing by the nose the bright little soul with a flash in him as of heavens own lightning but now growing very old and snuffy  shadow of pragmatic sanction shadow of the spanish crownit was such shadowhuntings of the kaiser in vienna it was this of the pragmatic sanction most of all that thwarted our prussian doublemarriage which lay so far away from it this it was that pretty nearly broke the hearts of friedrich wilhelmina and their mother and father for there never was such negotiating not for admittance to the kingdom of heaven in the pious times and the open goingsforth of it still more the secret minings and molecourses of it were into all places above ground and below no sovereign mortal could say he was safe from it let him agree or not friedrich wilhelm had cheerfully and with all his heart agreed to the pragmatic sanction this above ground in sight of the sun and rashly fancied he had then done with it till to his horror he found the imperial moles by way of keeping assurance doubly sure had been under the foundations of his very house for long years past and had all but brought it down about him in the most hideous manner     third shadow imperial majestys ostend company  another object which kaiser karl pursued with some diligence in these times and which likewise proved a shadow much disturbance as it gave mankind was his ostend eastindia company the kaiser had seen impoverished spain rich england rich holland he had taken up a creditable notion about commerce and its advantages he said to himself why should not my netherlands trade to the east as well as these english and dutch and grow opulent like them he instituted octroya an ostend eastindia company under due patents and imperial sheepskins of date 17th december 1722 buchholz i 88 pfeffel abrege chronologique de lhistoire dallemagne park 1776 ii 522 gave it what freedom he could to trade to the east impossible answered the dutch with distraction in their aspect impossible we say contrary to treaty of westphalia to utrecht to barrier treaty and destructive to the best interests of mankind especially to us and our tradeprofits we shall have to capture your ships if you ever send any  to which the kaiser counterpleaded earnestly diligently for the space of seven yearsto no effect we will capture your ships if you ever send any answered the dutch and english what ships ever could have been sent from ostend to the east or what ill they could have done there remains a mystery owing to the monopolizing maritime powers  the kaisers laudable zeal for commerce had to expend itself in his adriatic territoriesgiving privileges to the ports of trieste and fiume hormayr oesterreichischer plutarch x 101 making roads through the dalmatian hillcountries which are useful to this daybut could not operate on the netherlands in the way proposed the kaisers imperial ostend eastindia company which convulsed the diplomatic mind for seven years to come and made europe lurch from side to side in a terrific manner proved a mere paper company never sent any ships only produced diplomacies and had the honor to be this was the third grand shadow which the kaiser chased shaking all the world poor crank world as he strode after it and this also ended in zero and several tons of diplomatic correspondence carried once by breathless estaffettes and now silent gravitating towards acheron all of them and interesting to the spiders only  poor good kaiser they say he was a humane stately gentleman stately though shortish fond of pardoning criminals where he could very polite to muratori and the antiquaries even to english rymer in opening his archives to themand made roads in the dalmatian hillcountry which remain to this day i do not wonder he grew more and more saturnine and addicted to solid taciturn fieldsports his political perforcehunt parforce jagd with so many twofooted terriers and legationary beagles distressing all the world by their baying and their burrowing had proved to be of shadows and melted into thin air to a very singular degree     chapter iii  the seven crises or european travailthroes  in process of this so terrific duel with elizabeth farnese and general combat of the shadows which then made europe quake at every new lunge and pass of it and which now makes europe yawn to hear the least mention of it there came two sputterings of actual war byngs seavictory at messina 1718 spanish siege of gibraltar 1727 are the main phenomena of these two warsengland as its wont is taking a shot in both though it has now forgotten both and on the whole there came so far as i can count seven grand diplomatic spasms or crisesdesperate general european treatyings hither and then thither solemn congresses two of them with endless supplementary adhesions by the minor powers seven grand mothertreaties not to mention the daughters or supplementary adhesions they had all europe rising spasmodically seven times and doing its very uttermost to quell this terrible incubus all europe changing color seven times like a lobster boiling for twenty years seven diplomatic crises we say marked changings of color in the longsuffering lobster and two socalled warsbefore this enormous zero could be settled which high treaties and transactions human nature after much study of them grudges to enumerate apanage for baby carlos ghost of a pragmatic sanction these were a pair of causes for mankind be no word spoken of them except with regret and on evident compulsion  for the readers convenience we must note the salient points but grudge to do it salient points now mostly wrapt in orcus and terrestrially interesting only to the spidersexcept on an occasion of this kind when part of them happens to stick to the history of a memorable man to us they are mere bubblingsup of the general putrid fermentation of the then political world and are too unlovely to be dwelt on longer than indispensable triple alliance quadruple alliance congress of cambrai congress of soissons conference of pardo treaty of hanover treaty of wusterhausen what are they echo answers what ripperda and the queen of spain kaiser karl and his pragmatic sanction are fallen dim to every mind the troubles of thorn sad enough papistprotestant tragedy in their timewho now cares to know of them it is much if we find a hearing for the poor salzburg emigrants when they get into preussen itself afflicted human nature ought to be at last delivered from the palpably superfluous and if a few things memorable are to be remembered millions of things unmemorable must first be honestly buried and forgotten but to our affairthat of marking the chief bubblingsup in the abovesaid universal putrid fermentation so far as they concern us     congress of cambrai  we already saw byng sea fighting in the straits of messina that was part of crisis secondsequel in powderandball of crisis first which had been in paper till then the powers had interfered by triple by quadruple alliance to quench the spanishaustrian duel about apanage for baby carlos and a quantity of other shadows triple alliance 4th january 1717 was we may say when france england holland laboriously sorted out terms of agreement between kaiser and termagant quadruple 18th july 1718 was when kaiser after much coaxing acceded as fourth party and said gloomily yes then byngs seafight was when termagant said no bythe plots of alberoni never will i for my part accede to such terms and attacked the poor kaiser in his sicilies and elsewhere byngs seafight in aid of a suffering kaiser and his sicilies in consequence furthermore the french invaded spain till messina were retaken nay the english by land too made a dash at spain descent on vigo as they call itin reference to which take the following stray note  that same year 1719 year after byngs seafight messina just about recaptured there took effect planned by the vigorous colonel stanhope our minister at madrid who took personal share in the thing a descent on vigo sudden swoopdown upon town and shipping in those gallician northwest regions which was perfectly successfullord cobham leadingand made much noise among mankind filled all gazettes at that timebut now again is all fallen silent for usexcept this one thriceinsignificant point that there was in it in handysides regiment a lieutenant of foot by name sterne who had left with his poor wife at plymouth a very remarkable boy called lorry or lawrence known since that to all mankind when lorry in his life writes my father went on the vigo expedition readers may understand this was it strange enough that poor lieutenant of foot is now pretty much all that is left of this sublime enterprise upon vigo in the memory of mankindhanging there as if by a single hair till poor tristram shandy be forgotten too memoirs of laurence sterne written by himself for his daughter see annual register year 1775 pp 5052  in short the french and even the english invaded spain english byng and others sank spanish ships termagant was obliged to pack away her alberoni and give in she had to accede to quadruple alliance after all making it so to speak a quintuple one making peace in fact 17th february 1720general congress to be held at cambrai and settle the details  congress of cambrai met accordingly in 1722in the course of the year delegates slowly raining indate not fixable to a day or month congress was sat as we saidor alas was only still endeavoring to get seated and wandering about among the chairswhen george i came to charlottenburg that evening october 1723 and surveyed wilhelmina with a candle more inane congress never met in this world nor will meet settlement proved so difficult all the more as neither of the quarrelling parties wished it kaiser and termagant fallen as if exhausted had not the least disposition to agree lay diplomatically gnashing their teeth at one another ready to fight again should strength return difficult for third parties to settle on behalf of such a pair nay at length the kaisers ostend company came to light what will third parties dutch and english especially make of that  this poor congresslet the reader fancy itspent two years in arguments about precedencies in mere beatings of the air could not get seated at all but wandered among the chairs till february 1724 nor did it manage to accomplish any work whatever even then the most inane of human congresses and memorable on that account if on no other there in old stagnant cambrai through the third year and into the fourth were delegates spanish austrian english dutch french of solemn outfit with a big tail to eachlord whitworth whom i do not know lord polwarth earl of marchmont that will be a friend of popes were the english principals scholl ii 197there for about four years were these poor fellowcreatures busied baling out water with sieves seen through the horngate of dreams the figure of them rises almost grand on the mind  a certain bright young frenchman francois arouetspoiled for a solid lawcareer but whose oedipe we saw triumphing in the theatres and who will under the new name of voltaire become very memorable to ushappened to be running towards holland that way one of his many journeys thitherward and actually saw this congress then in the first year of its existence saw it probably dined with it a letter of his still extant not yet fallen to the spiders as so much else has done testifies to this fact let us read part of it the less despicable partas a piece supremely insignificant yet now in a manner the one surviving document of this extraordinary congress congresss own works and history having all otherwise fallen to the spiders forever the letter is addressed to cardinal duboisfor dubois with the face like a goat herzogin von orleans briefe yet lived first year of this congress and regent dorleans lived intensely interested here as third partyand a goatfaced cardinal once pimp and lackey ugliest of created souls archbishop of this same cambrai by divine permission and favor of beelzebub was capable of promoting a young fellow if he chose  to his eminence cardinal dubois from arouet junior  cambrai july 1722   we are just arrived in your city monseigneur where i think all the ambassadors and all the cooks in europe have given one another rendezvous it seems as if all the ministers of germany had assembled here for the purpose of getting their emperors health drunk as to messieurs the ambassadors of spain one of them hears two masses a day and the other manages the troop of players the english ministers a lord polwarth and a lord whitworth send many couriers to champagne and few to london for the rest nobody expects your eminence here it is not thought you will quit the palaisroyal to visit the sheep of your flock in these parts no it would be too bad for your eminence and for us all think sometimes monseigneur of a man who regards your goatfaced eminence as a beautiful ingenious creature and such a hand in conversation as never was the one thing i will ask of your goatfaced eminence at paris will be to have the goodness to talk to me oeuvres de voltaire 97 vols paris 18251834 lxviii 95 96  alas alasthe more despicable portions of this letter we omit as they are not history of the congress but of arouet junior on the shady side so much will testify that this congress did exist that its wiggeries and it were not always what they now are part of a nightmarevision in human history  elizabeth farnese seeing at what rate the congress of cambrai sped lost all patience with it and getting more and more exasperations there at length employed one ripperda a surprising dutch blackartist whom she now had for minister to pull the floor from beneath it so to speak and send it home in that manner which ripperda did an appropriate enough catastrophe comfortable to the reader upon which perhaps he will not grudge to read still another word     congress of cambrai gets the floor pulled from under it  termagant elizabeth had now one ripperda for minister a surprising dutch adventurer once secretary of some dutch embassy at madrid who discerning how the land lay had broken loose from that subaltern career had changed his religion insinuated himself into elizabeths royal favor and was now duke de ripperda and a diplomatic bulldog of the first quality full of mighty schemes and hopes in brief a new alberoni to the termagant queen this ripperda had persuaded her the third year of our inane congress now running out to no purpose that he if he were sent direct to vienna could reconcile the kaiser to her majesty and bring them to treaty independently of congresses he was sent accordingly in all privacy had reported himself as laboring there with the best outlooks for some while past when still early in 1725 there occurred on the part of francewhere regent dorleans was now dead and new politics bad come in voguethat sending back of the poor little spanish infanta 5th april 1725 quitted paris barbier journal du regne de louis xv i 218 and marrying of young louis xv elsewhere which drove elizabeth and the court of spain not unnaturally into a very delirium of indignation  why they sent the poor little lady home on those shocking terms it seems there was no particular reason except that french louis was now about fifteen and little spanish theresa was only eight and that under duc de bourbon the new premier and none of the wisest there was express or implicit an ardent wish to see royal progeny secured for which of course a wife of eight years would not answer so she was returned and even in a blundering way it is saidthe french ambassador at madrid having prefaced his communication not with light adroit preludings of speech but with a tempest of tears and howling lamentations as if that were the way to conciliate king philip and his termagant elizabeth transport of indignation was the natural consequence on their part order to every frenchman to be across the border within say eightandforty hours rejection forever of all french mediation at cambrai or elsewhere question to the english will you mediate for us then to which the answer being merely hm with looks of delayorder by express to ripperda to make straightway a bargain with the kaiser almost any bargain so it were made at once ripperda made a bargain treaty of vienna 30th april 1725 scholl ii 201 coxe walpole i 239250 titles and shadows each of us shall keep for his own lifetime then they shall drop as to realities again to parma and piacenza among the rest let these be as in the treaty of utrecht arrangeable in the lumpand indeed of parma and piacenza perhaps the less we say the better at present this was in substance ripperdas treaty the third great european travailthroe or change of color in the longsuffering lobster whereby of course the congress of cambrai did straightway disappear the floor miraculously vanishing under it and sinksfar below human eyereach by this timetowards the bottomless pool ever since such was the beginning such the end of that congress which arouet le jeune in 1722 saw as a contemporary fact drinking champagne in ramillies wigs and arranging comedies for itself     france and the britannic majesty trim the ship again how friedrich wilhelm came into it treaty of hanover 1725  the publication of this treaty of vienna 30th april 1725miraculous disappearance of the congress of cambrai by withdrawal of the floor from under it and close union of the courts of spain and vienna as the outcome of its slow laborsfilled europe and chiefly the late mediating powers with amazement anger terror made europe lurch suddenly to the other side as we phrased itother gunwale now under water wherefore in heavens name trim your ship again if possible ye high mediating powers this the mediating powers were laudably alert to do duc de bourbon and his young king about to marry were of pacific tendencies anxious for the balance still more was fleury who succeeded duc de bourbon cardinal fleury with his pupil louis xv under him producing royal progeny and nothing worse or better as yet began next year his long supremacy in france an aged reverend gentleman of sly delicately cunning ways and disliking war as george i did unless when forced on him now and henceforth no mediating power more anxious than france to have the ship in trim  george and bourbon laid their heads together deeply pondering this little less than awful state of the terrestrial balance and in about six months they in their quiet way suddenly came out with a fourth crisis on the astonished populations so as to right the ships trim again and more treaty of hanover this was their unexpected manoeuvre done quietly at herrenhausen when his majesty next went across for the hanover huntingseason mere huntingbut the diplomatists as well as the beagles were all in readiness there even friedrich wilhelm ostensibly intent on hunting was come over thither his abstruse ilgens with their inkhorns escorting him friedrich wilhelm hunting in unexpected sort was persuaded to sign this treaty which makes it unusually interesting to us an exceptional procedure on the part of friedrich wilhelm who beyond all sovereigns stays well at home careless of affairs that are not hisprocedure betokening cordiality at hanover and of good omen for the doublemarriage  yes surelyand yet something more on friedrich wilhelms part his rights on the clevejulich countries reversion of julich and berg once karl philip shall deceaseperhaps these high powers for a consideration will guarantee ones undoubted rights there it is understood they gave promises of this kind not too specific nay we hear farther a curious thing france and england looking for immediate war with the kaiser advised friedrich wilhelm to assert his rights on silesia which would have been an important procedure friedrich wilhelm it is added had actual thoughts of it the kaiser in those matters of the ritterdienst of the heidelberg protestants and wherever a chance was had been unfriendly little less than insulting to friedrich wilhelm give me one single hanoverian brigade to show that you go along with me said his prussian majestybut the britannic never altogether would oeuvres de frederic i 153 certain it is friedrich wilhelm signed a man with such fightingapparatus as to be important in a hanover treaty balance of power they tell me is in a dreadful way certainly if one can help the balance a little why not but julich and berg ones own outlook of reversion there that is the point to be attended tobalance i believe will somehow shift for itself on these principles friedrich wilhelm signed while ostensibly hunting fassmann p 368 forster  urkundenbuch p 67 treaty of hanover which was to trim the ship again or even to make it heel the other way dates itself 3d september 1725 and is of this purport we three france england prussia to stand by each other as one man in case any of us is attackedwill invite holland denmark sweden and every pacific sovereignty to join us in such conventionas they all gradually did had friedrich wilhelm but stood firm  for it is a state of the balances little less than awful rumor goes that by the ripperda bargain fatal to mankind don carlos was to get the beautiful young maria theresa to wife that would settle the parmapiacenza business and some others that would be a compensation with a witness spain and austria united as in karl vs time or perhaps some succession war or worse to fight over again  fleury and george as duc de bourbon and george had done though both pacific gentlemen brandished weapons at the kaiser strongly admonishing him to become less formidable or it would be worse for him possible indeed in such a shadowhunting shadowhunted hour fleury and george stand looking with intense anxiety into a certain spectral something which they call the balance of power no end to their exorcisms in that matter truly if each of the royal majesties and serene highnesses would attend to his own affairsdoing his utmost to better his own land and people in earthly and in heavenly respects a littlehe would find it infinitely profitabler for himself and others and the balance of power would settle in that case as the laws of gravity ordered which is its one method of settling after all diplomacyfleury and george by their manifestoing still more by their levying of men george i shovelling out his english subsidies as usual created deadly qualms in the kaiser who still found it unpleasant to admit spanish garrisons in parma but found likewise his termagant friend inexorably positive on that score and knew not what would become of him if he had to try fighting and the seapowers refused him cash to do it  hereby was the ship trimmed and more ship now lurching to the other side again george i goes subsidying hessians danes sounding manifestoes beating drums in an alarming manner and the kaiser except it were in russia with the new czarina catherine i that

kaiser who amid so many drums manifestoes menaces is now rolling eyes that witness everywhere considerable dismay this is the fourth grand crisis of europe crisis or travailthroe of nature bringing forth and unable to do it baby carloss apanage and the pragmatic sanction fourth conspicuous change of color to the universal lobster getting itself boiled on those sad terms for twenty years for its

the family when avoidable     chapter iv  doublemarriage treaty cannot be signed  hitherto the worldtides and ebbs and flows of external politics had by accident rather forwarded than hindered the doublemarriage in the rear of such a treaty of hanover triumphantly righting the european balances by help of friedrich wilhelm one might have hoped this little domestic treaty would at last get itself signed queen sophie did hasten off to hanover directly after her husband had left it under those favorable aspects but papa again proved unmanageable the treaty could not be achieved  alas and why not parents and children on both sides being really desirous of it what reason is there but it should in due time come to perfection and without annihilating time and space make four lovers happy no reason rubs doubtless had arisen since that visit of george i discordant procedures chiefly about friedrich wilhelms recruiting operations in the hanover territory as shall be noted by and by but these the everwakeful enthusiasm of queen sophie who had set her whole heart with a female fixity on this doublemarriage project had smoothed down again and now papa and husband being so blessedly united in their world politics why not sign the marriagetreaty honored majestypapa why nottush child you do not understand in these tremendous circumstances the celestial sign of the balance just about canting and the obliquity of the ecliptic like to alter how can one think of little marriages wait till the obliquity of the ecliptic come steadily to its old pitch  truth is george was in general of a slow solemn spanish turn of manners intolerably proud too since he got that english dignity says wilhelmina he seemed always tacitly to look down on friedrich wilhelm as if the prussian majesty were a kind of inferior clownish king in comparison it is certain he showed no eagerness to get the treaty perfected again and again when specially applied to by queen sophie on friedrich wilhelms order he intimated only it was a fixed thing but not to be hurriedenglish parliaments were concerned in it the parties were still young and so onafter which brief answer he would take you to the window and ask if you did not think the herrenhausen gardens and their leibnitz waterworks and clippedbeech walls were rather fine pollnitz  memoiren ii 226 228 c  in fact the english parliaments from whom money was so often demanded for our fat improper darlingtons lean improper kendals and other royal occasions would naturally have to make a marriagerevenue for this fine grandson of oursgrandson fred who is now a young lout of eighteen leading an extremely dissolute life they say at hanover and by no means the most beautiful of mortals either he or the foolish little father of him to our old sad heart they can wait they can wait said george always  but undoubtedly he did intend that both marriages should take effect only he was slow and the more you hurried him perhaps the slower he would have perfected the treaty next year say the authorities meant to do so if well let alone but townshend whispered withal better not urge him surly george was always a man of his word no treachery intended by him towards friedrich wilhelm or any man it is very clear moreover that friedrich wilhelm in this autumn 1725 was and was like to be of high importance to king george a man not to be angered by dishonorable treatment had such otherwise been likely on georges part nevertheless george did not sign the treaty next year eithersuch things having intervenednor the next year after that for reasons tragically good on the latter occasion  these delays about the doublemarriage treaty are not a pleasing feature of it to friedrich wilhelm who is very capable of being hurt by slights who at any rate dislikes to have loose thrums flying about or that the business of today should be shoved over upon tomorrow and so queen sophie has her own sore difficulties driven thus between the barbarians that is her husband and the deep sea that is her father to and fro nevertheless since all parties to the matter wished it sophie and the younger parties getting even enthusiastic about it and since the matter itself was good agreeable so far to prussia and england to protestant germany and to heaven and earthmight not sophie confidently hope to vanquish these and other difficulties and so bring all things to a happy close  had it not been for the imperial shadowhuntings and this rickety condition of the celestial balance alas the outer elements interfered with queen sophie in a singular manner huge foreign worldmovements springing from vienna and a spectrehaunted kaiser and spreading like an avalanche over all the earth snatched up this little doublemarriage question tore it along with them reeling over precipices one knew not whitherward at such a rate as was seldom seen before scarcely in the minerva press is there record of such surprising infinite and inextricable obstructions to a wedding or a doublewedding time and space which cannot be annihilated to make two lovers happy were here turned topsyturvy as it were to make four loversfour or at the very least three for wilhelmina will not admit she was ever the least in love not she poor soul either with loose fred or his english outlooksfour young creatures and one or more elderly persons superlatively wretched and even literally enough to do all but kill some of them  what is noteworthy too it proved wholly inane this huge worldocean of intrigues and imperial necromancy ran dry at last into absolute nothing even for the kaiser and might as well not have been and mother and father on the prussian side were driven to despair and pretty nearly to delirium by it and our poor young fritz got tormented scourged and throttled in body and in soul by it till he grew to loathe the light of the sun and in fact looked soon to have quitted said light at one stage of the business  we are now approaching act second of the doublemarriage where imperial ordnancemaster graf von seckendorf a blackartist of supreme quality despatched from vienna on secret errand crosses the palace esplanade at berlin on a summer evening of the year 1726 and evokes all the demons on our little crownprince and those dear to him we must first say something of an important step shortly antecedent thereto which occurred in the crownprinces educational course     chapter v  crownprince goes into the potsdam guards  amid such commotion of the foreign elements and the domestic an important change occurs in the crownprinces course of schooling it is decided that whatever be his progress in the speculative branches it is time he should go into the army and practically learn soldiering in his fourteenth year 3d may 1725 preuss i 26 106 and buch fur jedermann a minor book of his on the same subject berlin 1837 ii 13 not long before the treaty of hanover he was formally named captain by papa in warcouncil grenadier guards potsdam lifeguards to be the regiment and next year he is nominated major and a vacancy occurring appointed to begin actual duty it is on the 20th of august 1726 that he first leads out his battalion to the muster on those terms his age is not yet fifteen by four monthsa very tiny major among those potsdam giants but by rank we observe he rides and his horse is doubtless of the due height and so the tiny cadetdrillings have ended long files of giants splendent in goldlace and grenadiercaps have succeeded and earnest work instead of mimic in that matter has begun  however it may have fared with his other schoollessons here now is a schoolform he is advanced to in which there will be no resource but learning bad spelling might be overlooked by those that had charge of it bad drilling is not permissible on any terms we need not doubt the crownprince did his soldierduty faithfully and learned in every point the conduct of an officer penalty as of rhadamanthus waited upon all failure there that he liked it is by no means said he much disliked it and his disgusts were many an airy young creatureand it was in this time to give one instance that that shearing of his locks occurred which was spoken of above where the courtchirurgus proved so merciful to clog the winged psyche in everreturning paraderoutine and military pipeclayit seems very cruel but it is not to be altered in spite of ones disgusts the dull work to the last item of it has daily to be done which proved infinitely beneficial to the crownprince after all hereby to his athenianfrench elegancies and airy promptitudes and brilliancies there shall lie as basis an adamantine spartanism and stoicism very rare but very indispensable for such a superstructure well exemplified through after life in this crownprince     of the potsdam giants as a fact  his regiment was the potsdam grenadier guard that unique giantregiment of which the world has heard so much in a vague halfmythical way the giantregiment was not a myth however but a bigboned expensive fact tramping very hard upon the earth at one time though now gone all to the ghostly state as it was a classbook so to speak of our friedrichsclassbook printed in huge type for a certain branch of his schooling the details of which are so dim though the general outcome of it proved so unforgettablereaders apart from their curiosity otherwise may as well take a glimpse of it on this occasion vanished now and grown a giant phantom the like of it hardly again to be in this world and by accident the very smallest figure ever ranked in it makes it memorable there  with a wise instinct friedrich wilhelm had discerned that all things in prussia must point towards his army that his army was the heart and pith the state being the tree every branch and leaf bound after its sort to be nutritive and productive for the armys behoof that probably for any nation in the longrun and certainly for the prussian nation straightway life or death depends on the army friedrich wilhelms head in an inarticulate manner was full of this just notion and all his life was spent in organizing it to a practical fact the more of potential battle the more of life is in us a maximum of potential battle therefore and let it be the optimum in quality how friedrich wilhelm cared day and night with all his heart and all his soul to bring his army to the supreme pitch we have often heard and the more we look into his ways the more we are impressed with that fact it was the central thing for him all other things circulating towards it deriving from it no labor too great and none too little to be undergone for such an object he watched over it like an argus with eyes that reached everywhere discipline shall be as exact as euclidshort of perfection we do not stop discipline and ever better discipline enforcement of the rule in all points improvement of the rule itself where possible were the great drillsergeants continual care daily had some loop fallen which might have gone ravelling far enough but daily was he there to pick it up again and keep the web unrent and solidly progressive  we said it was the poetic ideal of friedrich wilhelm who is a dumb poet in several particularsand requires the privileges of genius from those that read his dumb poem it must be owned he rises into the fantastic here and there and has crotchets of ultraperfection for his army which are not rational at all crotchets that grew ever madder the farther he followed them this lifeguard regiment of foot for instance in which the crownprince now isfriedrich wilhelm got it in his fathers time no doubt a regiment then of fair qualities and he has kept drilling it improving it as poets polish stanzas unweariedly ever sinceand see now what it has grown to a potsdam giant regiment such as the world never saw before or since three battalions of themtwo always here at potsdam doing formal lifeguard duty the third at brandenburg on drill 800 to the battalion2400 sons of anak in all sublime enough hugely perfect to the royal eye such a mass of shining giants in their longdrawn regularities and mathematical manoeuvringslike some streak of promethean lightning realized here at last in the vulgar dusk of things  truly they are men supreme in discipline in beauty of equipment and the shortest man of them rises i think towards seven feet some are nearly nine feet high men from all countries a hundred and odd come annually as we saw from russiaa very precious windfall the rest have been collected crimped purchased out of every european country at enormous expense not to speak of other trouble to his majesty james kirkman an irish recruit of good inches cost him 1200 pounds before he could be got inveigled shipped and brought safe to hand the documents are yet in existence forster handbuch der geschichte geographie und statistik des preussischen reichs berlin 1820 iv 130 132not in a very lucid state and the portrait of this irish fellowcitizen himself who is by no means a beautiful man indeed they are all portrayed all the privates of this distinguished regiment are if anybody cared to look at themredivanoff from moscow seems of far better bone than kirkman though still more stolid of aspect one hohmann a born prussian was so tall you could not though yourself tall touch his bare crown with your hand august the strong of poland tried on one occasion and could not before hohmann turned up there had been jonas the norwegian blacksmith also a dreadfully tall monster giant macdollwho was to be married no consent asked on either side to the tall young woman which latter turned out to be a decrepit old woman all jestbooks know the mythhe also was an irish giant his name probably mdowal forster  preussens helden im krieg und frieden berlin l848 i 531 no date to the story no evidence what grain of truth may be in it this hohmann was now flugelmann fugleman as we have named it leader of the file the tallest of the regiment a very mountain of pipeclayed flesh and bone  here in reference to one other of those poor giants is an anecdote from fassmann who is very full on this subject of the giants abstruse historical fassmann often painfully cited by us a most small anecdote but then an indisputably certain onewhich brings back to us in a strange way the vanished time and its populations as the poorest authentic wooden lucifer may do kindling suddenly and peopling the void night for moments to the seeing eye  fassmann a very dark german literary man in obsolete costume and garniture how living or what doing we cannot guess found himself at paris gazing about in the year 1713 where among other things the fair of st germain was going on loud large fair of st germain which lasts from candlemas to the monday before easter and fassmann one day took a walk of contemplation through the same much noise gesticulation little meaning showbooths temporary theatres merryandrews sleightofhand men and a vast public drinking dancing gambling flirting as its wont is nothing new for us there new only that it all lies five generations from us now did the old pretender who was then in his expectant period in this same village of st germain see it too as fassmann did and louis xiv he is at versailles drooping fast very dull to his maintenon and our little fritz in berlin is a child in armsand the world is all awake as usual while fassmann strolls through this noisy inanity of showbooths in the year 1713  strolling along fassmann came upon a certain booth with an enormous picture hung aloft in front of it picture of a very tall man in heyduc livery coat reaching to his ankles in grand peruke cap and big heronplume with these words le geant allemand german giant written underneath partly from curiosity partly for countrys sake fassmann expended twopence viewed the gigantic fellowcreature admits he had never seen one so tall though bentenrieder the imperial diplomatist thought by some to be the tallest of men had come athwart him once this giants name was muller birthplace the neighborhood of weissenfelsa saxon like myself he had a small german wife not half his size he made money readily showing himself about in france england hollandand fassmann went his way thinking no more of the fellowbut now continues fassmann  coming to potsdam thirteen years after in the spring of 1726 by his majestys order toin fact to read the newspapers to his majesty and be generally useful chiefly in the tobaccocollege as we shall discoverwhat was my surprise to find this same geant allemand of st germain ranked among the kings grenadiers no doubt of the identity i renewed acquaintance with the man his little german wife was dead but he had got an english one instead an uncommonly shifty creature they had a neat little dwellinghouse as most of the married giants had near the palace here the wife sold beer brandy not permissible on any terms and lodged travellersi myself have lodged there on occasion in the course of some years the man took swelling in the legs good for nothing as a grenadier and was like to fall heavy on society but no his little wife snatched him up easily getting his discharge carried him over with her to england where he again became a showgiant and they were doing very well when last heard ofin the countrywakes of george iis early time and that is the real biography of one potsdam giant by a literary gentleman who had lodged with him on occasion fassmann pp 723730  the pay of these sublime footguards is greatly higher than common they have distinguished privileges and treatment on the other hand their discipline is nonpareil and discharge is never to be dreamt of while strength lasts poor kirkman does he sometimes think of the hill of howth and that he will never see it more kirkman i judge is not given to thoughtconsiders that he has tobacco here and privileges and perquisites and that howth and heaven itself is inaccessible to many a man     friedrich wilhelms recruiting difficulties  tall men not for this regiment only had become a necessary of life to friedrich wilhelm indispensable to him almost as his daily bread to his heart there is no road so ready as that of presenting a tall man or two friedrich wilhelms regiments are now by his exact new regulations levied and recruited each in its own canton or specific district there all males as soon as born are enrolled liable to serve when they have grown to years and strength all grown men under certain exceptions as of a widows eldest son or of the like evidently ruinous cases are liable to serve captain of the regiment and amtmann of the canton settle between them which grown man it shall be better for you not to be tall in fact it is almost a kindness of heaven to be gifted with some safe impediment of body slightly crooked back or the like if you much dislike the career of honor under friedrich wilhelm a general shadow of unquiet apprehension we can well fancy hanging over those rural populations and much unpleasant haggling now and thennothing but the kings justice that can be appealed to kings justice very great indeed but heavily checked by the kings value for handsome soldiers  happily his value for industrial laborers and increase of population is likewise great townsfolk skilful workmen as the theory supposes are exempt the more ingenious classes generally his majesty exempts in this respect to encourage them in others for on the whole he is not less a captain of work to his nation than of other things what he did for prussia in the way of industries improvements new manufactures new methods in settling colonies tearing up drowned bogs and subduing them into dry cornfields in building draining digging and encouraging or forcing others to do so would take a long chapter he is the enemy of chaos not the friend of it wherever you meet with him  for example potsdam itself potsdam now a pleasant grassy leafy place branching out extensively in fine stone architecture with swept pavements where as in other places the traveller finds land and water separated into two firmamentsfriedrich wilhelm found much of it a quagmire land and water still weltering in one in these very years his cuttings embankments buildings piledrivings there are enormous and his perseverance needs to be invincible for instance looking out one morning after heavy rain upon some extensive antiquagmire operations and strong piledrivings he finds half a furlong of his latest heavy piling clean gone what in the world has become of it pooh the swollen lake has burst it topsyturvy and it floats yonder bottom uppermost a halffurlong of distracted liquidpeat whereat his majesty gave a loud laugh says bielfeld baron de bielfeld lettres familieres second edition a leide 1767 i 31 and commenced anew the piles now stand firm enough like the rest of the earths crust and carry strong ashlar houses and umbrageous trees for mankind and trivial mankind can walk in clean pumps there shuddering or sniggering at friedrich wilhelm as their humor may be  no danger of this cantonsystem of recruitment to the more ingenious classes who could do better than learn drill nor to say truth does the poor clayey peasant suffer from it according to his apprehensions often perhaps could he count profit and loss he might find himself a gainer the career of honor turns out to be at least a career of practical stoicism and spartanism useful to any peasant or to any prince cleanliness of person and even of mind fixed rigor of method sobriety frugality these are virtues worth acquiring sobriety in the matter of drink is much attended to here his majesty permits no distillation of strongwaters in potsdam or within so many miles fassmann p 728 nor is sale of such allowed except in the most intensely select manner the soldiers pay is in the highest degree exiguous not above three halfpence a day for a common footsoldier in addition to what rations he hasbut it is found adequate to its purpose too supports the soldier in sound health vigorously fit for his work into which points his majesty looks with his own eyes and will admit no dubiety often too if not already oftenest as it ultimately grew to be the peasantsoldier gets home for many months of the year a soldierploughman and labors for his living in the old way his captain it is one of the captains perquisites who is generally a veteran of fifty with a long spartan training before he gets so high pockets the pay of all these furloughs supernumerary to the real work of the regimentand has certain important furnishings to yield in return  at any rate enrolment in time of peace cannot fall on many three or four recruits in the year to replace vacancies will carry the canton through its crisis for we are to note withal the third part of every regiment can and should by rule consist of foreignersmen not born prussians these are generally men levied in the imperial freetowns in the reich or empire as they term it that is to say or is mainly to say in the countries of germany that are not austrian or prussian for this foreign thirdpart too the recruits must be got excuses not admissible for captain or colonel nothing but recruits of the due inches will do captain and colonel supporting their enterprise on frugal adequate perquisites hinted of above have to be on the outlook vigilantly eagerly and must contrive to get them nay we can take supernumerary recruits and have in fact always on hand attached to each regiment a stock of such any number of recruits that stand well on their legs are welcome and for a tall man there is joy in potsdam almost as if he were a wise man or a good man  the consequence is all countries especially all german countries are infested with a new species of predatory twolegged animals prussian recruiters they glide about under disguise if necessary lynxeyed eager almost as the jesuit hounds are not hunting the souls of men as the spiritual jesuits do but their bodies in a merciless carnivorous manner better not to be too tall in any country at present irish kirkman could not be protected by the aegis of the british constitution itself in general however the prussian recruiter on british ground reports that the people are too well off that there is little to be done in those parts a tall british sailor if we pick him up strolling about memel or the baltic ports is inexorably claimed by the diplomatists no business doable till after restoration of him and he proves a mere loss to us despatches in the statepaper office germany holland switzerland the netherlands these are the fruitful fields for us and there we do hunt with some vigor  for example in the town of julich there lived and worked a tall young carpenter one day a welldressed positivelooking gentleman baron von hompesch the records name him enters the shop wants a stout chest with lock on it for household purposes must be of such and such dimensions six feet six in length especially and that is an indispensable pointin fact it will be longer than yourself i think herr zimmermann what is the cost when can it be ready cost time and the rest are settled a right stout chest then and see you dont forget the size if too short it will be of no use to me mindja wohl gewiss and the positivelooking wellclad gentleman goes his ways at the appointed day he reappears the chest is readywe hope an unexceptionable article too short as i dreaded says the positive gentleman nay your honor says the carpenter i am certain it is six feet six and takes out his footrulepshaw it was to be longer than yourself well it isno it isnt the carpenter to end the matter gets into his chest and will convince any and all mortals no sooner is he in rightly flat than the positive gentleman a prussian recruiting officer in disguise slams down the lid upon him locks it whistles in three stout fellows who pick up the chest gravely walk through the streets with it open it in a safe place and findhorrible to relatethe poor carpenter dead choked by want of air in this frightful middlepassage of his forster ii 305 306 pollnitz ii 518 519 name of the town is given julich as above date not and if the thing had been only a popular myth is it not a significant one but it is too true the tall carpenter lay dead and hompesch got imprisoned for life by the business  burgermeisters of small towns have been carried off in one case a rich merchant in magdeburg whom it cost a large sum to get free again stenzel iii 356 prussian recruiters hover about barracks paradegrounds in foreign countries and if they see a tall soldier the dutch have had instances and are indignant at them will persuade him to desertto make for the country where soldiermerit is understood and a tall fellow of parts will get his pair of colors in notime  but the highest stretch of their art was probably that done on the austrian ambassadortall herr von bentenrieder tallest of diplomatists whom fassmann till the fair of st germain had considered the tallest of men bentenrieder was on his road as kaisers ambassador to george i in those congressofcambrai times serenely journeying on when near by halberstadt his carriage broke carriage takes some time in mending the tall diplomatic herr walks on will stretch his long legs catch a glimpse of the town withal till they get it ready again and now at some guardhouse of the place a prussian officer inquires not too reverently of a nobleman without carriage who are you well answered he smiling i am botschafter messagebearer from his imperial majesty and who may you be that askto the guardhouse with us whither he is marched accordingly kaisers messenger why not being a most tall handsome man this kaisers botschafter striding along on foot here the guardhouse officials have decided to keep him to teach him prussian drillexerciseand are thrown into a singular quandary when his valets and suite come up full of alarm dissolving into joy and call him excellenz pollnitz ii 207209  tall herr von bentenrieder accepted the prostrate apology of these guardhouse officials but he naturally spoke of the matter to george i whose patience often fretted by complaints on that head seems to have taken fire at this transcendent instance of prussian insolency in consequence of this adventure he commenced says pollnitz a system of decisive measures of reprisals even and of altogether peremptory minatory procedures to clear hanover of this nuisance and to make it cease in very fact and not in promise and profession merely these were the first rubs queen sophie met with in pushing on the doublemarriage and sore rubs they were though she at last got over them coming on the back of that fine charlottenburg visit almost within year and day and directly in the teeth of such friendly aspects and prospects this conduct on the part of his britannic majesty much grieved and angered friedrich wilhelm and in fact involved him in considerable practical troubles  for it was the signal of a similar set of loud complaints and menacing remonstrances with little twinges of fulfilment here and there from all quarters of germany a tempest of trouble and public indignation rising everywhere and raining in upon friedrich wilhelm and this unfortunate hobby of his no riding of ones poor hobby in peace henceforth friedrich wilhelm always answered what was only superficially the fact that he knew nothing of these violences and acts of illneighborship he a just king was sorrier than any man to hear of them and would give immediate order that they should end but they always went on again much the same and never did end i am sorry a just king led astray by his hobby answers thus what is only superficially the fact but it seems he cannot help it his hobby is too strong for him regardless of curb and bridle in this instance let us pity a man of genius mounted on so ungovernable a hobby leaping the barriers in spite of his best resolutions perhaps the poetic temperament is more liable to such morbid biases influxes of imaginative crotchet and mere folly that cannot be cured friedrich wilhelm never would or could dismount from his hobby but he rode him under much sorrow henceforth under showers of anger and ridiculecontumelious words and procedures as it were saxa et faeces battering round him to a heavy extent the rider a victim of tragedy and farce both at once     queen sophies troubles grumkow with the old dessauer and grumkow without him  queen sophie had by delicate management got over those first rubs aud arrived at a treaty of hanover and clear ground again far worse rubs lay ahead but smooth travelling towards such a goal was not possible for this queen poor lady her court as we discern from wilhelmina and the books is a sad welter of intrigues suspicions of treacherous chambermaids headvalets pickthank scouts of official gentlemen and others striving to supplant one another satans invisible world very busy against queen sophie under any terms much more under those of the doublemarriage her place in a kindly but suspicious husbands favor was difficult to maintain restless aspirants climbing this way or that by laddersteps discoverable in this abstruse element are never wanting and have the due eavesdropping satellites now here now there queen sophie and her party have to walk warily as if among precipices and pitfalls of all which wide welter of extinct contemptibilities then and there so important here and now become minus quantities we again notice the existence but can undertake no study or specification whatever two incidents the latter of them dating near the point where we now are will sufficiently instruct the reader what a welter this was in which queen sophie and her bright little son the new major of the potsdam giants had to pass their existence  incident first fell out some six years ago or morein 1719 year of the heidelberg protestants of clement the forger when his majesty slept for weeks with a pistol under his pillow and had other troubles his majesty on one of his journeys which were always many was taken suddenly ill at brandenburg that year so violently ill that thinking himself about to die he sent for his good queen and made a will appointing her regent in case of his decease his majesty quite recovered before long but grumkow and the old dessauer main aspirants getting wind of this will and hunting out the truth of itwhat a puddling of the waters these two made in consequence stirring up mire and dirt round the good queen finding she had been preferred to them wilhelmina i 26 29 nay wilhelmina in her wild way believes they had not long after planned to fire a theatre about the king one afternoon in berlin city and take his life thereby securing for themselves such benefit in prospect as there might be not a doubt of it thinks wilhelmina the young margraf born 1700 see vol v p 393 our precious cousin of schwedt is not he sistersson of that old dessauer grandson of the great elector even as papa is papa once killed and our poor crownprince also made away withthat young margraf and his blue foxtiger of an uncle over him is king in prussia obviously they meant to burn that theatre and kill papa this is wilhelminas distracted belief as doubtless it was her mothers on the day in question a jealous muchsuffering transcendently exasperated mother as we see  incident second shows us those two rough gentlemen fallen out of partnership into open quarrel and even duel duel at the copenick gate much noised of in the dull old prussian booksthough always in a reserved manner not even the date as if that were dangerous being clearly given it came in the wake of that hanover treaty as is now guessed the two having taken opposite sides on that measure and got provoked into ripping up old sores in general dessau was against king george and the treaty it appears having his reasons familyreasons of old standing grumkow a bribable gentleman was forhaving also perhaps his reasons enough it came to altercations objurgations between the two which rose ever higherrose at length to wagerofbattle indignant challenge on the part of the old dessauer which however grumkow not regarded as a baresark in the fighting way regrets that his christian principles do not forsooth allow him to accept the king is appealed to the king being himself though an orthodox christian yet a still more orthodox soldier decides that on the whole general grumkow cannot but accept this challenge from the fieldmarshal prince of dessau  dessau is on the field at the copenick gate

stranding on politics of a shallowa man still memorable in the mythic traditions of that place better to drill men to perfection and invent iron ramrods against the day they shall be needed than go jostling on such terms with cattle of the grumkow kind and thus we perceive grumkow is in and the old dessauer out and there has been a change of ministry change of majestysadvisers brought aboutmay the advice going be wiser now  what the young crownprince did said thought in such environment of backstairs diplomacies female sighs and aspirations grumkow duels drillings in the giant regiment is not specified for us in the smallest particular in the extensive rubbishbooks that have been written about him ours is to indicate that such environment was how a lively soul acted on by it did not fail to react chameleonlike taking color from it and contrariwise taking color against it must be left to the readers imaginationone thing we have gathered and will not forget that the old dessauer is out and grumkow in that the rugged son of gunpowder drilling men henceforth at halle and in a dumb way meditating tactics as few ever did has no share in the foul enchantments that now supervene at court     chapter vi  ordnancemaster seckendorf crosses the palace esplanade  the kaisers terror and embarrassment at the conclusion of the hanover treaty as we saw were extreme war possible or likely and nothing but the termagant caprices of elizabeth farnese to depend on no cash from the seapowers only cannonshot invasion and hostility from their cash and them what is to be done to caress the pride of spain to keep alive the hopes in that quarter of marrying their don carlos the supplementary infant to our eldest archduchess which indeed has set the seapowers dreadfully on fire but which does leave parma and piacenza quiet for the present and makes the pragmatic sanction too an affair of spains own this is one resource though a poor one and a dangerous another is to make alliance with russia by well flattering the poor little brown czarina there but is not that a still poorer and what third is there  there is a third worth both the others could it be got done to detach friedrich wilhelm from those dangerous hanover confederates and bring him gently over to ourselves he has an army of 60000 in perfect equipment and money to maintain them so against us or for us60000 plus or 60000 minusthat will mean 120000 fighting men a most weighty item in any field there is like to be if it lie in the power of human art let us gain this wild irritated king of prussia dare any henchman of ours venture to go with honeycakes with pattings and cajoleries and slip the imperial muzzle well round the snout of that rugged ursine animal an iracund bear of dangerous proportions and justly irritated against us at present our experienced feldzeugmeister ordnancemaster and diplomatist graf von seckendorf a conscientious protestant and the cunningest of men able to lie to all lengthsdare

235 239  the second act therefore of this foolish worlddrama of the doublemarriage openson the 11th may 1726 towards sunset in the tabagie of the berlin palace as we gather from laborious comparison of windy pollnitz with other indistinct witnesses of a dreary naturein the following manner  prussian majesty sits smoking at the window nothing particular going on a squarebuilt shortish steelgray gentleman of military cut past fifty is strolling over the schlossplatz spacious square in front of the palace conspicuous amid the sparse populations there pensively recreating himself in the yellow sunlight and long shadows as after a days hard labor or travel who is that inquires friedrich wilhelm suspending his tobacco grumkow answers cautiously after survey he thinks it must be ordnancemaster seckendorf who was with him today passing on rapidly towards denmark on business that will not waitexperienced feldzeugmeister graf von seckendorf whom we stand in correspondence with of late and were expecting about this time whom we have known at the siege of stralsund nay ever since the marlborough times and the siege of menin in war and peace and have always reckoned a solid reasonable man and soldier why has he not come to usyour majesty confesses grumkow his business is so pressing business in denmark will not wait seckendorf owned he had come slightly round in his eagerness to see our grand review at tempelhof the day after tomorrow what soldier would omit the sight so he was pleased to intimate of soldiering carried to the nonplusultra but he hoped to do it quite incognito among the general publicand then to be at the gallop again not able to have the honor of paying his court at this timecourt narrenpossen nonsense answers friedrich wilhelmand opening the window beckons seckendorf up with his own royal head and hand the conversation of a man who had rational sense and could tell him anything were it only news af foreign parts in a rational manner was always welcome to friedrich wilhelm  and so seckendorf how can he help it is installed in the tabagie glides into pleasant conversation there a captivating talker solid for religion for the rights of germany against intrusive french and others such insight orthodoxy sense and ingenuity pleasant to hear and all with the due quantity of oil though he both snuffles and lisps and has privately in case of need a capacity of lyingfor he curiously distils you any lie in his religious alembics till it become tolerable to his conscience or even palatable as elixirs arecapacity of doubledistilled lying probably the greatest of his dayseckendorf assists at the grand review 13th may 1726 witnesses with unfeigned admiration the nonplusultra of manoeuvring and in fact the general management military and other of this admirable king pollnitz ii 235 fassmann pp 367 368 seckendorf no question of it will do his denmark business swiftly then since your majesty is pleased so to wish seckendorf sure enough will return swiftly to such a king whose familiar company vouchsafed him in this noble manner he likesoh how he likes it  in a week or two seckendorf is back to berlin attends his majesty on the annual military tour through preussen attends him everywhere becoming quite a necessary of life to his majesty and does not go away at all seckendorfs business if his majesty knew it will not lead him away but lies here on this spot and is now going on the magicapparatus grumkow the mainspring of it getting all into gear grumkow was once clear for king george and the hanover treaty having his reasons then but now he has other reasons and is clear against those foreign connections hm hahyes my estimable justly powerful herr von grumkow here is a little pension of 1600 ducats only 500 pounds as yet which the imperial majesty thinking of the service you may do prussia and germany and him graciously commands me to presentonly 500 pounds by the year as yet but there shall be no lack of money if we prosper forster iii 233 232 see also iv 172 121 157 c  and so there are now two blackartists of the first quality busy on the unconscious friedrich wilhelm and seckendorf for the next seven years will stick to friedrich wilhelm like his shadow and fascinate his whole existence and him as few wizards could have done friedrich wilhelm like st paul in melita warming his innocent hands at the fire of dry branches here kindled for himthat miracle of a venomous serpent is this that has fixed itself upon his finger to friedrich wilhelms enchanted sense it seems a birdofparadise trustfully perching there but it is of the whipsnake kind or a worse and will stick to him tragically if also comically for years to come the world has seen the comedy of it and has howled scornful laughter upon friedrich wilhelm for it but there is a tragic side not so well seen into where tears are due to the poor king and to certain others horsewhips and almost gallowsropes are dueyes had seckendorf and grumkow both been well hanged at this stage of the affair whereby the affair might have soon ended on fair terms it had been welcome to mankind welcome surely to the present editor for one such a saving to him of time wasted of disgust endured and indeed it is a solacement he has often longed for in these dreary operations of his but the fates appointed otherwise we have all to accept our fate  grumkow is sworn to imperial orthodoxy thenprobably the vulpine mind so to term it went always rather that way and only his interest the othergrumkow is well bribed supplied for bribing others where needful stands orthodox now under peril of his very head all things have been got distilled into the palatable state spiritual and economic for oneself and ones grand trojanhorse of a grumkow and the adventure proceeds apace seckendorf sits nightly in the tabagie a kind of smoking parliament as we shall see anon attends on all promenades and journeys one of the wisest heads and so pleasant in discourse he is grown indispensable and a necessary of life to us seckendorfs biographer computes he must have ridden in those seven years continually attending his majesty above 5000 german miles anonymous seckendorfs grandnephew versuch einer lebensbeschreibung des feldmarschalls grafen von seckendorf leipzig 1792 1794 i 6that is 25000 english miles or a trifle more than the length of the terrestrial equator  in a month or two 13th august 1726 preuss i 37 seckendorfsince majesty vouchsafes to honor us by wishing itcontrives to get nominated kaisers minister at berlin unlimited prospects of tabagie and good talk now opening on majesty and impartial grumkow in tabagie or wherever we are cannot but admit now and then that the excellenz herr graf ordnancemaster has a deal of reason in what he says about foreign politics about intrusive french and other points hm na muses friedrich wilhelm to himself if the kaiser had not been so lofty on us in that heidelbergprotestant affair in the ritterdienst business in those damned recruiting brabbles always a very highsniffing surly kaiser to us for in fact the kaiser has all along used friedrich wilhelm bitterly ill and contemplates no better usage of him except in show usage thinks the kaiser a big prussian piece of cannon whom we wish to enchant over to us did lazy peg complain of her usageso that the excellenz and grumkow have a heavy problem of it were they not so diligent and the cannon itself well disposed those blitz franzosen blasted french growls friedrich wilhelm sometimes in the tobaccoparliament forster ii 12 c for he hates the french and would fain love his kaiser being german to the bone and of right loyal heart though counted only a piece of cannon by some for one thing his prussian majesty declines signing that treaty of hanover a second time now when the dutch accede to it after almost a years trouble with them the prussian ambassador singular to observe has no orders to sign leaves the english with their hollanders and blitz franzosen to sign by themselves this time 9th august 1726 boyer the political state of great rrilain a monthly periodical vol xxxii p 77 which is the number for july 1726 we will wait we will wait thinks his prussian majestywho knows  but then julich and berg urges he always britannic majesty and the blitz franzosen were to secure me the reversion there that was the essential pointfor this too excellenz has a remedy works out gradually a remedy from headquarters the amiable dexterous man kaiser will do the like your majesty kaiser himself will secure it youin brief some three months after seckendorfs instalment as kaisers minister not yet five months since his appearance in the schlossplatz that may eveningit is now huntingseason and we are at wusterhausen majesty his two blackartists and the proper satellites on both sides all therea new and opposite treaty in extreme privacy on the 12th of october 1726 is signed at that sequestered huntingschloss treaty of wusterhausen so called which was once very famous and mysterious and caused many wigs to wag wigs to wag in those days especially when knowledge of it was first had the rather as only half knowledge could be had of itor can mourns dryasdust who has still difficulties about some secret articles in the document buchholz i 94 n courage my friend they are now of no importance to any creature  the essential purport of this treaty given in extenso without the secret articles in forster iv 159166 legible to all eyes is that friedrich wilhelm silently drops the hanover treaty and blitz franzosen and explicitly steps over to the kaisers side stipulates to assist the kaiser with so many thousand if attacked in germany by any blitz franzose or intrusive foreigner whatever in return for which the kaiser besides assisting prussia in the like case with a like quantity of thousands engages in circuitous chancery language to be helpful and humanly speaking effectual in that grand matter of julich and bergsomewhat in the following strain to our imperial mind it does appear the king of prussia has manifest right to the succession in julich and berg right grounded on express erbvergleich of 1624 not to speak of deeds subsequent the imperial mind as supreme judge of such matters in the reich will not fail to decide this cause soon and justly should it come to that but we hope it may take a still better course for the imperial mind will straightway set about persuading kurpfalz to comply peaceably and even undertakes to have something done that way before six months pass art v in forster ubi supra  humanly speaking surely the imperial mind will be effectual in the julich and berg matter but it was very necessary to use circuitous chancery languageinasmuch as the imperial mind desirous also to secure kurpfalzs help in this sore crisis had about three months ago treaty with kurpfalz 16th august 1726 forster ii 71 expressly engaged to kurpfalz that julich and berg should not go to friedrich wilhelm in terms of the old deed but to kurpfalzs cousins of sulzbach whom the old gentleman in spite of deeds was obstinate to prefer there is no doubt about that fact about that selfdevouring pair of facts to such straits is a kaiser driven when he gets deep into spectrehunting  this is the once famous now forgotten treaty of wusterhausen 12th october 1726 which proved so consolatory to the kaiser in that dread crisis of his spectrehunt and the effects of which are very visible in this history if nowhere else it caught up the prussianenglish doublemarriage launched it into the huge tide of imperial spectre politics into the awful swaggings and swayings of the terrestrial libra in general and nearly broke the heart of several royal persons of a memorable crownprince among others which last is now pretty much its sole claim to be ever mentioned again by mankind as there was no performance nor an intention of any in that julichberg matter excellenz seckendorf had the task henceforth of keeping by artmagic or the preternatural methodthat is by mere help of grumkow and the devilhis prussian majesty steady to the kaiser nevertheless always well divided from the english especially which the excellency seckendorf managed to do for six or seven years coming or in fact till these spectrechasings ended or ran elsewhither for consummation steady always jealous of the english sometimes nearly mad but always ready as a primed cannon so friedrich wilhelm was accordingly managed to be kepthis own household gone almost into delirium he himself looking out with loyally fierce survey for any antikaiser war when do we go off thenthough none ever came and indeed nothing came and except those torments to young friedrich and others it was all nothing one of the strangest pieces of blackart ever done  excellenz seckendorf whom friedrich wilhelm so loves is by no means a beautiful man far the reverse bodilyand the spirit correspondsa stiffbacked petrified stony inscrutablelooking and most unbeautiful old intriguer portraits of him which are frequent tell all one story the brow puckered together in a wide web of wrinkles from each temple as if it meant to hide the bad pair of eyes which look suspicion inquiry apprehension habit of doubledistilled mendacity the indeterminate projecting chin with its thick chapped underlip is shaken out or shoved out in millhopper fashionas if to swallow anything there may be spoken thing or other and grind it to profitable meal for itself spiritually he was an old soldier let for hire an old intriguer liar fighter what you like what we may call a human soul standing like a hackneycoach this halfcentury past with head tongue heart conscience at the hest of a discerning public and its shilling  there is considerable faculty a certain stiffnecked strength in the old fellow in fact nature had been rather kind to him and certainly his uncle and guardianthe distinguished seckendorf who did the historia lutheranismi a ritter and man of good mark in ernst the pious of saxegothas timetook pains about his education but natures gifts have not prospered with him how could they in that hackneycoach way of life considerable gifts we say shrunk into a strange bankruptcy in the development of them a stiffbacked closefisted old gentleman with millhopper chinwith puckery muchinquiring eyes which have never discovered any noble path for him in this world he is a strictly orthodox protestant zealous about external points of moral conduct yet scruples not for the kaisers shilling to lie with energy to all lengths and fight according to the reichshofrath code for any god or man he is gone mostly to avarice in these mature years all his various strengths turned into strength of grasping he is now fiftyfour a man public in the world especially since he became the kaisers man but he has served various masters in various capacities and been in many warsand for the next thirty years we shall still occasionally meet him seldom to our advantage  he comes from anspach originally and has kindred seckendorfs in office there old ritters in that country he inherited a handsome castle and estate meuselwitz near altenburg in the thuringen region from that uncle ernst of saxegothas man whom we spoke of and has otherwise gained wealth all which he holds like a vice once at meuselwitz they say he and some young secretary of a smartish turn sat working or conversing in a large room with only one candle to illuminate it the secretary snuffing the candle snuffed it out pshaw said seckendorf impatiently where did you learn to handle snuffers excellenz in a place where there were two lights kept replied the other  sechendorje leben already cited i 4for the rest he has a good old wife at meuselwitz who is now old and had never any children who loves him much and is much loved by him it would appear this is really the best fact i ever knew of himpoor bankrupt creature gone all to spiritual rheumatism to strict orthodoxy with unlimited mendacity and avarice as the general outcome stiffbacked closefisted strength all grown wooden or stony yet some little well of human sympathy does lie far in the interior one wishes after all since he could not be got hanged in time for us good days to his poor old wife and him he both lisps and snuffles as was mentioned writes cunningly acres of despatches to prince eugene never swears though a military man except on great occasions one oath jarnibleuwhich is perhaps some flashnote version of chairdedieu like parbleu zounds and the rest of them which the devil cannot prosecute you for whereby an economic man has the pleasure of swearing on cheap terms  herr pollnitzs account of seckendorf is unusually emphatic babbling pollnitz rises into a strain of pulpit eloquence inspired by indignation on this topic he affected german downrightness to which he was a stranger and followed under a deceitful show of piety all the principles of machiavel with the most sordid love of money he combined boorish manners lies of the distilled kind chiefly had so become a habit with him that he had altogether lost notion of employing truth in speech it was the soul of a usurer inhabiting now the body of a warcaptain now transmigrating into that of a huckster false oaths and the abominablest basenesses cost him nothing so his object might be reached he was miserly with his own but lavish with his masters money daily he gave most striking proofs of both these habitudes and this was the man whom we saw for a space of time at the head of the kaisers armies and at the helm of the state and of the german empire pollnitz ii 238having done the prussian affair so well  this cunning old gentleman to date from the autumn of 1726 may be said to have taken possession of friedrich wilhelm to have gone into him grumkow and he as two devils would have done in the old miraculous times and in many senses it was they not the nominal proprietor that lived friedrich wilhelms life for the next seven years a figure went about not doubting it was friedrich wilhelm but it was in reality seckendorfandgrumkow much more these two conjurer and his man both invisible have caught their royal wild bear got a rope round his muzzleand so dance him about now terrifying now exhilarating all the market by the pranks he plays grumkow a very machiavel after his sort knew the nature of the royal animal as no other did grumkow purchased by his pension of 500 pounds is dogcheap at the money as seckendorf often urges at vienna is he not and they add a touch of extraordinary gift now and then 40000 florins 4000 pounds on one occasion in 1732 forster iii 232 for grumkow dienet ehrlich serves honorably urges seckendorf and again if anybody deserves favor gnade meaning extra pay it is this gentlemanwahrlich purchased grumkow has ample money at command to purchase other people needed and does purchase so that all things and persons can be falsified and enchanted as need is by and by it has got so far that friedrich wilhelms ambassador at london maintains a ciphercorrespondence with grumkow and writes to friedrich wilhelm not what is passing in city or court there but what grumkow wishes friedrich wilhelm to think is passing  of insinuations by assent or contradiction potent if you know the nature of the beast of these we need not speak tabakscollegium has become a workshophuman nature can fancy it nay human nature can still read it in the british statepaper office to boundless stupendous extentbut ought mostly to suppress it when read  this is a very strange part of friedrich wilhelms history and has caused much wonder in the world wilhelminas book rather aggravating than assuaging that feeling on the part of intelligent readers a book written long afterwards from her recollections from her own oblique point of view in a beautifully shrill humor running not unnaturally into confused exaggerations and distortions of all kinds not mendaciously written anywhere yet erroneously everywhere wilhelmina had no knowledge of the magical machinery that was at work she vaguely suspects grumkow and seckendorf but does not guess in the mad explosions of papa that two devils have got into papa and are doing the mischief trusting to memory alone she misdates mistakes misplaces jumbles all things topsyturvygiving on the whole an image of affairs which is altogether oblique dislocated exaggerative and which in fine proves unintelligible if you try to construe it into a fact or thing done yet her human narrative in that wide waste of merely pedant maunderings is of great worth to us a green tree a leafy grove better or worse in the wilderness of dead bones and sandhow welcome many other books have been written on the matter but these to my experience only darken it more and more pull wilhelmina straight the best you can deduct a twentyfive or sometimes even a seventyfive per cent from the exaggerative portions of her statement you will find her always true lucid charmingly human and by far the best authority on this part of her brothers history statepapers to some extent have also been printed on the matter and of written statepapers here in england and elsewhere this editor has had several hundredweights distilled for him but except as lights hung out over wilhelmina nothing yet known of published or manuscript can be regarded as good for much  o heavens had one but sevenleague boots to get across that inane countrya bottomless whirlpool of dust and cobwebs in many placeswhere at any rate we had so little to do elucidating rectifying painfully contrasting comparing let us try to work out some conceivable picture of this strange imperial much ado about nothing and get our unfortunate crownprince and our unfortunate selves alive through it     chapter vii  tobaccoparliament  in these distressing junctures it may cheer the readers spirits and will tend to explain for him what is coming if we glance a little into the friedrichwilhelm tabagie tabakscollegium or smoking college more worthy to be called tobaccoparliament of which there have already been incidental notices far too remarkable an institution of the country to be overlooked by us here  friedrich wilhelm though an absolute monarch does not dream of governing without law still less without justice which he knows well to be the one basis for him and for all kings and men his lifeeffort prosecuted in a grand unconscious unvarying and instinctive way may be defined rather as the effort to find out everywhere in his affairs what was justice to make regulations laws in conformity with that and to guide himself and his prussia rigorously by these truly he is not of constitutional turn cares little about the wigs and formalities of justice pressing on so fiercely towards the essence and fact of it he has been known to tear asunder the wigs and formalities in a notably impatient manner when they stood between him and the fact but prussia has its laws withal tolerably abundant tolerably fixed and supreme and the meanest prussian man that could find out a definite law coming athwart friedrich wilhelms wrath would check friedrich wilhelm in midvolleyor hope with good ground to do it hope we say for the king is in his own and his peoples eyes to some indefinite extent always himself the supreme ultimate interpreter and grand living codex of the lawsalways to some indefinite extentand there remains for a subject man nothing but the appeal to philip sober in some rash cases on the whole however friedrich wilhelm is by no means a lawless monarch nor are his prussians slaves by any means they are patient stouthearted subject men with a very considerable quantity of radical fire very well covered in prevented from idle explosions bound to a respectful demeanor and especially to hold their tongues as much as possible  friedrich wilhelm has not the least shadow of a constitutional parliament nor even a privycouncil as we understand it his ministers being in general mere clerks to register and execute what he had otherwise resolved upon but he had his tabakscollegium tobaccocollege smoking congress tabagie which has made so much noise in the world and which in a rough natural way affords him the uses of a parliament on most cheap terms and without the formidable inconveniences attached to that kind of institution a parliament reduced to its simplest expression and instead of parliamentary eloquence provided with dutch claypipes and tobacco so we may define this celebrated tabagie of friedrich wilhelms  tabagies were not uncommon among german sovereigns of that epoch george i at hanover had his smokingroom and select smoking party on an evening and even at london as we noticed smoked nightly wetting his royal throat with thin beer in presence of his fat and of his lean mistress if there were no other company tobaccointroduced by the swedish soldiers in the thirtyyears war say some or even by the english soldiers in the bohemian or palatinate beginnings of said war say otherstobacco once shown them was enthusiastically adopted by the german populations long in want of such an article and has done important multifarious functions in that country ever since for truly in politics morality and all departments of their practical and speculative affairs we may trace its influences good and bad to this day  influences generally bad pacificatory but bad engaging you in idle cloudy dreamsstill worse promoting composure among the palpably chaotic and discomposed soothing all things into lazy peace that all things may be left to themselves very much and to the laws of gravity and decomposition whereby german affairs are come to be greatly overgrown with funguses in our time and give symptoms of dry and of wet rot wherever handled george i we say had his tabagie and other german sovereigns had but none of them turned it to a political institution as friedrich wilhelm did the thrifty man finding it would serve in that capacity withal he had taken it up as a commonplace solace and amusement it is a reward for doing strenuously the days heavy labors to wind them up in this manner in quiet society of friendly human faces into a contemplative smokecanopy slowly spreading into the realm of sleep and its dreams friedrich wilhelm was a man of habitudes his evening tabagie became a law of nature to him constant as the setting of the sun favorable circumstances quietly noticed and laid hold of by the thrifty man developed this simple evening arrangement of his into a sort of smoking parliament small but powerful where stateconsultations in a fitful informal way took place and the weightiest affairs might by dexterous management cunning insinuation and manoeuvring from those that understood the art and the place he bent this way or that and ripened towards such issue as was desirable  to ascertain what the true course in regard to this or the other high matter will be what the public will think of it and in short what and how the executiveroyal shall do therein this the essential function of a parliament and privycouncil was here by artless cheap methods under the bidding of mere nature multifariously done mere taciturnity and sedative smoke making the most of what natural intellect there might be the substitution of tobaccosmoke for parliamentary eloquence is by some held to be a great improvement here is smelfunguss opinion quaintly expressed with a smile in it which perhaps is not all of joy  tobaccosmoke is the one element in which by our european manners men can sit silent together without embarrassment and where no man is bound to speak one word more than he has actually and veritably got to say nay rather every man is admonished and enjoined by the laws of honor and even of personal ease to stop short of that point at all events to hold his peace and take to his pipe again the instant he has spoken his meaning if he chance to have any the results of which salutary practice if introduced into constitutional parliaments might evidently be incalculable the essence of what little intellect and insight there is in that room we shall or can get nothing more out of any parliament and sedative gently soothing gently clarifying tobaccosmoke if the room were well ventilated open atop and the air kept good with the obligation to a minimum of speech surely gives human intellect and insight the best chance they can have best chance instead of the worst chance as at present ah me ah me who will reduce fools to silence again in any measure who will deliver men from this hideous nightmare of stumporatory under which the grandest nations are choking to a nameless death bleeding too truly from mouth and nose and ears in our sad days  this tobaccocollege is the grumkowandseckendorf chief field of action these two gentlemen understand thoroughly the nature of the prussian tobaccoparliament have studied the conditions of it to the most intricate cranny no english whipperin or eloquent premier knows his st stephens better or how to hatch a measure in that dim hot element by hint by innuendo by contemplative smoke speech and forbearance to speak often looking one way and rowing anotherthey can touch the secret springs and guide in a surprising manner the big dangerous fireship for such every stateparliament is towards the haven they intend for it most dexterous parliamentmen smokeparliament no walpole no dundas or immortal pitt first or second is cleverer in parliamentary practice for their fireship though smaller than the british is very dangerous withal look at this for instance seckendorf one evening far contrary to his wont which was prostrate respect in easy forms and always judicious submission of ones own weaker judgment towards his majestyhas got into some difficult defence of the kaiser defence very difficult or in reality impossible the cautious man is flustered by the intricacies of his position by his majestys indignant countervolleys and the perilous necessity there is to do the impossible on the spur of the instantgets into emphasis answers his majestys volcanic fire by incipient heat of his own and in short seems in danger of forgetting himself and kindling the tobaccoparliament into a mere conflagration that will be an issue for us and yet who dare interfere friedrich wilhelms words in high clangorous metallic plangency and the pathos of a lion raised by anger into song fall hotter and hotter seckendorfs puckered brow is growing of slatecolor his shelflip shuttling violently lisps and snuffles mere unconciliatory matterwhat on earth will become of ushoom boom dexterous grumkow has drawn a hummingtop from his pocket and suddenly sent it spinning there it hums and caracoles through the bottles and glasses reckless what dangerous breakage and spilth it may occasion friedrich wilhelm looked aside to it indignantly what is that inquired he in metallic tone still high pooh a toy i bought for the little prince august your majesty am only trying it his majesty understood the hint seckendorf still better and a jolly touch of laughter on both sides brought the matter back into the safe tobaccoclouds again forster ii 110  this smoking parliament or tabakscollegium of his prussian majesty was a thing much talked of in the world but till seckendorf and grumkow started their grand operations there its proceedings are not on record nor indeed till then had its political or parliamentary function become so decidedly evident it was originally a simple smokingclub got together on hest of nature without ulterior intentionsthus english parliamenta themselves are understood to have been in the old norman time mere royal christmasfestivities with natural colloquy or parleying between king and nobles ensuing thereupon and what wisest consultation concerning the arduous things of the realm the circumstances gave rise to such parleyings or consultationsalways two in number in regard to every matter it would seem or even three one sober one drunk and one just after being drunkproving of extreme service in practice grew to be parliament with its three readings and what not  a smokingroomwith wooden furniture we can supposein each of his majestys royal palaces was set apart for this evening service and became the tabagie of his majesty a tabagieroom in the berlin schloss another in the potsdam if the cicerone had any knowledge could still be pointed outbut the tobaccopipes that are shown as friedrich wilhelms in the kunstkammer or museum of berlin pipes which no rational smoker not compelled to it would have used awaken just doubt as to the cicerones and you leave the locality of the tabagie a thing conjectural in summer season at potsdam and in country situations tabagie could be held under a tent we expressly know his majesty held tabagie at wusterhausen nightly on the steps of the big fountain in the outer court there issuing from wusterhausen schloss and its little clipped lindens by the western side passing the sentries bridge and black ditch with live prussian eagles vicious black bears you come upon the royal tabagie of wusterhausen covered by an awning i should think sending forth its bits of smokeclouds and its hum of human talk into the wide free desert round any room that was large enough and had height of ceiling and aircirculation and no clothfurniture would do and in each palace is one or more than one that has been fixed upon and fitted out for that object  a high large room as the engravings mostly worthless give it us contented saturnine human figures a dozen or so of them sitting round a large long table furnished for the occasion long dutch pipe in the mouth of each man supplies of knaster easily accessible small pan of burning peat in the dutch fashion sandy native charcoal which burns slowly without smoke is at your left hand at your right a jug which i find to consist of excellent thin bitter beer other costlier materials for drinking if you want such are not beyond reach on sidetables stand wholesome coldmeats royal rounds of beef not wanting with bread thinly sliced and buttered in a rustic but neat and abundant way such innocent accommodations narcotic or nutritious gaseous fluid and solid as human nature bent on contemplation and an evening lounge can require perfect equality is to be the rule no rising or notice taken when anybody enters or leaves let the entering man take his place and pipe without obligatory remarks if he cannot smoke which is seckendorfs case

believe was rambling and multifarious the days hunting if at wusterhausen the days news if at berlin or potsdam old reminiscences too i can fancy turning up and talk even in seckendorfs own time about

as we shall not see again till the last of the days  failing talk there were newspapers in abundance scraggy dutch courants journals of the rhine famas frankfurt zeitungs with which his majesty exuberantly supplied himselfbeing willing to know what was passing in the high places of the world or even what in the dark snuffy editors thoughts was passing this kind of matter as some picture of the actual hour his majesty liked to have read to him even during mealtime some subordinate character with clear windpipeall the better too if he be a bookman cognizant of history geography and can explain everythingusually reads the newspaper from some high seat behind backs while his majesty and household dine the same subordinate personage may be worth his place in the tabagie should his function happen to prove necessary there even bookmen though generally pedants and mere bags of wind and folly are good for something more especially if rich mines of quizzability turn out to be workable in them     of gundling and the literary men in tobaccoparliament  friedrich wilhelm had in succession or sometimes simultaneously a number of such nondescripts to read his newspapers and season his tabagielast evanescent phasis of the old courtfool specieswho form a noticeable feature of his environment one very famous literary gentleman of this description who distanced every competitor in the tabagie and elsewhere for serving his majestys occasions was jakob paul gundling a name still laughingly remembered among the prussian people gundling was a countryclergymans son of the nurnberg quarter had studied carrying off the honors in various universities had read or turned over whole cartloads of wise and foolish books gravitating i fear towards the latter kind had gone the grand tour as travelling tutor as companion to an english gentleman he had seen courts perhaps camps at lowest cities and inns knew in a manner practically and theoretically all things and had published multifarious books of his own list of them twentyone in number mostly on learned antiquarian subjectsin forster ii 255 256 the sublime longeared erudition of the man was not to be contested manifest to everybody thrice and four times manifest to himself in the first place  in the course of his roamings and grand and little tours he had come to berlin in old king friedrichs time had thrown powder in the eyes of men there and been appointed to professorships in the ritteracademy to chiefheraldshipshistoriographer royal and perhaps other honors and emoluments the whole of which were cut down by the ruthless scythe of friedrich wilhelm ruthlessly mowing his field clear in the manner we saw at his accession whereby learned grandiloquent gundling much addicted to liquor by this time and turning the corner of forty saw himself cast forth into the general wilderness that is to say walking the streets of berlin with no resources but what lay within himself and his own hungry skin much given to liquor too how he lived for a year or two after thiserudite pen and braggart tongue his only resourceswere tragical to say at length a famous tavernkeeper the leipzige polterhans leipzig killcow or boisterousjack as they call him finding what a dungeon of erudite talk this gundling was and how gentlemen got entertained by him gave gundling the run of his tavern or i fear only a seat in the drinkingroom and it was here that general grumkow found him talking big and disserting de omni scibili to the ancient berlin gentlemen over their cups a very dictionary of a man who knows in a manner all things and is by no means ignorant that he knows them would not this man suit his majesty thought grumkow and brought him to majesty to read the newspapers and explain everything date is not given or hinted at but incidentally we find gundling in full blast in the year 1718 von loen kleine schriften i 201 cited in forster i 260 and conclude his instalment was a year or two before gundling came to his majesty from the taproom of boisterousjack read the newspapers and explained everything such a dictionaryinbreeches much given to liquor as his majesty had got was never seen before working into the man his majesty who had a great taste for such things discovered in him such mines of collegelearning courtlearning without end selfconceit and depth of appetite not less considerable in fine such chaotic blockheadism with the consciousness of being wisdom as was wondrous to beholdas filled his majesty especially with laughter and joyful amazement here are mines of native darkness and human stupidity capable of being made to phosphoresce and effervesceare there not your majesty omniscient gundling was a prime resource in the tabagie for many years to come man with sublimer stores of longeared learning and omniscience man more destitute of motherwit was nowhere to be met with a man bankrupt of motherwitwho has squandered any poor motherwit he had in the process of acquiring his sublime longeared omniscience and has retained only depth of appetiteappetite for liquor among other things as the consummation and bottomless cesspool of appetitesis not this a discovery we have made in boisterousjacks your majesty  the man was an eldorado for the peculiar quizzing humor of his majesty who took immense delight in working him when occasion served in the first years he had to attend his majesty on all occasions of amusement if you invite his majesty to dinner gundling too must be of the party daily otherwise gundling was at the tabagie getting drunk if nothing better vein after vein rich in broad fun very broad and brobdignagian such as suits there is discovered in him without wit himself but much the cause of wit none oftener shook the tabagie with inextinguishable hahas daily by stirring into him you could wrinkle the tabagie into grim radiance of banter and silent grins  he wore sublime clothes friedrich wilhelm whom we saw dress up his regimental scavengerexecutioners in french costume for count rothenburgs behoof made haste to load gundling with rathships kammerherrships titles such as fools covetgave him tolerable pensions too poor devil and even functions if they were of the imaginary or big insignificant sort above all things his majesty dressed him as the pink of fortunate ambitious courtiers superfine scarlet coat gold buttonholes blackvelvet facings and embroideries without end strawcolored breeches red silk stockings with probably blue clocks to them and shoes with red heels on his learned head sat an immense cloudperiwig of white goatshair the man now growing towards fifty in the hat a red featherin this guise he walked the streets the gold key of kammerherr chamberlain conspicuously hanging at his coatbreast and looked proudly down upon the world when sober alas he was often not sober and fiends in human shape were ready enough to take advantage of his unguarded situation no man suffered ruder tarringandfeatheringand his only comfort was his bane withal that he had under such conditions the use of the royal cellars and could always command good liquor there  his illustrious scarlet coat by tumblings in the ditch soon got dirty to a degree and exposed him to the biting censures of his majesty anxious for the respectability of his hofraths one day two wicked captains finding him prostrate in some lone place cut off his kammerherr key and privately gave it to his majesty majesty in tabagie notices gundlings coatbreast where is your key then herr kammerherr hm hahunfortunately lost it ihro majestatlost it say you and his majesty looks dreadfully gravekey lost thinks tabagie grave seckendorf included jarnibleu that is something serious as if a soldier were to drink his musket thinks his majesty and what are the laws if an ignorant fellow is shot and a learned wise one escapes here is matter for a deliberative tabagie and to poor gundling a bad outlook fatal or short of fatal he had better not even drink much but dispense with consolation and keep his wits about him till this squall pass after much deliberating it is found that the royal clemency can be extended and an outlet devised under conditions next tabagie a servant enters with one of the biggest trays in the world and upon it a wooden key gilt about an ell long this gigantic implement is solemnly hung round the repentant kammerherr this he shall wear publicly as penance and be upon his behavior till the royal mind can relent figure the poor blockhead till that happen on recovering his metal key he goes to a smith and has it fixed on with wire  what gundling thought to himself amid these pranks and hoaxings we do not know the poor soul was not born a fool though he had become one by collegelearning vanity strongdrink and the worlds perversity and his own under good guidance especially if bred to strict silence he might have been in some measure a luminous objectnot as now a phosphorescent one shining by its mere rottenness a sad calamity of authors indeed when it overtakes a manpoor gundling probably had lucid intervals now and then tragic fits of discernment in the innerman of him he had a brother also a learned man who retained his senses and was even a rather famed professor at halle whose portrait looking very academic solemn and welltodo turns up in old printshops whose books concerning henry the fowler de henrico aucupe kaiser conrad i and other dim historical objects are still consultablethough with little profit to my experience the name of this one was nicolaus hieronymus ours is jakob paul the senior brotheronce the hope of the house it is likely and a fond fathers pridein that poor old nurnberg parsonage long ago  jakob paul likewise continued to write books on brandenburg heraldries topography genealogies even a life or two of some old brandenburg electors are still extant from his hand but not looked at now by any mortal he had been perhaps was again historiographer royal and felt bound to write such books several of them he printed and we hear of others still manuscript in five folio volumes written fair he held innumerable halfmock titles and offices among others was actual president of the berlin royal society or academie des sciences leibnitzs pet daughterthere gundling actually sat in office and drew the salary for one certainty as good he as another thought friedrich wilhelm what is the use of these solemn fellows in their big perukes with their crabbed xys and scientiflc pedlersfrench doing nothing that i can see except annually the berlin almanac which they live upon let them live upon it and be thankful with gundling for their head man  academy of sciences makes its almanac and some peculium of profit by it lectures perhaps a little on anatomy good for something that in his majestys mind but languisheswithout encouragement during the present reign has his majesty no prize questions to propose then none or worse he once officially put these learned associates upon ascertaining for him why champagne foamed they with a hidden vein of pleasantry required material to experiment upon friedrich wilhelm sent them a dozen or certain dozens and the matter proved insoluble to this day no king scarcely any man had less of reverence for the sciences so called for academic culture and the art of the talkingschoolmaster in general a king obtuse to the fine arts especially to the vocal arts in a high degree literary fame itself he regards as mountebank fame the art of writing big admirable folios is little better to him than that of vomiting long coils of wonderful ribbon for the idlers of the marketplace and he bearbaits his gundling in this manner as phosphorescent blockhead of the first magnitude worthy of nothing better  nay it is but lately 1723 the exact year that he did his evermemorable feat in regard to wolf and his philosophy at halle illustrious wolf was recognized at that time as the second greater leibnitz and headphilosopher of nature who by mathematical method had as it were taken nature in the fact and illuminated everything so that whosoever ran might readwhich all manner of people then tried to do but have now quite ceased trying by the wolfmethodimmortal wolf somewhat of a stiff reserved humor inwardly a little proud and not wanting in private contempt of the contemptible had been accused of heterodoxy by the halle theologians immortal wolf croakily satirical withal had of course defended himself and of course got into a shoreless sea of controversy with the halle theologians pestering his majesty with mere wars and rumors of war for a length of time from that halle university in busching beitrage i l140 is rough authentic account of wolf and especially of all thatwith several curious letters of wolfs so that majesty unable to distinguish top or bottom in such a coil of argument or to do justice in the case however willing and anxious often passionately asked what in gods name is the real truth of it majesty appointed commissions to inquire read reports could for a long while make out nothing certain at last came a decision on the suddenroyal mind suddenly illuminated it is a little uncertain how some give the credit of it to gundling which is unlikely others to two generals of pious orthodox turn acquainted with halleand i have heard obscurely that it was the old dessauer who also knew halle and was no doubt wearied to hear nothing talked of there but injured philosopher wolf and injuring theologian lange or vice versa some practical military man not given to take up with shadows it likeliest was in gods name what is the real truth of all that inquired his majesty of the practical man does wolf teach hellish doctrines as lange says or heavenly as himself says teaches babble mainly i should think and scientific pedlers french intimated the practical man but they say he has one doctrine about oaths and what he calls foundation of duty which i did not like not a heavenly doctrine that follow out that any of your majestys grenadiers might desert and say he had done no sin against god busching i 8 benekendorf karakterzilge aus dem leben konig friedrich wilhelm i anonymous berlin 1787 ii 23 friedrich wilhelm flew into a paroxysm of horror instantly redacted brief royal decree 15th november busching says 8th 1723 which is still extant among the curiosities of the universe ordering wolf to quit halle and the prussian dominions bag and baggage forevermore within eightandforty hours bey strafe des stranges under pain of the halter  halter the headphilosopher of nature found too late will be hanged as if he were a sheepstealer hanged and no mistake poor wolf gathered himself together wife and baggage girded up his loins and ran with the due despatch he is now found sheltered under hessendarmstadt at marburg professing something there and all the intellect of the world is struck with astonishment and with silent or vocal pity for the poor manit is but fair to say friedrich wilhelm gradually taking notice of the worlds humor in regard to this began to have his own misgivings and determined to read some of wolfs books for himself reading in wolf he had sense to discern that here was a man of undeniable talent and integrity that the practical military judgment loading with the iron ramrod had shot wide of the mark in this matter and in short that a palpable bit of foulplay had been done this was in 1733ten years after the shot when his majesty saw with his own eyes how wide it had gone he applied to wolf earnestly more than once to come back to him halle frankfurt any prussian university with a vacancy in it was now wide open to wolf but wolf knew better wolf with bows down to the ground answered always evadinglyand never would come back till the new reign began  friedrich wilhelm knew little of booklearning or bookwriting and his notion of it is very shocking to us but the fact is o reader bookwriting is of two kinds one wise and may be among the wisest of earthly things the other foolish sometimes far beyond what can be reached by human nature elsewhere blockheadism unwisdom while silent is reckoned bad but blockheadism getting vocal able to speak persuasivelyhave you considered that at all human opacity falling into phosphorescence that is to say becoming luminous to itself and to many mortals by the very excess of it by the very bursting of it into putrid fermentationall other forms of chaos are cosmic in comparisonour poor friedrich wilhelm had seen only gundlings among the bookwriting class had he seen wiser specimens he might have formed as he did in wolfs case another judgment nay in regard to gundling himself it is observable how with his unutterable contempt he seems to notice in him glimpses of the admirable such acquirements such dictionaryfaculties though gone distractedand almost has a kind of love for the absurd dog

sightings shall and may use the abovesaid shield of armsif it can be of any advantage to them a prussian majesty who gives us 150 pounds yearly with board and lodging and the run of his cellar and honors such as these is not to be lightly sneezed away though of queer humors now and then the highest personages as we said more than once made gifts to gundling miniatures set in diamonds purses of a hundred ducats even gundling it was thought might throw in a word mad or otherwise which would bear fruit it was said of him he never spoke to harm anybody with his majesty the poor blownup blockhead was radically not illnaturedat least if you let his phosphorescences alone  but the grandest explosions in tobaccoparliament were producible when you got two literary fools and as if with leydenjars positive and negative brought their vanities to bear on one another this sometimes happened when tobaccoparliament was in luck friedrich wilhelm had a variety of merryandrew raths of the gundling sort though none ever came up to gundling or approached him in worth as a merryandrew  herr fassmann who wrote books by patronage or for the leipzig booksellers and wandered about the world as a star or comet of some magnitude is not much known to my readersbut he is too well known to me for certain dark books of his which i have had to read life of friedrich wilhelm occasionally cited here life of august the strong  c a very dim literary figure undeniable indecipherable human fact of those days now fallen quite extinct and obsolete his garniture equipment environment all very dark to us probably a too restless imponderous creature too much of the gundling type structure of him gaseous not solid perhaps a little of the coxcomb naturally much of the sycophant on compulsionbeing sorely jammed into corners and without elbowroom at all in this world has for the rest a recognizable talent for magazine writingfor newspaper editing had that rich mine california of the spiritually vagabond been opened in those days poor extinct fassmann one discovers at last a vein of weak geniality in him here and there real human sense and eyesight under those strange conditions and his poor books rotted now to inanity have left a small seedpearl or two to the earnest reader alas if he was to become spiritually vagabond spiritually and otherwise might it not perhaps be wholesome to him that the california was not discovered  fassmann was by no means such a fool as gundling but he was much of a fool too he had come to berlin about this time 1726 as he himself says supra p 8 in hopes of patronage from the king or somebody might say to himself surely i am a better man than gundling if the berlin court has eyesight by the king on some wise generals recommending it he was as a preliminary introduced to the tabagie at least here is the celebrated gundling there is the celebrated fassmann positive leydenjar with negative close by in each of these two men lodges a fullcharged fiery electric virtue of selfconceit destructive each of the othercould a conductor be discovered conductors are discoverable conductors are not wanting and many are the explosions between these mutuallydestructive human varietieswelcomed with hilarious rather vacant huge horselaughter in this tobaccoparliament and synod of the houyhnhnms  of which take this acme and then end fassmann a fellow not without sarcasm and sharpness as you may still see has one evening provoked gundling to the transcendent pitchtill words are weak and only action will answer gundling driven to the exploding point suddenly seizes his dutch smokingpan of peatcharcoal ashes and redhot sand and dashes it in the face of fassmann who is of course dreadfully astonished thereby and has got his very eyebrows burnt not to speak of other injuries stand to him fassmann fassmann stands to him tightly being the better man as well as the more satirical grasps gundling by the collar wrenches him about lays him at last over his knee sittingpart uppermost slaps said sittingpart poor sittingpart that had broken the ice of wusterhausen with the hot pannay some say strips it and slaps amid the inextinguishable horselaughter sincere but vacant of the houyhnhnm olympus  after which his majesty as epilogue to such play suggests that feats of that nature are unseemly among gentlemen that when gentlemen have a quarrel there is another way of settling it fassmann thereupon challenges gundling gundling accepts time and place are settled pistols the weapon at the appointed time and place gundling stands accordingly pistol in hand but at sight of fassmann throws his pistol away will not shoot any man nor have any man shoot him fassmann sternly advances shoots his pistol powder merely into gundlings sublime goatshair wig wig blazes into flame gundling falls shrieking a dead man to the earth and they quench and revive him with a bucket of water was there ever seen such horseplay roaring laughter huge rude and somewhat vacant as that of the norse gods over their ale at yule timeas if the face of the sphinx were to wrinkle itself in laughter or the fabulous houyhnhnms themselves were there to mock in their peculiar fashion  his majesty at length gave gundling a winecask duly figured painted black with a white cross which was to stand in his room as mementomori and be his coffin it stood for ten years gundling often sitting to write in it a good screen against draughts and the poor monster was actually buried in this cask died 11th april 1731 age 58 description of the burial at bornstadt near potsdam in forster i 276 fassmann pronouncing some funeral orationand the orthodox clergy uttering from the distance only a mute groan the herr baron von gundling was a man of many dignities of much booklearning a man of great memory admits fassmann but of no judgment insinuates helooking for the judgment expectans judicium says fassmann with a pleasant wit fassmann succeeded to all the emoluments and honors but did not hold them preferred to run away before long and after him came one and the other whom the reader is not to be troubled with here enough if the patient reader have seen a little into that background of friedrich wilhelms existence and for the didactic part have caught up his real views or instincts upon spiritual phosphorescence or stupidity grown vocal which are much sounder than most of us suspect  these were the sports of the tobaccoparliament and it was always meant primarily for sport for recreation but there is no doubt it had a serious function as well business matters adds beneckendorf who had means of knowing benekendorf karakterzuge i 137149 vi 37 were often a subject of colloquy in the tabakscollegium not that they were there finished off decided upon or meant to be so but friedrich wilhelm often purposely brought up such things in conversation there that he might learn the different opinions of his generals and chief men without their observing itand so might profit by the collective wisdom in short     chapter viii  seckendorfs retort to her majesty  the treaty of wusterhausen was not yet known to queen sophie to her father george or to any external creature but that open flinching and gradual withdrawal from the treaty of hanover was too well known and boded no good to her pet project female sighs male obduracies and other domestic phenomena are to be imagined in consequence a grand britannic majesty indeed very lofty father to us madam ever since he came to be king of england stalking along there with his nose in the air not deigning the least notice of us except as of a thing that may be got to fight for him and he does not sign the doublemarriage treaty madam only talks of signing itas if we were a starved coachhorse to be quickened along by a wisp of hay put upon the coachpole close ahead of us alwaysjarnibleu snuffles seckendorf with a virtuous zeal or looks it and things are not pleasant at the royal dinnertable  excellenz seckendorf we find at this time often has his majesty to dinner and such dinners fitting ones tastes in all pointsno expense regarded which indeed is the kaisers if we knew it and in return excellenz is frequently at dinner with his majesty where the conversation if it turn on england which often happens is more and more an offence to queen sophie seckendorf studies to be polite reserved before the queens majesty at her own table yet sometimes he lisps out in his vile snuffling tone halfinsinuations remarks on our royal kindred which are irritating in the extreme queen sophie the politest of women did once says pollnitz on some excessive pressure of that lisping snuffling unendurability lose her royal patience and flame out with human frankness and uncommonly kindled eyes she signified to seckendorf that none who was not himself a kind of scoundrel could entertain such thoughts of kings and gentlemen which hard saying kindled the stiffbacked rheumatic soul of seckendorf excellenz had withal a temper in him far down in the deeps who answered your majesty that is what no one else thinks of me that is a name i have never permitted any one to give me with impunity and verily he kept his threat in that latter point says pollnitz ii 244  at this stage it is becoming in the nature of things unlikely that the projected doublemarriage or any union with england can ever realize itself for queen sophie and her house the kaiser has decreed that it never shall here is the king already irritated grown indisposed to it here is the kaisers seckendorf with preternatural apparatus come to maintain him in that humor to queen sophie herself who saw only the outside of seckendorf and his apparatus the matter doubtless seemed big with difficulties but to us who see the interior the difficulties are plainly hopeless unless the kaisers mind change unless many fixed things change the doublemarriage is impossible  one thing only is a sorrow and this proved an immeasurable one that they did not that queen sophie did not in such case frankly give it up doublemarriage is not a law of nature it is only a project at hanover that has gone off again there will be a life for our crownprince and princess without a marriage with englandit is greatly wise to recognize the impossible the unreasonably difficult when it presents itself but who of men is there much more who of women that can always do it  queen sophie dorothee will have this doublemarriage and it shall be possible pour lady she was very obstinate and her husband was very arbitrary a rough bear of a husband yet by no means an unloving one a husband who might have been managed she evidently made a great mistake in deciding not to obey this man as she had once vowed by perfect prompt obedience she might have had a very tolerable life with the rugged orson fallen to her lot who was a very honesthearted creature she might have done a pretty stroke of female work withal in taming her orson might have led him by the muzzle far enough in a private wayby obedience  but by disobedience by rebellion open or secret friedrich wilhelm was a husband friedrich wilhelm was a king and the most imperative man then breathing disobedience to friedrich wilhelm was a thing which in the prussian state still more in the berlin schloss and vital heart of said state the laws of heaven and of earth had not permitted for any mans or any womans sake to be the wide overarching sky looks down on no more inflexible sovereign man than him in the redcollared blue coat and white leggings with the bamboo in his hand a peaceable capacious not illgiven sovereign man if you will let him have his way but to bar his way to tweak the nose of his sovereign royalty and ignominiously force him into another way that is an enterprise no man or devil or body of men or devils need attempt seckendorf and grumkow in tobaccoparliament understand it better that attempt is impossible once for all the first step in such attempt will require to be assassination of friedrich wilhelm for you may depend on it royal sophie so long as he is alive the feat cannot be done o royal sophie o pretty feekin what a business you are making of it  the year 1726 was throughout a troublous one to queen sophie seckendorfs advent king georges manifestoing alarm of imminent universal war nay sputters of it actually beginning gibraltar invested by the spaniards ready for besieging it is said nor was this all sophies poor mother worn to a tragic megaera locked so long in the castle of ahlden has taken up wild plans of outbreak of escape by means of secretaries moneys in the bank of amsterdam and i know not what with all which sophie corresponding in double and triple mystery has her own terrors and sorrows trying to keep it down and now in the depth of the year the poor old mother suddenly dies 13th november 1726 memoirs of sophia dorothea consort of
