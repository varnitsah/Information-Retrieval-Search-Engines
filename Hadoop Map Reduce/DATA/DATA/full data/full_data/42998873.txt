wheel and his eye on the globe of the         jackstaff   holding the boat to the shore and out of the sweep of the current   lightly turning aside for the heavy logs of the driftwood   widely shunning the snags that made us sardonic obeisance    ii    all the soft damp air was full of delicate perfume   from the young willows in bloom on either bank of the river   faint delicious fragrance trancing the indolent senses   in a luxurious dream of the river and land of the lotus   not yet out of the west the roses of sunset were withered   in the deep blue above light clouds of gold and of crimson   floated in slumber serene and the restless river beneath them   rushed away to the sea with a vision of rest in its bosom   far on the eastern shore lay dimly the swamps of the cypress   dimly before us the islands grew from the rivers expanses   beautiful woodgrown isles with the gleam of the swart inundation   seen through the swaying boughs and slender trunks of their         willows   and on the shore beside us the cottontrees rose in the evening   phantomlike yearningly wearily with the inscrutable sadness   of the mute races of trees while hoarsely the steam from her         scapepipes   shouted then whispered a moment then shouted again to the         silence   trembling through all her frame with the mighty pulse of her         engines   slowly the boat ascended the swollen and broad mississippi   bankfull sweeping on with tangled masses of driftwood   daintily breathed about with whiffs of silvery vapor   where in his arrowy flight the twittering swallow alighted   and the belated blackbird paused on the way to its nestlings    iii    it was the pilots storythey both came aboard there at cairo   from a new orleans boat and took passage with us for saint louis   she was a beautiful woman with just enough blood from her mother   darkening her eyes and her hair to make her race known to a trader   you would have thought she was white the man that was with         heryou see such   weakly goodnatured and kind and weakly goodnatured and vicious   slender of body and soul fit neither for loving nor hating   i was a youngster then and only learning the river   not overfond of the wheel i used to watch them at monte   down in the cabin at night and learned to know all of the         gamblers   so when i saw this weak one staking his money against them   betting upon the turn of the cards i knew what was coming   they never left their pigeons a single feather to fly with   next day i saw them togetherthe stranger and one of the         gamblers   picturesque rascal he was with long black hair and moustaches   black slouch hat drawn down to his eyes from his villanous         forehead   on together they moved still earnestly talking in whispers   on toward the forecastle where sat the woman alone by the gangway   roused by the fall of feet she turned and beholding her master   greeted him with a smile that was more like a wifes than         anothers   rose to meet him fondly and then with the dread apprehension   always haunting the slave fell her eye on the face of the         gambler   dark and lustful and fierce and full of merciless cunning   something was spoken so low that i could not hear what the words         were   only the woman started and looked from one to the other   with imploring eyes bewildered hands and a tremor   all through her frame i saw her from where i was standing she         shook so   say is it so she cried on the weak white lips of her master   died a sickly smile and he said louise i have sold you   god is my judge may i never see such a look of despairing   desolate anguish as that which the woman cast on her master   griping her breast with her little hands as if he had stabbed her   standing in silence a space as fixed as the indian woman   carved out of wood on the pilothouse of the old pocahontas   then with a gurgling moan like the sound in the throat of the         dying   came back her voice that rising fluttered through wild         incoherence   into a terrible shriek that stopped my heart while she answered   sold me sold me soldand you promised to give me my freedom   promised me for the sake of our little boy in saint louis   what will you say to our boy when he cries for me there in saint         louis   what will you say to our godah you have been joking i see         it   no god god he shall hear itand all of the angels in heaven   even the devils in helland none will believe when they hear it   sold meher voice died away with a wail and in silence   down she sank on the deck and covered her face with her fingers    iv    in his story a moment the pilot paused while we listened   to the salute of a boat that rounding the point of an island   flamed toward us with fires that seemed to burn from the waters   stately and vast and swift and borne on the heart of the current   then with the mighty voice of a giant challenged to battle   rose the responsive whistle and all the echoes of island   swampland glade and brake replied with a myriad clamor   like wild birds that are suddenly startled from slumber at         midnight   then were at peace once more and we heard the harsh cries of the         peacocks   perched on a tree by a cabindoor where the whiteheaded settlers   whiteheaded children stood to look at the boat as it passed them   passed them so near that we heard their happy talk and their         laughter   softly the sunset had faded and now on the eastern horizon   hung like a tear in the sky the beautiful star of the evening    v    still with his back to us standing the pilot went on with his         story   all of us flocked round the woman the children cried and their         mothers   hugged them tight to their breasts but the gambler said to the         captain   put me off there at the town that lies round the bend of the         river   here you rise at once and be ready now to go with me   roughly he seized the womans arm and strove to uplift her   sheshe seemed not to heed him but rose like one that is         dreaming   slid from his grasp and fleetly mounted the steps of the gangway   up to the hurricanedeck in silence without lamentation   straight to the stern of the boat where the wheel was she ran and         the people   followed her fast till she turned and stood at bay for a moment   looking them in the face and in the face of the gambler   not one to save hernot one of all the compassionate people   not one to save her of all the pitying angels in heaven   not one bolt of god to strike him dead there before her   wildly she waved him back we waiting in silence and horror   over the swarthy face of the gambler a pallor of passion   passed like a gleam of lightning over the west in the nighttime   white she stood and mute till he put forth his hand to secure         her   then she turned and leapedin midair fluttered a moment   down then whirling fell like a brokenwinged bird from a         treetop   down on the cruel wheel that caught her and hurled her and         crushed her   and in the foaming water plunged her and hid her forever    vi    still with his back to us all the pilot stood but we heard him   swallowing hard as he pulled the bellrope for stopping then         turning   this is the place where it happened brokenly whispered the         pilot   somehow i never like to go by here alone in the nighttime   darkly the mississippi flowed by the town that lay in the         starlight   cheerful with lamps below we could hear them reversing the         engines   and the great boat glided up to the shore like a giant exhausted   heavily sighed her pipes broad over the swamps to the eastward   shone the full moon and turned our fartrembling wake into silver   all was serene and calm but the odorous breath of the willows   smote with a mystical sense of infinite sorrow upon us     forlorn     i    red roses in the slender vases burning     breathed all upon the air   the passion and the tenderness and yearning     the waiting and the doubting and despair    ii    still with the music of her voice was haunted     through all its charméd rhymes   the open book of such a one as chanted     the things he dreamed in old old summertimes    iii    the silvern chords of the piano trembled     still with the music wrung   from them the silence of the room dissembled     the closes of the songs that she had sung    iv    the languor of the crimson shawls abasement     lying without a stir   upon the floorthe absence at the casement     the solitude and hush were full of her    v    without and going from the room and never     departing did depart   her steps and one that came too late forever     felt them go heavy oer his broken heart    vi    and sitting in the houses desolation     he could not bear the gloom   the vanishing encounter and evasion     of things that were and were not in the room    vii    through midnight streets he followed fleeting visions     of faces and of forms   he heard old tendernesses and derisions     amid the sobs and cries of midnight storms    viii    by midnight lamps and from the darkness under     that lamps made at their feet   he saw sweet eyes peer out in innocent wonder     and sadly follow after him down the street    ix    the noonday crowds their restlessness obtruded     between him and his quest   at unseen corners jostled and eluded     against his hand her silken robes were pressed    x    doors closed upon her out of garret casements     he knew she looked at him   in splendid mansions and in squalid basements     upon the walls he saw her shadow swim    xi    from rapid carriages she gleamed upon him     whirling away from sight   from all the hopelessness of search she won him     back to the dull and lonesome house at night    xii    full early into dark the twilights saddened     within its closéd doors   the echoes with the clocks monotony maddened     leaped loud in welcome from the hollow floors    xiii    but gusts that blew all day with solemn laughter     from widemouthed chimneyplaces   and the strange noises between roof and rafter     the wainscot clamor and the scampering races    xiv    of mice that chased each other through the chambers     and up and down the stair   and rioted among the ashen embers     and left their frolic footprints everywhere    xv    were hushed to hear his heavy tread ascending     the broad steps one by one   and toward the solitary chamber tending     where the dim phantom of his hope alone    xvi    rose up to meet him with his growing nearer     eager for his embrace   and moved and melted into the white mirror     and stared at him with his own haggard face    xvii    but turning he was ware her looks beheld him     out of the mirror white   and at the window yearning arms she held him     out of the vague and sombre fold of night    xviii    sometimes she stood behind him looking over     his shoulder as he read   sometimes he felt her shadowy presence hover     above his dreamful sleep beside his bed    xix    and rising from his sleep her shadowy presence     followed his light descent   of the long stair her shadowy evanescence     through all the whispering rooms before him went    xx    upon the earthy draught of cellars blowing     his shivering lampflame blue   amid the damp and chill he felt her flowing     around him from the doors he entered through    xxi    the spiders wove their webs upon the ceiling     the bat clung to the wall   the dry leaves through the open transom stealing     skated and danced adown the empty hall    xxii    about him closed the utter desolation     about him closed the gloom   the vanishing encounter and evasion     of things that were and were not in the room    xxiii    vexed him forever and his life forever     immured and desolate   beating itself with desperate endeavor     but bruised itself against the round of fate    xxiv    the roses in their slender vases burning     were quenchéd long before   a dust was on the rhymes of love and yearning     the shawl was like a shroud upon the floor    xxv    her music from the thrilling chords had perished     the stillness was not moved   with memories of cadences long cherished     the closes of the songs that she had loved    xxvi    but not the less he felt her presence never     out of the room depart   over the threshold not the less forever     he felt her going on his broken heart     pleasurepain    das vergnügen ist nichts als ein höchst angenehmer   schmerzheinrich heine     i    full of beautiful blossoms     stood the tree in early may   came a chilly gale from the sunset     and blew the blossoms away    scattered them through the garden     tossed them into the mere   the sad tree moaned and shuddered     alas the fall is here    but all through the glowing summer     the blossomless tree throve fair   and the fruit waxed ripe and mellow     with sunny rain and air    and when the dim october     with golden death was crowned   under its heavy branches     the tree stooped to the ground    in youth there comes a westwind     blowing our bloom away   a chilly breath of autumn     out of the lips of may    we bear the ripe fruit after     ah me for the thought of pain   we know the sweetness and beauty     and the heartbloom never again    ii    one sails away to sea     one stands on the shore and cries   the ship goes down the world and the light     on the sullen water dies    the whispering shell is mute     and after is evil cheer   she shall stand on the shore and cry in vain     many and many a year    but the stately widewinged ship     lies wrecked on the unknown deep   far under dead in his coral bed     the lover lies asleep    iii    through the silent streets of the city     in the nights unbusy noon   up and down in the pallor     of the languid summer moon    i wander and think of the village     and the house in the maplegloom   and the porch with the honeysuckles     and the sweetbrier all abloom    my soul is sick with the fragrance     of the dewy sweetbriers breath   o darling the house is empty     and lonesomer than death    if i call no one will answer     if i knock no one will come   the feet are at rest forever     and the lips are cold and dumb    the summer moon is shining     so wan and large and still   and the weary dead are sleeping     in the graveyard under the hill    iv    we looked at the wide white circle     around the autumn moon   and talked of the change of weather     it would rain tomorrow or soon    and the rain came on the morrow     and beat the dying leaves   from the shuddering boughs of the maples     into the flooded eaves    the clouds wept out their sorrow     but in my heart the tears   are bitter for want of weeping     in all these autumn years    v    the bobolink sings in the meadow     the wren in the cherrytree   come hither thou little maiden     and sit upon my knee    and i will tell thee a story     i read in a book of rhyme   i will but fain that it happened     to me one summertime    when we walked through the meadow     and she and i were young   the story is old and weary     with being said and sung    the story is old and weary     ah child it is known to thee   who was it that last night kissed thee     under the cherrytree    vi    like a bird of evil presage     to the lonely house on the shore   came the wind with a tale of shipwreck     and shrieked at the bolted door    and flapped its wings in the gables     and shouted the wellknown names   and buffeted the windows     afeard in their shuddering frames    it was night and it is morning     the summer sun is bland   the whitecap waves come rocking rocking     in to the summer land    the whitecap waves come rocking rocking     in the sun so soft and bright   and toss and play with the dead man     drowned in the storm last night    vii    i remember the burning brushwood     glimmering all day long   yellow and weak in the sunlight     now leaped up red and strong    and fired the old dead chestnut     that all our years had stood   gaunt and gray and ghostly     apart from the sombre wood    and flushed with sudden summer     the leafless boughs on high   blossomed in dreadful beauty     against the darkened sky    we children sat telling stories     and boasting what we should be   when we were men like our fathers     and watched the blazing tree    that showered its fiery blossoms     like a rain of stars we said   of crimson and azure and purple     that night when i lay in bed    i could not sleep for seeing     whenever i closed my eyes   the tree in its dazzling splendor     against the darkened skies    i cannot sleep for seeing     with closéd eyes tonight   the tree in its dazzling splendor     dropping its blossoms bright    and old old dreams of childhood     come thronging my weary brain   dear foolish beliefs and longings     i doubt are they real again    it is nothing and nothing and nothing     that i either think or see   the phantoms of dead illusions     tonight are haunting me     in august     all the long august afternoon       the little drowsy stream   whispers a melancholy tune   as if it dreamed of june       and whispered in its dream    the thistles show beyond the brook       dust on their down and bloom   and out of many a weedgrown nook   the asterflowérs look       with eyes of tender gloom    the silent orchard aisles are sweet       with smell of ripening fruit   through the sere grass in shy retreat   flutter at coming feet       the robins strange and mute    there is no wind to stir the leaves       the harsh leaves overhead   only the querulous cricket grieves   and shrilling locust weaves       a song of summer dead     the empty house     the wet trees hang above the walks     purple with damps and earthish stains     and strewn by moody absent rains   with roseleaves from the wildgrown stalks    unmown in heavy tangled swaths     the ripe junegrass is wanton blown     snails slime the untrodden thresholdstone   along the sills hang drowsy moths    down the blank visage of the wall     where many a wavering trace appears     like a forgotten trace of tears   from swollen eaves the slow drops crawl    where everything was wide before     the curious wind that comes and goes     finds all the latticed windows close   secret and close the bolted door    and with the shrewd and curious wind     that in the archéd doorway cries     and at the bolted portal tries   and harks and listens at the blind    forever lurks my thought about     and in the ghostly middlenight     finds all the hidden windows bright   and sees the guests go in and out    and lingers till the pallid dawn     and feels the mystery deeper there     in silent gustswept chambers bare   with all the midnight revel gone    but wanders through the lonesome rooms     where harsh the astonished cricket calls     and from the hollows of the walls   vanishing start unshapen glooms    and lingers yet and cannot come     out of the drear and desolate place     so full of ruins solemn grace   and haunted with the ghost of home     bubbles     i    i stood on the brink in childhood     and watched the bubbles go   from the rockfretted sunny ripple     to the smoother tide below    and over the white creekbottom     under them every one   went golden stars in the water     all luminous with the sun    but the bubbles broke on the surface     and under the stars of gold   broke and the hurrying water     flowed onward swift and cold    ii    i stood on the brink in manhood     and it came to my weary brain   and my heart so dull and heavy     after the years of pain    that every hollowest bubble     which over my life had passed   still into its deeper current     some heavenly gleam had cast    that however i mocked it gayly     and guessed at its hollowness   still shone with each bursting bubble     one star in my soul the less     lost beliefs     one after one they left us     the sweet birds out of our breasts   went flying away in the morning     will they come again to their nests    will they come again at nightfall     with gods breath in their song   noon is fierce with the heats of summer     and summer days are long    o my life with thy upward liftings     thy downwardstriking roots   ripening out of thy tender blossoms     but hard and bitter fruits    in thy boughs there is no shelter     for the birds to seek again   the desolate nest is broken     and torn with storms and rain     louis lebeaus conversion       yesterday while i moved with the languid crowd on the riva   musing with idle eyes on the wide lagoons and the islands   and on the dimseen seaward glimmering sails in the distance   where the azure haze like a vision of indiansummer   haunted the dreamy sky of the soft venetian december   while i moved unwilled in the mellow warmth of the weather   breathing air that was full of old world sadness and beauty   into my thought came this story of free wild life in ohio   when the land was new and yet by the beautiful river   dwelt the pioneers and indian hunters and boatmen      pealed from the campanili responding from island to island   bells of that ancient faith whose incense and solemn devotions   rise from a hundred shrines in the broken heart of the city   but in my revery heard i only the passionate voices   of the people that sang in the virgin heart of the forest   autumn was in the land and the trees were golden and crimson   and from the luminous boughs of the overelms and the maples   tender and beautiful fell the light in the worshippers faces   softer than lights that stream through the saints on the windows of         churches   while the balsamy breath of the hemlocks and pines by the river   stole on the winds through the woodland aisles like the breath of a         censer   loud the people sang old campmeeting anthems that quaver   quaintly yet from lips forgetful of lips that have kissed them   loud they sang the songs of the sacrifice and atonement   and of the end of the world and the infinite terrors of judgment   songs of ineffable sorrow and wailing compassionate warning   unto the generations that hardened their hearts to their savior   songs of exultant rapture for them that confessed him and followed   bearing his burden and yoke enduring and entering with him   into the rest of his saints and the endless reward of the blessed   loud the people sang but through the sound of their singing   broke inarticulate cries and moans and sobs from the mourners   as the glory of god that smote the apostle of tarsus   smote them and strewed them to earth like leaves in the breath of         the whirlwind      hushed at last was the sound of the lamentation and singing   but from the distant hill the throbbing drum of the pheasant   shook with its heavy pulses the depths of the listening silence   when from his place arose a whitehaired exhorter and faltered   brethren and sisters in jesus the lord hath heard our petitions   so that the hearts of his servants are awed and melted within         them   even the hearts of the wicked are touched by his infinite mercy   all my days in this vale of tears the lord hath been with me   he hath been good to me he hath granted me trials and patience   but this hour hath crowned my knowledge of him and his goodness   truly but that it is well this day for me to be with you   now might i say to the lordi know thee my god in all fulness   now let thy servant depart in peace to the rest thou hast         promised      faltered and ceased and now the wild and jubilant music   of the singing burst from the solemn profound of the silence   surged in triumph and fell and ebbed again into silence      then from the group of the preachers arose the greatest among         them   he whose days were given in youth to the praise of the savior   he whose lips seemed touched like the prophets of old from the         altar   so that his words were flame and burned to the hearts of his         hearers   quickening the dead among them reviving the cold and the doubting   there he charged them pray and rest not from prayer while a sinner   in the sound of their voices denied the friend of the sinner   pray till the night shall falltill the stars are faint in the         morning   yea till the sun himself be faint in that glory and brightness   faint in the light which shall dawn in mercy for penitent sinners   kneeling he led them in prayer and the quick and sobbing         responses   spake how their souls were moved with the might and the grace of the         spirit   then while the converts recounted how god had chastened and saved         them   children whose golden locks yet shone with the lingering         effulgence   of the touches of him who blessed little children forever   old men whose yearning eyes were dimmed with the farstreaming         brightness   seen through the opening gates in the heart of the heavenly city   stealthily through the harking woods the lengthening shadows   chased the wild things to their nests and the twilight died into         darkness      now the four great pyres that were placed there to light the         encampment   high on platforms raised above the people were kindled   flaming aloof as it were the pillar by night in the desert   fell their crimson light on the lifted orbs of the preachers   fell on the withered brows of the old men and israels mothers   fell on the bloom of youth and the earnest devotion of manhood   fell on the anguish and hope in the tearful eyes of the mourners   flaming aloof it stirred the sleep of the luminous maples   with warm summerdreams and faint luxurious languor   near the four great pyres the people closed in a circle   in their midst the mourners and praying with them the exhorters   and on the skirts of the circle the unrepentant and scorners   ever fewer and sadder and drawn to the place of the mourners   one after one by the prayers and tears of the brethren and         sisters   and by the spirit of god that was mightily striving within them   till at the last alone stood louis lebeau unconverted      louis lebeau the boatman the trapper the hunter the fighter   from the unlucky french of gallipolis he descended   heir to old world want and new world love of adventure   vague was the life he led and vague and grotesque were the rumors   through which he loomed on the peoplethe hero of mythical         hearsay   quick of hand and of heart impatient generous western   taking the thought of the young in secret love and in envy   not less the elders shook their heads and held him for outcast   reprobate roving ungodly infidel worse than a papist   with his whispered fame of lawless exploits at st louis   wild affrays and loves with the halfbreeds out on the osage   brawls at new orleans and all the towns on the rivers   all the godless towns of the manyruffianed rivers   only she who loved him the best of all in her loving   knew him the best of all and other than that of the rumors   daily she prayed for him with conscious and tender effusion   that the lord would convert him but when her father forbade him   unto her thought she denied him and likewise held him for         outcast   turned her eyes when they met and would not speak though her heart         broke      bitter and brief his logic that reasoned from wrong unto error   this is their praying and singing he said that makes you reject         me   you that were kind to me once but i think my fathers religion   with a light heart in the breast and a friendly priest to absolve         one   better than all these conversions that only bewilder and vex me   and that have made men so hard and women fickle and cruel   well then pray for my soul since you would not have spoken to         save me   yes for i go from these saints to my brethren and sisters the         sinners   spoke and went while her faint lips fashioned unuttered entreaties   went and came again in a year at the time of the meeting   haggard and wan of face and wasted with passion and sorrow   dead in his eyes was the careless smile of old and its phantom   haunted his lips in a sneer of restless incredulous mocking   day by day he came to the outer skirts of the circle   dwelling on her where she knelt by the whitehaired exhorter her         father   with his hollow looks and never moved from his silence      now where he stood alone the last of impenitent sinners   weeping old friends and comrades came to him out of the circle   and with their tears besought him to hear what the lord had done for         them   ever he shook them off not roughly nor smiled at their transports   then the preachers spoke and painted the terrors of judgment   and of the bottomless pit and the flames of hell everlasting   still and dark he stood and neither listened nor heeded   but when the fervent voice of the whitehaired exhorter was lifted   fell his brows in a scowl of fierce and scornful rejection   lord let this soul be saved cried the fervent voice of the old         man   for that the shepherd rejoiceth more truly for one that hath         wandered   and hath been found again than for all the others that strayed         not      out of the midst of the people a woman old and decrepit   tremulous through the light and tremulous into the shadow   wavered toward him with slow uncertain paces of palsy   laid her quivering hand on his arm and brokenly prayed him   louis lebeau i closed in death the eyes of your mother   on my breast she died in prayer for her fatherless children   that they might know the lord and follow him always and serve         him   o i conjure you my son by the name of your mother in glory   scorn not the grace of the lord as when a summernoons tempest   breaks in one swift gush of rain then ceases and gathers   darker and gloomier yet on the lowering front of the heavens   so broke his mood in tears as he soothed her and stilled her         entreaties   and so he turned again with his clouded looks to the people      vibrated then from the hush the accents of mournfullest pity   his who was gifted in speech and the glow of the fires illumined   all his pallid aspect with sudden and marvellous splendor   louis lebeau he spake i have known you and loved you from         childhood   still when the others blamed you i took your part for i knew         you   louis lebeau my brother i thought to meet you in heaven   hand in hand with her who is gone to heaven before us   brothers through her dear love i trusted to greet you and lead you   up from the brink of the river unto the gates of the city   lo my years shall be few on the earth o my brother   if i should die before you had known the mercy of jesus   yea i think it would sadden the hope of glory within me      neither yet had the will of the sinner yielded an answer   but from his lips there broke a cry of unspeakable anguish   wild and fierce and shrill as if some demon within him   bent his soul with the ultimate pangs of fiendish possession   and with the outstretched arms of bewildered imploring toward them   deathwhite unto the people he turned his face from the darkness      out of the sedge by the creek a flight of clamorous killdees   rose from their timorous sleep with piercing and iterant challenge   wheeled in the starlight and fled away into distance and silence   white in the vale lay the tents and beyond them glided the river   where the broadhorn1 drifted slow at the will of the current   and where the boatman listened and knew not how as he listened   something touched through the years the old lost hopes of his         childhood   only his sense was filled with low monotonous murmurs   as of a faintheard prayer that was chorused with deeper         responses      not with the rest was lifted her voice in the fervent responses   but in her soul she prayed to him that heareth in secret   asking for light and for strength to learn his will and to do it   o make me clear to know if the hope that rises within me   be not part of a love unmeet for me here and forbidden   so if it be not that make me strong for the evil entreaty   of the days that shall bring me question of self and reproaches   when the unrighteous shall mock and my brethren and sisters shall         doubt me   make me worthy to know thy will my savior and do it   in her pain she prayed and at last through her mute adoration   rapt from all mortal presence and in her rapture uplifted   glorified she rose and stood in the midst of the people   looking on all with the still unseeing eyes of devotion   vague and tender and sweet as the eyes of the dead when we dream         them   living and looking on us but they cannot speak and we cannot   knowing only the peril that threatened his souls unrepentance   knowing only the fear and error and wrong that withheld him   thinking in doubt of me his soul had perished forever   touched with no feeble shame but trusting her power to save him   through the circle she passed and straight to the side of her         lover   took his hand in her own and mutely implored him an instant   answering giving forgiving confessing beseeching him all         things   drew him then with her and passed once more through the circle   unto her place and knelt with him there by the side of her father   trembling as women tremble who greatly venture and triumph   but in her innocent breast was the saints sublime exultation      so was louis converted and though the lips of the scorners   spared not in after years the subtle taunt and derision   what time meeker grown his heart held his hand from its answer   not the less lofty and pure her love and her faith that had saved         him   not the less now discerned was her inspiration from heaven   by the people that rose and embracing and weeping together   poured forth their jubilant songs of victory and of thanksgiving   till from the embers leaped the dying flame to behold them   and the hills of the river were filled with reverberant echoes   echoes that out of the years and the distance stole to me hither   while i moved unwilled in the mellow warmth of the weather   echoes that mingled and fainted and fell with the fluttering         murmurs

   all through with such delicious pain     of soul and sense to breathe again   the sweet that haunted memory still    and under these december skies     as bland as mays in other climes     i move

the pictures stare     into each others sleepless eyes     and the daylight into the darkness dies   from year to year in the palace there     but they watch and guard that no device   take either one of them unaware    their majesties the king and the queen     the parents of the reigning prince     both put off royalty many years since   with life and the gifts that have always been     given to kings from god to evince   his sense of the mighty over the mean    i cannot say that i like the face     of the king it is something fat and red     and the neck that lifts the royal head   is thick and coarse and a scanty grace     dwells in the dull blue eyes that are laid   sullenly on the queen in her place    he must have been a king in his day     twere well to pleasure in work and sport     one of the heavenanointed sort   who ruled his people with iron sway     and knew that through good and evil report   god meant him to rule and them to obey    there are many other likenesses     of the king in his royal palace there     you find him depicted everywhere   in his robes of state in his huntingdress     in his flowing wig in his powdered hair   a king in all of them none the less    but most himself in this on the wall     over against his consort whose     laces and hoops and highheeled shoes   make her the finest lady of all     the queens or courtly dames you choose   in the ancestral portrait hall    a glorious blonde a luxury     of luring blue and wanton gold     of blanchéd rose and crimson bold   of lines that flow voluptuously     in tender languorous curves to fold   her form in perfect symmetry    she might have been false of her withered dust     there scarcely would be enough to write     her guilt in now and the dead have a right   to our lenient doubt if not to our trust     so if the truth cannot make her white   let us be as merciful as wemust    ii    the queen died first the queen died young     but the king was very old when he died     rotten with license and lust and pride   and the usual virtues came and hung     their cypress wreaths on his tomb and wide   throughout his kingdom his praise was sung    how the queen died is not certainly known     and faithful subjects are all forbid     to speak of the murder which some one did   one night while she slept in the dark alone     history keeps the story hid   and fear only tells it in undertone    up from your startled feet aloof     in the famous echoroom with a bound     leaps the echo and round and round   beating itself against the roof     a horrible gasping shuddering sound   dies ere its terror can utter proof    of that it knows a door is fast     and none is suffered to enter there     his sacred majesty could not bear   to look at it toward the last     as he grew very old it opened where   the queen died young so many years past    iii    how the queen died is not certainly known     but in the palaces solitude     a harking dread and horror brood   and a silence as if a mortal groan     had been hushed the moment before and would   break forth again when you were gone    the present king has never dwelt     in the desolate palace from year to year     in the wide and stately garden drear   the snows and the snowy blossoms melt     unheeded and a ghastly fear   through all the shivering leaves is felt    by night the gathering shadows creep     along the dusk and hollow halls     and the slumberbroken palace calls   with stifled moans from its nightmare sleep     and then the ghostly moonlight falls   athwart the darkness brown and deep    at early dawn the light wind sighs     and through the desert garden blows     the wasted sweetness of the rose   at noon the feverish sunshine lies     sick in the walks but at evenings close   when the last long rays to the windows rise    and with many a bloodred wrathful streak     pierce through the twilight glooms that blur     his cruel vigilance and her   regard they light fierce looks that wreak     a hopeless hate that cannot stir   a voiceless hate that cannot speak    in the awful calm of the sleepless eyes     and as if she saw her murderer glare     on her face and he the white despair   of his victim kindle in wild surmise     confronted the conscious pictures stare   and their secret back into darkness dies     the faithful of the gonzaga2     i    federigo the son of the marquis

stormy night at their convent     and passed with the storm at day    the long parley of a peasant     that sold them wine and food   the gossip of a shepherd     that guided them through a wood    a boatmans talk at the ferry     of a river where they crossed   and as if they had sunk in the current     all trace of them was lost    and so is an end of tidings     but never an end of tears   of

reaping sowing     bearing burdens and far and nigh   begging for him on the highway     of the strangers that pass by    and they look whenever you meet them     like brokenhearted men   and i heard that the sick man would not     if he could be well again    for they say that he for loves sake     was gladly banishèd   but she for whom he was banished     is worse to him now than dead    a recreant to his sorrow     a traitress to his woe   from her place the marchioness rises     the minstrel turns to go    but fast by the hand she takes him     his hand in her clasp is cold   if gold

asks no gold for guerdon     but before he leaves the land    he craves of your love once proffered     that you suffer him for reward   in this crowning hour of his glory     to look on your son my

for a brother that is my son   the comrades turned to the bridegroom     in silence every one    but the bridegroom looked on the minstrel     with a visage blank and changed   as his whom the sight of a spectre     from his reason hath estranged    and the smiling courtiers near them     on a sudden were still as death   and subtlystricken the people     hearkened and held their breath    with an awe uncomprehended     for an unseen agony   who is this that lies adying     with her head on the princes knee    a light of anguish and wonder     is in the princes eye   o speak sweet saint and

author of this ballad has added a thread of evident lovestory       to a most romantic incident of the history of mantua which       occurred in the fifteenth century he relates the incident so       nearly as he found it in the cronache montovane that he is       ashamed to say how little his invention has been employed in it       the hero of the story federigo became the third marquis of       mantua and was a prince greatly beloved and honored by his       subjects    3 breve pertugio dentro dalla muda         la qual per me ha il titol della fame         e in che conviene ancor chaltri si

paid three times the price for my pleasure    brown hands splashed with mulberry blood     the basket wreathed with mulberry leaves   hiding the berries beneath themgood     let us take whatever the young rogue gives    for you know old friend i havent eaten     a mulberry since the ignorant joy   of anything sweet in the mouth could sweeten     all this bitter world for a boy    ii    o i mind the tree in the meadow stood     by the road near the hill when i clomb aloof   on its branches this side of the girdled wood     i could see the top of our cabin roof    and looking westward could sweep the shores     of the river where we used to swim   under the ghostly sycamores     haunting the waters smooth and dim    and eastward athwart the pasturelot     and over the milkwhite buckwheat field   i could see the stately elm where i shot     the first black squirrel i ever killed    and southward over the bottomland     i could see the mellow breadths of farm   from the rivershores to the hills expand     clasped in the curving rivers arm    in the fields we set our guileless snares     for rabbits and pigeons and wary quails   content with the vaguest feathers and hairs     from doubtful wings and vanished tails    and in the blue summer afternoon     we used to sit in the mulberrytree   the breaths of wind that remembered june     shook the leaves and glittering berries free    and while we watched the wagons go     across the river along the road   to the mill above or the mill below     with horses that stooped to the heavy load    we told old stories and made new plans     and felt our hearts gladden within us again   for we did not dream that this life of a mans     could ever be what we know as men    we sat so still that the woodpeckers came     and pillaged the berries overhead   from his log the chipmonk waxen tame     peered and listened to what we said    iii    one of us long ago was carried     to his grave on the hill above the tree   one is a farmer there and married     one has wandered over the sea    and if you ask me i hardly know     whether id be the dead or the clown   the clod above or the clay below     or this listless dust by fortune blown    to alien lands for however it is     so little we keep with us in life   at best we win only victories     not peace not peace o friend in this strife    but if i could turn from the long defeat     of the little successes once more and be   a boy with the whole wide world at my feet     under the shade of the mulberrytree    from the shame of the squandered chances the sleep     of the will that cannot itself awaken   from the promise the future can never keep     from the fitful purposes vague and shaken    then while the grasshopper sang out shrill     in the grass beneath the blanching thistle   and the afternoon air with a tender thrill     harked to the quails complaining whistle    ah me should i paint the morrows again     in quite the colors so faint today   and with

   but when at last upon their way returning     taciturn late and loath   through the broad meadow in the sunset burning     they reached the gate one fine spell hindered them both    her heart was troubled with a subtile anguish     such as but women know   that wait and lest love speak or speak not languish     and what they would would rather they would not so    till he saidmanlike nothing

mourned by disconsolate crickets and iterant grasshoppers crying   all the still nights long from the ripened abundance of gardens   then ere the boughs of the maples are mantled with earliest         autumn   but the wind of autumn breathes from the orchards at nightfall   full of winy perfume and mystical yearning and languor   and in the noonday woods you hear the foraging squirrels   and the long crashing fall of the halfeaten nut from the         treetop   when the robins are mute and the yellowbirds haunting the         thistles   cheep and twitter and flit through the dusty lanes and the         loppings   when the pheasant booms from your stealthy foot in the cornfield   and the wildpigeons feed few and shy in the scokeberry bushes   when the weary land lies hushed like a seer in a vision   and your life seems but the dream of a dream which you cannot         remember   broken bewildering vague an echo that answers to nothing   that time of year you know they stood by the gate in the meadow   fronting the sinking sun and the level stream of its splendor   crimsoned the meadowslope and woodland with tenderest sunset   made her beautiful face like the luminous face of an angel   smote through the painéd gloom of his heart like a hurt to the         sense there   languidly clung about by the halffallen shawl and with folded   hands that held a few sad asters i sigh for this idyl   lived at last to an end and looking on to my proselife   with a smile she said and a subtle derision of manner   better and better i seem when i recollect all that has happened   since i came here in june the walks we have taken together   through these darling meadows and dear old desolate woodlands   all our afternoon readings and all our strolls through the moonlit   villageso sweetly asleep one scarcely could credit the scandal   heartache and trouble and spite that were hushed for the night         in its silence   yes i am better i think i could even be civil to him for his         kindness   letting me come here without him but open the gate cousin         clement   seems to me it grows chill and i think it is healthier indoors   no then i you need not speak for i

lonesome odorous twilight    ii      high on the farmhouse hearth the first autumn fire was kindled   scintillant hickory bark and dryest limbs of the beechtree   burned where all summer long the boughs of asparagus flourished   wild were the children with mirth and grouping and clinging         together   danced with the dancing flame and lithely swayed with its humor   ran to the windowpanes and peering forth into the darkness   saw there another room flamelit and with frolicking children   ah by such phantom hearths i think that we sit with our         firstloves   sometimes they tossed on the floor and sometimes they hid in the         corners   shouting and laughing aloud and never resting a moment   in the rude delight the boisterous gladness of childhood   cruel as summer sun and singingbirds to the heartsick     clement sat in his chair unmoved in the midst of the hubbub   rapt with unseeing eyes and unafraid in their gambols   by his tawny beard the children caught him and clambered   over his knees and waged a mimic warfare across them   made him their battleground and won and lost kingdoms upon him   airily to and fro and out of one room to another   passed his cousin and busied herself with things of the household   nonchalant debonair blithe with bewitching housewifely         importance   laying the cloth for the supper and bringing the meal from the         kitchen   fairer than ever she seemed and more than ever she mocked him   coming behind his chair and clasping her fingers together   over his eyes in a girlish caprice and crying who is it   vexed his despair with a vision of wife and of home and of         children   calling his sisters children around her and stilling their         clamor   making believe they were hers and clement sat moody and silent   blank to the wistful gaze of his mother bent on his visage   with the tender pain the pitiful helpless devotion   of the mother that looks on the face of her son in his trouble   grown beyond her consoling and knows that she cannot befriend him   then his cousin laughed and in idleness talked with the children   sometimes she turned to him and then when the thistle was falling   caught it and twined it again in her hair and called it her         keepsake   smiled and made him ashamed of his petulant gift there before         them     but when the night was grown old and the two by the hearthstone         together   sat alone in the flickering red of the flame and the cricket   carked to the stillness and ever with sullen throbs of the         pendule   sighed the timeworn clock for the death of the days that were         perished   it was her whim to be sad and she brought him the book they were         reading   read it tonight she said that i may not seem to be going   said and mutely reproached him with all the pain she had wrought         him   from her hand he took the volume and read and she listened   all his voice molten in secret tears and ebbing and flowing   now with a faltering breath and now with impassioned abandon   read from the book of a poet the rhyme of the fatally sundered   fatally met too late and their love was their guilt and their         anguish   but in the night they rose and fled away into the darkness   glad of all dangers and shames and even of death for their loves         sake     then when his voice brake hollowly falling and fading to         silence   thrilled in the silence they sat and durst not behold one another   feeling that wild temptation that tender ineffable yearning   drawing them heart to heart one blind mad moment of passion   with their fate they strove but out of the pang of the conflict   through such costly triumph as wins a waste and a famine   victors they came and love retrieved the error of loving     so foreknowing the years and sharply discerning the future   guessing the riddle of life and accepting the cruel solution   side by side they sat as far as the stars are asunder   carked the cricket no more but while the audible silence   shrilled in their ears she suddenly rising and dragging the         thistle   out of her clinging hair laughed mockingly casting it from her   perish the thorns and splendorthe bloom and the sweetness are         perished   dreary respectable calm polite despair and ones duty   these and the world for dead lovethe end

faltering reason know him dead    and i would that my heart might feel it too   and unto its own regret be true    for this is the hardest of all to bear   that his life was so generous and fair    so full of love so full of hope   broadening out with ample scope    and so far from death that his dying seems   the idle agony of dreams    to my heart that feels him living yet   and i forget and i

many a murmuring honeybee    on the strawberry blossoms in the grass   stoops by his grave and will not pass    and in the little hollow beneath   the slope of the silent field of death    the cowbells tinkle soft and sweet   and the cattle go by with homeward feet    and the squirrel barks from the sheltering limb   at the harmless noises not meant for him    and nature unto her loving

delight    o blossoms that hang like winter     drifted upon the trees   o birds that sing in the blossoms     o blossomhaunting bees    o green green leaves on the branches     o shadowy dark below   o cool of the aisles of orchards     woods that the wild flowers know    o air of gold and perfume     wind breathing sweet and sun   o sky of perfect azure     day heaven and earth in one    let me draw near thy secret     and in thy deep heart see   how fared in doubt and dreaming     the spring that is come in me    for my soul is held in silence     a rapture great and dumb   for the mystery that lingered     the glory that is come  1861     in earliest spring     tossing his mane of snows in wildest eddies and tangles     lionlike march cometh in hoarse with tempestuous breath   through all the moaning chimneys and thwart all the hollows and         angles     round the shuddering house threating of winter and death    but in my heart i feel the life of the wood and the meadow     thrilling the pulses that own kindred with fibres that lift   bud and blade to the sunward within the inscrutable shadow     deep in the oaks chill core under the gathering drift    nay to earths life in mine some prescience or dream or desire     how shall i name it aright comes for a moment and goes   rapture of life ineffable perfectas if in the brier     leafless there by my door trembled a sense of the rose     the bobolinks are singing     out of its fragrant heart of bloom     the bobolinks are singing   out of its fragrant heart of bloom   the appletree whispers to the room   why art thou but a nest of gloom     while the bobolinks are singing    the two wan ghosts of the chamber there     the bobolinks are singing   the two wan ghosts of the chamber there   cease in the breath of the honeyed air   sweep from the room and leave it bare     while the bobolinks are singing    then with a breath so chill and slow     the bobolinks are singing   then with a breath so chill and slow   it freezes the blossoms into snow   the haunted room makes answer low     while the bobolinks are singing    i know that in the meadowland     the bobolinks are singing   i know that in the meadowland   the sorrowful slender elmtrees stand   and the brook goes by on the other hand     while the bobolinks are singing    but ever i see in the brawling stream     the bobolinks are singing   but ever i see in the brawling stream   a maiden drowned and floating dim   under the water like a dream     while the bobolinks are singing    buried she lies in the meadowland     the bobolinks are singing   buried she lies in the meadowland   under the sorrowful elms where they stand   wind blow over her soft and bland     while the bobolinks are singing    o blow but stir not the ghastly thing     the bobolinks are singing   o blow but stir not the ghastly thing   the farmer saw so heavily swing   from the elm one merry morn of spring     while the bobolinks were singing    o blow and blow away the bloom     the bobolinks are singing   o blow and blow away the bloom   that sickens me in my heart of gloom   that sweetly sickens the haunted room     while the bobolinks are singing     prelude  to an early book of verse     in march the earliest bluebird came     and caroled from the orchardtree     his little tremulous songs to me   and called upon the summers name    and made old summers in my heart     all sweet with flower and sun again     so that i said o not in vain   shall be thy lay of little art    though never summer sun may glow     nor summer flower for thee may bloom     though winter turn in sudden gloom   and drowse the stirring spring with snow    and learned to trust if i should call     upon the sacred name of song     though chill through march i languish long   and never feel the may at all    yet may i touch in some who hear     the hearts wherein old songs asleep     wait but the feeblest touch to leap   in music sweet as summer air    i sing in march brief bluebird lays     and hope a may and do not know     may be the heaven is full of snow   may be there open summer days     the movers  sketch     parting was over at last and all the goodbys had been spoken   up the long hillside road the whitetented wagon moved slowly   bearing the mother and children while onward before them the         father   trudged with his gun on his arm and the faithful housedog beside         him   grave and sedate as if knowing the sorrowful thoughts of his         master      april was in her prime and the day in its dewy awaking   like a great flower afar on the crest of the eastern woodland   goldenly bloomed the sun and over the beautiful valley   dim with its dew and shadow and bright with its dream of a river   looked to the western hills and shone on the humble procession   paining with splendor the childrens eyes and the heart of the         mother      beauty and fragrance and song filled the air like a palpable         presence   sweet was the smell of the dewy leaves and the flowers in the         wildwood   fair the long reaches of sun and shade in the aisles of the forest   glad of the spring and of love and of morning the wild birds were         singing   jays to each other called harshly then mellowly fluted together   sang the oriole songs as golden and gay as his plumage   pensively piped the querulous quails their greetings unfrequent   while on the meadow elm the meadow lark gushed forth in music   rapt exultant and shaken with the great joy of his singing   over the river loudchattering aloft in the air the kingfisher   hung ere he dropped like a bolt in the water beneath him   gossiping out of the bank flew myriad twittering swallows   and in the boughs of the sycamores quarrelled and clamored the         blackbirds      never for these things a moment halted the movers but onward   up the long hillside road the whitetented wagon moved slowly   till on the summit that overlooked all the beautiful valley   trembling and spent the horses came to a standstill unbidden   then from the wagon the mother in silence got down with her         children   came and stood by the father and rested her hand on his shoulder      long together they gazed on the beautiful valley before them   looked on the wellknown fields that stretched away to the         woodlands   where in the dark lines of green showed the milkwhite crest of         the dogwood   snow of wildplums in bloom and crimson tints of the redbud   looked on the pasturefields where the cattle were lazily         grazing   soft and sweet and thin came the faint far notes of the         cowbells   looked on the ofttrodden lanes with their elder and blackberry         borders   looked on the orchard a bloomy sea with its billows of blossoms   fair was the scene yet suddenly strange and all unfamiliar   as are the faces of friends when the word of farewell has been         spoken   long together they gazed then at last on the little logcabin   home for so many years now home no longer forever   rested their tearless eyes in the silent rapture of anguish   up on the morning air no column of smoke from the chimney   wavering silver and azure rose fading and brightening ever   shut was the door where yesterday morning the children were         playing   lit with a gleam of the sun the window stared up at them blindly   cold was the hearthstone now and the place was forsaken and empty   empty ah no but haunted by thronging and tenderest fancies   sad recollections of all that had been of sorrow or gladness      still they sat there in the glow of the wide red fire in the         winter   still they sat there by the door in the cool of the still summer         evening   still the mother seemed to be singing her babe there to slumber   still the father beheld her weep oer the child that was dying   still the place was haunted by all the pasts sorrow and gladness      neither of them might speak for the thoughts that came crowding         their hearts so   till in their ignorant trouble aloud the children lamented   then was the spell of silence dissolved and the father and mother   burst into tears and embraced and turned their dim eyes to the         westward  ohio 1859     through the meadow     the summer sun was soft and bland   as they went through the meadow land    the

cries   heard and could not believe and the morning mocked their eyes   showing where wildest and fiercest the waters leaped up and ran   raving round him and past the visage of a man   clinging or seeming to cling to the trunk of a tree that caught   fast in the rocks below scarce out of the surges raught   was it a life could it be to yon slender hope that clung   shrill above all the tumult the answering terror rung    ii    under the weltering rapids a boat from the bridge is drowned   over the rocks the lines of another are tangled and wound   and the long fateful hours of the morning have wasted soon   as it had been in some blessed trance and now it is noon   hurry now with the raft but o build it strong and stanch   and to the lines and treacherous rocks look well as you launch   over the foamy tops of the waves and their foamsprent sides   over the hidden reefs and through the embattled tides   onward rushes the raft with many a lurch and leap   lord if it strike him loose from the hold he scarce can keep    no through all peril unharmed it reaches him harmless at last   and to its proven strength he lashes his weakness fast   now for the shore but steady steady my men and slow   taut now the quivering lines now slack and so let her go   thronging the shores around stand the pitying multitude   wan as his own are their looks and a nightmare seems to brood   heavy upon them and heavy the silence hangs on all   save for the rapids plunge and the thunder of the fall   but on a sudden thrills from the people still and pale   chorussing his unheard despair a desperate wail   caught on a lurking point of rock it sways and swings   sport of the pitiless waters the raft to which he clings    iii    all the long afternoon it idly swings and sways   and on the shore the crowd lifts up its hands and prays   lifts to heaven and wrings the hands so helpless to save   prays for the mercy of god on him whom the rock and the wave   battle for fettered betwixt them and who amidst their strife   struggles to help his helpers and fights so hard for his life   tugging at rope and at reef while men weep and women swoon   priceless second by second so wastes the afternoon   and it is sunset now and another boat and the last   down to him from the bridge through the rapids has safely passed    iv    wild through the crowd comes flying a man that nothing can stay   maddening against the gate that is locked athwart his way   no we keep the bridge for them that can help him you   tell us who are you his brother god help you both pass         through   wild with wide arms of imploring he calls aloud to him   unto the face of his brother scarce seen in the distance dim   but in the roar of the rapids his fluttering words are lost   as in a wind of autumn the leaves of autumn are tossed   and from the bridge he sees his brother sever the rope   holding him to the raft and rise secure in his hope   sees all as in a dream the terrible pageantry   populous shores the woods the sky the birds flying free   sees then the formthat spent with effort and fasting and         fear   flings itself feebly and fails of the boat that is lying so near

wildweed flower that simply blows   and is there any moral shut     within the bosom of the rose    tennyson    i    she lies upon the soft enamoured grass     i the wooing shelter of an appletree   and at her feet the trancéd brook is glass     and in the blossoms over her the bee     hangs charméd of his sordid industry   for love of her the light wind will not pass    ii    her golden hair blown over her red lips     that seem two roseleaves softly breathed apart   athwart her rounded throat like sunshine slips     her small hand resting on her beating heart     the crook that tells her

her dress     and of her redheeled shoes appears the sheen     and she hath ribbons of such blue or green   as best suits pastoral peoples comeliness    iv    she sleeps and it is in the month of may     and the whole land is full of the delight   of music and sweet scents and all the day     the sun is gold the moon is pearl all night     and like a paradise the world is bright   and like a young girls hopes the world is gay    v    so waned the hours and while her beauteous sleep     was blest with many a happy dream of love   untended still her silly vagrant sheep     afar from that young shepherdess did rove     along the vales and through the gossip grove   oer daisied meads and up the thymy steep    vi    then for it happens oft when harm is nigh     our dreams grow haggard till at last we wake   she thought that from the little runnel by     there crept upon a sudden forth a snake     and stung her hand and fled into the brake   whereat she sprang up with a bitter cry    vii    and wildly over all that place did look     and could not spy her ingrate wanton flock   not there among tall grasses by the brook     not there behind the mossybearded rock     and pitiless echo answered with a mock   when she did sorrow that she was forsook    viii    alas the scattered sheep might not be found     and long and loud that gentle maid did weep   till in her blurréd sight the hills went round     and circling far field wood and stream did sweep     and on the ground the miserable bopeep   fell and forgot her troubles in a swound    ix    when she awoke the sun long time had set     and all the land was sleeping in the moon   and all the flowers with dim sad dews were wet     as they had wept to see her in that swoon     it was about the nights lowbreathing noon   only the larger stars were waking yet    x    bopeep the fair and hapless shepherdess     rose from her swooning in a sore dismay   and tried to smooth her damp and rumpled dress     that showed in truth a grievous disarray     then where the brook the wan moons mirror lay   she laved her eyes and curled each golden tress    xi    and looking to her ribbons if they were     as ribbons of a shepherdess should be   she took the hat that she was wont to wear     bedecked it was with ribbons flying free     as ever man in opera might see   and set it on her curls of yellow hair    xii    and i will go and seek my sheep she said     through every distant land until i die   but when they bring me hither cold and dead     let me beneath these appleblossoms lie     with this dear faithful lovely runnel nigh   here where my crucrucruel sheep have fed    xiii    thus sorrow and despair make bold bopeep     and forth she springs and hurries on her way   across the lurking rivulet she can leap     no sombre forest shall her quest delay     no crooked vale her eager steps bewray   what dreadeth she that seeketh her lost sheep    xiv    by many a pond where timorous waterbirds     with clattering cries and throbbing wings arose   by many a pasture where the softeyed herds     looked shadowhuge in their unmoved repose     long through the lonesome night that sad one goes   and fills the solitude with wailing words    xv    so that the little fieldmouse dreams of harm     snuggled away from harm beneath the weeds   the violet sleeping on the clovers arm     wakes and is cold with thoughts of dreadful deeds     the pensive people of the waterreeds   hark with a mute and dolorous alarm    xvi    and the fond hearts of all the turtledoves     are broken in compassion of her woe   and every tender little bird that loves     feels in his breast a sympathetic throe     and flowers are sad wherever she may go   and hoarse with sighs the waterfalls and groves    xvii    the pale moon droppeth low star after star     grows faint and slumbers in the gray of dawn   and still she lingers not but hurries far     till in a dreary wilderness withdrawn     through tangled woods she lorn and lost moves on   where griffins dire and dreadful dragons are    xviii    her ribbons all are dripping with the dew     her redheeled shoes are torn and stained with mire   her tender arms the angry sharpness rue     of many a scraggy thorn and envious brier     and poor bopeep with no sweet pity nigh her   wrings her small hands and knows not what to do    xix    and on that crude and rugged ground she sinks     and soon her seeking had been ended there   but through the trees a fearful glimmer shrinks     and of a hermits dwelling she is ware     at the dull pane a dulleyed taper blinks   drowsed with long vigils and the morning air    xx    thither she trembling moves and at the door     falls down and cannot either speak or stir   the hermit comeswith no white beard before

looked so beautiful there mute and white     he kissed her on the lips and on the eyes   the most a prince could do in such a plight     but chiefly gazed on her in still surprise     and when he saw her lily eyelids rise   for him the whole world had no fairer sight    xxiii    rude is my fare a bit of venison steak     a dish of honey and a glass of wine   with clean white bread is the poor feast i make     be served i pray i think this flask is fine     he said hard is this hermit life of mine   this day i will its weariness forsake    xxiv    and then he told her how it chanced that he     king coles son in that forest held his court   and the sole reason that there seemed to be     was he was being hermit there for sport     but he confessed the life was not his forte   and therewith both laughed out right jollily    xxv    and sly bopeep forgot her sheep again     in gay discourse with that engaging youth   love hath such sovran remedies for pain     but then he was a handsome prince in truth     and both were young and both were silly sooth   and everything to love but love seems vain    xxvi    they took them down the silverclaspéd book     that this young anchorites predecessor kept   a holy seerand through it they did look     sometimes their idle eyes together crept     sometimes their lips but still the leaves they swept   until they found a shepherds pictured crook    xxvii    and underneath was writ it should befall     on such a day in such a month and year   a maiden fair a young prince brave and tall     by such a chance should come together here     they were the people that was very clear   o love the prince said let us read it all    xxviii    and thus the hermits prophecy ran on     though she her lost sheep wist not where to find   yet should she bid her weary care begone     and banish every doubt from her sweet mind     they with their little snowwhite tails behind   homeward would go if they were left alone    xxix    they closed the book and in her happy eyes     the prince read truth and love forevermore   better than any hermits prophecies     they passed together from the caverns door     embraced they turned to look at it once more   and over it beheld the glad sun rise    xxx    that streamed before them aisles of dusk and gold     under the songswept arches of the wood   and forth they went tranced in each others hold     down through that rare and luminous solitude     their happy hearts enchanted in the mood   of morning and of may and romance old    xxxi    sometimes the saucy leaves would kiss her cheeks     and he must kiss their wanton kiss away   to die beneath her feet the woodflower seeks     the quivering aspen feels a fine dismay     and many a scented blossom on the spray   in odorous sighs its passionate longing speaks    xxxii    and forth they went down to that stately stream     bowed over by the ghostly sycamores   awearily as if some heavy dream     held them in languor but whose opulent shores     with pearléd shells and dusts of precious ores   were tremulous brilliance in the morning beam    xxxiii    where waited them beside the lustrous sand     a silkwinged shallop sleeping on the flood   and smoothly wafted from the hither strand     across the calm broad stream they lightly rode     under them still the silver fishes stood   the eager lilies on the other land    xxxiv    beckonéd them but where the castle shone     with diamonded turrets and a wall   of goldembedded pearl and costly stone     their vision to its peerless splendor thrall     the maiden fair the young prince brave and tall   thither with light unlingering feet pressed on    xxxv    a gallant train to meet this loving pair     in silk and steel moves from the castle door   and up the broad and ringing castle stair     they go with gleeful minstrelsy before     and hail our prince and princess evermore   from all the happy throng is greeting there    xxxvi    and in the hall the princes sire king cole     sitting with crown and royal ermine on   his fiddlers three behind with pipe and bowl     rises and moves to lift his kneeling son     greeting his bride with kisses many a one   and tears and laughter from his jolly soul    xxxvii    then both his children to a window leads     that over daisied pastureland looks out   and shows bopeep where her lost flock wide feeds     and every frolic lambkin leaps about     she hears boyblue that lazy shepherd shout   slow pausing from his pipe of mellow reeds    xxxviii    and turning peers into her princes eyes     then caught and clasped against her princes heart   upon her breath her answer wordless dies     and leaves her gratitude to sweeter art     to lips from which the bloom shall never part   to looks wherein the summer never dies     while she sang    i    she sang and i heard the singing     far out of the wretched past   of meadowlarks in the meadow     in a breathing of the blast    cold through the clouds of sunset     the thin red sunlight shone   staining the gloom of the woodland     where i walked and dreamed alone    and glinting with chilly splendor     the meadow under the hill   where the lingering larks were lurking     in the sere grass hid and still    out they burst with their singing     their singing so loud and gay   they made in the heart of october     a sudden ghastly may    that faded and ceased with their singing     the thin red sunlight paled   and through the boughs above me     the wind of evening wailed    wailed and the light of evening     out of the heaven died   and from the marsh by the river     the lonesome killdee cried    ii    the song is done but a phantom     of music haunts the chords   that thrill with its subtile presence     and grieve for the dying words    and in the years that are perished     far back in the wretched past   i see on the maygreen meadows     the white snow falling fast    falling and falling and falling     as still and cold as death   on the bloom of the odorous orchard     on the small meek flowers beneath    on the roofs of the villagehouses     on the long silent street   where its plumes are soiled and broken     under the passing feet    on the green crest of the woodland     on the cornfields far apart   on the cowering birds in the gable     and on my desolate heart     a poet     from wells where truth in secret lay   he saw the midnight stars by day    o marvellous gift the many cried   o cruel gift his voice replied    the stars were far and cold and high   that glimmered in the noonday sky    he yearned toward the sun in vain   that warmed the lives of other men     convention     he falters on the threshold     she lingers on the stair   can it be that was his footstep     can it be that she is there    without is tender yearning     and tender love is within   they can hear each others heartbeats     but a wooden door is between     the poets friends     the robin sings in the elm     the cattle stand beneath   sedate and grave with great brown eyes     and fragrant meadowbreath    they listen to the flattered bird     the wiselooking stupid things   and they never understand a word     of all the robin sings     no love lost  a romance of travel    1862   berthawriting from venice    i    on your heart i feign myself fallenah heavier burden   darling of sorrow and pain than ever shall rest there i take you   into these friendless arms of mine that you cannot escape me   closer and closer i fold you and tell you all and you listen   just as you used at home and you let my sobs and my silence   speak when the words will not comeand you understand and forgive         me   ah no no but i write with the wretched bravado of distance   what you must read unmoved by the pity too far for entreaty    ii      well i could never have loved him but when he sought me and         asked me   when to the men that offered their lives the love of a woman   seemed so little to givei promised the love that he asked me   sent him to war with my kiss on his lips and thought him my hero   afterward came the doubt and out of long question selfknowledge   came that great defeat and the heart of the nation was withered   mine leaped high with the awful relief won of death but the         horror   then of the crime that was wrought in that guilty moment of         rapture   guilty as if my will had winged the bullet that struck him   clung to me day and night and dreaming i saw him forever   looking through battlesmoke with sorrowful eyes of upbraiding   or in the moonlight lying gray or dimly approaching   holding toward me his arms that still held nearer and nearer   folded about me at last  and i would i had died in the fever   better then than now and better than ever hereafter    iii      weary as some illusion of fever to me was the ocean   stormswept scourged with bitter rains and wandering always   onward from sky to sky with endless processions of surges   knowing not life nor death but since the light was the first day   only enduring unrest till the darkness possess it the last day   over its desolate depths we voyaged away from all living   all the world behind us waned into vaguest remoteness   names and faces and scenes recurred like that broken remembrance   of the anterior bodiless life of the spiritthe trouble   of a bewildered brain or the touch of the hand that created   and when the ocean ceased at last like a faded illusion   europe itself seemed only a vision of eld and of sadness   naught but the dark in my soul remained to me constant and real   growing and taking the thoughts bereft of happier uses   blotting all sense of lapse from the days that with swift iteration   were and were not they fable the bright days the fleetest   these that had nothing to give that had nothing to bring or to         promise   went as one day alone for me was no alternation   save from my dull despair to wild and reckless rebellion   when the regret for my sin was turned to ruthless selfpity   when i hated him whose love had made me its victim   through his faith and my falsehood yet claiming me then i was         smitten   with so great remorse such grief for him and compassion   that if he could have come back to me i had welcomed and loved         him   more than man ever was loved alas for me that another   holds his place in my heart evermore alas that i listened   when the words whose daring lured my spirit and lulled it   seemed to take my blame away with my will of resistance      do not make haste to condemn me my will was the will of a         woman   fain to be broken by love yet unto the last i endeavored   what i could to be faithful still to the past and my penance   and as we stood that night in the old roman garden together   by the fountain whose passionate tears but now had implored me   in his pleading voiceand he waited my answer i told him   all that had been before of delusion and guilt and conjured him   not to darken his fate with mine the costly endeavor   only was subtler betrayal o me from the pang of confession   sprang what strange delight as i tore from its lurking that         horror   brooded upon so longwith the hope that at last i might see it   through his eyes unblurred by the tears that disordered my vision   oh with what rapturous triumph i humbled my spirit before him   that he might lift me and soothe me and make that dreary         remembrance   all this confused present seem only some sickness of fancy   only a morbid folly no certain and actual trouble   if from that refuge i fled with words of too feeble denial   bade him hate me with sobs that entreated his tenderest pity   moved mute lips and left the meaningless farewell unuttered   she that never has loved alone can wholly condemn me    iv      how could he other than follow my heart had bidden him follow   nor had my lips forbidden and rome yet glimmered behind me   when my soul yearned towards his from the sudden forlornness of         absence   everywhere his face looked from vanishing glimpses of faces   everywhere his voice reached my senses in fugitive cadence   sick through the storied cities with wretched hopes and         upbraidings   of my own heart for its hopes i went from wonder to wonder   blind to them all or only beholding them wronged and related   through some trick of wayward thought to myself and my trouble   not surprise nor regret but a fierce precipitate gladness   sent the blood to my throbbing heart when i found him in venice   waiting for you he whispered you would so i answered him         nothing    v      father whose humor grows more silent and ever more absent   changed in all but love for me since the death of my mother   willing to see me contented at last and trusting us wholly   left us together alone in our world of love and of beauty   so by noon and by night we two have wandered in venice   where the beautiful lives in vivid and constant caprices   yet where the charm is so perfect that nothing fantastic surprises   more than in dreams and ones life with the life of the city is         blended   in a luxurious calm and the tumult without and beyond it   seems but the emptiest fable of vain aspiration and labor      yes from all that makes this venice sole among cities   peerless foreverthe still lagoons that sleep in the sunlight   lulled by their islandbells the nights mysterious waters   lit through their shadowy depths by stems of splendor that blossom   into the lamps that float like flamy lotuses over   narrow and secret canals that dimly gleaming and glooming   under palacewalls and numberless arches of bridges   list no sound but the dip of the gondoliers oar and his warning   cried from corner to corner the sad superb canalazzo   mirroring marvellous grandeur and beauty and dreaming of glory   out of the empty homes of her lords departed the footways   wandering sunless between the walls of the houses and stealing   glimpses through rusted cancelli of lurking greenness of gardens   wildgrown flowers and broken statues and mouldering frescos   thoroughfares filled with traffic and throngs ever ebbing and         flowing   to and from the heart of the city whose pride and devotion   lifting high the bells of st marks like prayers unto heaven   stretch a marble embrace of palaces toward the cathedral   orient gorgeous and flushed with color and light like the         morning   from the lingering waste that is not yet ruin in venice   and her phantasmal show through all of being and doing   came a strange joy to us untouched by regret for the idle   days without yesterdays that died into nights without morrows   here in our paradise of love we reigned newcreated   as in the youth of the world in the days before evil and         conscience   ah in our fair lost world was neither fearing nor doubting   neither the sickness of old remorse nor the gloom of foreboding   only the glad surrender of all individual being   unto him whom i loved and in whose tender possession   fatefree my soul reposed from its anguish            of these things i write you   as of anothers experience part of my own they no longer   seem to me now through the doom that darkens the past like the         future    vi      golden the sunset gleamed above the city behind us   out of a city of clouds as fairy and lovely as venice   while we looked at the fishingtails of purple and yellow   far on the rim of the sea whose light and musical surges   broke along the sands with a faint reiterant sadness   but when the sails had darkened into black wings through the         twilight   sweeping away into nightpast the broken tombs of the hebrews   homeward we sauntered slowly through dewsweet blossomy alleys   so drew near the boat by errant and careless approaches   entered and left with indolent pulses the lido behind us      all the sunset had paled and the campanili of venice   rose like the masts of a mighty fleet moored there in the water   lights flashed furtively to and fro through the deepening twilight   massed in one thick shade lay the gardens the numberless islands   lay like shadows upon the lagoons and on us as we loitered   by their enchanted coasts a spell of ineffable sweetness   fell and made us at one with them and silent and blissful   shadows we seemed that drifted on through a being of shadow   vague indistinct to ourselves unbounded by hope or remembrance   yet we knew the beautiful night as it grew from the evening   far beneath us and far above us the vault of the heavens   glittered and darkened and now the moon that had haunted the         daylight   thin and pallid dimmed the stars with her fulness of splendor   and over all the lagoons fell the silvery rain of the moonbeams   as in the song the young girls sang while their gondolas passed         us   sang in the joy of love or youths desire of loving      balmy night of the south o perfect night of the summer   night of the distant dark of the near and tender effulgence   how from my despair are thy peace and loveliness frightened   for while our boat lay there at the will of the light undulations   idle as if our mood imbued and controlled it yet ever   seeming to bear us on athwart those shining expanses   out to shining seas beyond pursuit or returning   there while we lingered and lingered and would not break from our         rapture   down the mirrored night another gondola drifted   nearer and slowly nearer our own and moonlighted faces   stared and that sweet trance grew a rigid and dreadful possession   which if no dream indeed yet mocked with such semblance of         dreaming   that as it happens in dreams when a dear face stooping to kiss         us   takes ere the lips have touched some malign and horrible aspect   his face faded away and the face of the deadof that other   flashed on mine and writhing through every change of emotion   wild amaze and scorn accusation and pitiless mocking   vanished into the swoon whose blackness encompassed and hid me    philipto bertha      i am not sure i own that if first i had seen my delusion   when i saw you last night i should be so ready to give you   now your promises back and hold myself nothing above you   that it is mine to offer a freedom you never could ask for   yet believe me indeed from no bitter heart i release you   you are as free of me now as though i had died in the battle   or as i never had lived nay if it is mine to forgive you   go without share of the blame that could hardly be all upon your         side      ghosts are not sensitive things yet after my death in the         papers   sometimes a harrowing doubt assailed this impalpable essence   had i done so well to plead my cause at that moment   when your consent must be yielded less to the lover than soldier   not so well i was answered by that ethereal conscience   ghosts have about them and not so nobly or wisely as might be   truly i loved you then as now i love you no longer      i was a prisoner then and this doubt in the languor of sickness   came and it clung to my convalescence and grew to the purpose   after my days of captivity ended to seek you and solve it   and if i haply had erred to undo the wrong and release you      well you have solved me the doubt i dare to trust that you wept         me   just a little at first when you heard of me dead in the battle   for we were plighted you know and even in this saintly humor   i would scarce like to believe that my loss had merely relieved         you   yet i say it was prudent and well not to wait for my coming   back from the dead if it may be i sometimes had cherished a fancy   that i had won some right to the palm with the pang of the         martyr   fondly intended perhaps some splendor of selfabnegation   doubtless all that was a folly which merciful chances have spared         me   no i am far from complaining that circumstance coolly has ordered   matters of tragic fate in such a commonplace fashion   how do i know indeed that the easiest isnt the best way      friendly adieux end this note and our little comedy with it    fannyto clara    i      yes i promised to write but how shall i write to you darling   venice we reached last monday wild for canals and for color   palaces prisons lagoons and gondolas bravoes and moonlight   all the mysterious dreadful beautiful things in existence   fred had joined us at naples insuffrably knowing and travelled   wise in the prices of things and great at tempestuous bargains   rich in the costly nothing our youthful travellers buy here   at a prodigious outlay of time and money and trouble   utter confusion of facts and talking the wildest of pictures   pyramids battlefields bills and examinations of luggage   passports policemen porters and how he got through his         tobacco   ignorant handsome fullbearded brown and goodnatured as ever   annie thinks him perfect and i well enough for a brother   also a friend of freds came with us from naples to venice   and altogether i think we are rather agreeable people   for weve been taking our pleasure at all times in perfect         goodhumor   which is an excellent thing that youll understand when youve         travelled   seen recreation deadbeat and cross and learnt what a burden   frescos for instance can be and in general what an affliction   life is apt to become among the antiques and old masters      venice weve thoroughly done and its perfectly true of the         pictures   titians and tintorettos and palmas and paul veroneses   neither are gondolas fictions but verities hearselike and         swanlike   quite as the heart could wish and one finds to ones infinite         comfort   venice just as unique as ones fondest visions have made it   palaces and mosquitoes rise from the water together   and in the citys streets the saltsea is ebbing and flowing   several inches or more      ah let me not wrong thee o venice   fairest forlornest and saddest of all the cities and dearest   dear for my heart has won here deep peace from cruel confusion   and in this lucent air whose night is but tenderer noonday   fear is forever dead and hope has put on the immortal   there and you need not laugh im coming to something directly   one thing ive bought you a chain of the famous fabric of venice   something peculiar and quaint and of such a delicate texture   that you must wear it embroidered upon a riband of velvet   if you would have the effect of its exquisite fineness and beauty   isnt it very frail i asked of the workman who made it   strong enough if you will to bind a lover signora   with an expensive smile twas bought near the bridge of rialto   shylock you know in our shopping aunt may and fred do the         talking   fred begins always in french with the most delicious effrontry   only to end in profoundest humiliation and english   aunt however scorns to speak any tongue but italian   quanto per these ones here and what did you say was the         prezzo   ah troppo caro too much no no dont i tell you its         troppo   all the while insists that the gondolieri shall show us   what she calls titians palazzo and pines for the house of         othello   annie the dear little goose believes in fred and her mother   with an enchanting abandon she doesnt at all understand them   but she has some twilight views of their cleverness father is         quiet   now and then ventures some french when he fancies that nobody hears         him   in an aside to the valetdeplacei never detect him   buys things for mother and me with a quite supernatural sweetness   tolerates all freds airs and is indispensably pleasant    ii      prattling on of these things which i think cannot interest         deeply   so i hold back in my heart its dear and wonderful secret   which i must tell you at last however i falter to tell you   fain to keep it all my own for a little while longer   doubting but it shall lose some part of its strangeness and         sweetness   shared with another and fearful that even you may not find it   just the marvel that i doand thus turn our friendship to hatred      sometimes it seems to me that this love which i feel is eternal   must have begun with my life and that only an absence was ended   when we met and knew in our souls that we loved one another   for from the first was no doubt the earliest hints of the passion   whispered to girlhoods tremulous dream may be mixed with         misgiving   but when the very love comes it bears no vagueness of meaning   touched by its truth too fine to be felt by the ignorant senses   knowing but looks and utterance soul unto soul makes confession   silence to silence speaks and i think that this subtile assurance   yet unconfirmed from without is even sweeter and dearer   than the perfected bliss that comes when the words have been         spoken   not that id have them unsaid now but t was delicious to         ponder   all the miracle over and clasp it and keep it and hide it   while i beheld him you know with looks of indifferent languor   talking of other things and felt the divine contradiction   trouble my heart below            and yet if no doubt touched our passion   do not believe for that our love has been wholly unclouded   all best things are ours when pain and patience have won them   peace itself would mean nothing but for the strife that preceded   triumph of love is greatest when peril of love has been sorest   thats to say i dare say im only repeating what he said   well then of all wretched things in the world a mystery clara   lurked in this life dear to mine and hopelessly held us asunder   when we drew nearest together and all but his speech said i love         you   fred had known him at college and then had found him at naples   after several yearsand called him a capital fellow   thus far his knowledge went and beyond this began to run shallow   over troubled ways and to break into brilliant conjecture   harder by far to endure than the others reticent absence   absence wherein at times he seemed to walk like one troubled   by an uneasy dream whose spell is not broken with waking   but it returns all day with a vivid and sudden recurrence   like a remembered event of the past that was closest the present   this we knew from himself he went at the earliest summons   when the rebellion began and falling terribly wounded   into the enemys hands after ages of sickness and prison   made his escape at last and returning found all his virtues   grown out of recognition and shining in posthumous splendor   found all changed and estranged and he fancied more wonder than         welcome   so somewhat heavy of heart and disabled for war he had wandered   hither to europe for perfecter peace abruptly his silence   full of suggestion and sadness made here a chasm between us   but we spanned the chasm with conversational bridges   else talked all around it and feigned an ignorance of it   with that absurd pretence which is always so painful or comic   just as you happen to make it or see it                  in spite of our fictions   severed from his by that silence my heart grew ever more anxious   till last night when together we sat in piazza san marco   then when the morrow must bring us partingforever it might         be   taking our ices al fresco some strolling minstrels were singing   airs from the trovatore i noted with painful observance   with the unwilling minuteness at such times absolute torture   all that brilliant scene for which i cared nothing before me   darkeyed venetian leoni regarding the forestieri   with those compassionate looks of gentle and curious wonder   homekeeping italys nations bend on the voyaging races   taciturn indolent sad as their beautiful city itself is   groups of remotest englishnot just the traditional english   lavish milor is no more and your travelling briton is frugal   english though after all with the channel always between them   islanded in themselves and the continents sociable races   countrypeople of oursthe new worlds confident children   proud of america always and even vain of the troubles   as of disaster laid out on a scale unequalled in europe   polyglot russians that spoke all languages better than natives   whitecoated austrian officers anglicized austrian dandies   gorgeous levantine figures of greek and turk and albanian   these and the throngs that moved through the long arcades and         piazza   shone on by numberless lamps that flamed round the perfect piazza   jewellike set in the splendid frame of this beautiful picture   full of such motley life and so altogether venetian      then we rose and walked where the lamps were blanched by the         moonlight   flooding the piazzetta with splendor and throwing in shadow   all the façade of saint marks with its pillars and horses and         arches   but the sculptured frondage that blossoms over the arches   into the forms of saints was touched with tenderest lucence   and the angel that stands on the crest of the vast campanile   bathed his golden vans in the liquid light of the moonbeams   black rose the granite pillars that lift the saint and the lion   black sank the island campanili from distance to distance   over the charmèd scene there brooded a presence of music   subtler than sound and felt unheard in the depth of the spirit      how can i gather and show you the airy threads of enchantment   woven that night round my life and forever wrought into my being   as in our boat we glided away from the glittering city   dull at heart i felt and i looked at the lights in the water   blurring their brilliance with tears while the tresses of eddying         seaweed   whirled in the ebbing tide like the tresses of seamaidens         drifting   seaward from palacehaunts in the moonshine glistened and         darkened      sad and vague were my thoughts and full of fear was the silence   and when he turned to speak at last i trembled to hear him   feeling he now must speak of his love and his life and its         secret   now that the narrowing chances had left but that cruel conclusion   else the lifelong ache of a love and a trouble unuttered   better my feebleness pleaded the dreariest doubt that had vexed         me   than my life left nothing not even a doubt to console it   but while i trembled and listened his broken words crumbled to         silence   and as though some touch of fate had thrilled him with warning   suddenly from me he turned our gondola slipped from the shadow   under a ship lying near and glided into the moonlight   where in its brightest lustre another gondola rested   i saw two lovers there and he in the face of the woman   saw what has made him mine my own belovèd forever   minebut through what tribulation and awful confusion of         spirit   tears that i think of with smiles and sighs i remember with         laughter   agonies full of absurdity keen ridiculous anguish   ending in depths of blissful shame and heavenly transports    iii      white and estranged as a man who has looked on a spectre he         mutely   sank to the place at my side nor while we returned to the city   uttered a word of explaining or comment or comfort but only   with his goodnight incoherently craved my forgiveness and         patience   parted and left me to spend the night in hysterical vigils   tending to annies supreme dismay and postponing our journey   one day longer at least for i went to bed in the morning   firmly rejecting the pity of friends and the pleasures of travel   fixed in a dreadful purpose never to get any better      later however i rallied when fred with a maddening prologue   touching the cause of my sickness including his fever at jaffa   told me that some one was waiting and could he see me a moment   see me certainly not oryes but why did he want to   so in the dishabille of a morninggown and an armchair   languid with eloquent wanness of eye and of cheek i received         him   willing to touch and reproach and halfmelted myself by my pathos   which with a reprobate joy i wholly forgot the next instant   when with electric words few swift and vivid he brought me   through a brief tempest of tears to this heaven of sunshine and         sweetness      yes he had looked on a ghostthe phantom of love that was         perished   when last night he beheld the scene of which i have told you   for to the woman he saw there his troth had been solemnly plighted   ere he went to the war his return from the dead found her absent   in the belief of his death and hither to europe he followed   followed to seek her and keep if she would the promise between         them   or were a haunting doubt confirmed to break it and free her   then at naples we met and the love that before he was conscious   turned his life toward mine laid torturing stress to the purpose   whither it drove him forever and whence forever it swerved him   how could he tell me his love with this terrible burden upon him   how could he linger near me and still withhold the avowal   and what ruin were that if the other were doubted unjustly   and should prove fatally true with shame he confessed he had         faltered   clinging to guilty delays and to hopes that were bitter with         treason   up to the eve of our parting and then the last anguish was spared         him   her love for him was dead but the heart that leaped in his bosom   with a great dumb throb of joy and wonder and doubting   still must yield to the spell of his silencing will till that         phantom   proved an actual ghost by commonplace tests of the daylight   such as speech with the ladys father                  and now could i pardon   nay did i think i could love him i sobbingly answered i thought         so   and we are all of us going to lago di como tomorrow   with an ulterior view at the first convenient legation      patientest darling goodby poor fred whose sense of whats         proper   never was touched till now is shocked at my glad selfbetrayals   and i am pointed out as an awful example to annie   figuring all she must never be but oh if he loves me    postscript      since he has shown me a letter in which he absolves and forgives         her   philip of course not fred and the other of course and not         annie   dont you think him generous noble unselfish heroic    lenvoyclaras comment    well im glad i am sure if fanny supposes shes happy   ive no doubt her lover is good and nobleas men go   but as regards his release of a woman whod wholly forgot him   and whom he loved no longer for one whom he loves and who loves         him   i dont exactly see where the heroism commences     the song the oriole sings     there is a bird that comes and sings     in the professors gardentrees   upon the english oak he swings     and tilts and tosses in the breeze    i know his name i know his note     that so with rapture takes my soul   like flame the gold beneath his throat     his glossy cope is black as coal    o oriole it is the song     you sang me from the cottonwood   too young to feel that i was young     too glad to guess if life were good    and while i hark before my door     adown the dusty concord road   the blue miami flows once more     as by the cottonwood it flowed    and on the bank that rises steep     and pours a thousand tiny rills   from death and absence laugh and leap     my schoolmates to their fluttermills    the blackbirds jangle in the tops     of hoaryantlered sycamores   the timorous killdee starts and stops     among the driftwood on the shores    below the bridgea noonday fear     of dust and shadow shot with sun   stretches its gloom from pier to pier     far unto alien coasts unknown    and on those alien coasts above     where silver ripples break the streams   long blue from some roofsheltering grove     a hidden parrot scolds and screams    ah nothing nothing commonest things     a touch a glimpse a sound a breath   it is a song the oriole sings     and all the rest belongs to death    but oriole my oriole     were some bright seraph sent from bliss   with songs of heaven to win my soul     from simple memories such as this    what could he tell to tempt my ear     from you what high thing could there be   so tenderly and sweetly dear     as my lost boyhood is to me     pordenone    i    hard by the church of saint stephen in sole and beautiful venice   under the colonnade of the augustinian convent   every day as i passed i paused to look at the frescos   painted upon the ancient walls of the court of the convent   by a great master of old who wore his sword and his dagger   while he wrought the figures of patriarchs martyrs and virgins   into the sacred and famous scenes of scriptural story    ii    long ago the monks from their snug selfdevotion were driven   wistful and fat and slow looking backward i fancied them going   out through the sculptured doorway and down the ponte defrati   cowled and sandalled and beaded a plump and pensive procession   and in my day their cells were barracks for austrian soldiers   who in their turn have followed the augustinian friars   as to the frescos little remained of work once so perfect   summer and winter weather of some three cycles had wasted   plaster had fallen and left unsightly blotches of ruin   wanton and stupid neglect had done its worst to the pictures   yet to the sympathetic and reverent eye was apparent   where the careless glance but found in expanses of plaster   touches of incoherent color and lines interrupted   somewhat still of the life of surpassing splendor and glory   filling the frescos once and here and there was a figure   standing apart and out from the common decay and confusion   flushed with immortal youth and ineffaceable beauty   such as that figure of eve in pathetic expulsion from eden   takingthe tourist remembersthe wrath of heaven al fresco   as is her wellknown custom in thousands of acres of canvas    iii    i could make out the muchbepainted biblical subjects   when i had patience enough the temptation of course and         expulsion   cain killing abel his brotherthe merest fragment of murder   noahs debauchthe trunk of the seafaring patriarch naked   and the garment borne backward to cover it fearfully tattered   abraham offering isaacno visible isaac and only   abrahams lifted knife held back by the hovering angel   martyrdom of saint stephena part of the figure of stephen   and the conversion of paulthe greaves on the leg of a soldier   held across the back of a prostrate horse by the stirrup   but when i looked at the face of that tearful and beauteous         figure   eve in the fresco there and in venice of old violante   as i must fain believe the lovely daughter of palma   who was her fathers saint barbara and was the bella of titian   such a meaning and life shone forth from its animate presence   as could restore those vague and ineffectual pictures   with their pristine colors and fill them with light and with         movement   nay sometimes it could blind me to all the present about me   till i beheld no more the sausagelegged austrian soldiers   where they stood on guard beside one door of the convent   nor the sentinel beggars that watched the approach to the other   neither the bigolanti the broadbacked friulan maidens   drawing the water with clatter and splashing and laughter and         gossip   out of the carven well in the midst of the court of the convent   no not even the one with the mole on her cheek and the sidelong   look as she ambled forth with her buckets of bronze at her         shoulder   swinging upon the yoke to and fro adrip and aglimmer   all in an instant was changed and once more the cloister was         peopled   by the serene monks of old and against walls of the cloisters   high on his scaffolding raised pordenone5 wrought at his         frescos   armed with dagger and sword as the legend tells against titian   who was his rival in art and in love    iv                      it seemed to be summer   in the forenoon of the day and the masters diligent pencil   laid its last light touches on eve driven forth out of eden   otherwise violante and while his pupils about him   wrought and chattered in silence ran the thought of the painter   she and forever she is it come to be my perdition   shall i then never more make the face of a beautiful woman   but it must take her divine accursèd beauty upon it   and when i finish my work stand forth her visible presence   ah i could take this sword and strike it into her bosom   though i believe my own hearts blood would stream from the         painting   so much i love her yes that look is marvellous like you   wandering tendersuch as id give my salvation to win you   once to bend upon me but i knew myself better than make you   lest i should play the fool about you here before people   helpless to turn away from your violet eyes violante   that have turned all my life to a vision of madness the painter   here unto speech betraying the thoughts he had silently pondered   visions visions my son said a gray old friar who listened   seated there in the sun with his eye on the work of the painter   fishily fixed while the master blasphemed behind his mustaches   much have i envied your art who vouchsafeth to those who adore         her   visions of heavenly splendor denied to fastings and vigils   i have spent days and nights of faint and painful devotion   scourged myself almost to death without one glimpse of the glory   which your touch has revealed in the face of that heavenly maiden   pleasure me to repeat what it was you were saying of visions   fain would i know how they come to you though i never see them   and in my thickness of hearing i fear some words have escaped me   then while the painter glared on the lifted face of the friar   baleful breathless bewildered fiercer than noon in the dogdays   round the circle of pupils there ran a tittering murmur   from the lips to the ears of those nameless beppis and gigis   buzzed the stinging whisper lets hear pordenones confession   well they knew the masters luckless love and whose portrait   he had unconsciously painted there and guessed that his visions   scarcely were those conceived by the friar who constantly         blundered   round the painter at work mistaking every subject   noahs drunken debauch for the stoning of stephen the martyr   and the conversion of paul for the flight into egypt forever   putting his hand to his ear and shouting speak louder i pray         you   so they waited now in silent amused expectation   till pordenones angry scorn should gather to bursting   long the painter gazed in furious silence then slowly   uttered a kind of moan and turned again to his labor   tears gathered into his eyes of mortification and pathos   and when the dull old monk who forgot while he waited the answer   visions and painter and all had maundered away in his error   pordenone half envied the imbecile peace of his bosom   for in my own he mused is such a combat of devils   that i believe torpid age or stupid youth would be better   than this manhood of mine that has climbed aloft to discover   heights which i never can reach and bright on the pinnacle         standing   in the unfading light my rival crowned victor above me   if i could hint what i feel what forever escapes from my pencil   all aftertime should know my will was not less than my failure   nor should any one dare remember me merely in pity   all should read my sorrows and do my discomfiture homage   saying not meanly at any time this painter meant or endeavored   his was the anguish of one who falls short of the highest         achievement   conscious of doing his utmost and knowing how vast his defeat is   life if he would might have had some second guerdon to give him   but he would only the first and behold let us honor   grief such as his must have been no other sorrow can match it   there are certainly some things here that are nobly imagined   look here is masterly power in this play of light and these         shadows   boldly are massed and what color one can well understand         buonarotti   saying the sight of his curtius was worth the whole journey from         florence   here is a man at least never less than his work you can feel it   as you can feel in titians the painters inferior spirit   he and this pordenone you know were rivals and titian   knew how to paint to the popular humor and spared not   foul means or fair his way with rivals to crush pordenone   who with an equal chance                     alas if the whole world should tell me   i was his equal in art and the lie could save me from torment   so must i be lost for my soul could never believe it   nay let my envy snarl as fierce as it will at his glory   still when i look on his work my soul makes obeisance within me   humbling itself before the touch that shall never be equalled    he who sleeps in continual noise is wakened by silence   and pordenone was roused from these thoughts anon by the sudden   hush that had fallen upon the garrulous group of his pupils   and ere he turned halfway with instinctive looks of inquiry   he was already warned with a shock at the heart of a presence   long attended not feared and he laid one hand on his swordhilt   seizing the sheath with the other hand that the pallet had dropped         from   then he fronted titian who stood with his arms lightly folded   and with a curious smile half of sarcasm half of compassion   bent on th embattled painter cried your slave messere antonio   what good friend has played this bitter jest with your humor   as i beheld you just now fullarmed with your pencil and palette   i was half awed by your might but these sorry trappings of bravo   make me believe you less fit to be the rival of titian   here in the peaceful calm of our wellordered city of venice   than to take service under some spanish lordling at naples   needy in blades for work that can not wait for the poison    pordenone flushed with anger and shame to be taken   at an unguarded point but he answered with scornful defiance   oh you are come i see with the favorite weapon of titian   and you would make a battle of words if you care for my counsel   listen to me i say you are skilfuller far in my absence   and your tongue can inflict a keener and deadlier mischief   when it is dipped in poisonous lies and wielded in secret   nay then titian responded methinks that our friend aretino6   makes a much better effect than either of us in that tongueplay   but since messer robusti has measured our wit for his portrait   even he has grown shyer of using his tongue than he once was   have you not heard the tale tintoretto was told aretino   meant to make him the subject of one of his merry effusions   and with his naked dirk he went carefully over his person   promising if the poet made free with him in his verses   he would immortalize my satirical friend with that pencil   doubtless the tale is not true aretino says nothing about it   always speaks in fact with the highest respect of robusti   true or not tis well found then looking around on the frescos   good very good indeed your breadth and richness and softness   no man living surpasses those heads are truly majestic   yes buonarotti was right when he said that to look at your         curtius   richly repaid him the trouble and cost of a journey from florence   surely the world shall know you the first of painters in fresco   well you will not strike me unarmed this was hardly expected   by the good people that taught you to think our rivalry bloodred   let us be friends pordenone                     be patron and patronized rather   nay if you spoke your whole mind out be assassin and victim   could the life beat again in the broken heart of giorgione   he might tell us i think something pleasant of friendship with         titian   suddenly over the shoulder of titian peered an ironical visage   smiling malignly intentthe leer of the scurrilous poet   you knowall the world knowswho dug the grave of giorgione7   titian and he were no friendsour lady of sorrows forgive em   but for all hurt that titian did him he might have been living   greater than any living and lord of renown and such glory   as would have left you both dull as yon withered moon in the         sunshine   loud laughed the listening group at the insolent gibe of the poet   stirring the gall to its depths in the bitter soul of their master   who with his tremulous fingers tapped the hilt of his poniard   answering naught as yet anon the glance of the ribald   carelessly ranging from pordenones face to the picture   dwelt with an absent light on its marvellous beauty and kindled   into a slow recognition with ha violante then erring   wilfully as to the subject he cackled his filthy derision   what have we here more magdalens yet of the painters acquaintance   ah         the words had scarce left his lips when the painter   rushed upon him and clutching his throat thrust him backward and         held him   over the scaffoldings edge in air and straightway had flung him   crashing down on the pave of the cloister below but for titian   who around painter and poet alike wound his strong arms and stayed         them   solely until the bewildered pupils could come to the rescue   then as the foes relaxed that embrace of frenzy and murder   white one with rage and the other with terror and either with         hatred   grimly the great master smiled you were much nearer paradise         piero   than you have been for some time be ruled now by me and get         homeward   fast as you may and be thankful and then as the poet   looking neither to right nor to left amid the smiles of the pupils   tottered along the platform and trembling descended the ladder   down to the cloister pave and still without upward or backward   glance disappeared beneath the outer door of the convent   titian turned again to the painter farewell pordenone   learn more fairly to know me i envy you not and no rival   now or at any time have i held you or ever shall hold you   prosper and triumph still for all me you shall but do me honor   seeing that i too serve the art that your triumphs illustrate   i for my part find life too short for work and for pleasure   if it should touch a centurys bound i should think it too         precious   even to spare a moment for rage at anothers good fortune   do not be fooled by the purblind flatterers who would persuade you   either of us shall have greater fame through the fall of the other   we can thrive only in common the tardily blossoming cycles   flowering at last in this glorious age of our art had not waited   folded calyxes still for pordenone or titian   think you if we had not been our pictures had never been painted   others had done them or better the same we are only   pencils god paints with and think you that he had wanted for         pencils   but for our being at hand and yetfor some virtue creative   dwells and divinely exists in the being of every creature   so that the thing done through him is dear as if he had done it   if i should see your power a tint of this great efflorescence   fading methinks i should feel myself beginning to wither   they have abused your hate who told you that titian was jealous   once in my youth that is passed i too had my hates and my envies   sdeath how it used to gall methat power and depth of giorgione   i could have turned my knife in his heart when i looked at his         portraits   ah we learn somewhat still as the years go now when i see you   doing this good work here i am glad in my soul of its beauty   art is not ours o friend but if we are not hers we are nothing   look at the face you painted last yearor yesterday even   far so far it seems from you so utterly finally parted   nothing is stranger to you than this child of your soul and you         wonder   did i indeed then do it no thrill of the rapture of doing   stirs in your breast at the sight nay then not even the beauty   which we had seemed to create is our own the frame universal   is as much ours and shall i hate you because you are doing   that which when done you cannot feel yours more than i mine can feel         it   it shall belong hereafter to all who perceive and enjoy it   rather than him who made it he least of all shall enjoy it   they of the church conjure us to look on death and be humble   i say look upon life and keep your pride if you can then   see how todays achievement is only tomorrows confusion   see how possession always cheapens the thing that was precious   to our endeavor how losses and gains are equally losses   how in ourselves we are nothing and how we are anything only   as indifferent parts of the whole that still on our ceasing   whole remains as before no less without us than with us   were it not for the delight of doing the wonderful instant   ere the thing done is done and dead life scarce were worth living   ah but that makes life divine we are gods for that instant         immortal   mortal for evermore with a few days rumoror ages   what does it matter we too have our share of eating and         drinking   love and the liking of friendsmankinds common portion and         pleasure   come pordenone with me i would fain have you see my assumption   while it is still unfinished and stay with me for the evening   you shall send home for your lute and ill ask sansovino to         supper8   after what happened just now i scarcely could ask aretino   though for the matter of that the dog is not one to bear malice   will you not come    v          i listen with titian and wait for the answer   but whatever the answer that comes to titian i hear none   nay while i linger all those presences fade into nothing   in the dead air of the past and the old augustinian convent   lapses to picturesque profanation again as a barrack   lapses and changes once more and this time vanishes wholly   leaving me at the end with the broken shadowy legend   broken and shadowy still as in the beginning i linger   teased with its vague unfathomed suggestion and wonder   as at first i wondered what happened about violante   and am but ill content with those metaphysical phrases   touching the strictly impersonal nature of personal effort   wherewithal titian had fain avoided the matter at issue   footnotes    5 giovanni antonio licinio called pordenone from his birthplace       in the friuli was a contemporary of titians whom he equalled       in many qualities and was one of the most eminent venetian       painters in fresco    6 pietro aretino the satirical poet was a friend of titian whose       house he frequented the story of tintorettos measuring him for       a portrait with his dagger is well known    7 giorgione giorgio barbarelli was titians fellowpupil and rival       in the school of bellini he died at thirtyfour after a life       of great triumphs and excesses    8 sansovino the architect was a familiar guest at titians table       in his house near the fondamenta nuove     the long days     yes they are here again the long long days     after the days of winter pinched and white     soon with a thousand minstrels comes the light   late the sweet robinhaunted dusk delays    but the long days that bring us back the flowers     the sunshine and the quietdripping rain     and all the things we knew of spring again   the long days bring not the longlost long hours    the hours that now seem to have been each one     a summer in itself a whole lifes bound     filled full of deathless joywhere in his round   have these forever faded from the sun    the fret the fever the unrest endures     but the time flies oh try my little lad     coming so hot and playworn to be glad   and patient of the long hours that are yours
