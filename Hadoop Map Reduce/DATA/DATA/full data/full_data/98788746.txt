98788746	homeward bound or the chase  a tale of the sea  by j fenimore cooper         is t not strange canidius   that from tarentum and brundusium   he could so quickly cut the ionian sea   and take in toryneshakspeare   complete in one volume  new edition  new york published by hurd and houghton cambridge riverside press 1871     homeward bound     preface    in one respect this book is a parallel to franklins wellknown apologue of the hatter and his sign it was commenced with a sole view to exhibit the present state of society in the united states through the agency in part of a set of characters with different peculiarities who had freshly arrived from europe and to whom the distinctive features of the country would be apt to present themselves with greater force than to those who had never lived beyond the influence of the things portrayed by the original plan the work was to open at the threshold of the country or with the arrival of the travellers at sandy hook from which point the tale was to have been carried regularly forward to its conclusion but a consultation with others has left little more of this plan than the hatters friends left of his sign as a vessel was introduced in the first chapter the cry was for more ship until the work has become all ship it actually closing at or near the spot where it was originally intended it should commence owing to this diversion from the authors designa design that lay at the bottom of all his projectsa necessity has been created of running the tale through two separate works or of making a hurried and insufficient conclusion the former scheme has consequently been adopted  it is hoped that the interest of the narrative will not be essentially diminished by this arrangement  there will be very likely certain imaginative persons who will feel disposed to deny that every minute event mentioned in these volumes ever befell one and the same ship though ready enough to admit that they may very well have occurred to several different ships a mode of commenting that is much in favour with your small critic to this objection we shall make but a single answer the caviller if any there should prove to be is challenged to produce the logbook of the montauk london packet and if it should be found to contain a single sentence to controvert any one of our statements or facts a frank recantation shall be made captain truck is quite as well known in new york as in london or portsmouth and to him also we refer with confidence for a confirmation of all we have said with the exception perhaps of the little occasional touches of character that may allude directly to himself in relation to the latter mr leach and particularly mr saunders are both invoked as unimpeachable witnesses  most of our readers will probably know that all which appears in a new york journal is not necessarily as true as the gospel as some slight deviations from the facts accidentally occur though doubtless at very long intervals it should not be surprising that they sometimes omit circumstances that are quite as veracious as anything they do actually utter to the world no argument therefore can justly be urged against the incidents of this story on account of the circumstance of their not being embodied in the regular marine news of the day  another serious objection on the part of the american reader to this work is foreseen the author has endeavoured to interest his readers in occurrences of a date as antiquated as two years can make them when he is quite aware that in order to keep pace with a state of society in which there was no yesterday it would have been much safer to anticipate things by laying his scene two years in advance it is hoped however that the public sentiment will not be outraged by this glimpse at antiquity and this the more so as the sequel of the tale will bring down events within a year of the present moment  previously to the appearance of that sequel however it may be well to say a few words concerning the fortunes of some of our characters as it might be en attendant  to commence with the most important the montauk herself once deemed so splendid and convenient is already supplanted in the public favour by a new ship the reign of a popular packet a popular preacher or a popular anythingelse in america being limited by a national esprit de corps to a time materially shorter than that of a lustre this however is no more than just rotation in favour being as evidently a matter of constitutional necessity as rotation in office  captain truck for a novelty continues popular a circumstance that he himself ascribes to the fact of his being still a bachelor  toast is promoted figuring at the head of a pantry quite equal to that of his great master who regards his improvement with some such eyes as charles the twelfth of sweden regarded that of his great rival peter after the affair of pultowa  mr leach now smokes his own cigar and issues his own orders from a monkey rail his place in the line being supplied by his former dickey he already speaks of his great model as of one a little antiquated it is true but as a man who had merit in his time though it was not the particular merit that is in fashion today  notwithstanding these little changes which are perhaps inseparable from the events of a period so long as two years in a country as energetic as america and in which nothing seems to be stationary but the ages of tontine nominees and threelife leases a cordial esteem was created among the principal actors in the events of this book which is likely to outlast the passage and which will not fail to bring most of them together again in the sequel  april 1838     chapter i      an inner room i have   where thou shalt rest and some refreshment take   and then we will more fully talk of this    orra   the coast of england though infinitely finer than our own is more remarkable for its verdure and for a general appearance of civilisation than for its natural beauties the chalky cliffs may seem bold and noble to the american though compared to the granite piles that buttress the mediterranean they are but molehills and the travelled eye seeks beauties instead in the retiring vales the leafy hedges and the clustering towns that dot the teeming island neither is portsmouth a very favourable specimen of a british port considered solely in reference to the picturesque a town situated on a humble point and fortified after the manner of the low countries with an excellent haven suggests more images of the useful than of the pleasing while a background of modest receding hills offers little beyond the verdant swales of the country in this respect england itself has the fresh beauty of youth rather than the mellowed hues of a more advanced period of life or it might be better to say it has the young freshness and retiring sweetness that distinguish her females as compared with the warmer tints of spain and italy and which women and landscape alike need the near view to be appreciated  some such thoughts as these passed through the mind of the traveller who stood on the deck of the packet montauk resting an elbow on the quarterdeck rail as he contemplated the view of the coast that stretched before him east and west for leagues the manner in which this gentleman whose temples were sprinkled with grey hairs regarded the scene denoted more of the thoughtfulness of experience and of tastes improved by observation than it is usual to meet amid the bustling and commonplace characters that compose the majority in almost every situation of life the calmness of his exterior an air removed equally from the admiration of the novice and the superciliousness of the tyro had indeed so strongly distinguished him from the moment he embarked in london to that in which he was now seen in the position mentioned that several of the seamen swore he was a manofwarsman in disguise the fairhaired lovely blueeyed girl at his side too seemed a softened reflection of all his sentiment intelligence knowledge tastes and cultivation united to the artlessness and simplicity that became her sex and years  we have seen nobler coasts eve said the gentleman pressing the arm that leaned on his own but after all england will always be fair to american eyes  more particularly so if those eyes first opened to the light in the eighteenth century father  you at least my child have been educated beyond the reach of national foibles whatever may have been my own evil fortune and still i think even you have seen a great deal to admire in this country as well as in this coast  eve effingham glanced a moment towards the eye of her father and perceiving that he spoke in playfulness without suffering a cloud to shadow a countenance that usually varied with her emotions she continued the discourse which had in fact only been resumed by the remark first mentioned  i have been educated as it is termed in so many different places and countries returned eve smiling that i sometimes fancy i was born a woman like my great predecessor and namesake the mother of abel if a congress of nations in the way of masters can make one independent of prejudice i may claim to possess the advantage my greatest fear is that in acquiring liberality i have acquired nothing else  mr effingham turned a look of parental fondness in which parental pride was clearly mingled on the face of his daughter and said with his eyes though his tongue did not second the expression this is a fear sweet one that none besides thyself would feel  a congress of nations truly muttered another male voice near the father and daughter you have been taught music in general by seven masters of as many different states besides the touch of the guitar by a spaniard greek by a german the living tongues by the european powers and philosophy by seeing the world and now with a brain full of learning fingers full of touches eyes full of tints and a person full of grace your father is taking you back to america to waste your sweetness on the desert air  poetically expressed if not justly imagined cousin jack returned the laughing eve but you have forgot to add and a heart full of feeling for the land of my birth  we shall see in the end  in the end as in the beginning now and for evermore  all love is eternal in the commencement  do you make no allowance for the constancy of woman think you that a girl of twenty can forget the country of her birth the land of her forefathersor as you call it yourself when in a good humour the land of liberty  a pretty specimen you will have of its liberty returned the cousin sarcastically after having passed a girlhood of wholesome restraint in the rational society of europe you are about to return home to the slavery of american female life just as you are about to be married  married mr effingham  i suppose the catastrophe will arrive sooner or later and it is more likely to occur to a girl of twenty than to a girl of ten  mr john effingham never lost an argument for the want of a convenient fact my love the father observed by way of bringing the brief discussion to a close but here are the boats approaching let us withdraw a little and examine the chance medley of faces with which we are to become familiar by the intercourse of a month  you will be much more likely to agree on a verdict of murder muttered the kinsman  mr effingham led his daughter into the hurricanehouseor as the packetmen quaintly term it the coachhouse where they stood watching the movements on the quarterdeck for the next halfhour an interval of which we shall take advantage to touch in a few of the stronger lights of our picture leaving the softer tints and the shadows to be discovered by the manner in which the artist tells the story  edward and john effingham were brothers children were born on the same day had passionately loved the same woman who had preferred the firstnamed and died soon after eve was born had notwithstanding this collision in feeling remained sincere friends and this the more so probably from a mutual and natural sympathy in their common loss had lived much together at home and travelled much together abroad and were now about to return in company to the land of their birth after what might be termed an absence of twelve years though both had visited america for short periods in the intervalsjohn not less than five times  there was a strong family likeness between the cousins their persons and even features being almost identical though it was scarcely possible for two human beings to leave more opposite impressions on mere casual spectators when seen separately both were tall of commanding presence and handsome while one was winning in appearance and the other if not positively forbidding at least distant and repulsive the noble outline of face in edward effingham had got to be cold severity in that of john the aquiline nose of the latter seeming to possess an eaglelike and hostile curvaturehis compressed lip sarcastic and cold expression and the fine classical chin a feature in which so many of the saxon race fail a haughty scorn that caused strangers usually to avoid him eve drew with great facility and truth and she had an eye as her cousin had rightly said full of tints often and often had she sketched both of these loved faces and never without wondering wherein that strong difference existed in nature which she had never been able to impart to her drawings the truth is that the subtle character of john effinghams face would have puzzled the skill of one who had made the art his study for a life and it utterly set the graceful but scarcely profound knowledge of the beautiful young painter at defiance all the points of character that rendered her father so amiable and so winning and which were rather felt than perceived in his cousin were salient and bold and if it may be thus expressed had become indurated by mental suffering and disappointment  the cousins were both rich though in ways as opposite as their dispositions and habits of thought edward effingham possessed a large hereditary property that brought a good income and which attached him to this world of ours by kindly feelings towards its land and water while john much the wealthier of the two having inherited a large commercial fortune did not own ground enough to bury him as he sometimes deridingly said he kept his gold in corporations that were as soulless as himself  still john effingham was a man of cultivated mind of extensive intercourse with the world and of manners that varied with the occasion or perhaps it were better to say with his humours in all these particulars but the latter the cousins were alike edward effinghams deportment being as equal as his temper though also distinguished for a knowledge of society  these gentlemen had embarked at london on their fiftieth birthday in the packet of the 1st of october bound to new york the lands and family residence of the proprietor lying in the state of that name of which all of the parties were natives it is not usual for the cabin passengers of the london packets to embark in the docks but mr effinghamas we shall call the father in general to distinguish him from the bachelor johnas an old and experienced traveller had determined to make his daughter familiar with the peculiar odours of the vessel in smooth water as a protection against seasickness a malady however from which she proved to be singularly exempt in the end they had accordingly been on board three days when the ship came to an anchor off portsmouth the point where the remainder of the passengers were to join her on that particular day when the scene of this tale commences  at this precise moment then the montauk was lying at a single anchor not less than a league from the land in a flat calm with her three topsails loose the courses in the brails and with all those signs of preparation about her that are so bewildering to landsmen but which seamen comprehend as clearly as words the captain had no other business there than to take on board the wayfarers and to renew his supply of fresh meat and vegetables things of so familiar import on shore as to be seldom thought of until missed but which swell into importance during a passage of a months duration eve had employed her three days of probation quite usefully having with the exception of the two gentlemen the officers of the vessel and one other person been in quiet possession of all the ample not to say luxurious cabins it is true she had a female attendant but to her she had been accustomed from childhood and nanny sidley as her quondam nurse and actual ladysmaid was termed appeared so much a part of herself that while her absence would be missed almost as greatly as that of a limb her presence was as much a matter of course as a hand or foot nor will a passing word concerning this excellent and faithful domestic be thrown away in the brief preliminary explanations we are making  ann sidley was one of those excellent creatures who it is the custom with the european travellers to say do not exist at all in america and who while they are certainly less numerous than could be wished have no superiors in the world in their way she had been born a servant lived a servant and was quite content to die a servantand this too in one and the same family we shall not enter into a philosophical examination of the reasons that had induced old ann to feel certain she was in the precise situation to render her more happy than any other that to her was attainable but feel it she did as john effingham used to express it from the crown of her head to the sole of her foot she had passed through infancy childhood girlhood up to womanhood pari passu with the mother of eve having been the daughter of a gardener who died in the service of the family and had heart enough to feel that the mixed relations of civilised society when properly understood and appreciated are more pregnant of happiness than the vulgar scramble and heartburnings that in the mêlée of a migrating and unsettled population are so injurious to the grace and principles of american life at the death of eves mother she had transferred her affections to the child and twenty years of assiduity and care had brought her to feel as much tenderness for her lovely young charge as if she had been her natural parent but nanny sidley was better fitted to care for the body than the mind of eve and when at the age of ten the latter was placed under the control of an accomplished governess the good woman had meekly and quietly sunk the duties of the nurse in those of the maid  one of the severest trialsor crosses as she herself termed itthat poor nanny had ever experienced was endured when eve began to speak in a language she could not herself comprehend for in despite of the best intentions in the world and twelve years of use the good woman could never make anything of the foreign tongues her young charge was so rapidly acquiring one day when eve had been maintaining an animated and laughing discourse in italian with her instructress nanny unable to command herself had actually caught the child to her bosom and bursting into tears implored her not to estrange herself entirely from her poor old nurse the caresses and solicitations of eve soon brought the good woman to a sense of her weakness but the natural feeling was so strong that it required years of close observation to reconcile her to the thousand excellent qualities of mademoiselle viefville the lady to whose superintendence the education of miss effingham had been finally confided  this mademoiselle viefville was also among the passengers and was the one other person who now occupied the cabins in common with eve and her friends she was the daughter of a french officer who had fallen in napoleons campaigns had been educated at one of those admirable establishments which form points of relief in the ruthless history of the conqueror and had now lived long enough to have educated two young persons the last of whom was eve effingham twelve years of close communion with her élève had created sufficient attachment to cause her to yield to the solicitations of the father to accompany his daughter to america and to continue with her during the first year of her probation in a state of society that the latter felt must be altogether novel to a young woman educated as his own child had been  so much has been written and said of french governesses that we shall not anticipate the subject but leave this lady to speak and act for herself in the course of the narrative neither is it our intention to be very minute in these introductory remarks concerning any of our characters but having thus traced their outlines we shall return again to the incidents as they occurred trusting to make the reader better acquainted with all the parties as we proceed     chapter ii      lord cram and lord vultur   sir brandish ocultur   with marshal carouzer   and old lady mouser    bath guide   the assembling of the passengers of a packetship is at all times a matter of interest to the parties concerned during the western passage in particular which can never safely be set down at less than a month there is the prospect of being shut up for the whole of that period within the narrow compass of a ship with those whom chance has brought together influenced by all the accidents and caprices of personal character and a difference of nations conditions in life and education the quarterdeck it is true forms a sort of local distinction and the poor creatures in the steerage seem the rejected of providence for the time being but all who know life will readily comprehend that the pêlemêle of the cabins can seldom offer anything very enticing to people of refinement and taste against this evil however there is one particular source of relief most persons feeling a disposition to yield to the circumstances in which they are placed with the laudable and convenient desire to render others comfortable in order that they may be made comfortable themselves  a man of the world and a gentleman mr effingham had looked forward to this passage with a good deal of concern on account of his daughter while he shrank with the sensitiveness of his habits from the necessity of exposing one of her delicacy and plastic simplicity to the intercourse of a ship accompanied by mademoiselle viefville watched over by nanny and guarded by himself and his kinsman he had lost some of his apprehensions on the subject during the three probationary days and now took his stand in the centre of his own party to observe the new arrivals with something of the security of a man who is entrenched in his own doorway  the place they occupied at a window of the hurricanehouse did not admit of a view of the water but it was sufficiently evident from the preparations in the gangway next the land that boats were so near as to render that unnecessary  genus cockney species bagman muttered john effingham as the first arrival touched the deck that worthy has merely exchanged the basket of a coach for the deck of a packet we may now learn the price of buttons  it did not require a naturalist to detect the species of the stranger in truth though john effingham had been a little more minute in his description than was warranted by the fact the person in question was one of those mercantile agents that england scatters so profusely over the world some of whom have all the most sterling qualities of their nation though a majority perhaps are a little disposed to mistake the value of other people as well as their own this was the genus as john effingham had expressed it but the species will best appear on dissection the master of the ship saluted this person cordially and as an old acquaintance by the name of monday  a mousquetaire resuscitated said mademoiselle viefville in her broken english as one who had come in the same boat as the firstnamed thrust his whiskered and mustachoed visage above the rail of the gangway  more probably a barber who has converted his own head into a wigblock growled john effingham  it cannot surely be wellington in disguise added mr effingham with a sarcasm of manner that was quite unusual for him  or a peer of the realm in his robes whispered eve who was much amused with the elaborate toilet of the subject of their remarks who descended the ladder supported by a sailor and after speaking to the master was formally presented to his late boatcompanion as sir george templemore the two bustled together about the quarterdeck for a few minutes using eyeglasses which led them into several scrapes by causing them to hit their legs against sundry objects they might otherwise have avoided though both were much too highbred to betray feelingsor fancied they were which answered the same purpose  after these flourishes the new comers descended to the cabin in company not without pausing to survey the party in the hurricanehouse more especially eve who to old anns great scandal was the subject of their manifest and almost avowed admiration and observation  one is rather glad to have such a relief against the tediousness of a seapassage said sir george as they went down the ladder no doubt you are used to this sort of thing mr monday but with me it is voyage the firstthat is if i except the channel and the seas one encounters in making the usual run on the continent  oh dear me i go and come as regularly as the equinoxes sir george which you know is quite in rule once a year i call my passages the equinoxes too for i religiously make it a practice to pass just twelve hours out of the twentyfour in my berth  this was the last the party on deck heard of the opinions of the two worthies for the time being nor would they have been favoured with all this had not mr monday what he thought a rattling way with him which caused him usually to speak in an octave above every one else although their voices were nearly mute or rather lost to those above they were heard knocking about in their staterooms and sir george in particular as frequently called out for the steward by the name of saunders as mr monday made similar appeals to the stewards assistant for succour by the appropriate appellation of toast  i think we may safely claim this person at least for a countryman said john effingham he is what i have heard termed an american in a european mask  the character is more ambitiously conceived than skilfully maintained replied eve who had need of all her retenue of manner to abstain from laughing outright were i to hazard a conjecture it would be to describe the gentleman as a collector of costumes who had taken a fancy to exhibit an assortment of his riches on his own person mademoiselle viefville you who so well understand costumes may tell us from what countries the separate parts of that attire have been collected  i can answer for the shop in berlin where the travelling cap was purchased returned the amused governess in no other part of the world can a parallel be found  i should think maam put in nanny with the quiet simplicity of her nature as well as of her habits that the gentleman must have bought his boots in paris for they seem to pinch his feet and all the paris boots and shoes pinch ones feetat least all mine did  the watchguard is stamped geneva continued eve  the coat comes from frankfort cest une équivoque  and the pipe from dresden mademoiselle viefville  the conchiglia savours of rome and the little chain annexed bespeaks the rialto while the moustaches are anything but indigènes and the tout ensemble the world the man is travelled at least  eves eyes sparkled with humour as she said this while the new passenger who had been addressed as mr dodge and as an old acquaintance also by the captain came so near them as to admit of no further comments a short conversation between the two soon let the listeners into the secret that the traveller had come from america in the spring whither after having made the tour of europe he was about to return in the autumn  seen enough ha added the captain with a friendly nod of the head when the other had finished a brief summary of his proceedings in the eastern hemisphere all eyes and no leisure or inclination for more  ive seen as much as i warnt to see returned the traveller with an emphasis on and a pronunciation of the word we have italicised that cannot be committed to paper but which were eloquence itself on the subject of selfsatisfaction and selfknowledge  well that is the main point when a man has got all he wants of a thing any addition is like overballast whenever i can get fifteen knots out of the ship i make it a point to be satisfied especially under closereefed topsails and on a taut bowline  the traveller and the master nodded their heads at each other like men who understood more than they expressed when the former after inquiring with marked interest if his roommate sir george templemore had arrived went below an intercourse of three days had established something like an acquaintance between the latter and the passengers she had brought from the river and turning his red quizzical face towards the ladies he observed with inimitable gravity  there is nothing like understanding when one has enough even if it be of knowledge i never yet met with the navigator who found two noons in the same day that he was not in danger of shipwreck now i dare say mr dodge there who has just gone below has as he says seen all he warnts to see and it is quite likely he knows more already than he can cleverly get along withlet the people be getting the booms on the yards mr leach we shall be warnting to spread our wings before the end of the passage  as captain truck though he often swore seldom laughed his mate gave the necessary order with a gravity equal to that with which it had been delivered to him and even the sailors went aloft to execute it with greater alacrity for an indulgence of humour that was peculiar to their trade and which as few understood it so well none enjoyed so much as themselves as the homewardbound crew was the same as the outwardbound and mr dodge had come abroad quite as green as he was now going home ripe this traveller of six months finish did not escape diver commentaries that literally cut him up from clew to earring and which flew about in the rigging much as active birds flutter from branch to branch in a tree the subject of all this wit however remained profoundly not to say happily ignorant of the sensation he had produced being occupied in disposing of the dresden pipe the venetian chain and the roman conchiglia in his stateroom and in instituting an acquaintance as he expressed it with his roommate sir george templemore  we must surely have something better than this observed mr effingham for i observed that two of the staterooms in the main cabin are taken singly  in order that the general reader may understand this it may be well to explain that the packetships have usually two berths in each stateroom but they who can afford to pay an extra charge are permitted to occupy the little apartment singly it is scarcely necessary to add that persons of gentlemanly feeling when circumstances will at all permit prefer economising in other things in order to live by themselves for the month usually consumed in the passage since in nothing is refinement more plainly exhibited than in the reserve of personal habits  there is no lack of vulgar fools stirring with full pockets rejoined john effingham the two rooms you mention may have been taken by some yearling travellers who are little better than the semiannual savant who has just passed us  it is at least something cousin jack to have the wishes of a gentleman  it is something eve though it end in wishes or even in caricature  what are the names pleasantly asked mademoiselle viefville the names may be a clue to the characters  the papers pinned to the bedcurtains bear the antithetical titles of mr sharp and mr blunt though it is quite probable the first is wanting of a letter or two by accident and the last is merely a synonyme of the old nom de guerre cash  do persons then actually travel with borrowed names in our days asked eve with a little of the curiosity of the common mother whose name she bore  that do they and with borrowed money too as well as in other days i dare say however these two covoyagers of ours will come just as they are in truth sharp enough and blunt enough  are they americans think you  they ought to be both the qualities being thoroughly indigènes as mademoiselle viefville would say  nay cousin john i will bandy words with you no longer for the last twelve months you have done little else than try to lessen the joyful anticipations with which i return to the home of my childhood  sweet one i would not willingly lessen one of thy young and generous pleasures by any of the alloy of my own bitterness but what wilt thou a little preparation for that which is as certain to follow as that the sun succeeds the dawn will rather soften the disappointment thou art doomed to feel  eve had only time to cast a look of affectionate gratitude towards himfor whilst he spoke tauntingly he spoke with a feeling that her experience from childhood had taught her to appreciateere the arrival of another boat drew the common attention to the gangway a call from the officer in attendance had brought the captain to the rail and his order to pass in the luggage of mr sharp and mr blunt was heard by all near  now for les indigènes whispered mademoiselle viefville with the nervous excitement that is a little apt to betray a lively expectation in the gentler sex  eve smiled for there are situations in which trifles help to awaken interest and the little that had just passed served to excite curiosity in the whole party mr effingham thought it a favourable symptom that the master who had had interviews with all his passengers in london walked to the gangway to receive the newcomers for a boatload of the quarterdeck oi polloi had come on board a moment before without any other notice on his part than a general bow with the usual order to receive their effects  the delay denotes englishmen the caustic john had time to throw in before the silent arrangement at the gangway was interrupted by the appearance of the passengers  the quiet smile of mademoiselle viefville as the two travellers appeared on deck denoted approbation for her practised eye detected at a glance that both were certainly gentlemen women are more purely creatures of convention in their way than men their education inculcating nicer distinctions and discriminations than that of the other sex and eve who would have studied sir george templemore and mr dodge as she would have studied the animals of a caravan or as creatures with whom she had no affinities after casting a sly look of curiosity at the two who now appeared on deck unconsciously averted her eyes like a wellbred young person in a drawingroom  they are indeed english quietly remarked mr effingham but out of question english gentlemen  the one nearest appears to me to be continental answered mademoiselle viefville who had not felt the same impulse to avert her look as eve he is jamais anglais  eve stole a glance in spite of herself and with the intuitive penetration of a woman intimated that she had come to the same conclusion the two strangers were both tall and decidedly gentlemanlike young men whose personal appearance would cause either to be remarked the one whom the captain addressed as mr sharp had the most youthful look his complexion being florid and his hair light though the other was altogether superior in outline of features as well as in expression indeed mademoiselle viefville fancied she never saw a sweeter smile than that he gave on returning the salute of the deck there was more than the common expression of suavity and of the usual play of features in it for it struck her as being thoughtful and as almost melancholy his companion was gracious in his manner and perfectly well toned but his demeanour had less of the soul of the man about it partaking more of the training of the social caste to which it belonged these may seem to be nice distinctions for the circumstances but mademoiselle viefville had passed her life in good company and under responsibilities that had rendered observation and judgment highly necessary and particularly observations of the other sex  each of the strangers had a servant and while their luggage was passed up from the boat they walked aft nearer to the hurricanehouse accompanied by the captain every american who is not very familiar with the world appears to possess the mania of introducing captain truck was no exception to the rule for while he was perfectly acquainted with a ship and knew the etiquette of the quarterdeck to a hair he got into blue water the moment he approached the finesse of deportment he was exactly of that school of élégants who fancy drinking a glass of wine with another and introducing are touches of breeding it being altogether beyond his comprehension that both have especial uses and are only to be resorted to on especial occasions still the worthy master who had begun life on the forecastle without any previous knowledge of usages and who had imbibed the notion that manners make the man taken in the narrow sense of the axiom was a devotee of what he fancied to be good breeding and one of his especial duties as he imagined in order to put his passengers at their ease was to introduce them to each other a proceeding which it is hardly necessary to say had just a contrary effect with the better class of them  you are acquainted gentlemen he said as the three approached the party in the hurricanehouse  the two travellers endeavoured to look interested while mr sharp carelessly observed that they had met for the first time in the boat this was delightful intelligence to captain truck who did not lose a moment in turning it to account stopping short he faced his companions and with a solemn wave of the hand he went through the ceremonial in which he most delighted and in which he piqued himself at being an adept  mr sharp permit me to introduce you to mr bluntmr blunt let me make you acquainted with mr sharp  the gentlemen though taken a little by surprise at the dignity and formality of the captain touched their hands civilly to each other and smiled eve not a little amused at the scene watched the whole procedure and then she too detected the sweet melancholy of the one expression and the marblelike irony of the other it may have been this that caused her to start though almost imperceptibly and to colour  our turn will come next muttered john effingham get the grimaces ready  his conjecture was right for hearing his voice without understanding the words the captain followed up his advantage to his own infinite gratification  gentlemenmr effingham mr john effinghamevery one soon came to make this distinction in addressing the cousinsmiss effingham mademoiselle viefvillemr sharp mr bluntladiesgentlemen mr blunt mr sharp  the dignified bow of mr effingham as well as the faint and distant smile of eve would have repelled any undue familiarity in men of less tone than either of the strangers both of whom received the unexpected honour like those who felt themselves to be intruders as mr sharp raised his hat to eve however he held it suspended a moment above his head and then dropping his arm to its full length he bowed with profound respect though distantly mr blunt was less elaborate in his salute but as pointed as the circumstances at all required both gentlemen were a little struck with the distant hauteur of john effingham whose bow while it fulfilled all the outward forms was what eve used laughingly to term imperial the bustle of preparation and the certainty that there would be no want of opportunities to renew the intercourse prevented more than the general salutations and the newcomers descended to their staterooms  did you remark the manner in which those people took my introduction asked captain truck of his chief mate whom he was training up in the ways of packetpoliteness as one in the road of preferment now to my notion they might have shook hands at least thats what i call vattel  one sometimes falls in with what are rum chaps returned the other who from following the london trade had caught a few cockneyisms if a man chooses to keep his hands in the beckets why let him say i but i take it as a slight to the company to sheer out of the usual track in such matters  i was thinking as much myself but after all what can packetmasters do in such a case we can set luncheon and dinner before the passengers but we cant make them eat now my rule is when a gentleman introduces me to do the thing handsomely and to return shake for shake if it is three times three but as for a touch of the beaver it is like setting a topgallant sail in passing a ship at sea and means just nothing at all who would know a vessel because he has let run his halyards and swayed the yard up again one would do as much to a turk for manners sake no no there is something in this and d me just to make sure of it the first good opportunity that offers illay ill just introduce them all over againlet the people ship their handspikes mr leach and heave in the slack of the chainay ay ill take an opportunity when all hands are on deck and introduce them shipshape one by one as your greenhorns go through a lubbershole or we shall have no friendship during the passage  the mate nodded approbation as if the other had hit upon the right expedient and then he proceeded to obey the orders while the cares of his vessel soon drove the subject temporarily from the mind of his commander     chapter iii      by all description this should be the place   whos herespeak hono answerwhat is this    timon of athens   a ship with her sails loosened and her ensign abroad is always a beautiful object and the montauk a noble newyorkbuilt vessel of seven hundred tons burthen was a firstclass specimen of the kettlebottom school of naval architecture wanting in nothing that the taste and experience of the day can supply the scene that was now acting before their eyes therefore soon diverted the thoughts of mademoiselle viefville and eve from the introductions of the captain both watching with intense interest the various movements of the crew and passengers as they passed in review  a crowd of welldressed but of an evidently humbler class of persons than those farther aft were thronging the gangways little dreaming of the physical suffering they were to endure before they reached the land of promisethat distant america towards which the poor and oppressed of nearly all nations turn longing eyes in quest of a shelter eve saw with wonder aged men and women among them beings who were about to sever most of the ties of the world in order to obtain relief from the physical pains and privations that had borne hard on them for more than threescore years a few had made sacrifices of themselves in obedience to that mysterious instinct which man feels in his offspring while others again went rejoicing flushed with the hope of their vigour and youth some the victims of their vices had embarked in the idle expectation that a change of scene with increased means of indulgence could produce a healthful change of character all had views that the truth would have dimmed and perhaps no single adventurer among the emigrants collected in that ship entertained either sound or reasonable notions of the mode in which his step was to be rewarded though many may meet with a success that will surpass their brightest picture of the future more no doubt were to be disappointed  reflections something like these passed through the mind of eve effingham as she examined the mixed crowd in which some were busy in receiving stores from boats others in holding party conferences with friends in which a few were weeping here and there a group was drowning reflection in the parting cup while wondering children looked up with anxiety into the wellknown faces as if fearful they might lose the countenances they loved and the charities on which they habitually relied in such a mêlée  although the stern discipline which separates the cabin and steerage passengers into castes as distinct as those of the hindoos had not yet been established captain truck had too profound a sense of his duty to permit the quarterdeck to be unceremoniously invaded this part of the ship then had partially escaped the confusion of the moment though trunks boxes hampers and other similar appliances of travelling were scattered about in tolerable affluence profiting by the space of which there was still sufficient for the purpose most of the party left the hurricanehouse to enjoy the short walk that a ship affords at that instant another boat from the land reached the vessels side and a gravelooking personage who was not disposed to lessen his dignity by levity or an omission of forms appeared on deck where he demanded to be shown the master an introduction was unnecessary in this instance for captain truck no sooner saw his visitor than he recognized the wellknown features and solemn pomposity of a civil officer of portsmouth who was often employed to search the american packets in pursuit of delinquents of all degrees of crime and folly  i had just come to the opinion i was not to have the pleasure of seeing you this passage mr grab said the captain shaking hands familiarly with the myrmidon of the law but the turn of the tide is not more regular than you gentlemen who come in the name of the kingmr grab mr dodge mr dodge mr grab and now to what forgery or bigamy or elopement or scandalum magnatum do i owe the honor of your company this timesir george templemore mr grab mr grab sir george templemore  sir george bowed with the dignified aversion an honest man might be supposed to feel for one of the others employment while mr grab looked gravely and with a counter dignity at sir george the business of the officer however was with none in the cabin but he had come in quest of a young woman who had married a suitor rejected by her unclean arrangement that was likely to subject the latter to a settlement of accounts which he found inconvenient and which he had thought it prudent to anticipate by bringing an action of debt against the bridegroom for advances real or pretended made to the wife during her nonage a dozen eager ears caught an outline of this tale as it was communicated to the captain and in an incredibly short space of time it was known throughout the ship with not a few embellishments  i do not know the person of the husband continued the officer nor indeed does the attorney who is with me in the boat but his name is robert davis and you can have no difficulty in pointing him out we know him to be in the ship  i never introduce any steerage passengers my dear sir and there is no such person in the cabin i give you my honourand that is a pledge that must pass between gentlemen like us you are welcome to search but the duty of the vessel must go on take your manbut do not detain the shipmr sharp mr grab mr grab mr sharpbear a hand there mr leach and let us have the slack of the chain as soon as possible  there appeared to be what the philosophers call the attraction of repulsion between the parties last introduced for the tall gentlemanlylooking mr sharp eyed the officer with a supercilious coldness neither party deeming much ceremony on the occasion necessary mr grab now summoned his assistant the attorney from the boat and there was a consultation between them as to their further proceedings fifty heads were grouped around them and curious eyes watched their smallest movements one of the crowd occasionally disappearing to report proceedings  man is certainly a clannish animal for without knowing any thing of the merits of the case without pausing to inquire into the right or the wrong of the matter in the pure spirit of partisanship every man woman and child of the steerage which contained fully a hundred souls took sides against the law and enlisted in the cause of the defendant all this was done quietly however for no one menaced or dreamed of violence crew and passengers usually taking their cues from the officers of the vessel on such occasions and those of the montauk understood too well the rights of the public agents to commit themselves in the matter  call robert davis said the officer resorting to a ruse by affecting an authority he had no right to assume robert davis echoed twenty voices among which was that of the bridegroom himself who was nigh to discover his secret by an excess of zeal it was easy to call but no one answered  can you tell me which is robert davis my little fellow the officer asked coaxingly of a fine flaxenheaded boy whose age did not exceed ten and who was a curious spectator of what passed tell me which is robert davis and i will give you a sixpence  the child knew but professed ignorance  cest un esprit de corps admirable exclaimed mademoiselle viefville for the interest of the scene had brought nearly all on board with the exception of those employed in the duty of the vessel near the gangway ceci est délicieux and i could devour that boy  what rendered this more odd or indeed absolutely ludicrous was the circumstance that by a species of legerdemain a whisper had passed among the spectators so stealthily and yet so soon that the attorney and his companion were the only two on deck who remained ignorant of the person of the man they sought even the children caught the clue though they had the art to indulge their natural curiosity by glances so sly as to escape detection  unfortunately the attorney had sufficient knowledge of the family of the bride to recognize her by a general resemblance rendered conspicuous as it was by a pallid face and an almost ungovernable nervous excitement he pointed her out to the officer who ordered her to approach hima command that caused her to burst into tears the agitation and distress of his wife were near proving too much for the prudence of the young husband who was making an impetuous movement towards her when the strong grasp of a fellowpassenger checked him in time to prevent discovery it is singular how much is understood by trifles when the mind has a clue to the subject and how often signs that are palpable as day are overlooked when suspicion is not awakened or when the thoughts have obtained a false direction the attorney and the officer were the only two present who had not seen the indiscretion of the young man and who did not believe him betrayed his wife trembled to a degree that almost destroyed the ability to stand but casting an imploring look for selfcommand on her indiscreet partner she controlled her own distress and advanced towards the officer in obedience to his order with a power of endurance that the strong affections of a woman could alone enable her to assume  if the husband will not deliver himself up i shall be compelled to order the wife to be carried ashore in his stead the attorney coldly remarked while he applied a pinch of snuff to a nose that was already saffroncoloured from the constant use of the weed  a pause succeeded this ominous declaration and the crowd of passengers betrayed dismay for all believed there was now no hope for the pursued the wife bowed her head to her knees for she had sunk on a box as if to hide the sight of her husbands arrest at this moment a voice spoke from among the group on the quarterdeck  is this an arrest for crime or a demand for debt asked the young man who has been announced as mr blunt  there was a quiet authority in the speakers manner that reassured the failing hopes of the passengers while it caused the attorney and his companion to look round in surprise and perhaps a little in resentment a dozen eager voices assured the gentleman there was no crime in the matter at allthere was even no just debt but it was a villanous scheme to compel a wronged ward to release a fraudulent guardian from his liabilities though all this was not very clearly explained it was affirmed with so much zeal and energy as to awaken suspicion and to increase the interest of the more intelligent portion of the spectators the attorney surveyed the travelling dress the appearance of fashion and the youth of his interrogator whose years could not exceed fiveandtwenty and his answer was given with an air of superiority  debt or crime it can matter nothing in the eye of the law  it matters much in the view of an honest man returned the youth with spirit one might hesitate about interfering in behalf of a rogue however ready to exert himself in favour of one who is innocent perhaps of every thing but misfortune  this looks a little like an attempt at a rescue i hope we are still in england and under the protection of english laws  no doubt at all of that mr seal put in the captain who having kept an eye on the officer from a distance now thought it time to interfere in order to protect the interests of his owners yonder is england and that is the isle of wight and the montauk has hold of an english bottom and good anchorage it is no one means to dispute your authority mr attorney nor to call in question that of the king mr blunt merely throws out a suggestion sir or rather a distinction between rogues and honest men nothing more depend on it sirmr seal mr blunt mr blunt mr seal and a thousand pities it is that a distinction is not more commonly made  the young man bowed slightly and with a face flushed partly with feeling and partly at finding himself unexpectedly conspicuous among so many strangers he advanced a little from the quarterdeck group like one who feels he is required to maintain the ground he has assumed  no one can be disposed to question the supremacy of the english laws in this roadstead he said and least of all myself but you will permit me to doubt the legality of arresting or in any manner detaining a wife in virtue of a process issued against the husband  a briefless barrister muttered seal to grab i dare say a timely guinea would have silenced the fellow what is now to be done  the lady must go ashore and all these matters can be arranged before a magistrate  ay ay let her sue out a habeas corpus if she please added the ready attorney whom a second survey caused to distrust his first inference justice is blind in england as well as in other countries and is liable to mistakes but still she is just if she does mistake sometimes she is always ready to repair the wrong  cannot you do something here eve involuntarily halfwhispered to mr sharp who stood at her elbow  this person started on hearing her voice making this sudden appeal and glancing a look of intelligence at her he smiled and moved nearer to the principal parties  really mr attorney he commenced this appears to be rather irregular i must confessquite out of the ordinary way and it may lead to unpleasant consequences  in what manner sir interrupted seal measuring the others ignorance at a glance  why irregular in form if not in principle i am aware that the habeas corpus is allessential and that the law must have its way but really this does seem a little irregular not to describe it by any harsher term  mr seal treated this new appeal respectfully in appearance at least for he saw it was made by one greatly his superior while he felt an utter contempt for it in essentials as he perceived intuitively that this new intercession was made in a profound ignorance of the subject as respects mr blunt however he had an unpleasant distrust of the result the quiet manner of that gentleman denoting more confidence in himself and a greater practical knowledge of the laws still to try the extent of the others information and the strength of his nerves he rejoined in a magisterial and menacing tone  yes let the lady sue out a writ of habeas corpus if wrongfully arrested and i should be glad to discover the foreigner who will dare to attempt a rescue in old england and in defiance of english laws  it is probable paul blunt would have relinquished his interference from an apprehension that he might be ignorantly aiding the evildoer but for this threat and even the threat might not have overcome his prudence had not he caught the imploring look of the fine blue eyes of eve  all are not necessarily foreigners who embark on board an american ship at an english port he said steadily nor is justice denied those that are the habeas corpus is as well understood in other countries as in this for happily we live in an age when neither liberty nor knowledge is exclusive if an attorney you must know yourself that you cannot legally arrest a wife for a husband and that what you say of the habeas corpus is little worthy of attention  we arrest and whoever interferes with an officer in charge of a prisoner is guilty of a rescue mistakes must be rectified by the magistrates  true provided the officer has warranty for what he does  writs and warrants may contain errors but an arrest is an arrest growled grab  not the arrest of a woman for a man in such a case there is design and not a mistake if this frightened wife will take counsel from me she will refuse to accompany you  at her peril let her dare do so  at your peril do you dare to attempt forcing her from the ship  gentlemen gentlemenlet there be no misunderstanding i pray you interposed the captain mr blunt mr grab mr grab mr blunt no warm words gentlemen i beg of you but the tide is beginning to serve mr attorney and time and tide you knowif we stay here much longer the montauk may be forced to sail on the 2d instead of the 1st as has been advertised in both hemispheres i should be sorry to carry you to sea gentlemen without your small stores and as for the cabin it is as full as a lawyers conscience no remedy but the steerage in such a caselay forward men and heave away some of you man the foretopsail halyardswe are as regular as our chronometers the 1st 10th and 20th without fail  there was some truth blended with a little poetry in captain trucks account of the matter the tide had indeed made in his favour but the little wind there was blew directly into the roadstead and had not his feelings become warmed by the distress of a pretty and interesting young woman it is more than probable the line would have incurred the disgrace of having a ship sail on a later day than had been advertised as it was however he had the matter up in earnest and he privately assured sir george and mr dodge if the affair were not immediately disposed of he should carry both the attorney and officer to sea with him and that he did not feel himself bound to furnish either with water they may catch a little rain by wringing their jackets he added with a wink though october is a dryish month in the american seas  the decision of paul blunt would have induced the attorney and his companion to relinquish their pursuit but for two circumstances they had both undertaken the job as a speculation or on the principle of no play no pay and all their trouble would be lost without success then the very difficulty that occurred had been foreseen and while the officer proceeded to the ship the uncle had been busily searching for a son on shore to send off to identify the husbanda step that would have been earlier resorted to could the young man have been found this son was a rejected suitor and he was now seen by the aid of a glass that mr grab always carried pulling towards the montauk in a twooared boat with as much zeal as malignancy and disappointment could impart his distance from the ship was still considerable but a peculiar hat with the aid of the glass left no doubt of his identity the attorney pointed out the boat to the officer and the latter after a look through the glass gave a nod of approbation exultation overcame the usual wariness of the attorney for his pride too had got to be enlisted in the success of his speculationmen being so strangely constituted as often to feel as much joy in the accomplishment of schemes that are unjustifiable as in the accomplishment of those of which they may have reason to be proud  on the other hand the passengers and people of the packet seized something near the truth with that sort of instinctive readiness which seems to characterize bodies of men in moments of excitement that the solitary boat which was pulling towards them in the dusk of the evening contained some one who might aid the attorney and his myrmidon all believed though in what manner none could tell  between all seamen and the ministers of the law there is a longstanding antipathy for the visits of the latter are usually so timed as to leave nothing between the alternatives of paying or of losing a voyage it was soon apparent then that mr seal had little to expect from the apathy of the crew for never did men work with better will to get a ship loosened from the bottom  all this feeling manifested itself in a silent and intelligent activity rather than in noise or bustle for every man on board exercised his best faculties as well as his best good will and strength the clockwork ticks of the palls of the windlass resembling those of a watch that had got the start of time while the chain came in with surges of half a fathom at each heave  lay hold of this rope men cried mr leach placing the end of the maintopsail halyards in the hands of halfadozen athletic steerage passengers who had all the inclination in the world to be doing though uncertain where to lay their hands lay hold and run away with it  the second mate performed the same feat forward and as the sheets had never been started the broad folds of the montauks canvas began to open even while the men were heaving at the anchor these exertions quickened the blood in the veins of those who were not employed until even the quarterdeck passengers began to experience the excitement of a chase in addition to the feelings of compassion captain truck was silent but very active in preparations springing to the wheel he made its spokes fly until he had forced the helm hard up when he unceremoniously gave it to john effingham to keep there his next leap was to the foot of the mizenmast where after a few energetic efforts alone he looked over his shoulder and beckoned for aid  sir george templemore mizentopsailhalyards mizentopsailhalyards sir george templemore muttered the eager master scarce knowing what he said mr dodge now is the time to show that your name and nature are not identical  in short nearly all on board were busy and thanks to the hearty good will of the officers stewards cooks and a few of the hands that could be spared from the windlass busy in a way to spread sail after sail with a rapidity little short of that seen on board of a vessel of war the rattling of the clewgarnet blocks as twenty lusty fellows ran forward with the tack of the mainsail and the hauling forward of braces was the signal that the ship was clear of ground and coming under command  a cross current had superseded the necessity of casting the vessel but her sails took the light air nearly abeam the captain understanding that motion was of much more importance just then than direction no sooner did he perceive by the bubbles that floated past or rather appeared to float past that his ship was dividing the water forward than he called a trusty man to the wheel relieving john effingham from his watch the next instant mr leach reported the anchor catted and fished  pilot you will be responsible for this if my prisoners escape said mr grab menacingly you know my errand and it is your duty to aid the ministers of the law  harkee mr grab put in the master who had warmed himself with the exercise we all know and we all do our duties on board the montauk it is your duty to take robert davis on shore if you can find him and it is my duty to take the montauk to america now if you will receive counsel from a wellwisher i would advise you to see that you do not go in her no one offers any impediment to your performing your office and ill thank you to offer me none in performing minebrace the yards further forward boys and let the ship come up to the wind  as there were logic useful information law and seamanship united in this reply the attorney began to betray uneasiness for by this time the ship had gathered so much way as to render it exceedingly doubtful whether a twooared boat would be able to come up with her without the consent of those on board it is probable as evening had already closed and the rays of the moon were beginning to quiver on the ripple of the water that he would have abandoned his object though with infinite reluctance had not sir george templemore pointed out to the captain a sixoared boat that was pulling towards them from a quarter that permitted it to be seen in the moonlight  that appears to be a manofwars cutter observed the baronet uneasily for by this time all on board felt a sort of personal interest in their escape  it does indeed captain truck added the pilot and if she make a signal it will become my duty to heaveto the montauk  then bundle out of her my fine fellow as fast as you can for not a brace or a bowline shall be touched here with my consent for any such purpose the ship is clearedmy hour is comemy passengers are on boardand america is my havenlet them that want me catch me that is what i call vattel  the pilot and the master of the montauk were excellent friends and understood each other perfectly even while the former was making the most serious professions of duty the beat was hauled up and first whispering a few cautions about the shoals and the currents the worthy marine guide leaped into it and was soon seen floating asterna cheering proof that the ship had got fairly in motion as he fell out of hearing in the wake of the vessel the honest fellow kept calling out to tack in season  if you wish to try the speed of your boat against that of the pilot mr grab called out the captain you will never have a better opportunity it is a fine night for a regatta and i will stand you a pound on mr handleads heels for that matter i would as soon trust his head or his hands in the bargain  the officer continued obstinately on board for he saw that the sixoared boat was coming up with the ship and as he well knew the importance to his client of compelling a settlement of the accounts he fancied some succour might be expected in that quarter in the mean time this new movement on the part of their pursuers attracted general attention and as might be expected the interest of this little incident increased the excitement that usually accompanies a departure for a long seavoyage fourfold men and women forgot their griefs and leavetakings in anxiety and in that pleasure which usually attends agitation of the mind that does not proceed from actual misery of our own     chapter iv      whither away so fast                 o god save you   even to the hall to hear what shall become   of the great duke of buckingham    henry viii   the assembling of the passengers of the large packetship is necessarily an affair of coldness and distrust especially with those who know the world and more particularly still when the passage is from europe to america the greater sophistication of the old than of the new hemisphere with its consequent shifts and vices the knowledge that the tide of emigration sets westward and that few abandon the home of their youth unless impelled by misfortune at least with other obvious causes unite to produce this distinction then come the fastidiousness of habits the sentiments of social castes the refinements of breeding and the reserves of dignity of character to be put in close collision with bustling egotism ignorance of usages an absence of training and downright vulgarity of thought and practices although necessity soon brings these chaotic elements into something like order the first week commonly passes in reconnoitring cool civilities and cautious concessions to yield at length to the neverdying charities unless indeed the latter may happen to be kept in abeyance by a downright quarrel about midnight carousals a squeaking fiddle or some incorrigible snorer  happily the party collected in the montauk had the good fortune to abridge the usual probation in courtesies by the stirring events of the night on which they sailed two hours had scarcely elapsed since the last passenger crossed the gangway and yet the respective circles of the quarterdeck and steerage felt more sympathy with each other than the boasted human charities ordinarily quicken in days of commonplace intercourse they had already found out each others names thanks to the assiduity of captain truck who had stolen time in the midst of all his activity to make halfadozen more introductions and the americans of the less trained class were already using them as freely as if they were old acquaintances we say americans for the cabins of these ships usually contain a congress of nations though the people of england and of her cidevant colonies of course predominate in those of the london lines on the present occasion the last two were nearly balanced in numbers so far as national character could be made out opinion which as might be expected had been busy the while being suspended in reference to mr blunt and one or two others whom the captain called foreigners to distinguish them from the anglosaxon stock  this equal distribution of forces might under other circumstances have led to a division in feeling for the conflicts between american and british opinions coupled with a difference in habits are a prolific source of discontent in the cabins of packets the american is apt to fancy himself at home under the flag of his country while his transatlantic kinsman is strongly addicted to fancying that when he has fairly paid his money he has a right to embark all his prejudices with his other luggage  the affair of the attorney and the newlymarried couple however was kept quite distinct from all feelings of nationality the english apparently entertaining quite as lively a wish that the latter might escape from the fangs of the law as any other portion of the passengers the parties themselves were british and although the authority evaded was of the same origin right or wrong all on board had taken up the impression that it was improperly exercised sir george templemore the englishman of highest rank was decidedly of this way of thinkingan opinion he was rather warm in expressingand the example of a baronet had its weight not only with most of his own countrymen but with not a few of the americans also the effingham party together with mr sharp and mr blunt were indeed all who seemed to be entirely indifferent to sir georges sentiments and as men are intuitively quick in discovering who do and who do not defer to their suggestions their accidental independence might have been favoured by this fact for the discourse of this gentleman was addressed in the main to those who lent the most willing ears mr dodge in particular was his constant and respectful listener and profound admirerbut then he was his roommate and a democrat of a water so pure that he was disposed to maintain no man had a right to any one of his senses unless by popular sufferance  in the mean while the night advanced and the soft light of the moon was playing on the waters adding a semimysterious obscurity to the excitement of the scene the twooared boat had evidently been overtaken by that carrying six oars and after a short conference the first had returned reluctantly towards the land while the latter profiting by its position had set two lugsails and was standing out into the offing on a course that would compel the montauk to come under its lee when the shoals as would soon be the case should force the ship to tack  england is most inconveniently placed captain truck dryly remarked as he witnessed this manoeuvre were this island only out of the way now we might stand on as we head and leave those manofwars men to amuse themselves all night with backing and filling in the roads of portsmouth  i hope there is no danger of that little boats overtaking this large ship exclaimed sir george with a vivacity that did great credit to his philanthropy according to the opinion of mr dodge at least the latter having imbibed a singular bias in favour of persons of condition from having travelled in an eilwagen with a german baron from whom he had taken a model of the pipe he carried but never smoked and from having been thrown for two days and nights into the society of a polish countess as he uniformly termed her in the gondole of a diligence between lyons and marseilles in addition mr dodge as has just been hinted was an ultrafreeman at homea circumstance that seems always to react when the subject of the feeling gets into foreign countries  a feather running before a ladys sigh would outsail either of us in this air which breathes on us in some such fashion as a whale snores sir george by sudden puffs i would give the price of a steerage passage if great britain lay off the cape of good hope for a week or ten days  or cape hatteras rejoined the mate  not i i wish the old island no harm nor a worse climate than it has got already though it lies as much in our way just at this moment as the moon in an eclipse of the sun i bear the old creature a greatgrandsons loveor a step or two farther off if you willand come and go too often to forget the relationship but much as i love her the affection is not strong enough to go ashore on her shoals and so we will go about mr leach at the same time i wish from my heart that twolugged rascal would go about his business  the ship tacked slowly but gracefully for she was in what her master termed racing trim and as her bows fell off to the eastward it became pretty evident to all who understood the subject that the two little lugsails that were eating into the wind as the sailors express it would weather upon her track ere she could stretch over to the other shoal even the landsmen had some feverish suspicions of the truth and the steerage passengers were already holding a secret conference on the possibility of hiding the pursued in some of the recesses of the ship such things were often done one whispered to another and it was as easy to perform it now as at any other time  but captain truck viewed the matter differently his vocation called him three times a year into the roads at portsmouth and he felt little disposition to embarrass his future intercourse with the place by setting its authorities at a too open defiance he deliberated a good deal on the propriety of throwing his ship up into the wind as she slowly advanced towards the boat and of inviting those in the latter to board him opposed to this was the pride of profession and jack truck was not a man to overlook or to forget the yarns that were spun among his fellows at the new england coffeehouse or among those farming hamlets on the banks of the connecticut whence all the packetmen are derived and whither they repair for a shelter when their careers are run as regularly as the fruit decays where it falleth or the grass that has not been harvested or cropped withers on its native stalk  there is no question sir george that this fellow is a manofwars man said the master to the baronet who stuck close to his side take a peep at the creeping rogue through this nightglass and you will see his crew seated at their thwarts with their arms folded like men who eat the kings beef none but your regular public servant ever gets that impudent air of idleness about him either in england or america in this respect human nature is the same in both hemispheres a man never falling in with luck but he fancies it is no more than his deserts  there seems to be a great many of them can it be their intention to carry the vessel by boarding  if it is they must take the will for the deed returned mr truck a little coldly i very much question if the montauk with three cabin officers as many stewards two cooks and eighteen foremastmen would exactly like the notion of being carried as you style it sir george by a sixoared cutters crew we are not as heavy as the planet jupiter but have somewhat too much gravity to be carried as lightly as all that too  you intend then to resist asked sir george whose generous zeal in behalf of the pursued apparently led him to take a stronger interest in their escape than any other person on board  captain truck who had never an objection to sport pondered with himself a little smiled and then loudly expressed a wish that he had a member of congress or a member of parliament on board  your desire is a little extraordinary for the circumstances observed mr sharp will you have the goodness to explain why  this matter touches on international law gentlemen continued the master rubbing his hands for in addition to having caught the art of introduction the honest mariner had taken it into his head he had become an adept in the principles of vattel of whom he possessed a wellthumbed copy and for whose dogmas he entertained the deference that they who begin to learn late usually feel for the particular master into whose hands they have accidentally fallen under what circumstances or in what category can a public armed ship compel a neutral to submit to being boardednot carried sir george you will please to remark for d me if any man carries the montauk that is not strong enough to carry her crew and cargo along with herbut in what category now is a packet like this i have the honour to command obliged in comity to heaveto and to submit to an examination at all the ship is aweigh and has handsomely tacked under her canvas and gentlemen i should be pleased to have your sentiments on the occasion just have the condescension to point out the category  mr dodge came from a part of the country in which men were accustomed to think act almost to eat and drink and sleep in common or in other words from one of those regions in america in which there was so much community that few had the moral courage even when they possessed the knowledge and all the other necessary means to cause their individuality to be respected when the usual process of conventions subconventions caucusses and public meetings did not supply the means of a concentrated action he and his neighbours had long been in the habit of having recourse to societies by way of obtaining energetic means as it was termed and from his tenth year up to his twentyfifth this gentleman had been either a president vicepresident manager or committeeman of some philosophical political or religious expedient to fortify human wisdom make men better and resist error and despotism his experience had rendered him expert in what may well enough be termed the language of association no man of his years in the twentysix states could more readily apply the terms of taking upexcitementunqualified hostilitypublic opinionspreading before the public or any other of those generic phrases that imply the privileges of all and the rights of none unfortunately the pronunciation of this person was not as pure as his motives and he misunderstood the captain when he spoke of comity as meaning a committee and although it was not quite obvious what the worthy mariner could intend by obliged in committee comity to heaveto yet as he had known these bodies to do so many energetic things he did not see why they might not perform this evolution as well as another  it really does appear captain truck he remarked accordingly that our situation approaches a crisis and the suggestion of a comity committee strikes me as being peculiarly proper and suitable to the circumstances and in strict conformity with republican usages in order to save time and that the gentlemen who shall be appointed to serve may have opportunity to report therefore i will at once nominate sir george templemore as chairman leaving it for any other gentleman present to suggest the name of any candidate he may deem proper i will only add that in my poor judgment this comity committee ought to consist of at least three and that it have power to send for persons and papers  i would propose five captain truck by way of amendment added another passenger of the same kidney as the last speaker gentlemen of their school making it a point to differ a little from every proposition by way of showing their independence  it was fortunate for both the mover of the original motion and for the proposer of the amendment that the master was acquainted with the character of mr dodge or a proposition that his ship was to be worked by a committee or indeed by comity would have been very likely to meet with but an indifferent reception but catching a glimpse of the laughing eyes of eve as well as of the amused faces of mr sharp and mr blunt by the light of the moon he very gravely signified his entire approbation of the chairman named and his perfect readiness to listen to the report of the aforesaid committee as soon as it might be prepared to make it  and if your committee or comity gentlemen he added can tell me what vattel would say about the obligation to heaveto in a time of profound peace and when the ship or boat in chase can have no belligerent rights i shall be grateful to my dying day for i have looked him through as closely as old women usually examine almanacks to tell which way the wind is about to blow and i fear he has overlooked the subject altogether  mr dodge and three or four more of the same communitypropensity as himself soon settled the names of the rest of the committee when the nominees retired to another part of the deck to consult together sir george templemore to the surprise of all the effingham party consenting to serve with a willingness that rather disregarded forms  it might be convenient to refer other matters to this committee captain said mr sharp who had tact enough to see that nothing but her habitual retenue of deportment kept eve whose bright eyes were dancing with humour from downright laughter these are the important points of reefing and furling the courses to be steered the sail to be carried the times and seasons of calling all hands together with sundry other customary duties that no doubt would be well treated on in this forthcoming report  no doubt sir i perceive you have been at sea before and i am sorry you were overlooked in naming the members of the comity take my word for it all that you have mentioned can be done on board the montauk by a comity as well as settling the question of heavingto or not for yonder boatby the way mr leach the fellows have tacked and are standing in this direction thinking to cross our bows and speak usmr attorney the tide is setting us off the land and you may make it morning before you get into your nests if you hold on much longer i fear mrs seal and mrs grab will be unhappy women  the bloodhounds of the law heard this warning with indifference for they expected succour of some sort though they hardly knew of what sort from the manofwars boat which it was now plain enough must weather on the ship after putting their heads together mr seal offered his companion a pinch of snuff helping himself afterwards like a man indifferent to the result and one patient in time of duty the sunburnt face of the captain whose standing colour was that which cooks get when the fire burns the brightest but whose hues no fire or cold ever varied was turned fully on the two and it is probable they would have received some decided manifestation of his will had not sir george templemore with the four other committeemen approached to give in the result of their conference  we are of opinion captain truck said the baronet that as the ship is under way and your voyage may be fairly said to have commenced it is quite inexpedient and altogether unnecessary for you to anchor again but that it is your duty  i have no occasion for advice as to my duty gentlemen if you can let me know what vattel says or ought to have said on the subject or touching the category of the right of search except as a belligerent right i will thank you if not we must een guess at it i have not sailed a ship in this trade these ten years to need any jogging of the memory about portjurisdiction either for these are matters in which one gets to be expert by dint of use as my old master used to say when he called us from table with half a dinner now there was the case of the blacks in charleston in which our government showed clearly it had not studied vattel or it never would have given the answer it did perhaps you never heard that case sir george and as it touches a delicate principle i will just run over the category lightly for it has its points as well as a coast  does not this matter pressmay not the boat  the boat will do nothing gentlemen without the permission of jack truck you must know the carolinians have a law that all niggers brought into their state by ships must be caged until the vessel sails again this is to prevent emancipation as they call it or abolition i know not which an englishman comes in from the islands with a crew of blacks and according to law the authorities of charleston house them all before night john bull complains to his minister and his minister sends a note to our secretary and our secretary writes to the governor of carolina calling on him to respect the treaty and so on gentlemen i need not tell you what a treaty isit is a thing in itself to be obeyed but it is all important to know what it commands well what was this said treaty that john should come in and out of the ports on the footing of the most favoured nation on the statu quo ante bellum principle as vattel has it now the carolinians treated john just as they treated jonathan and there was no more to be said all parties were bound to enter the port subject to the municipals as is set forth in vattel that was a case soon settled you perceive though depending on a nicety  sir george had listened with extreme impatience but fearful of offending he listened to the end then seizing the first pause in the captains discourse he resumed his remonstrances with an interest that did infinite credit to his humanity at the same time that he overlooked none of the obligations of politeness  an exceedingly clear case i protest he answered and capitally puti question if lord stowell could do it betterand exceedingly apt that about the ante bellum but i confess my feelings have not been so much roused for a long time as they have been on account of these poor people there is something inexpressibly painful in being disappointed as one is setting out in the morning of life as it were in this cruel manner and rather than see this state of things protracted i would prefer paying a trifle out of my own pocket if this wretched attorney will consent now to take a hundred pounds and quit us and carry back with him that annoying cutter with the lugsails i will give him the money most cheerfullymost cheerfully i protest  there is something so essentially respectable in practical generosity that though eve and all the curious auditors of what was massing felt an inclination to laugh at the whole procedure up to this declaration eye met eye in commendation of the liberality of the baronet he had shown he had a heart in the opinion of most of those who heard him though his previous conversation had led several of the observers to distrust his having the usual quantum of head  give yourself no trouble about the attorney sir george returned the captain shaking the other cordially by the hand he shall not touch a pound of your money nor do i think he is likely to touch robert davis we have caught the tide on our lee bow and the current is wheeling us up to windward like an opposition coach flying over blackheath in a few minutes we shall be in blue water and then ill give the rascal a touch of vattel that will throw him all aback if it dont throw him overboard  but the cutter  why if we drive the attorney and grab out of the ship there will be no process in the hands of the others by which they can carry off the man even admitting the jurisdiction i know the scoundrels and not a shilling shall either of the knaves take from this vessel with my consent harkee sir george a word in your ear two of as dd cockroaches as ever rummaged a ships breadroom ill see that they soon heave about or ill heave them both into their boat with my own fair hands  the captain was about to turn away to examine the position of the cutter when mr dodge asked permission to make a short report in behalf of the minority of the comity committee the amount of which was that they agreed in all things with the majority except on the point that as it might become expedient for the ship to anchor again in some of the ports lower down the channel it would be wise to keep that material circumstance in view in making up a final decision in the affair this report on the part of the minority which mr dodge explained to the baronet partook rather of the character of a caution than of a protest had quite as little influence on captain truck as the opinion of the majority for he was just one of those persons who seldom took advice that did not conform with his own previous decision but he coolly continued to examine the cutter which by this time was standing on the same course as the ship a short distance to windward of her and edging a little off the wind so as to bring the two nearer to each other every yard they advanced  the wind had freshened to a little breeze and the captain nodded his head with satisfaction when he heard even where he stood on the quarterdeck the slapping of the sluggish swell as the huge bows of the ship parted the water at this moment those in the cutter saw the bubbles glide swiftly past them while to those in the montauk the motion was still slow and heavy and yet of the two the actual velocity was rather in favour of the latter both having about what is technically termed fourknot way on them the officer of the boat was quick to detect the change that was acting against him and by easing the sheets of his lugsails and keeping the cutter as much off the wind as he could he was soon within a hundred feet of the ship running along on her weatherbeam the bright soft moonlight permitted the face of a young man in a manofwar cap who wore the undress uniform of a sea lieutenant to be distinctly seen as he rose in the sternsheets which contained also two other persons  i will thank you to heaveto the montauk said the lieutenant civilly while he raised his cap apparently in compliment to the passengers who crowded the rail to see and hear what passed i am sent on the duty of the king sir  i know your errand sir returned captain truck whose resolution to refuse to comply was a good deal shaken by the gentlemanlike manner in which the request was made and i wish you to bear witness that if i do consent to your request it is voluntarily for on the principles laid down by vattel and the other writers on international law the right of search is a belligerent right and england being at peace no ship belonging to one nation can have a right to stop a vessel belonging to another  i cannot enter into these niceties sir returned the lieutenant sharply i have my orders and you will excuse me if i say i intend to execute them  execute them with all my heart sir if you are ordered to heaveto my ship all you have to do is to get on board if you can and let us see the style in which you handle yards as to the people now stationed at the braces the trumpet that will make them stir is not to be spoken through at the admiralty the fellow has spirit in him and i like his principles as an officer but i cannot admit his conclusions as a jurist if he flatters himself with being able to frighten us into a new category now that is likely to impair national rights the lad has just got himself into a problem that will need all his logic and a good deal of his spirit to get out of again  you will scarcely think of resisting a kings officer in british waters said the young man with that haughtiness that the meekest tempers soon learn to acquire under a pennant  resisting my dear sir i resist nothing the misconception is in supposing that you sail this ship instead of john truck that is my name sir john truck do your errand in welcome but do not ask me to help you come aboard with all my heart nothing would give me more pleasure than to take wine with you but i see no necessity of stopping a packet that is busy on a long road without an object as we say on the other side of the big waters  there was a pause and then the lieutenant with the sort of hesitation that a gentleman is apt to feel when he makes a proposal that he knows ought not to be accepted called out that those in the boat with him would pay for the detention of the ship a more unfortunate proposition could not be made to captain truck who would have hoveto his ship in a moment had the lieutenant proposed to discuss vattel with him on the quarterdeck and who was only holding out as a sort of salve to his rights with that disposition to resist aggression that the experience of the last forty years has so deeply implanted in the bosom of every american sailor in cases connected with english naval officers and who had just made up his mind to let robert davis take his chance and to crack a bottle with the handsome young man who was still standing up in the boat but mr truck had been too often to london not to understand exactly the manner in which englishmen appreciate american character and among other things he knew it was the general opinion in the island that money could do any thing with jonathan or as christophe is said once to have sententiously expressed the same sentiment if there were a bag of coffee in h a yankee could be found to go and bring it out  the master of the montauk had a proper relish for his lawful gains as well as another but he was vainglorious on the subject of his countrymen principally because he found that the packets outsailed all other merchantships and fiercely proud of any quality that others were disposed to deny them  at hearing this proposal or intimation therefore instead of accepting it captain truck raised his hat with formal civility and coolly wished the other good night this was bringing the affair to a crisis at once for the helm of the cutter was borne up and an attempt was made to run the boat alongside of the ship but the breeze had been steadily increasing the air had grown heavier as the night advanced and the dampness of evening was thickening the canvas of the coarser sails in a way sensibly to increase the speed of the ship when the conversation commenced the boat was abreast of the forerigging and by the time it ended it was barely up with the mizzen the lieutenant was quick to see the disadvantage he laboured under and he called out heave as he found the cutter was falling close under the counter of the ship and would be in her wake in another minute the bowman of the boat cast a light grapnel with so much precision that it hooked in the mizzen rigging and the line instantly tightened so as to tow the cutter a seaman was passing along the outer edge of the hurricanehouse at the moment coming from the wheel and with the decision of an old salt he quietly passed his knife across the stretched cordage and it snapped like packthread the grapnel fell into the sea and the boat was lossing in the wake of the ship all as it might be while one could draw a breath to furl the sails and ship the oars consumed but an instant and then the cutter was ploughing the water under the vigorous strokes of her crew  spirited spirited and nimble observed captain truck who stood coolly leaning against a shroud in a position where he could command a view of all that was passing improving the opportunity to shake the ashes from his cigar while he spoke a fine young fellow and one who will make an admiral or something better i dare say if he liveperhaps a cherub in time now if he pull much longer in the backwater of our wake i shall have to give him up leach as a little marinish ah there he sheers out of it like a sensible youth as he is well there is something pleasant in the conceit of a sixoared boats carrying a london liner by boarding even admitting the lad could have got alongside  so it would seem thought mr leach and the crew of the montauk for they were clearing the decks with as much philosophy as men ever discover when employed in an unthankful office this sangfroid of seamen is always matter of surprise to landsmen but adventurers who have been rocked in the tempest for years whose utmost security is a great hazard and whose safety constantly depends on the command of the faculties come in time to experience an apathy on the subject of all the minor terrors and excitements of life that none can acquire unless by habit and similar risks there was a low laugh among the people and now and then a curious glance of the eye over the quarter to ascertain the position of the struggling boat but there the effect of the little incident ceased so far as the seamen were concerned  not so with the passengers the americans exulted at the failure of the manofwars man and the english doubted to them deference to the crown was habitual and they were displeased at seeing a stranger play a kings boat such a trick in what they justly enough thought to be british waters although the law may not give a man any more right than another to the road before his own door he comes in time to fancy it in a certain degree his particular road strictly speaking the montauk was perhaps still under the dominion of the english laws though she had been a league from the land when laying at her anchor and by this time the tide and her own velocity had swept her broad off into the offing quite as far again indeed she had now got to such a distance from the land that captain truck thought it his duty to bring matters to a conclusion with the attorney  well mr seal he said i am grateful for the pleasure of your company thus far but you will excuse me if i decline taking you and mr grab quite to america half an hour hence you will hardly be able to find the island for as soon as we have got to a proper distance from the cutter i shall tack to the southwest and you ought moreover to remember the anxiety of the ladies at home  this may turn out a serious matter captain truck on your return passage the laws of england are not to be trifled with will you oblige me by ordering the steward to hand me a glass of water waiting for justice is dry duty i find  extremely sorry i cannot comply gentlemen vattel has nothing on the subject of watering belligerents or neutrals and the laws of congress compel me to carry so many gallons to the man if you will take it in the way of a nightcap however and drink success to our run to america and your own to the shore it shall be in champagne if you happen to like that agreeable fluid  the attorney was about to express his readiness to compromise on these terms when a glass of the beverage for which he had first asked was put into his hand by the wife of robert davis he took the water drank it and turned from the woman with the obduracy of one who never suffered feeling to divert him from the pursuit of gain the wine was brought and the captain filled the glasses with a seamans heartiness  i drink to your safe return to mrs seal and the little gods and goddesses of justicepan or mercury which is it and as for you grab look out for sharks as you pull in if they hear of your being afloat the souls of persecuted sailors will set them on you as the devil chases male coquettes well gentlemen you are balked this time but what matters it it is but another man got safe out of a country that has too many in it and i trust we shall meet good friends again this day four months even man and wife must part when the hour arrives  that will depend on how my client views your conduct on this occasion captain truck for he is not a man that it is always safe to thwart  that for your client mr seal returned the captain snapping his fingers i am not to be frightened with an attorneys growl or a bailiffs nod you come off with a writ or a warrant i care not which i offer no resistance you hunt for your man like a terrier looking for a rat and cant find him i see the fine fellow at this moment on deckbut i feel no obligation to tell you who or where he is my ship is cleared and i sail and you have no power to stop me we are outside of all the headlands good two leagues and a half off and some writers say that a gunshot is the extent of your jurisdiction once out of which your authority is not worth half as much as that of my chief cook who has power to make his mate clean the coppers well sir you stay here ten minutes longer and we shall be fully three leagues from your nearest land and then you are in america according to law and a quick passage you will have made of it now that is what i call a category  as the captain made this last remark his quick eye saw that the wind had hauled so far round to the westward as to supersede the necessity of tacking and that they were actually going eight knots in a direct line from portsmouth casting an eye behind him he perceived that the cutter had given up the chase and was returning towards the distant roads under circumstances so discouraging the attorney who began to be alarmed for his boat which was flying along on the water towed by the ship prepared to take his leave for he was fully aware that he had no power to compel the other to heaveto his ship to enable him to get out of her luckily the water was still tolerably smooth and with fear and trembling mr seal succeeded in blundering into the boat not however until the watermen had warned him of their intention to hold on no longer mr grab followed with a good deal of difficulty and just as a hand was about to let go the painter the captain appeared at the gangway with the man they were in quest of and said in his most winning manner  mr grab mr davis mr davis mr grab i seldom introduce steerage passengers but to oblige two old friends i break the rule thats what i call a category my compliments to mrs grab let go the painter  the words were no sooner uttered than the boat was tossing and whirling in the caldron left by the passing ship     chapter v      what country mends is this                    illyria lady    twelfth night   captain truck cast an eye aloft to see if everything drew as coolly as if nothing out of the usual course had happened he and his crew having seemingly regarded the attempt to board them as men regard the natural phenomena of the planets or in other words as if the ship of which they were merely parts had escaped by her own instinct or volition this habit of considering the machine as the governing principle is rather general among seamen who while they ease a brace or drag a bowline as the coachman checks a rein appear to think it is only permitting the creature to work her own will a little more freely it is true all know better but none talk or indeed would seem to feel as if they thought otherwise  did you observe how the old barky jumped out of the way of those rovers in the cutter said the captain complacently to the quarterdeck group when his survey aloft had taken sufficient heed that his own nautical skill should correct the instinct of the ship a skittish horse or a whale with the irons in him or for that matter one of the funniest of your theatricals would not have given a prettier aside than this poor old hulk which is certainly just the clumsiest craft that sails the ocean i wish king william would take it into his royal head now to send one of his lightheeled cruisers out to prove it by way of resenting the cantaverous trick the montauk played his boat  the dull report of a gun as the sound came short and deadened up against the breeze checked the raillery of mr truck on looking to leeward there was sufficient light to see the symmetrical sails of the corvette they had left at anchor trimmed close by the wind and the vessel itself standing out under a press of canvas apparently in chase the gun had evidently been fired as a signal of recall to the cutter blue lights being burnt on board of both the ship and its boat in proof that they were communicating  the passengers now looked gravely at each other for the matter in their eyes began to be serious some suggested the possibility that the offence of davis might be other than debt but this was disproved by the process and the account of the bailiff himself while most concluded that a determination to resent the slight done the authorities had caused the cruiser to follow them out with the intention of carrying them back again the english passengers in particular began now to reason in favour of the authority of the crown while those who were known to be americans grew warm in maintaining the rights of their flag both the effinghams however were moderate in the expression of their opinions for education years and experience had taught them to discriminate justly  as respects the course of captain truck in refusing to permit the cutter to board him he is probably a better judge than any of us mr effingham observed with gentlemanly reservefor he must better understand the precise position of his ship at the time but concerning the want of right in a foreign vessel of war to carry this ship into port in a time of profound peace when sailing on the high seas as will soon be the case with the montaukadmitting that she is not there at presenti should think there can be no reasonable doubt the dispute if there is to be any has now to become matter of negotiation or redress must be sought through the general agents of the two nations and not taken by the inferior officers of either party the instant montauk reaches the public highway of nations she is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the country under whose flag she legally sails  vattel to the backbone said the captain giving a nod of approbation again clearing the end of his cigar  now john effingham was a man of strong feelings which is often but another word for a man of strong prejudices and he had been educated between thirty or forty years before which is saying virtually that he was educated under the influence of the british opinions that then weighed and many of which still weigh like an incubus on the national interests of america it is true mr effingham was in all senses the contemporary as he had been the schoolfellow of his cousin that they loved each other as brothers had the utmost reliance on each others principles in the main thought alike in a thousand things and yet in the particular of english domination it was scarcely possible for one man to resemble another less than the widowed kinsman resembled the bachelor  edward effingham was a singularly justminded man and having succeeded at an early age to his estate he had lived many years in that intellectual retirement which by withdrawing him from the strifes of the world had left a cultivated sagacity to act freely on a natural disposition at the period when the entire republic was in substance exhibiting the disgraceful picture of a nation torn by adverse factions that had their origin in interests alien to its own when most were either englishmen or frenchmen he had remained what nature the laws and reason intended him to be an american enjoying the otium cum dignitate on his hereditary estate and in his hereditary abode edward effingham with little pretensions to greatness and with many claims to goodness had hit the line of truth which so many of the godlikes of the republic under the influence of their passions and stimulated by the transient and fluctuating interests of the day entirely overlooked or which if seeing they recklessly disregarded a less impracticable subject for excitementthe primum mobile of all american patriotism and activity if we are to believe the theories of the timescould not be found than this gentleman independence of situation had induced independence of thought study and investigation rendered him original and just by simply exempting him from the influence of the passions and while hundreds were keener abler in the exposition of subtleties or more imposing with the mass few were as often right and none of less selfishness than this simpleminded and upright gentleman he loved his native land while he saw and regretted its weaknesses was its firm and consistent advocate abroad without becoming its interested or mawkish flatterer at home and at all times and in all situations manifested that his heart was where it ought to be  in many essentials john effingham was the converse of all this of an intellect much more acute and vigorous than that of his cousin he also possessed passions less under control a will more stubborn and prejudices that often neutralized his reason his father had inherited most of the personal property of the family and with this he had plunged into the vortex of monied speculation that succeeded the adoption of the new constitution and verifying the truth of the sacred saying that where treasure is there will the heart be also he had entered warmly and blindly into all the factious and irreconcilable principles of party if such a word can properly be applied to rules of conduct that bary with the interests of the day and had adopted the current errors with which faction unavoidably poisons the mind  america was then much too young in her independence and too insignificant in all eyes but her own to reason and act for herself except on points that pressed too obviously on her immediate concerns to be overlooked but the great social principlesor it might be better to say the great social intereststhat then distracted europe produced quite as much sensation in that distant country as at all comported with a state of things that had so little practical connexion with the result the effingham family had started federalists in the true meaning of the term for their education native sense and principles had a leaning to order good government and the dignity of the country but as factions became fiercer and names got to be confounded and contradictory the landed branch settled down into what they thought were american and the commercial branch into what might properly be termed english federalists we do not mean that the father of john intended to be untrue to his native land but by following up the dogmas of party he had reasoned himself into a set of maxims which if they meant anything meant everything but that which had been solemnly adopted as the governing principles of his own country and many of which were diametrically opposed to both its interests and its honour  john effingham had insensibly imbibed the sentiments of his particular sect though the large fortune inherited from his father had left him too independent to pursue the sinuous policy of trade he had permitted temperament to act on prejudice to such an extent that he vindicated the right of england to force men from under the american flag a doctrine that his cousin was too simpleminded and clearheaded ever to entertain for an instant and he was singularly ingenious in discovering blunders in all the acts of the republic when they conflicted with the policy of great britain in short his talents were necessary perhaps to reconcile so much sophistry or to render that reasonably plausible that was so fundamentally false after the peace of 1815 john effingham went abroad for the second time and he hurried through england with the eagerness of strong affection an affection that owed its existence even more to opposition than to settled notions of truth or to natural ties the result was disappointment as happens nineteen times in twenty and this solely because in the zeal of a partisan he had fancied theories and imagined results like the english radical who rushes into america with a mind unsettled by impracticable dogmas he experienced a reaction and this chiefly because he found that men were not superior to nature and discovered so late in the day what he might have known at starting that particular causes must produce particular effects from this time john effingham became a wiser and a more moderate man though as the shock had not been sufficiently violent to throw him backward on truth or rather upon the opposing prejudices of another sect the remains of the old notions were still to be discovered lingering in his opinions and throwing a species of twilight shading over his mind as in nature the hues of evening and the shadows of the morning follow or precede the light of the sun  under the influence of these latent prejudices then john effingham replied to the remarks of his cousin and the discourse soon partook of the discursive character of all arguments in which the parties are not singularly clearheaded and free from any other bias than that of truth nearly all joined in it and half an hour was soon passed in settling the law of nations and the particular merits or demerits of the instance before them  it was a lovely night and mademoiselle viefville and eve walked the deck for exercise the smoothness of the water rendering the moment every way favourable as has been already said the common feeling in the escape of the newmarried couple had broken the ice and less restraint existed between the passengers at the moment when mr grab left the ship than would have been the case at the end of a week under ordinary circumstances eve effingham had passed her time since her eleventh year principally on the continent of europe and in the mixed intercourse that is common to strangers in that part of the world or in other words equally without the severe restraint that is usually imposed there on the young of her own sex or without the extreme license that is granted to them at home she came of a family too well toned to run into the extravagant freedoms that sometimes pass for easy manners in america had she never quitted her fathers house even but her associations abroad had unavoidably imparted greater reserve to her ordinary deportment than the simplicity of cisatlantic usages would have rendered indispensable in the most fastidious circles with the usual womanly reserves she was natural and unembarrassed in her intercourse with the world and she had been allowed to see so many different nations that she had obtained a selfconfidence that did her no injury under the influence of an exemplary education and great natural dignity of mind still mademoiselle viefville notwithstanding she had lost some of her own peculiar notions on the subject by having passed so many years in an american family was a little surprised at observing that eve received the respectful advances of mr sharp and mr blunt with less reserve than it was usual to her to manifest to entire strangers instead of remaining a mere listener she answered several remarks of the first and once or twice she even laughed with him openly at some absurdity of the committee of five the cautious governess wondered but half disposed to fancy that there was no more than the necessary freedom of a ship in it allfor like a true frenchwoman mademoiselle viefville had very vague notions of the secrets of the mighty deepshe permitted it to pass confiding in the longtried taste and discretion of her charge while mr sharp discoursed with eve who held her arm the while she herself had fallen into an animated conversation with mr blunt who walked at her side and who spoke her own language so well that she at first set him down as a countryman travelling under an english appellation as a nom de guerre while this dialogue was at its height of interestfor paul blunt discoursed with his companion of paris and its excellencies with a skill that soon absorbed all her attention paris ce magnifique paris having almost as much influence on the happiness of the governess as it was said to have had on that of madame de stael eves companion dropped his voice to a tone that was rather confidential for a stranger although it was perfectly respectful and said  i have flattered myself perhaps through the influence of selflove alone that miss effingham has not so far forgotten all whom she has met in her travels as to think me an utter stranger  certainly not returned eve with perfect simplicity and composure else would one of my faculties that of memory be perfectly useless i knew you at a glance and consider the worthy captains introduction as so much finesse of breeding utterly thrown away  i am equally gratified and vexed at all this gratified and infinitely flattered to find that i have not passed before your eyes like the common herd who leave no traces of even their features behind them and vexed at finding myself in a situation that i fear you fancy excessively ridiculous  oh one hardly dare to attach such consequences to acts of young men or young women either in an age as original as our own i saw nothing particularly absurd but the introductionand so many absurder have since passed that this is almost forgotten  and the name  is certainly a keen one if i am not mistaken when we were in italy you were content to let your servant bear it but venturing among a people so noted for sagacity as the yankees i suppose you have fancied it was necessary to go armed capápié  both laughed lightly as if they equally enjoyed the pleasantry and then he resumed  but i sincerely hope you do not impute improper motives to the incognito  i impute it to that which makes many young men run from rome to vienna or from vienna to paris which causes you to sell the visavis to buy a dormeuse to know your friends today and to forget them tomorrow or in short to do a hundred other things that can be accounted for on no other motive  and this motive  is simply caprice  i wish i could persuade you to ascribe some better reason to all my conduct can you think of nothing in the present instance less discreditable  perhaps i can eve answered after a moment of thought then laughing lightly again she added quickly but i fear in exonerating you from the charge of unmitigated caprice i shall ascribe a reason that does little less credit to your knowledge  this will appear in the end does mademoiselle viefville remember me do you fancy  it is impossible she was ill you will remember the three months we saw so much of you  and your father miss effinghamam i really forgotten by him  i am quite certain you are not he never forgets a face whatever in this instance may have befallen the name  he received me so coldly and so much like a total stranger  he is too wellbred to recognise a man who wishes to be unknown or to indulge in exclamations of surprise or in dramatic starts he is more stable than a girl moreover and may feel less indulgence to caprice  i feel obliged to his reserve for exposure would be ridiculous and so long as you and he alone know me i shall feel less awkward in the ship i am certain neither will betray me  betray  betray discover annihilate me if you will anything is preferable to ridicule  this touches a little on the caprice but you flatter yourself with too much security you are known to one more besides my father myself and the honest man whom you have robbed of all his astuteness which i believe was in his name  for pitys sake who can it be  the worthy nanny sidley my whilom nurse and actual femme de chambre no ogre was ever more vigilant on his ward than the faithful nanny and it is vain to suppose she does not recall your features  but ogres sometimes sleep recollect how many have been overcome in that situation  eve smiled but shook her head she was about to assure mr sharp of the vanity of his belief when an exclamation from her governess diverted the attention of both and before either had time to speak again mademoiselle turned to them and said rapidly in french  i assure you ma chère i should have mistaken monsieur for a compatriote by his language were it not for a single heinous fault that he has just committed  which fault you will suffer me to inquire into that i may hasten to correct it asked mr blunt  mais monsieur you speak too perfectly too grammatically for a native you do not take the liberties with the language that one who feels he owns it thinks he has a right to do it is the fault of too much correctness  and a fault it easily becomes i thank you for the hint mademoiselle but as i am now going where little french will be heard it is probable it will soon be lost in greater mistakes  the two then turned away again and continued the dialogue that had been interrupted by this trifling  there may also be one more to whom you are known continued eve as soon as the vivacity of the discourse of the others satisfied her the remark would not he heard  surely you cannot mean him  surely i do mean him are you quite certain that mr sharp mr blunt mr blunt mr sharp never saw each other before  i think not until the moment we entered the boat in company he is a gentlemanly young man he seems even to be more and one would not be apt to forget him he is altogether superior to the rest of the set do you not agree with me  eve made no answer probably because she thought her companion was not sufficiently intimate to interrogate her on the subject of her opinions of others mr sharp had too much knowledge of the world not to perceive the little mistake he had made and after begging the young lady with a ludicrous deprecation of her mercy not to betray him he changed the conversation with the tact of a man who saw that the discourse could not be continued without assuming a confidential character that eve was indisposed to permit luckily a pause in the discourse between the governess and her colloquist permitted a happy turn to the conversation  i believe you are an american mr blunt he remarked and as i am an englishman we may be fairly pitted against each other on this important question of international law and about which i hear our worthy captain flourishing extracts from vattel as familiarly as household terms i hope at least you agree with me in thinking that when the sloopofwar comes up with us it will be very silly on our part to make any objections to being boarded by her  i do not know that it is at all necessary i should be an american to give an opinion on such a point returned the young man he addressed courteously though he smiled to himself as he answeredfor what is right is right quite independent of nationality it really does appear to me that a publicarmed vessel ought in war or peace to have a right to ascertain the character of all merchantships at least on the coast of the country to which the cruisers belong without this power it is not easy to see in what manner they can seize smugglers capture pirates or other wise enforce the objects for which such vessels are usually sent to sea in the absence of positive hostilities  i am happy to find you agreeing with me then in the legality of the doctrine of the right of search  paul blunt again smiled and eve as she caught a glimpse of his fine countenance in turning in their short walk fancied there was a concealed pride of reason in the expression still he answered as mildly and quietly as before  the right of search certainly to attain these ends but to attain no more if nations denounce piracy for instance and employ especial agents to detect and overcome the freebooters there is reason in according to these agents all the rights that are requisite to the discharge of the duties but in conceding this much i do not see that any authority is acquired beyond that which immediately belongs to the particular service to be performed if we give a man permission to enter our house to look for thieves it does not follow that because so admitted he has a right to exercise any other function i do believe that the ship in chase of us as a public cruiser ought to be allowed to board this vessel but finding nothing contrary to the laws of nations about her that she will have no power to detain or otherwise molest her even the right i concede ought to be exercised in good faith and without vexatious abuses  but surely you must think that in carrying off a refugee from justice we have placed ourselves in the wrong and cannot object as a principle to the poor mans being taken back again into the country from which he has escaped however much we may pity the hardships of the particular case  i much question if captain truck will be disposed to reason so vaguely in the first place he will be apt to say that his ship was regularly cleared and that he had authority to sail that in permitting the officer to search his vessel while in british waters he did all that could be required of him the law not compelling him to be either a bailiff or an informer that the process issued was to take davis and not to detain the montauk that once out of british waters american law governs and the english functionary became an intruder of whom he had every right to rid himself and that the process by which he got his power to act at all became impotent the instant it was without the jurisdiction under which it was granted  i think you will find the captain of yonder cruiser indisposed to admit this doctrine  that is not impossible men often preferring abuses to being thwarted in their wishes but the captain of yonder cruiser might as well go on board a foreign vessel of war and pretend to a right to command her in virtue of the commission by which he commands his own ship as to pretend to find reason or law in doing what you seem to predict  i rejoice to hear that the poor man cannot now be torn from his wife exclaimed eve  you then incline to the doctrine of mr blunt miss effingham observed the other controversialist a little reproachfully i fear you make it a national question  perhaps i have done what all seem to have done permitted sympathy to get the better of reason and yet it would require strong proof to persuade me that villanouslooking attorney was engaged in a good cause and that meek and warmhearted wife in a bad one  both the gentlemen smiled and both turned to the fair speaker as if inviting her to proceed but eve checked herself having already said more than became her in her own opinion  i had hoped to find an ally in you mr blunt to sustain the claim of england to seize her own seamen when found on board of vessels of another nation resumed mr sharp when a respectful pause had shown both the young men that they need expect nothing more from their fair companion but i fear i must set you down as belonging to those who wish to see the power of england reduced coúte qui coúte  this was received as it was meant or as a real opinion veiled under pleasantry  i certainly do not wish to see her power maintained coúte qui coúte returned the other laughing and in this opinion i believe i may claim both these ladies as allies  certainement exclaimed mademoiselle viefville who was a living proof that the feelings created by centuries of animosity are not to be subdued by a few flourishes of the pen  as for me mr sharp added eve you may suppose being an american girl i cannot subscribe to the right of any country to do us injustice but i beg you will not include me among those who wish to see the land of my ancestors wronged in aught that she may rightfully claim as her due  this is powerful support and i shall rally to the rescue seriously then will you allow me to inquire sir if you think the right of england to the services of her seamen can be denied  seriously then mr sharp you must permit me to ask if you mean by force or by reason  by the latter certainly  i think you have taken the weak side of the english argument the nature of the service that the subject or the citizen as it is now the fashion to say at paris mademoiselle  tant pis muttered the governess  owes his government continued the young man slightly glancing at eve at the interruption is purely a point of internal regulation in england there is compulsory service for seamen without restriction or what is much the same without an equal protection in france it is compulsory service on a general plan in america as respects seamen the service is still voluntary  your pardonwill the institutions of america permit impressment at all  i should think not indiscriminate impressment though i do not see why laws might not be enacted to compel drafts for the ships of war as well as for the army but this is a point that some of the professional gentlemen on board if there be any such might better answer than myself  the skill with which you have touched on these subjects tonight had made me hope to have found such a one in you for to a traveller it is always desirable to enter a country with a little preparation and a ship might offer as much temptation to teach as to learn  if you suppose me an american lawyer you give me credit for more than i can lay claim to  as he hesitated eve wondered whether the slight emphasis he had laid on the two words we have italicised was heaviest on that which denoted the country or on that which denoted the profession  i have been much in america and have paid a little attention to the institutions but should be sorry to mislead you into the belief that i am at all infallible on such points mr blunt continued  you were about to touch on impressment  simply to say that it is a municipal national power one in no degree dependent on general principles and that it can properly be exercised in no situation in which the exercise of municipal or national powers is forbidden i can believe that this power may be exercised on board american ships in british watersor at least that it is a more plausible right in such situations but i cannot think it can be rightfully exercised anywhere else i do not think england would submit to such a practice an hour reversing the case and admitting her present strength and an appeal of this sort is a pretty good test of a principle  ay ay what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander as vattel says interrupted captain truck who had overheard the last speech or two not that he says this in so many words but then he has the sentiment at large scattered throughout his writings for that matter there is little that can be said on a subject that he does not put before his readers as plainly as beachy head lies before the navigator of the british channel with bowditch and vattel a man might sail round the globe and little fear of a bad landfall or a mistake in principles my present object is to tell you ladies that the steward has reported the supper in waiting for the honour of your presence  before quitting the deck the party inquired into the state of the chase and the probable intentions of the sloopofwar  we are now on the great highway of nations returned mr truck and it is my intention to travel it without jostling or being jostled as for the sloop she is standing out under a press of canvas and we are standing from her in nearly a straight line in like circumstances she is some eight or ten miles astern of us and there is an old saying among seamen that a stern chase is a long chase i do not think our case is about to make an exception to the rule i shall not pretend to say what will be the upshot of the matter but there is not the ship in the british navy that can gain ten miles on the montauk in her present trim and with this breeze in as many hours so we are quit of her for the present  the last words were uttered just as eve put her foot on the step to descend into the cabin     chapter vi      trin stephano   steph doth thy other mouth call me mercy mercy    tempest   the life of a packet steward is one of incessant mixing and washing of interrogations and compoundings all in a space of about twelve feet square these functionaries usually clever mulattoes who have caught the civilisation of the kitchen are busy from morning till night in their cabins preparing dishes issuing orders regulating courses starting corks and answering questions apathy is the great requisite for the station for wo betide the wretch who fancies any modicum of zeal or good nature can alone fit him for the occupation from the moment the ship sails until that in which a range of the cable is overhauled or the chain is rowsed up in readiness to anchor no smile illumines his face no tone issues from his voice while on duty but that of dogged routineof submission to those above or of snarling authority to those beneath him as the hour for the drink gelt or buona mana approaches however he becomes gracious and smiling on his first appearance in the pantry of a morning he has a regular series of questions to answer and for which like the dutiful zeluco who wrote all his letters to his mother on the same day varying the dates to suit the progress of time he not unfrequently has a regular set of answers out and dried in his gastronomical mind hows the wind hows the weather hows her head all addressed to this standing almanack are mere matters of course for which he is quite prepared though it is by no means unusual to hear him ordering a subordinate to go on deck after the answer is given with a view to ascertain the facts it is only when the voice of the captain is heared from his stateroom that he conceives himself bound to be very particular though such is the tact of all connected with ships that they instinctively detect the know nothings who are uniformly treated with an indifference suited to their culpable ignorance even the old salt on the forecastle has an instinct for a brother tar though a passenger and a due respect is paid to neptune in answering his inquiries while half the time the maiden traveller meets with a grave equivoque a marvel or a downright mystification  on the first morning out the steward of the montauk commenced the dispensation of his news for no sooner was he heard rattling the glasses and shuffling plates in the pantry than the attack was begun by mr dodge in whom a laudable thirst after knowledge as exemplified in putting questions was rather a besetting principle this gentleman had come out in the ship as has been mentioned and unfortunately for the interest of his propensity not only the steward but all on board had as it is expressed in slang language early taken the measure of his foot the result of his present application was the following brief dialogue  steward called out mr dodge through the blinds of his stateroom whereabouts are we  in the british channel sir  i might have guessed that myself  so i spose sir nobody is better at guessing and divining than mr dodge  but in what part of the channel are we saunders  about the middle sir  how far have we come to night  from portsmouth roads to this place sir  mr dodge was satisfied and the steward who would not have dared to be so explicit with any other cabinpassenger continued coolly to mix an omelette the next attack was made from the same room by sir george templemore  steward my good fellow do you happen to know whereabouts we are  certainly sir the land is still werry obwious  are we getting on cleverly  nicely sir with a mincing emphasis on the first word that betrayed there was a little waggery about the gravelooking mulatto  and the sloopofwar steward  nicely too sir  there was a shuffling in the stateroom followed by a silence the door of mr sharps room was now opened an inch or two and the following questions issued through the crevice  is the wind favourable steward  just her character sir  do you mean that the wind is favourable  for the montauk sir shes a persuader in this breeze  but is she going in the direction we wish  if the gentleman wishes to perambulate america it is probable he will get there with a little patience  mr sharp pulledto his door and ten minutes passed without further questions the steward beginning to hope the morning catechism was over though he grumbled a wish that gentlemen would turn out and take a look for themselves now up to this moment saunders knew no more than those who had just been questioning him of the particular situation of the ship in which he floated as indifferent to the whereabouts and the winds as men sail in the earth along its orbit without bethinking them of parallaxes nodes ecliptics and solstices aware that it was about time for the captain to be heard he sent a subordinate on deck with a view to be ready to meet the usual questions from his commander a couple of minutes were sufficient to put him au courant of the real state of things the next door that opened was that of paul blunt however who thrust his head into the cabin with all his dark curls in the confusion of a night scene  steward  sir  hows the wind  quite exhilarating sir  from what quarter  about south sir  is there much of it  a prewailing breeze sir  and the sloop  shes to leeward sir operating along as fast as she can  steward  sir stepping hurriedly out of his pantry in order to hear more distinctly  under what sail are we  topgallant sails sir  hows her head  westsouthwest sir  delicious any news of the rover  hull down to leeward sir and on our quarter  staggering along eh  quite like a disguised person sir  better still hurry along that breakfast of yours sir i am as hungry as a troglodyte  the honest captain had caught this word from a recent treatise against agrarianism and having an acquired taste for orders in one sense at least he flattered himself with being what is called a conservative in other words he had a strong relish for that maxim of the scotch freebooter which is rendered into english by the comely aphorism of keep what youve got and get what you can  a cessation of the interrogatories took place and soon after the passengers began to appear in the cabin one by one as the first step is almost invariably to go on deck especially in good weather in a few minutes nearly all of the last nights party were again assembled in the open air a balm that none can appreciate but those who have experienced the pent atmosphere of a crowded vessel the steward had rendered a faithful account of the state of the weather to the captain who was now seen standing in the mainrigging looking at the clouds to windward and at the sloopofwar to leeward in the knowing manner of one who was making comparisons materially to the disadvantage of the latter  the day was fine and the montauk bearing her canvas nobly was to use the stewards language also staggering along under everything that would draw from her topgallantsails down with the wind near two points forward of the beam or on an easy bowline as there was but little sea her rate was quite nine knots though varying with the force of the wind the cruiser had certainly followed them thus far though doubts began to be entertained whether she was in chase or merely bound like themselves to the westward a course common to all vessels that wish to clear the channel even when it is intended to go south as the rocks and tides of the french coast are inconvenient neighbours in long nights  who knows after all that the cutter which tried to board us asked the captain aloud belongs to the ship to leeward  i know the boat sir answered the second mate and the ship is the foam  let her foam away then if she wishes to speak us has any one tried her bearings since daylight  we set her by the compass at six oclock sir and she has not varied her bearing as far as from one belaying pin to another in three hours but her hull rises fast you can now make out her ports and at daylight the bottom of her courses dipped  ay ay she is a lightgoing foam then if that is the case she will be alongside of us by night  in which event captain you will be obliged to give him a broadside of vattel threw in john effingham in his cool manner  if that will answer his errand he is welcome to as much as he can carry i begin to doubt gentlemen whether this fellow be not in earnest in which case you may nave an opportunity of witnessing how ships are handled when seamen have their management i have no objection to setting the experience of a poor comeandgo sort of a fellow like myself in opposition to the geometry and hamilton moore of a young manofwarsman i dare say now yonder chap is a lord or a lords progeny while poor jack truck is just as you see him  do you not think halfanhour of compliance on our part might bring the matter to an amicable conclusion a once said paul blunt were we to run down to him the object of his pursuit could be determined in a few minutes  what and abandon poor davis to the rapacity of that rascally attorney generously exclaimed sir george templemore i would prefer paying the portcharges myself run into the handiest french port and let the honest fellow escape  there is no probability that a cruiser would attempt to take a mere debtor from a foreign vessel on the open sea  if there were no tobacco in the world mr blunt i might feel disposed to waive the categories and show the gentleman that courtesy returned the captain who was preparing another cigar but while the cruiser might not feel authorised to take an absconding debtor from this vessel he might feel otherwise on the subject of tobacco provided there has been an information for smuggling  captain truck then explained that the subordinates of the packets frequently got their ships into trouble by taking adventures of the forbidden weed clandestinely into european ports and that his ship in such circumstances would lose her place in the line and derange all the plans of the company to which she belonged he did the english government the justice to say that it had always manifested a liberal disposition not to punish the innocent for the guilty but were any such complaints actually in the wind he thought he could settle it with much less loss to himself on his return than on the day of sailing while this explanation was delivered a group had clustered round the speaker leaving eve and her party on the opposite side of the deck  this last speech of mr blunts quite unsettles my opinion of his national character as vattel and our worthy captain would say remarked mr sharp last night i set him down as a right loyal american but i think it would not be natural for a thoroughgoing countryman of yours miss effingham to propose this act of courtesy to a cruiser of king william  how far any countrymen of mine thoroughgoing or not have reason to manifest extreme courtesy to any of your cruisers eve laughingly replied i shall leave captain truck to say but with you i have long been at a loss to determine whether mr blunt is an englishman or an american or indeed whether he be either  long miss effingham he then has the honour of being well known to you  eye answered steadily though the colour mounted to her brow but whether from the impetuous exclamation of her companion or from any feeling connected with the subject of their conversation the young man was at a loss to discover  long as girls of twenty count timesome four or five years but you may judge how well when i tell you i am ignorant of his country even  and may i venture to ask which do you yourself give him credit for being an american or an englishman  eves bright eyes laughed as she answered you have put the question with so much finesse and with a politeness so well managed that i should indeed be churlish to refuse an answernay do not interrupt me and spoil all the good you have done by unnecessary protestations of sincerity  all i wish to say is to ask an explanation of a finesse of which i am quite as innocent as of any wish to draw down upon myself the visitations of your displeasure  do you then really conceive it a credit to be an american  nobody of less modesty than yourself miss effingham under all the circumstances would dream of asking the question  i thank you for the civility which must be taken as it is offered i presume quite as a thing en règle but to leave our fine opinions of each other as well as our prejudices out of the question  you will excuse me if i object to this for i feel nay good sense implicated you can hardly attribute to me opinions so utterly unreasonable so unworthy of a gentlemanso unfounded in short am i not incurring all the risks and hardships of a long seavoyage expressly to visit your great country and i trust to improve by its example and society  since you appear to wish it mr sharp eve glanced her playful eye up at him as she pronounced the namei will be as credulous as a believer in animal magnetism and that i fancy is pushing credulity to the verge of reason it is now settled between us that you do conceive it an honour to be an american born educated and by extraction  all of which being the case with miss effingham  all but the second indeed they write me fearful things concerning this european education of mine some even go so far as to assure me i shall be quite unfitted to live in the society to which i properly belong  europe will be rejoiced to receive you back again in that case and no european more so than myself  the beautiful colour deepened a little on the cheek of eve but she made no immediate reply  to return to our subject she at length said were i required to say i should not be able to decide on the country of mr blunt nor have i ever met with any one who appeared to know i saw him first in germany where he circulated in the best company though no one seemed acquainted with his history even there he made a good figure was quite at his ease speaks several languages almost as well as the natives of the different countries themselves and altogether was a subject of curiosity with those who had leisure to think of any thing but their own dissipation and folly  mr sharp listened with obvious gravity to the fair speaker and had not her own eyes been fastened on the deck she might have detected the lively interest betrayed in his perhaps the feeling which was at the bottom of all this to a slight degree influenced his answer  quite an admirable crichton  i do not say that though certainly expert in tongues my own rambling life has made me acquainted with a few languages and i do assure you this gentleman speaks three or four with almost equal readiness and with no perceptible accent i remember at vienna many even believed him to be a german  what with the name of blunt  eve smiled and her companion who silently watched every expression of her varying countenance as if to read her thoughts noted it  names signify little in these migratory times returned the young lady you have but to imagine a von before it and it would pass at dresden or at berlin von blunt der edelgeborne graf von blunt hofrathor if you like it better geheimer rath mit excellenz und eure gnaden  or bawbergveginspectorsubstitut added mr sharp laughing no no this will hardly pass blunt is a good old english name but it has not finesse enough for italian german spanish or anything else but john bull and his family  i see no necessity for my part for all this bluntishness the gentleman may think frankness a good travelling quality  surely he has not concealed his real name  mr sharp mr blunt mr blunt mr sharp rejoined eve laughing until her bright eyes danced with pleasure there would be something ridiculous indeed in seeing so much of the finesse of a master of ceremonies subjected to so profound a mystification i have been told that passing introductions amount to little among you men and this would be a case in point  i would i dared ask if it be really so  were i to be guilty of indiscretion in anothers case you would not fail to distrust me in your own i am moreover a protestant and abjure auricular confessions  you will not frown if i inquire whether the rest of your party remember him  my father mademoiselle viefville and the excellent nanny sidley again but i think none other of the servants as he never visited us mr john effingham was travelling in egypt at the time and did not see him at all and we only met in general society nannys acquaintance merely that of seeing him check his horse in the prater to speak to us of a morning  poor fellow i pity him he has at least never had the happiness of strolling on the shores of como and the islands of laggo maggiore in your company or of studying the wonders of the pitti and the vatican  if i must confess all he journeyed with us on foot and in boats an entire month among the wonders of the oberland and across the wallenstadt this was at a time when we had no one with us but the regular guides and the german courier who was discharged in london  were it not for the impropriety of tampering with a servant i would cross the deck and question your good nanny this moment said mr sharp with playful menace of all torture that of suspense is the hardest to be borne  i grant you full permission and acquit you of all sins whether of disrespect meanness impertinence ungentlemanlike practices or any other vice that may be thought to attend and characterize the act  this formidable array of qualities would check the curiosity of a village gossip  it has an effect i did not intend then i wish you to put your threat in execution  not seriously surely  never more so take a favourable moment to speak to the good soul as an old acquaintance she remembers you well and by a little of that interrogating management you possess a favourable opportunity may occur to bring in the other subject in the mean time i will glance over the pages of this book  as eve began to read mr sharp perceived she was in earnest and hesitating a moment in doubt of the propriety of the act he yielded to her expressed desire and strolled carelessly towards the faithful old domestic he addressed her indifferently at first until believing he might go further he smilingly observed that he believed he had seen her in italy to this nanny quietly assented and when he indirectly added that it was under another name she smiled but merely intimated her consciousness of the fact by a quick glance of the eye  you know that travellers assume names for the sake of avoiding curiosity he added and i hope you will not betray me  you need not fear me sir i meddle with little besides my own duty and so long as miss eve appears to think there is no harm in it i will venture to say it is no more than a gentlemans caprice  why that is the very word she applied to it herself you have caught the term from miss effingham  well sir and if i have it is caught from one who deals little harm to any  i believe i am not the only one on board who travels under a false name if the truth were known  nanny looked first at the deck then at her interrogators face next towards mr blunt withdrawing her eye again as if guilty of an indiscretion and finally at the sails perceiving her embarrassment respecting her discretion and ashamed of the task he had undertaken mr sharp said a few civil things suited to the condition of the woman and sauntering about the deck for a short time to avoid suspicion soon found himself once more alongside of eve the latter inquired with her eyes a little exultingly perhaps concerning his success  i have failed he said but something must be ascribed to my own awkward diffidence for there is so much meanness in tampering with a servant that i had not the heart to push my questions even while i am devoured by curiosity  your fastidiousness is not a disease with which all on board are afflicted for there is at least one grand inquisitor among us by what i can learn so take heed to your sins and above all be very guarded of old letters marks and other telltales that usually expose impostors  to all that i believe sufficient care has already been had by that other dromio my own man  and in what way do you share the name between you is it dromio of syracuse and dromio of ephesus or does john call himself fitzedward or mortimer or de courcy  he has complaisance enough to make the passage with nothing but a christian name i believe in truth it was by a mere accident that i turned usurper in this way he took the stateroom for me and being required to give a name he gave his own as usual when i went to the docks to look at the ship i was saluted as mr sharp and then the conceit took me of trying how it would wear for a month or six weeks i would give the world to know if the geheimer rath got his cognomen in the same honest manner  i think not as his man goes by the pungent title of pepper unless poor john should have occasion for two names during the passage you are reasonably safe and still i think continued eve biting her lips like one who deliberated if it were any longer polite to bet mr john effingham would hazard all the french gloves in his trunks against all the english finery in yours that the inquisitor just hinted at gets at your secret before we arrive perhaps i ought rather to say ascertains that you are not mr sharp and that mr blunt is  her companion entreated her to point out the person to whom she had given the sobriquet she mentioned  accuse me of giving nicknames to no one the man has this title from mademoiselle viefville and his own great deeds it is a certain mr steadfast dodge who it seems knows something of us from the circumstance of living in the same county and who from knowing a little in this comprehensive manner is desirous of knowing a great deal more  the natural result of all useful knowledge  mr john effingham who is apt to fling sarcasms at all lands his native country included affirms that this gentleman is but a fair specimen of many more it will be our fortune to meet in america if so we shall not long be strangers for according to mademoiselle viefville and my good nanny he has already communicated to them a thousand interesting particulars of himself in exchange for which he asks no more than the reasonable compensation of having all his questions concerning us truly answered  this is certainly alarming intelligence and i shall take heed accordingly  if he discover that john is without a surname i am far from certain he will not prepare to have him arraigned for some high crime or misdemeanour for mr john effingham maintains that the besetting propensity of all this class is to divine the worst the moment their imaginations cease to be fed with fact all is false with them and it is flattery or accusation  the approach of mr blunt caused a cessation of the discourse eve betraying a slight degree of sensitiveness about admitting him to share in these little asides a circumstance that her companion observed not without satisfaction the discourse now became general the person who joined them amusing the others with an account of several proposals already made by mr dodge which as he expressed it in making the relation manifested the strong communitycharacteristics of an american the first proposition was to take a vote to ascertain whether mr van buren or mr harrison was the greatest favourite of the passengers and on this being defeated owing to the total ignorance of so many on board of both the parties he had named he had suggested the expediency of establishing a society to ascertain daily the precise position of the ship captain truck had thrown cold water on the last proposal however by adding to it what among legislators is called a rider he having drily suggested that one of the duties of the said society should be to ascertain also the practicability of wading across the atlantic     chapter vii      when clouds are seen wise men put on their cloaks   when great leaves fall then winter is at hand   when the sun sets who doth not look for night   untimely storms make men expect a dearth   all may be well but if god sort it so   tis more than we deserve or i expect    richard iii   these conversations however were mere episodes of the great business of the passage throughout the morning the master was busy in rating his mates giving sharp reprimands to the stewards and cooks overhauling the log line introducing the passengers seeing to the stowage of the anchors in getting down the signalpole throwing in touches of vattel and otherwise superintending duty and dispensing opinions all this time the cat in the grass does not watch the bird that hops along the ground with keener vigilance than he kept his eye on the foam to an ordinary observer the two ships presented the familiar spectacle of vessels sailing in the same direction with a very equal rate of speed and as the course was that necessary to clear the channel most of the passengers and indeed the greater part of the crew began to think the cruiser like themselves was merely bound to the westward mr truck on the contrary judging by signs and movements that more naturally suggested themselves to one accustomed to direct the evolutions of a ship and to reason on their objects than to the mere subjects of his will thought differently to him the motive of the smallest change on board the sloopofwar was as intelligible as if it had been explained in words and he even foresaw many that were about to take place before noon the foam had got fairly abeam and mr leach pointing out the circumstance observed that if her wish was to overhaul them she ought then to tack it being a rule among seamen that the pursuing vessel should turn to windward as often as she found herself nearest to her chase but the experience of captain truck taught him better the tide was setting into the channel on the flood and the wind enabled both ships to fake the current on their leebows a power that forced them up to windward whereas by tacking the foam would receive the force of the stream on her weather broadside or so nearly so as to sweep her farther astern than her difference in speed could easily repair  she has the heels of us and she weathers on us as it is grumbled the master and that might satisfy a man less modest i have led the gentleman such a tramp already that he will be in none of the best humours when he comes alongside and we may make up our minds on seeing portsmouth again before we see newyork unless a slant of wind or the night serve us a good turn i trust leach you have not been destroying your prospects in life by looking too wistfully at a tobaccofield  not i sir and if you will give me leave to say it captain truck i do not think a plug has been landed from the ship which did not go ashore in a bonafide tobaccobox that might appear in any court in england the people will swear to a man that this is true  ay ay and the barons of the exchequer would be the greatest fools in england not to believe them if there has been no defrauding the revenue why does a cruiser follow this ship a regular packet to sea  this affair of the steerage passenger davis sir is probably the cause the man may be heavily in debt or possibly a defaulter for these rogues when they break down often fall lower than the twixt decks of a ship like this  this will do to put the quarterdeck and cabin in good humour at sailing and give them something to open an acquaintance with but it is sawdust to none but your new beginners i have known that seal this many a year and the rogue never yet had a case that touched the quarterdeck it is as the man and his wife say and ill not give them up out here in blue water for as much foam as lies on jersey beach after an easterly blow it will not be any of the family of davis that will satisfy yonder windeater but he will lay his hand on the whole family of the montauk leaving them the agreeable alternative of going back to portsmouth in his pleasant society or getting out here in midchannel and wading ashore as best they can d me if i believe leach that vattel will bear the fellow out in it even if there has been a whole hogshead of the leaves trundled into his island without a permit  to this mr leach had no encouraging answer to make for like most of his class he held practical force in much greater respect than the abstractions of books he deemed it prudent therefore to be silent though greatly doubting the efficacy of a quotation from any authority on board when fairly put in opposition to a written order from the admiral at portsmouth or even to a signal sent down from admiralty at london  the day wore away making a gradual change in the relative positions of the two ships though so slowly as to give captain truck strong hopes of being able to dodge his pursuer in the coming night which promised to be dark and squally to return to portsmouth was his full intention but not until he had first delivered his freight and passengers in newyork for like all men bound up body and soul in the performance of an especial duty he looked on a frustration of his immediate object as a much greater calamity than even a double amount of more remote evil besides he felt a strong reliance on the liberality of the english authorities in the end and had little doubt of being able to extricate himself and his ship from any penalties to which the indiscretion or cupidity of his subordinates might have rendered him liable  just as the sun dipped into the watery track of the montauk most of the cabin passengers again appeared on deck to take a look at the situation of the two vessels and to form their own conjectures as to the probable result of the adventure by this time the foam had tacked twice once to weather upon the wake of her chase and again to resume her line of pursuit the packet was too good a ship to be easily overtaken and the cruiser was now nearly hulldown astern but evidently coming up at a rate that would bring her alongside before morning the wind blew in squalls a circumstance that always aids a vessel of war as the greater number of her hands enables them to make and shorten sail with ease and rapidity  this unsettled weather is as much as a mile an hour against us observed captain truck who was far from pleased at the fact of his being outsailed by anything that floated and if truth must be said i think that fellow has somewhere about half a knot the best of it in the way of foot on a bowline and with this breeze but he has no cargo in and they trim their boats like steelyards give us more wind or a freer and i would leave him to digest his orders as a shark digests a marlingspike or a ringbolt notwithstanding all his advantages for little good would it then do him to be trying to run into the winds eye like a steamtug as it is we must submit we are certainly in a category and be dd to it  it was one of those wildlooking sunsets that are so frequent in the autumn in which appearances are worse perhaps than the reality the ships were now so near the chops of the channel that no land was visible and the entire horizon presented that chill and wintry aspect that belongs to gloomy and driving clouds to which streaks of dull light serve more to give an appearance of infinite space than any of the relief of brightness it was a dreary nightfall to a landsmans eye though they who better understood the signs of the heavens as they are exhibited on the ocean saw little more than the promise of obscurity and the usual hazards of darkness in a muchfrequented sea  this will be a dirty night observed john effingham and we may have occasion to bring in some of the flaunting vanity of the ship ere another morning returns  the vessel appears to be in good hands returned mr effingham i have watched them narrowly for i know not why i have felt more anxiety on the occasion of this passage than on any of the nine i have already made  as he spoke the tender father unconsciously bent his eyes on eve who leaned affectionately on his arm steadying her light form against the pitching of the vessel she understood his feelings better than he did himself possibly since accustomed to his fondest care from childhood she well knew that he seldom thought of others or even of himself while her own wants or safety appealed to his unwearying love  father she said smiling in his wistful face we have seen more troubled waters than these far and in a much frailer vessel do you not remember the wallenstadt and its miserable skiff where i have heard you say there was really danger though we escaped from it all with a little fright  perfectly well do i recollect it love nor have i forgotten our brave companion and his good service at that critical moment but for his stout arm and timely succour we might not as you say have been quit for the fright  although mr effingham looked only at his daughter while speaking mr sharp who listened with interest saw the quick retreating glance of eve at paul blunt and felt something like a chill in his blood as he perceived that her own cheeks seemed to reflect the glow which appeared on that of the young man he alone observed this secret evidence of common interest in some event in which both had evidently been actors those around them being too much occupied in the arrangements of the ship and too little suspicious to heed the trifling circumstance captain truck had ordered all hands called to make sail to the surprise of even the crew the vessel at the moment was staggering along under as much canvas as she could apparently bear and the mates looked aloft with inquiring eyes as if to ask what more could be done  the master soon removed all doubts with a rapidity that is not common in merchant ships but which is usual enough in the packets the lower studdingsails and two topmaststuddingsails were prepared and made ready for hoisting as soon as the words all ready were uttered the helm was put up the sails were set and the montauk was running with a free wind towards the narrow passage between the scilly islands and the lands end captain truck was an expert channel pilot from long practice and keeping the run of the tides in his head he had loosely calculated that his vessel had so much offing as with a free wind and the great progress she had made in the last twentyfour hours would enable him to lay through the pass  tis a ticklish hole to run into in a dirty night with a staggering breeze he said rubbing his hands as if the hazard increased his satisfaction and we will now see if this foam has mettle enough to follow  the chap has a quick eye and good glasses even though he should want nerve for the scilly rocks cried the mate who was looking out from the mizzen rigging there go his stunsails already and a plenty of them  sure enough the cruiser threw out her studdingsails had them full and drawing in five minutes and altered her course so as to follow the montauk there was now no longer any doubt concerning her object for it was hardly possible two vessels should adopt so bold a step as this just at dark and on such a night unless the movements of one were regulated by the movements of the other  in the mean time anxious faces began to appear on the quarterdeck and mr dodge was soon seen moving stealthily about among the passengers whispering here cornering there and seemingly much occupied in canvassing opinions on the subject of the propriety of the step that the master had just taken though if the truth must be told he rather stimulated opposition than found others prepared to meet his wishes when he thought however he had collected a sufficient number of suffrages to venture on an experiment that nothing but an inherent aversion to shipwreck and a watery grave could embolden him to make he politely invited the captain to a private conference in the stateroom occupied by himself and sir george templemore changing the venue as the lawyers term it to his own little apartmentno master of a packet willingly consenting to transact business in any other placecaptain truck who was out of cigars at the moment very willingly assented  when the two were seated and the door of the room was closed mr dodge carefully snuffed the candle looked about him to make sure there was no eavesdropper in a room eight feet by seven and then commenced his subject with what he conceived to be a commendable delicacy and discretion  captain truck he said in the sort of low confidential tone that denotes equally concern and mystery i think by this time you must have set me down as one of your warm and true friends and supporters i came out in your ship and please god we escape the perils of the sea it is my hope and intention to return home in her  if not friend dodge returned the master observing that the other paused to note the effect of his peroration and using a familiarity in his address that the acquaintance of the former passage had taught him was not misapplied if not friend dodge you have made a capital mistake in getting on board of her as it is by no means probable an occasion will offer to get out of her until we fall in with a newsboat or a pilotboat at least somewhere in the latitude and longitude of sandy hook you smoke i believe sir  i ask no better returned steadfast declining the offer i have told every one on the continentmr dodge had been to paris geneva along the rhine and through belgium and holland and in his eyes this was the continentthat no better ship or captain sails the ocean and you know captain i have a way with me when i please that causes what i say to be remembered why my dear sir i had an article extolling the whole line in the most appropriate terms and this ship in particular put into the journal at rotterdam it was so well done that not a soul suspected it came from a personal friend of yours  the captain was rolling the small end of a cigar in his mouth to prepare it for smoking the regulations of the ship forbidding any further indulgence below but when he received this assurance he withdrew the tobacco with the sort of mystifying simplicity that gets to be a second nature with a regular votary of neptune and answered with a coolness of manner that was in ridiculous contrast to the affected astonishment of the words  the devil you didwas it in good dutch  i do not understand much of the language said mr dodge hesitatingly for all he knew in truth was yaw and nein and neither of these particularly wellbut it looked to be uncommonly well expressed i could do no more than pay a man to translate it but to return to this affair of running in among the scilly islands such a night as this  return my good fellow this is the first syllable you have said about the matter  concern on your account has caused me to forget myself to be frank with you captain truck and if i wernt your very best friend i should be silent there is considerable excitement getting up about this matter  excitement what is that likea sort of moral headsea do you mean  precisely and i must tell you the truth though i had rather a thousand times not but this change in the ships course is monstrous unpopular  that is bad news with a vengeance mr dodge i shall rely on you as an old friend to get up an opposition  my dear captain i have done all i could in that way already but i never met with people so bent on a thing as most of the passengers the effinghams are very decided though so purseproud and grand sir george templemore declares it is quite extraordinary and even the french lady is furious to be as sincere as the crisis demands public opinion is setting so strong against you that i expect an explosion  well so long as the tide sets in my favour i must endeavour to bear it stemming a current in or out of water is uphill work but with a good bottom clean copper and plenty of wind it may be done  it would not surprise me were the gentlemen to appeal to the general sentiment against you when we arrive and make a handle of it against your line  it may be so indeed but what can be done if we return the englishman will certainly catch us and in that case my own opinion would be dead against me  well well captain i thought as a friend i would speak my mind if this thing should really get into the papers in america it would spread like fire in the prairies you know what the papers are i trust captain truck  i rather think i do mr dodge with many thanks for your hints and i believe i know what the scilly islands are too the elections will be nearly or quite over by the time we get in and thank god theyll not be apt to make a party question of it this fall at least in the mean time rely on my keeping a good lookout for the shoals of popularity and the quicksands of excitement you smoke sometimes i know and i can recommend this cigar as fit to regale the nose of that chap of strasbourgyou read your bible i know mr dodge and need not be told whom i mean the steward will be happy to give you a light on deck sir  in this manner captain truck with the sang froid of an old tar and the tact of a packetmaster got rid of his troublesome visiter who departed half suspecting that he had been quizzed but still ruminating on the expediency of getting up a committee or at least a public meeting in the cabin to follow up the blow by the aid of the latter could he but persuade mr effingham to take the chair and sir george templemore to act as secretary he thought he might escape a sleepless night and what was of quite as much importance make a figure in a paragraph on reaching home  mr dodge whose christian name thanks to a pious ancestry was steadfast partook of the qualities that his two appellations not inaptly expressed there was a singular profession of steadiness of purpose and of high principle about him all of which vanished in dodge at the close a great stickler for the rights of the people he never considered that this people was composed of many integral parts but he viewed all things as gravitating towards the great aggregation majorities were his hobbies and though singularly timid as an individual or when in the minority put him on the strongest side and he was ready to face the devil in short mr dodge was a peoples man because his strongest desire his ambition and his pride as he often expressed it was to be a man of the people in his particular neighbourhood at home sentiment ran in veins like gold in the mines or in streaks of public opinion and though there might be three or four of these public sentiments so long as each had its party no one was afraid to avow it but as for maintaining a notion that was not thus upheld there was a savour of aristocracy about it that would damn even a mathematical proposition though regularly solved and proved so much and so long had mr dodge respired a moral atmosphere of this communitycharacter and gregarious propensity that he had in many things lost all sense of his individuality as much so in fact as if he breathed with a pair of county lungs ate with a common mouth drank from the townpump and slept in the open air  such a man was not very likely to make an impression on captain truck one accustomed to rely on himself alone in the face of warring elements and who knew that a ship could not safely have more than a single will and that the will of her master  the accidents of life could scarcely form extremes of character more remote than that of steadfast dodge and that of john truck the first never did anything beyond acts of the most ordinary kind without first weighing its probable effect in the neighbourhood its popularity or unpopularity how it might tally with the different public opinions that were whiffling through the county in what manner it would influence the next election and whether it would be likely to elevate him or depress him in the public mind no asiatic slave stood more in terror of a vindictive master than mr dodge stood in fear and trembling before the reproofs comments censures frowns cavillings and remarks of every man in his county who happened to be long to the political party that just at that moment was in power as to the minority he was as brave as a lion could snap his fingers at them and was foremost in deriding and scoffing at all they said and did this however was in connexion with politics only for the instant partydrill ceased to be of value steadfasts valour oozed out of his composition and in all other things he dutifully consulted every public opinion of the neighbourhood this estimable man had his weak points as well as another and what is more he was quite sensible of them as was proved by a most jealous watchfulness of his besetting sins in the way of exposure if not of indulgence in a word steadfast dodge was a man that wished to meddle with and control all things without possessing precisely the spirit that was necessary to leave him master of himself he had a rabid desire for the good opinion of every thing human without always taking the means necessary to preserve his own was a stout declaimer for the rights of the community while forgetting that the community itself is but a means set up for the accomplishment of a given end and felt an inward and profound respect for everything that was beyond his reach which manifested itself not in manly efforts to attain the forbidden fruit but rather in a spirit of opposition and detraction that only betrayed through its jealousy the existence of the feeling which jealousy however he affected to conceal under an intense regard for popular rights since he was apt to aver it was quite intolerable that any man should possess anything even to qualities in which his neighbours might not properly participate all these moreover and many similar traits mr dodge encouraged in the spirit of liberty  on the other hand john truck sailed his own ship was civil to his passengers from habit as well as policy knew that every vessel must have a captain believed mankind to be little better than asses took his own observations and cared not a straw for those of his mates was never more bent on following his own views than when all hands grumbled and opposed him was daring by nature decided from use and long selfreliance and was every way a man fitted to steer his bark through the trackless ways of life as well as those of the ocean it was fortunate for one in his particular position that nature had made the possessor of so much selfwill and temporary authority cool and sarcastic rather than hotheaded and violent and for this circumstance mr dodge in particular had frequent occasions for felicitation     chapter viii      but then we are in order when we are   most out of order    jack cade   disappointed in his private appeal to the captains dread of popular disapprobation mr dodge returned to his secret work on deck for like a true freeman of the exclusive school this person never presumed to work openly unless sustained by a clear majority canvassing all around him and striving hard to create a public opinion as he termed it on his side of the question by persuading his hearers that every one was of his particular way of thinking already a method of exciting a feeling much practised by partisans of his school in the interval captain truck was working up his days reckoning by himself in his own stateroom thinking little and caring less about any thing but the results of his figures which soon convinced him that by standing a few hours longer on his present course he should plump his ship ashore somewhere between falmouth and the lizard  this discovery annoyed the worthy master so much the more on account of the suggestions of his late visiter for nothing could be less to his taste than to have the appearance of altering his determination under a menace still something must be done before midnight for he plainly perceived that thirty or forty miles at the farthest would fetch up the montauk on her present course the passengers had left the deck to escape the night air and he heard the effinghams inviting mr sharp and mr blunt into the ladies cabin which had been taken expressly for their party while the others were calling upon the stewards for the usual allowance of hot drinks at the diningtable without the talking and noise disturbed him his own stateroom became too confined and he went on deck to come to his decision in view of the angrylooking skies and the watery waste over which he was called to prevail here we shall leave him pacing the quarterdeck in moody silence alone too much disturbed to smoke even while the mate of the watch sat in the mizzenrigging like a monkey keeping a lookout to windward and ahead in the mean time we will return to the cabin of the effinghams  the montauk was one of the noblest of those surpassingly beautiful and yachtlike ships that now ply between the two hemispheres in such numbers and which in luxury and the fitting conveniences seem to vie with each other for the mastery the cabins were lined with satinwood and birdseye maple small marble columns separated the glittering panels of polished wood and rich carpets covered the floors the main cabin had the great table as a fixture in the centre but that of eve somewhat shorter but of equal width was free from all encumbrance of the sort it had its sofas cushions mirrors stools tables and an upright piano the doors of the staterooms and other conveniences opened on its sides and ends in short it presented at that hour the resemblance of a tasteful boudoir rather than that of an apartment in a cramped and vulgar ship  here then all who properly belonged to the place were assembled with mr sharp and mr blunt as guests when a tap at the door announced another visiter it was mr dodge begging to be admitted on a matter of business eve smiled as she bowed assent to old nanny who acted as her groom of the chambers and hastily expressed a belief that her guest must have come with a proposal to form a dorcas society  although mr dodge was as bold as caesar in expressing his contempt of anything but popular sway he never came into the presence of the quiet and wellbred without a feeling of distrust and uneasiness that had its rise in the simple circumstance of his not being used to their company indeed there is nothing more appalling in general to the vulgar and pretending than the simplicity and natural ease of the refined their own notions of elegance lie so much on the surface that they seem at first to suspect an ambush and it is probable that finding so much repose where agreeably to their preconceived opinions all ought to be fuss and pretension they imagine themselves to be regarded as intruders  mr effingham gave their visitor a polite reception and one that was marked with a little more than the usual formality by way of letting it be understood that the apartment was private a precaution that he knew was very necessary in associating with tempers like those of steadfast all this was thrown away on mr dodge notwithstanding every other person present admired the tact with which the host kept his guest at a distance by extreme attention for the latter fancied so much ceremony was but a homage to his claims it had the effect to put him on his own good behaviour however and of suspending the brusque manner in which he had intended to broach his subject as every body waited in calm silence as if expecting an explanation of the cause of his visit mr dodge soon felt himself constrained to say something though it might not be quite as clearly as he could wish  we have had a considerable pleasant time miss effingham since we sailed from portsmouth he observed familiarly  eve bowed her assent determined not to take to herself a visit that did violence to all her habits and notions of propriety but mr dodge was too obtuse to feel the hint conveyed in mere reserve of manner  it would have been more agreeable i allow had not this manofwar taken it into her head to follow us in this unprecedented manner mr dodge was as fond of his dictionary as the steward though he belonged to the political while saunders merely adorned the polite school of talkers sir george calls it a most uncomfortable pro endure you know sir george templemore without doubt miss effingham  i am aware there is a person of that name on board sir returned eve who recoiled from this familiarity with the sensitiveness with which a welleducated female distinguishes between one who appreciates her character and one who does not but have never had the honour of his acquaintance  mr dodge thought all this extraordinary for he had witnessed captain trucks introduction and did not understand how people who had sailed twentyfour hours in the same ship and had been fairly introduced should not be intimate as for himself he fancied he was what he termed well acquainted with the effinghams from having talked of them a great deal ignorantly and not a little maliciously a liberty he felt himself fully entitled to take from the circumstance of residing in the same county although he had never spoken to one of the family until accident placed him in their company on board the same vessel  sir george is a gentleman of great accomplishments miss effingham i assure you a man of unqualified merit we have the same stateroom for i like company and prefer chatting a little in my berth to being always asleep he is a baronet i suppose you knownot that i care anything for titles all men being equal in truth thoughthough  unequal in reality sir you probably meant to add observed john effingham who was lolling on eves workstand his eagleshaped face fairly curling with the contempt he felt and which he hardly cared to conceal  surely not sir exclaimed the terrified steadfast looking furtively about lest some active enemy might be at hand to quote this unhappy remark to his prejudice surely not men are every way equal and no one can pretend to be better than another no noit is nothing to me that sir george is a baronet though one would prefer having a gentleman in the same stateroom to having a coarse fellow sir george thinks sir that the ship is running into great danger by steering for the land in so dark a night and in such dirty weather he has many outoftheway expressions sir george i must admit for one of his rank he calls the weather dirty and the proceedings uncomfortable modes of expression gentlemen to which i give an unqualified disapprobation  probably sir george would attach more importance to a qualified disapprobation retorted john effingham  quite likely returned mr dodge innocently though the two other visiters eve and mademoiselle viefville permitted slight muscular movements about the lips to be seen sir george is quite an original in his way we have few originals in our part of the country you know mr john effingham for to say the truth it is rather unpopular to differ from the neighbourhood in this or any other respect yes sir the people will rule and ought to rule still i think sir george may get along well enough as a stranger for it is not quite as unpopular in a stranger to be original as in a native i think you will agree with me sir in believing it excessively presuming in an american to pretend to be different from his fellowcitizens  no one sir could entertain such presumption i am persuaded in your case  no sir i do not speak from personal motives but of the great general principles that are to be maintained for the good of mankind i do not know that any man has a right to be peculiar in a free country it is aristocratic and has an air of thinking one man is better than another i am sure mr effingham cannot approve of it  perhaps not freedom has many arbitrary laws that it will not do to violate  certainly sir or where would be its supremacy if the people cannot control and look down peculiarity or anything they dislike one might as well live in despotism at once  as i have resided much abroad of late years mr dodge inquired eve who was fearful her kinsman would give some cut that would prove to be past bearing as she saw his eye was menacing and who felt a disposition to be amused at the others philosophy that overcame the attraction of repulsion she had at first experienced towards himwill you favour me with some of those great principles of liberty of which i hear so much but which i fear have been overlooked by my european instructors  mademoiselle viefville looked grave messrs sharp and blunt delighted mr dodge himself mystified  i should feel myself little able to instruct miss effingham on such a subject the latter modestly replied as no doubt she has seen too much misery in the nations she has visited not to appreciate justly all the advantages of that happy country which has the honour of claiming her for one of its fair daughters  eve was terrified at her own temerity for she was far from anticipating so high a flight of eloquence in return for her own simple request but it was too late to retreat  none of the many illustrious and godlike men that our own beloved land has produced can pretend to more zeal in its behalf than myself but i fear my abilities to do it justice will fall far short of the subject he continued liberty as you know miss effingham as you well know gentlemen is a boon that merits our unqualified gratitude and which calls for our daily and hourly thanks to the gallant spirits who in the days that tried mens souls were foremost in the tented field and in the councils of the nation  john effingham turned a glance at eve that seemed to tell her how unequal she was to the task she had undertaken and which promised a rescue with her consent a condition that the young lady most gladly complied with in the same silent but expressive manner  of all this my young kinswoman is properly sensible mr dodge he said by way of diversion but she and i confess myself have some little perplexity on the subject of what this liberty is about which so much has been said and written in our time permit me to inquire if you understand by it a perfect independence of thought action and rights  equal laws equal rights equality in all respects and pure abstract unqualified liberty beyond all question sir  what a power in the strong man to beat the little man and to take away his dinner  by no means sir heaven forbid that i should maintain any such doctrine it means entire liberty no kings no aristocrats no exclusive privileges but one man as good as another  do you understand then that one man is as good as another under our system mr dodge  unqualifiedly so sir i am amazed that such a question should be put by a gentleman of your information in an age like this  if one man is as good as another said mr blunt who perceived that john effingham was biting his lips a sign that something more biting would followwill you do me the favour to inform me why the country puts itself to the trouble and expense of the annual elections  elections sir in what manner could free institutions flourish or be maintained without constantly appealing to the people the only true sources of power  to this i make no objections mr dodge returned the young man smiling but why an election if one man is as good as another a lottery would be cheaper easier and sooner settled why an election or even a lottery at all why not choose the president as the persians chose their king by the neighing of a horse  this would be indeed an extraordinary mode of proceeding for an intelligent and virtuous people mr blunt and i must take the liberty of saying that i suspect you of pleasantry if you wish an answer i will say at once by such a process we might get a knave or a fool or a traitor  how mr dodge i did not expect this character of the country from you are the americans then all fools or knaves or traitors  if you intend to travel much in our country sir i would advise great caution in throwing out such an insinuation for it would be apt to meet with a very general and unqualified disapprobation americans are enlightened and free and as far from deserving these epithets as any people on earth  and yet the fact follows from your own theory if one man is as good as another and any one of them is a fool or a knave or a traitorall are knaves or fools or traitors the insinuation is not mine but it follows i think inevitably as a consequence of your own proposition  in the pause that succeeded mr sharp said in a low voice to eve he is an englishman after all  mr dodge does not mean that one man is as good as another in that particular sense mr effingham kindly interposed in his quality of host his views are less general i fancy than his words would give us at first reason to suppose  very true mr effingham very true sir one man is not as good as another in that particular sense or in the sense of elections but in all other senses yes sir turning towards mr blunt again as one reviews the attack on an antagonist who has given a fall after taking breath in all other senses one man is unqualifiedly as good as another one man has the same rights as another  the slave as the freeman  the slaves are exceptions sir but in the free states except in the case of elections one man is as good as another in all things that is our meaning and any other principle would be unqualifiedly unpopular  can one man make a shoe as well as another  of rights siri stick to the rights you will remember  has the minor the same rights as the man of full age the apprentice as the master the vagabond as the resident the man who cannot pay as the man who can  no sir not in that sense either you do not understand me sir i fear all that i mean is that in particular things one man is as good as another in america this is american doctrine though it may not happen to be english and i flatter myself it will stand the test of the strictest investigation  and you will allow me to inquire where this is not the case in particular things if you mean to say that there are fewer privileges accorded to the accidents of birth or to fortune and station in america than is usual in other countries we shall agree but i think it will hardly do to say there are none  privileges accorded to birth in america sir the idea would be odious to her people  does not the child inherit the property of the father  most assuredly but this can hardly be termed a privilege  that may depend a good deal on taste i should account it a greater privilege than to inherit a title without the fortune  i perceive gentlemen that we do not perfectly understand each other and i must postpone the discussion to a more favourable opportunity for i confess great uneasiness at this decision of the captains about steering in among the rocks of sylla mr dodge was not as clearheaded as common in consequence of the controversy that had just occurred i challenge you to renew the subject another time gentlemen i only happened in another peculiarity of diction in this gentleman to make a first call for i suppose there is no exclusion in an american ship  none whatever sir mr john effingham coldly answered all the staterooms are in common and i propose to seize an early occasion to return this compliment by making myself at home in the apartment which has the honour to lodge mr dodge and sir george templemore  here mr dodge beat a retreat without touching at all on his real errand instead of even following up the matter with the other passengers he got into a corner with one or two congenial spirits who had taken great offence that the effinghams should presume to retire into their cabin and particularly that they should have the extreme aristocratical audacity to shut the door where he continued pouring into the greedy ears of his companions his own history of the recent dialogue in which according to his own account of the matter he had completely gotten the better of that young upstart blunt a man of whom he knew positively nothing divers anecdotes of the effingham family that came of the lowest and most idle gossip of rustic malignancy and his own vague and confused notions of the rights of persons and of things very different was the conversation that ensued in the ladies cabin after the welcome disappearance of the uninvited guest not a remark of any sort was made on his intrusion or on his folly even john effingham little addicted in common to forbearance being too proud to waste his breath on so low game and too well taught to open upon a man the moment his back was turned but the subject was continued and in a manner better suited to the education intelligence and views of the several speakers  eve said but little though she ventured to ask a question now and then mr sharp and mr blunt being the principal supporters of the discourse with an occasional quiet discreet remark from the young ladys father and a sarcasm now and then from john effingham mr blunt though advancing his opinions with diffidence and with a proper deference for the greater experience of the two elder gentlemen soon made his superiority apparent the subject proving to be one on which he had evidently thought a great deal and that too with a discrimination and originality that are far from common  he pointed out the errors that are usually made on the subject of the institutions of the american union by confounding the effects of the general government with those of the separate states and he clearly demonstrated that the confederation itself had in reality no distinctive character of its own even for or against liberty it was a confederation and got its character from the characters of its several parts which of themselves were independent in all things on the important point of distinctive principles with the exception of the vague general provision that they must be republics a prevision that meant anything or nothing so far as true liberty was concerned as each state might decide for itself  the character of the american government is to be sought in the characters of the state governments he concluded which vary with their respective policies it is in this way that communities that hold one half of their numbers in domestic bondage are found tied up in the same political fasces with other communities of the most democratic institutions the general government assures neither liberty of speech liberty of conscience action nor of anything else except as against itself a provision that is quite unnecessary as it is purely a government of delegated powers and has no authority to act at all on those particular interests  this is very different from the general impression in europe observed mr sharp and as i perceive i have the good fortune to be thrown into the society of an american if not an american lawyer able to enlighten my ignorance on these interesting topics i hope to be permitted during some of the idle moments of which we are likely to have many to profit by it  the other coloured bowed to the compliment but appeared to hesitate before he answered  tis not absolutely necessary to be an american by birth he said as i have already had occasion to observe in order to understand the institutions of the country and i might possibly mislead you were you to fancy that a native was your instructer i have often been in the country however if not born in it and few young men on this side of the atlantic have had their attention pointed with so much earnestness to all that affects it as myself  i was in hopes we had the honour of including you among our countrymen observed john effingham with evident disappointment so many young men come abroad disposed to quarrel with foreign excellences of which they know nothing or to concede so many of our own in the true spirit of serviles that i was flattering myself i had at last found an exception  eve also felt regret though she hardly avowed to herself the reason  he is then an englishman after all said mr sharp in another aside  why not a germanor a swissor even a russian  his english is perfect no continental could speak so fluently with such a choice of words so totally without an accent without an effort as mademoiselle viefville says he does not speak well enough for a foreigner  eve was silent for she was thinking of the singular manner in which a conversation so oddly commenced had brought about an explanation on a point that had often given her many doubts twenty times had she decided in her own mind that this young man whom she could properly call neither stranger nor acquaintance was a countryman and as often had she been led to change her opinion he had now been explicit she thought and she felt compelled to set him down as a european though not disposed still to believe he was an englishman for this latter notion she had reasons it might not have done to give to a native of the island they had just left as she knew to be the fact with mr sharp  music succeeded this conversation eve having taken the precaution to have the piano tuned before quitting port an expedient we would recommend to all who have a regard for the instrument that extends beyond its outside or even for their own ears john effingham executed brilliantly on the violin and as it appeared on inquiry the two younger gentlemen performed respectably on the flute flageolet and one or two other wind instruments we shall leave them doing great justice to beethoven rossini and mayerbeer whose compositions mr dodge did not fail to sneer at in the outer cabin as affected and altogether unworthy of attention and return on deck to the company of the anxious master  captain truck had continued to pace the deck moodily and alone during the whole evening and he only seemed to come to a recollection of himself when the relief passed him on his way to the wheel at eight bells inquiring the hour he got into the mizzen rigging with a nightglass and swept the horizon in search of the foam nothing could be made out the darkness having settled upon the water in a way to circumscribe the visible horizon to very narrow limits  this may do he muttered to himself as he swung off by a rope and alighted again on the planks of the deck mr leach was summoned and an order was passed for the relieved watch to remain on deck for duty  when all was ready the first mate went through the ship seeing that all the candles were extinguished or that the hoods were drawn over the skylights in such a way as to conceal any rays that might gleam upwards from the cabin at the same time attention was paid to the binnacle lamp this precaution observed the people went to work to reduce the sail and in the course of twenty minutes they had got in the studdingsails and all the standing canvas to the topsails the forecourse and a forward staysail the three topsails were then reefed with sundry urgent commands to the crew to be active for the englishman was coming up like a horse all this time no doubt  this much effected the hands returned on deck as much amazed at the several arrangements as if the order had been to cut away the masts  if we had a few guns and were a little strongerhanded growled an old salt to the secondmate as he hitched up his trousers and rolled over his quid i should think the hard one aft had been stripping for a fight but as it is we have nothing to carry on the war with unless we throw seabiscuits into the enemy  stand by to veer called out the captain from the quarterdeck or as he pronounced it ware  the men sprang to the braces and the bows of the ship fell off gradually as the yards yielded slowly to the drag in a minute the montauk was rolling dead before it and her broadside came sweeping up to the wind with the ships head to the eastward this new direction in the course had the double effect of hauling off the land and of diverging at more than right angles from the line of sailing of the foam if that ship still continued in pursuit the seamen nodded their heads at each other in approbation for all now as well understood the meaning of the change as if it had been explained to them verbally  the revolution on deck produced as sudden a revolution below the ship was no longer running easily on an even keel but was pitching violently into a headbeating sea and the wind which a few minutes before was scarcely felt to blow was now whistling its hundred strains among the cordage some sought their berths among whom were mr sharp and mr dodge some hurried up the stairs to learn the reason and all broke up their avocations for the night  captain truck had the usual number of questions to answer which he did in the following succinct and graphic manner a reply that we hope will prove as satisfactory to the reader as it was made to be perforce satisfactory to the curious on board  had we stood on an hour longer gentlemen we should have been lost on the coast of cornwall he said pithily had we stopped where we were the sloopofwar would nave been down upon us in twenty minutes by changing the course in the way you have seen he may get to leeward ward of us if he find it out he may change his own course in the dark being as likely to go wrong as to go right or he may stand in and set up the ribs of his majestys ship foam to dry among the rocks of the lizard where i hope all her people will get safely ashore dry shod  after waiting the result anxiously for an hour the passengers retired to their rooms one by one but captain truck did not quit the deck until the middle watch was set paul blunt heard him enter his stateroom which was next to his own and putting out his head he inquired the news above the worthy master had discovered something about this young man which created a respect for his nautical information for he never misapplied a term and he invariably answered all his questions promptly and with respect  dirtier and dirtier he said in defiance of mr dodges opinion of the phrase pulling off his peejacket and laying aside his sowwester a capfull of wind with just enough drizzle to take the comfort out of a man and lacker him down like a boot  the ship has gone about  like a dancingmaster with two toes we have got her head to the southward and westward again another reef in the topsails which word mr truck pronounced tawsails with great unction england well under our lee and the atlantic ocean right before us six hours on this course and we make a fair wind of it  and the sloop     chapter ix            the moon was now   rising full orbed but broken by a cloud   the wind was hushed and the sea mirrorlike    italy   most of the passengers appeared on deck soon after saunders was again heard rattling among his glasses the day was sufficiently advanced to allow a distinct view of all that was passing and the wind had shifted the change had not occurred more than ten minutes and as most of the inmates of the cabin poured up the cabinstairs nearly in a body mr leach had just got through with the necessary operation of bracing the yards about for the breeze which was coming stiff now blew from the northeast no land was visible and the mate was just giving his opinion that they were up with scilly as captain truck appeared in the group  one glance aloft and another at the heavens sufficed to let the experienced master into all the secrets of his present situation his next step was to jump into the rigging and to take a look at the sea in the direction of the lizard there to his extreme disappointment appeared a ship with everything set that would draw and with a studdingsail flapping before it could be drawn down which he knew in an instant to be the foam at this spectacle mr truck compressed his lips and made an inward imprecation that it would ill comport with our notions of propriety to repeat  turn the hands up and shake out the reefs sir he said coolly to his mate for it was a standing rule of the captains to seem calmest when he was in the greatest rage turn them up sir and show every rag that will draw from the truck to the lower studdingsail boom and be dd to them  on this hint mr leach bestirred himself and the men were quickly on the yards casting loose gaskets and reefpoints sail opened after sail and as the steerage passengers who could show a force of thirty or forty men aided with their strength the montauk was soon running dead before the wind under every thing that would draw and with studdingsails on both sides the mates looked surprised the seamen cast inquiring glances aft but mr truck lighted a cigar  gentlemen said the captain after a few philosophical whiffs to go to america with yonder fellow on my weather beam is quite out of the question he would be up with me and in possession before ten oclock and my only play is to bring the wind right over the taffrail where luckily we have got it i think we can bother him at this sport for your sharp bottoms are not as good as your kettlebottoms in ploughing a full furrow as for bearing her canvas the montauk will stand it as long as any ship in king williams navy before the gale and on one thing you may rely ill carry you all into lisbon before that tobaccohating rover shall carry you back to portsmouth this is a category to which i will stick  this characteristic explanation served to let the passengers understand the real state of the case no one remonstrated for all preferred a race to being taken and even the englishmen on board began again to take sides with the vessel they were in and this the more readily as captain truck freely admitted that their cruiser was too much for him on every tack but the one he was about to try mr sharp hoped that they might now escape and as for sir george templemore he generously repeated his offer to pay out of his own pocket all the portcharges in any french spanish or portuguese harbour the master would enter rather than see such an outrage done a foreign vessel in a time of profound peace  the expedient of captain truck proved his judgment and his knowledge of his profession within an hour it was apparent that if there was any essential difference in the sailing of the two ships under the present circumstances it was slightly in favour of the montauk the foam now set her ensign for the first time a signal that she wished to speak the ship in sight at this captain truck chuckled for he pronounced it a sign that she was conscious she could not get them within range of her guns  show him the gridiron cried the captain briskly it will not do to be beaten in civility by a man who has beaten us already on so many other tacks but keep all fast as a churchdoor on a weekday  this latter comparison was probably owing to the circumstance of the masters having come from a part of the country where all the religion is compressed into the twentyfour hours that commence on a saturdaynight at sunset and end at sunset the next day at least this was his own explanation of the matter the effect of success was always to make mr truck loquacious and he now began to tell many excellent anecdotes of which he had stores all of events that had happened to him in person or of which he had been an eyewitness and on which his hearers as sancho said might so certainly depend as true that if they chose they might safely swear they had seen them themselves  speaking of churches and doors sir george he said between the puffs of the cigar were you ever in rhode island  never as this is my first visit to america captain  true well you will be likely to go there if you go to boston as it is the best way unless you would prefer to run over nantucket shoals and a hundred miles of ditto as mr dodge calls it  ditter captain if you pleaseditter it is the continental word for roundabout  the dl it is it is worth knowing however and what may be the french for peejacket  you mistake me sirditter a circuit or the longer way  that is the road we are now travelling by georgei say leach do you happen to know that we are making a ditter to america  you were speaking of a church captain truck politely interposed sir george who had become rather intimate with his fellowoccupant of the stateroom  i was travelling through that state a few years since on my way from providence to new london at a time when a new road had just been opened it was on a sunday and the stagea fourhorse power you must knowhad never yet run through on the lordsday well we might be as it were off here at right angles to our course and there was a short turn in the road as one would say out yonder as we hove in sight of the turn i saw a chap at the masthead of a tree down he slid and away he went right before it towards a meetinghouse two or three cables length down the road we followed at a smart jog and just before we got the church abeam out poured the whole congregation horse and foot parson and idlers sinners and hypocrites to see the fourhorse power go past now this is what i call keeping the churchdoor open on a sunday  we might have hesitated about recording this anecdote of the captains had we not received an account of the same occurrence from a quarter that left no doubt that his version of the affair was substantially correct this and a few similar adventures some of which he invented and all of which he swore were literal enabled the worthy master to keep the quarterdeck in good humour while the ship was running at the rate of ten knots the hour in a line so far diverging from her true course but the relief to landsmen is so great in general in meeting with a fair wind at sea that few are disposed to quarrel with its consequences a bright day a steady ship the pleasure of motion as they raced with the combing seas and the interest of the chase set every one at ease and even steadfast dodge was less devoured with envy a jealousy of his own deservings and the desire of management than usual not an introduction occurred and yet the little world of the ship got to be better acquainted with each other in the course of that day than would have happened in months of the usual collision on land  the montauk continued to gain on her pursuer until the sun set when captain truck began once more to cast about him for the chances of the night he knew that the ship was running into the mouth of the bay of biscay or at least was fast approaching it and he bethought him of the means of getting to the westward the night promised to be anything but dark for though a good many wildlooking clouds were by this time scudding athwart the heavens the moon diffused a sort of twilight gleam in the air waiting patiently however until the middlewatch was again called he reduced sail and hauled the ship off to a southwest course hoping by this slight change insensibly to gain an offing before the foam was aware of it a scheme that he thought more likely to be successful as by dint of sheer driving throughout the day he had actually caused the courses of that vessel to dip before the night shut in  even the most vigilant become weary of watching and captain truck was unpleasantly disturbed next morning by an alarm that the foam was just out of gunshot coming up with them fast on gaining the deck he found the fact indisputable favoured by the change in the course the cruiser had been gradually gaining on the montauk ever since the first watch was relieved and had indeed lessened the distance between the respective ships by twothirds no remedy remained but to try the old expedient of getting the wind over the taffrail once more and of showing all the canvas that could be spread as like causes are known to produce like effects the expedient brought about the old results the packet had the best of it and the sloopofwar slowly fell astern mr truck now declared he would make a regular business of it and accordingly he drove his ship in that direction throughout the day the following night and until near noon of the day which succeeded varying his course slightly to suit the wind which he studiously kept so near aft as to allow the studdingsails to draw on both sides at meridian on the fourth day out the captain got a good observation and ascertained that the ship was in the latitude of oporto with an offing of less than a degree at this time the topgallant sails of the foam might be discovered from the deck resembling a boat clinging to the watery horizon as he had fully made up his mind to run into port in preference to being overhauled the master had kept so near the land with an intention of profiting by his position in the event of any change favouring his pursuers but he now believed that at sunset he should be safe in finally shaping his course for america  there must be doublefortified eyes aboard that fellow to see what we are about at this distance when the night is once shut in he said to mr leach who seconded all his orders with obedient zeal and we will watch our moment to slip out fairly into the great prairie and then we shall discover who best knows the trail youll be for trotting off to the prairies sir george as soon as we get in and for trying your hand at the buffaloes like all the rest of them ten years since if an englishman came to look at us he was afraid of being scalped in broadway and now he is never satisfied unless he is astraddle of the rocky mountains in the first fortnight i take over lots of cockneyhunters every summer who just get a shot at a grizzly bear or two or at an antelope and come back in time for the opening of drury lane  should we not be more certain of accomplishing your plans by seeking refuge in lisbon for a day or two i confess now i should like to see lisbon and as for the portcharges i would rather pay them twice than that this poor man should be torn from his wife on this point i hope captain truck i have made myself sufficiently explicit  captain truck shook the baronet heartily by the hand as he always did when this offer was renewed declaring that his feelings did him honour  never fear for davis he said old grab shall not have him this tack nor the foam neither ill throw him overboard before such a disgrace befall us or him well this leech has driven us from the old road and nothing now remains but to make the southern passage unless the wind prevail at south  the montauk in truth had not much varied from a course that was once greatly in favour with the london ships lisbon and new york being nearly in the same parallel of latitude and the currents if properly improved often favouring the run it is true the montauk had kept closer in with the continent by a long distance than was usual even for the passage he had named but the peculiar circumstances of the chase had left no alternative as the master explained to his listeners  it was a coasting voyage or a tow back to portsmouth sir george he said and of the two i know you like the montauk too well to wish to be quit of her so soon  to this the baronet gave a willing assent protesting that his feelings had got so much enlisted on the side of the vessel he was in that he would cheerfully forfeit a thousand pounds rather than be overtaken the master assured him that was just what he liked and swore that he was the sort of passenger he most delighted in  when a man puts his foot on the deck of a ship sir george he should look upon her as his home his church his wife and children his uncles and aunts and all the other lumber ashore this is the sentiment to make seamen now i entertain a greater regard for the shortest ropeyarn aboard this ship than for the topsailsheets or best bower of any other vessel it is like a mans loving his own finger or toe before another persons i have heard it said that one should love his neighbour as well as himself but for my part i love my ship better than my neighbours or my neighbour himself and i fancy if the truth were known my neighbour pays me back in the same coin for my part i like a thing because it is mine  a little before dark the head of the montauk was inclined towards lisbon as if her intention was to run in but the moment the dark spot that pointed out the position of the foam was lost in the haze of the horizon captain truck gave the order to ware and sail was made to the westsouthwest  most of the passengers felt an intense curiosity to know the state of things on the following morning and all the men among them were dressed and on deck just as the day began to break the wind had been fresh and steady all night and as the ship had been kept with her yards a little checked and topmast studdingsails set the officers reported her to be at least a hundred miles to the westward of the spot where she veered the reader will imagine the disappointment the latter experienced then when they beheld the foam a little on their weatherquarter edging away for them as assiduously as she had been hauling up for them the night they sailed from portsmouth distant little more than a league  this is indeed extraordinary perseverance said paul blunt to eve at whose side he was standing at the moment the fact was ascertained and i think our captain might do well to heaveto and ascertain its cause  i hope not cried his companion with vivacity i confess to an esprit de corps and a gallant determination to see it out as mr leach styles his own resolution one does not like to be followed about the ocean in this manner unless it be for the interest it gives the voyage after all how much better is this than dull solitude and what a zest it gives to the monotony of the ocean  do you then find the ocean a scene of monotony  such it has oftener appeared to me than anything else and i give it a fair trial having never le mal de mer but i acquit it of this sin now for the interest of a chase in reasonably good weather is quite equal to that of a horserace which is a thing i delight in even mr john effingham can look radiant under its excitement  and when this is the case he is singularly handsome a nobler outline of face is seldom seen than that of mr john effingham  he has a noble outline of soul if he did but know it himself returned eve warmly i love no one as much as he with the exception of my father and as mademoiselle viefville would say pour cause  the young man could have listened all day but eve smiled bowed graciously though with a glistening eye and hastily left the deck conscious of having betrayed some of her most cherished feelings to one who had no claim to share them  captain truck while vexed to his hearts core or as he expressed it himself struck aback like an old lady shot off a handsled in sliding down hill was prompt in applying the old remedy to the evil the montauk was again put before the wind sail was made and the fortunes of the chase were once more cast on the play of the ship  the commander of the foam certainly deprecated this change for it was hardly made before he set his ensign and fired a gun but of these signals no other notice was taken than to show a flag in return when the captain and his mates proceeded to get the bearings of the sloopofwar ten minutes showed they were gaining twenty did better and in an hour she was well on the quarter  another day of strife succeeded or rather of pure sailing for not a rope was started on board the montauk the wind still standing fresh and steady the sloop made many signals all indicating a desire to speak the montauk but captain truck declared himself too experienced a navigator to be caught by bunting and in too great a hurry to stop and chat by the way  vattel had laid down no law for such a piece of complaisance in a time of profound peace i am not to be caught by that category  the result may be anticipated from what has been already related the two ships kept before the wind until the foam was again far astern and the observations of captain truck told him he was as far south as the azores in one of these islands he was determined to take refuge provided he was not favoured by accident for going farther south was out of the question unless absolutely driven to it calculating his distance on the evening of the sixth day out he found that he might reach an anchorage at pico before the sloopofwar could close with him even allowing the necessity of hauling up again by the wind  but providence had ordered differently towards midnight the breeze almost failed and became baffling and when the day dawned the officer of the watch reported that it was ahead the pursuing ship though still in sight was luckily so far astern and to leeward as to prevent any danger from a visit by boats and there was leisure to make the preparations that might become necessary on the springing up of a new breeze of the speedy occurrence of such a change there was now every symptom the heavens lighting up at the northwest a quarter from which the genius of the storms mostly delights in making a display of his power     chapter x            i come with mightier things   who calls mo silent i have many tones   the dark sky thrills with low mysterious moans   borne on my sweeping winds    mrs hemans   the awaking of the winds on the ocean is frequently attended with signs and portents as sublime as any the fancy can conceive on the present occasion the breeze that had prevailed so steadily for a week was succeeded by light baffling puffs as if conscious of the mighty powers of the air that were assembling in their strength these inferior blasts were hurrying to and fro for a refuge the clouds too were whirling about in uncertain eddies many of the heaviest and darkest descending so low along the horizon that they had an appearance of settling on the waters in quest of repose but the waters themselves were unnaturally agitated the billows no longer following each other in long regular waves were careering upwards like fiery coursers suddenly checked in their mad career the usual order of the eternally unquiet ocean was lost in a species of chaotic tossings of the element the seas heaving themselves upward without order and frequently without visible cause this was the reaction of the currents and of the influence of breezes still older than the last not the least fearful symptom of the hour was the terrific calmness of the air amid such a scene of menacing wildness even the ship came into the picture to aid the impression of intense expectation for with her canvas reduced she too seemed to have lost that instinct which had so lately guided her along the trackless waste and was wallowing nearly helpless among the confused waters still she was a beautiful and a grand object perhaps more so at that moment than at any other for her vast and naked spars her wellsupported masts and all the ingenious and complicated hamper of the machine gave her a resemblance to some sinewy and gigantic gladiator pacing the arena in waiting for the conflict that was at hand  this is an extraordinary scene said eve who clung to her fathers arm as she gazed around her equally in admiration and in awe a dreadful exhibition of the sublimity of nature  although accustomed to the sea returned mr blunt i have witnessed these ominous changes but twice before and i think this the grandest of them all  were the others followed by tempests inquired the anxious parent  one brought a tremendous gale while the other passed away like a misfortune of which we get a near view but are permitted to escape the effects  i do not know that i wish such to be entirely our present fortune rejoined eve for there is so much sublimity in this view of the ocean unaroused that i feel desirous of seeing it when aroused  we are not in the hurricane latitudes or hurricane months resumed the young man and it is not probable that there is anything more in reserve for us than a hearty gale of wind which may at least help us to get rid of yonder troublesome follower  even that i do not wish provided he will let us continue the race on our proper route a chase across the atlantic would be something to enjoy at the moment gentlemen and something to talk of in after life  i wonder if such a thing be possible exclaimed mr sharp it would indeed be an incident to recount to another generation  there is little probability of our witnessing such an exploit mr blunt remarked for gales of wind on the ocean have the same separating influence on consorts of the sea that domestic gales have on consorts of the land nothing is more difficult than to keep ships and fleets in sight of each other in very heavy weather unless indeed those of the best qualities are disposed to humour those of the worst  i know not which may be called the best or which the worst in this instance for our tormentor appears to be as much better than ourselves in some particulars as we are better than he in others if the humouring is to come from our honest captain it will be some such humouring as the spoiled child gets from a capricious parent in moments o anger  mr truck passed the group at that instant and heard his name coupled with the word honest in the mouth of eve though he lost the rest of the sentence  thank you for the compliment my dear young lady he said and i wish i could persuade captain somebody of his britannic majestys ship foam to be of the same way of thinking it is all because he will not fancy me honest in the article of tobacco that he has got the montauk down here on the spanish coast where the man who built her would not know her so unnatural and unseemly is it to catch a london liner so far out of her track i shall have to use double care to get the good craft home again  and why this particular difficulty captain eve who was amused with mr trucks modes of speech pleasantly inquired is it not equally easy to go from one part of the ocean as from another  equally easy bless you my dear young lady you never made a more capital mistake in your life do you imagine it is as easy to go from london to new york now as to go from new york to london  i am so ignorant as to have made this ridiculous mistake if mistake it be nor do i now see why it should be otherwise  simply because it is uphill maam as for our position here to the eastward of the azores the difficulty is soon explained by dint of coaxing i had got the good old ship so as to know every inch of the road on the northern passage and now i shall be obliged to wheedle her along on a new route like a shy horse getting through a new stabledoor one might as well think of driving a pig from his sty as to get a ship out of her track  we trust to you to do all this and much more at need but to what will these grand omens lead shall we have a gale or is so much magnificent menacing to be taken as an empty threat of natures  that we shall know in the coarse of the day miss effingham though nature is no bully and seldom threatens in vain there is nothing more curious to study or which needs a nicer eye to detect than your winds  of the latter i am fully persuaded captain for they are called the viewless winds you will remember and the greatest authority we possess speaks of them as being quite beyond the knowledge of man that we may hear the sound of the wind but cannot tell whence it cometh or whither it goeth  i do not remember the writer you mean my dear young lady returned mr truck quite innocently but he was a sensible fellow for i believe vattel has never yet dared to grapple with the winds there are people who fancy the weather is foretold in the almanack but according to my opinion it is safer to trust a rheumatis of two or three years standing a good wellestablished oldfashioned rheumatisi say nothing of your newfangled diseases like the cholera and varioloid and animal magnitudesbut a good oldfashioned rheumatis such as people used to have when i was a boy is as certain a barometer as that which is at this moment hanging up in the coachhouse here within two fathoms of the very spot where we are standing i once had a rheumatis that i set much store by for it would let me know when to look out for easterly weather quite as infallibly as any instrument i ever sailed with i never told you the story of the old connecticut horsejockey and the typhoon i believe and as we are doing nothing but waiting for the weather to make up its mind  the weather to make up its mind exclaimed eve looking around her in awe at the sublime and terrific grandeur of the ocean of the heavens and of the pent and moody air is there an uncertainty in this  lord bless you my dear young lady the weather is often as uncertain and as undecided and as hard to please too as an old girl who gets sudden offers on the same day from a widower with ten children an attorney with one leg and the parson of the parish uncertain indeed why i have known the weather in this grandiloquent condition for a whole day mr dodge there will tell you it is making up its mind which way it ought to blow to be popular so as we have nothing better to do mr effingham i will tell you the story about my neighbour the horsejockey hauling yards when there is no wind is like playing on a jewsharp at a concert of trombones  mr effingham made a complaisant sign of assent and pressed the arm of the excited eve for patience  you must know gentlemen the captain commenced looking round to collect as many listeners as possiblefor he excessively disliked lecturing to small audiences when he had anything to say that he thought particularly cleveryou must know that we had formerly many craft that went between the river and the islands  the river interrupted the amused mr sharp  certain the connecticut i mean we all call it the river down our waybetween the river and the west indies with horses cattle and other knickknacks of that description among others was old joe bunk who had followed the trade in a highdecked brig for some twentythree years he and the brig having grown old in company like man and wife about forty years since our river ladies began to be tired of their bohea and as there was a good deal said in favour of souchong in those days an excitement was got up on the subject as mr dodge calls it and it was determined to make an experiment in the new quality before they dipped fairly into the trade well what do you suppose was done in the premises as vattel says my dear young lady  eves eyes were still on the grand and portentous aspect of the heavens but she civilly answered  no doubt they sent to a shop and purchased a sample  not they they knew too much for that since any rogue of a grocer might cheat them when the excitement had got a little headway on it they formed a tea society with the parsons wife for presidentess and her oldest daughter for secretary in this way they went to work until the men got into the fever too and a project was set afoot to send a craft to china for a sample of what they wanted  china exclaimed eve this time looking the captain fairly in the face  china certain it lies off hereaway you know round on the other side of the earth well whom should they choose to go on the errand but old joe bunk the old man had been so often to the islands and back without knowing anything of navigation they thought he was just their man as there was no such thing as losing him  one would think he was the very man to get lost observed mr effingham while the captain fitted a fresh cigar for smoke he would and did in any company that was out of the cabin although he always professed a readiness to cease if any person disliked the fragrance of tobacco  not he sir he was just as well off in the indian ocean as he would be here for he knew nothing about either well joe fitted up the brig the seven dollies was her name for you must know we had seven ladies in the town who were cally dolly and they each of them used to send a colt or a steer or some other delicate article to the islands by joe whenever he went so he fitted up the seven dollies hoisted in his dollars and made sail the last that was seen or heard of the old man for eight months was off montauk where he was fallen in with two days out steering southeasterly by compass  i should think observed john effingham who began to arouse himself as the story proceeded that mrs bunk must have been very uneasy all this time  not she she stuck to the bohea in hopes the souchong would arrive before the restoration of the jews arrive it did sure enough at the end of eight months and a capital adventure it proved for all concerned old joe got a great name in the river for the exploit though how he got to china no one could say or how he got back again or for a long time how he got the huge heavy silver teapot he brought home with him  a silver teapot  exactly that article at last the truth came to be known for it is not an easy matter to hide anything of that nature down our way it is aristocratic as mr dodge says to keep a secret at first they tried joe with all sorts of questions but he gave them guess for guess then people began to talk and finally it was fairly whispered that the old man had stolen the teapot this brought him before the meetinglaw was out of the question you will understand as there was no evidence but the meeting dont stick much at particulars provided people talk a good deal  and the result asked john effingham i suppose the parish took the teapot and left joe the grounds  you are as far out of the way as we are here down on the coast of spain the truth is just this the seven dollies was lying among the rest of them at anchor below canton with the weather as fine as young girls love to see it in may when joe began to get down his yards to house his masts and to send out all his spare anchors he even went so far as to get two hawsers fastened to a junk that had grounded a little ahead of him this made a talk among the captains of the vessels and some came on board to ask the reason joe told them he was getting ready for the typhoon but when they inquired his reasons for believing there was to be a typhoon at all joe looked solemn shook his head and said he had reasons enough but they were his own had he been explicit he would have been laughed at but the sight of an old greyheaded man who had been at sea forty years getting ready in this serious manner set the others at work too for ships follow each others movements like sheep running through a breach in the fence well that night the typhoon came in earnest and it blew so hard that joe bunk said he could see the houses in the moon all the air having blown out of the atmosphere  but what has this to do with the teapot captain truck  it is the life and soul of it the captains in port were so delighted with joes foreknowledge that they clubbed and presented him this pot as a testimony of their gratitude and esteem hed got to be popular among them mr dodge and that was the way they proved it  but pray how did he know the storm was approaching asked eve whose curiosity had been awakened in spite of herself it could not have been that his foreknowledge was supernatural  that no one can say for joe was presbyterianbuilt as we say kettlebottomed and stowed well the truth was not discovered until ten years afterwards when the old fellow got to be a regular cripple what between rheumatis old age and steaming one day he had an attack of the first complaint and in one of its most severe paroxysms when nature is apt to wince he roared three times a typhoon a typhoon a typhoon and the murder was out sure enough the next day we had a regular northeaster but old joe got no sign of popularity that time and now when you get to america gentlemen and ladies you will be able to say you have heard the story of joe bunk and his teapot  thereupon captain truck took two or three hearty whiffs of the cigar turned his face upwards and permitted the smoke to issue forth in a continued stream until it was exhausted but still keeping his head raised in the inconvenient position it had taken the eye of the master fastened in this manner on something aloft was certain to draw other eyes in the same direction and in a few seconds all around him were gazing in the same way though none but himself could tell why  turn up the watch below mr leach captain truck at length called out and eve observed that he threw away the cigar although a fresh one a proof as she fancied that he was preparing for duty  the people were soon at their places and an effort was made to get the ships head round to the southward although the frightful stillness of the atmosphere rendered the manoeuvre difficult it succeeded in the end by profiting by the passing and fitful currents that resembled so many sighings of the air the men were then sent on the yards to furl all the canvas with the exception of the three topsails and the forecourse most of it having been merely hauled up to await the result all those who had ever been at sea before saw in these preparations proof that captain truck expected the change would be sudden and severe still as he betrayed no uneasiness they hoped his measures were merely those of prudence mr effingham could not refrain from inquiring however if there existed any immediate motives for the preparations that were so actively though not hurriedly making  this is no affair for the rheumatis returned the facetious master for look you here my worthy sir and you my dear young ladythis was a sort of parental familiarity the honest jack fancied he had a right to take with all his unmarried female passengers in virtue of his office and of his being a bachelor drawing hard upon sixtylook you here my dear young lady and you too maamselle for you can understand the clouds i take it if they are not french clouds do you not see the manner in which those blacklooking rascals are putting their heads together they are plotting something quite in their own way ill warrant you  the clouds are huddling and rolling over each other certainly returned eve who had been struck with the wild beauty of their evolutions and a noble though fearful picture they present but i do not understand the particular meaning of it if there be any hidden omen in their airy flights  no rheumatis about you young lady said the captain jocularly too young and handsome and too modern too i dare say for that oldfashioned complaint but on one category you may rely and that is that nothing in nature conspires without an object  but i do not think vapour whirling in a current of air is a conspiracy answered eve laughing though it may be a category  perhaps notwho knows however for it is as easy to suppose that objects understand each other as that horses and dogs understand each other we know nothing about it and therefore it behooves us to say nothing if mankind conversed only of the things they understood half the words might be struck out of the dictionaries but as i was remarking those clouds you can see are getting together and are making ready for a start since here they will not be able to stay much longer  and what will compel them to disappear  do me the favour to turn your eyes here to the norwest you see an opening there that looks like a crouching lion is it not so  there is certainly a bright clear streak of sky along the margin of the ocean that has quite lately made its appearance does it prove that the wind will blow from that quarter  quite as much my dear young lady as when you open your window it proves that you mean to put your head out of it  an act a wellbred young woman very seldom performs observed mademoiselle viefville and never in a town  no well in our town on the river the womens heads are half the time out of the windows but i do not pretend maamselle to be expert in proprieties of this sort though i can venture to say that i am somewhat of a judge of what the winds would be about when they open their shutters this opening to the norwest then is a sure sign of something coming out of the window wellbred or not  but added eve the clouds above us and those farther south appear to be hurrying towards your bright opening captain instead of from it  quite in nature gentlemen quite in nature ladies when a man has fully made up his mind to retreat he blusters the most and one step forward often promises two backward you often see the stormy petterel sailing at a ship as if he meant to come aboard but he takes good care to put his helm down before he is fairly in the rigging so it is with clouds and all other things in nature vattel says you may make a show of fight when your necessities require it but that a neutral cannot fire a gun unless against pirates now these clouds are putting the best face on the matter but in a few minutes you will see them wheeling as st paul did before them  st paul captain truck  yes my dear young lady to the right about  eve frowned for she disliked some of these nautical images though it was impossible not to smile in secret at the queer associations that so often led the wellmeaning masters discursive discourse his mind was a strange jumble of an early religious educationreligious as to externals and professions at leastwith subsequent loose observation and much worldly experience and he drew on his stock of information according to his own account of the matter as saunders the steward cut the butter from the firkins or as it came first  his prediction concerning the clouds proved to be true for half an hour did not pass before they were seen scampering out of the way of the norwester to use the captains figure like sheep giving play to the dogs the horizon brightened with a rapidity almost supernatural and in a surprisingly short space of time the whole of that frowning vault that had been shadowed by murky and menacing vapour sporting its gambols in ominous wildness was cleared of everything like a cloud with the exception of a few white rich fleecy piles that were grouped in the north like a battery discharging its artillery on some devoted field  the ship betrayed the arrival of the wind by a cracking of the spars as they settled into their places and then the huge hull began to push aside the waters and to come under control the first shock was far from severe though as the captain determined to bring his vessel up as near his course as the direction of the breeze would permit he soon found he had as much canvas spread as she could bear twenty minutes brought him to a single reef and half an hour to a second  by this time attention was drawn to the foam the old superiority of that cruiser was now apparent again and calculations were made concerning the possibility of avoiding her if they continued to stand on much longer on the present course the captain had hoped the montauk would have the advantage from her greater bulk when the two vessels should be brought down to closereefed topsails as he foresaw would be the case but he was soon compelled to abandon even that hope further to the southward he was resolved he would not go as it would be leading him too far astray and at last he came to the determination to stand towards the islands which were as near as might be in his track and to anchor in a neutral roadstead if too hard pressed  he cannot get up with us before midnight leach he concluded the conference held with the mate by saying and by that time the gale will be at its height if we are to have a gale and then the gentleman will not be desirous of lowering his boats in the mean time we shall be driving in towards the azores and it will be nothing out of the course of nature should i find an occasion to play him a trick as for offering up the montauk a sacrifice on the altar of tobacco as old deacon hourglass used to say in his prayers it is a category to be averted by any catastrophe short of condemnation     chapter xi                 i that shower dewy light   through slumbering leaves bring stormsthe tempest birth   of memory thought remorsebe holy earth   i am the solemn night    mrs hemans   in this instance it is not our task to record any of the phenomena of the ocean but a regular though fierce gale of wind one of the first signs of its severity was the disappearance of the passengers from the deck one shutting himself in his room after another until none remained visible but john effingham and paul blunt both these gentlemen as it appeared had made so many passages and had got to be so familiar with ships that seasickness and alarms were equally impotent as respects their constitutions and temperaments  the poor steeragepassengers were no exception but they stole for refuge into their dens heartily repentant for the time being at having braved the dangers and discomforts of the sea the gentle wife of davis would now willingly have returned to meet the resentment of her uncle and as for the bridegroom himself as mr leach who passed through this scene of abominations to see that all was right described himmr grab would not wring him for a dishcloth if he could see him in his present pickle  captain truck chuckled a good deal at this account for he had much the same sympathy for ordinary cases of seasickness as a kitten feels in the agony of the first mouse it has caught and which it is its sovereign pleasure to play with instead of eating  it serves him right mr leach for getting married and mind you dont fall into the same abuse of your opportunities he said with an air of selfsatisfaction while comparing three or four cigars in the palm of his hand doubtful which of the fragrant plump rolls to put into his mouth getting married mr blunt commonly makes a man a fit subject for nausea and nothing is easier than to set the stomachpump in motion in one of your bridegrooms is not this true as the gospel mr john effingham  mr john effingham made no replybut the young man who at the moment was admiring his fine form and the noble outline of his features was singularly struck with the bitterness not to say anguish of the smile with which he bowed a cold assent all this was lost on captain truck who proceeded con amore  one of the first things that i ask concerning my passengers is is he married when the answer is no i set him down as a good companion in a gale like this or as one who can smoke or crack a joke when a topsail is flying out of a boltropea companion for a category now if either of you gentlemen had a wife she would have you under hatches today lest you should slip through a scupperholeor be washed overboard with the sprayor have your eyebrows blown away in such a gale and then i should lose the honour of your company comfort is too precious to be thrown away in matrimony a man may gain foreknowledge by a wife but he loses free agency as for you mr john effingham you must have coiled away about half a century of life and there is not much to fear on your account but mr blunt is still young enough to be in danger of a mishap i wish neptune would come aboard of us hereaway and swear you to be true and constant to yourself young gentleman  paul laughed coloured slightly and then rallying he replied in the same voice  at the risk of losing your good opinion captain and even in the face of this gale i shall avow myself an advocate of matrimony  if you will answer me one question my dear sir i will tell you whether the case is or is not hopeless  in order to assent to this you will of course see the necessity of letting me know what the question is  have you made up your mind who the young woman shall be if that point is settled i can only recommend to you some of joe bunks souchong and advise you to submit for there is no resisting ones fate the reason your turks yield so easily to predestination and fate is the number of their wives many a book is written to show the cause of their submitting their necks so easily to the sword and the bowstring ive been in turkey gentlemen and know something of their ways the reason of their submitting so quietly to be beheaded is that they are always ready to hang themselves how is the fact sir have you settled upon the young lady in your own mind or not  although there was nothing in all this but the permitted trifling of boon companions on shipboard paul blunt received it with an awkwardness one would hardly have expected in a young man of his knowledge of the world he reddened laughed made an effort to throw the captain to a greater distance by reserve and in the end fairly gave up the matter by walking to another part of the deck luckily the attention of the honest master was drawn to the ship at that instant and paul flattered himself he was unperceived but the shadow of a figure at his elbow startled him and turning quickly he found mr john effingham at his side  her mother was an angel said the latter huskily i too love her but it is as a father  sirmr effinghamthese are sudden and unexpected remarks and such as i am not prepared for  do you think one as jealous of that fair creature as i could have overlooked your passionshe is loved by both of you and she merits the warmest affection of a thousand persevere for while i have no voice and i fear little influence on her decision some strange sympathy causes me to wish you success my own man told me that you have met before and with her fathers knowledge and this is all i ask for my kinsman is discreet he probably knows you though i do not  the face of paul glowed like fire and he almost gasped for breath pitying his distress effingham smiled kindly and was about to quit him when he felt his hand convulsively grasped by those of the young man  do not quit me mr effingham i entreat you he said rapidly it is so unusual for me to hear words of confidence or even of kindness that they are most precious to me i have permitted myself to be disturbed by the random remarks of that wellmeaning but unreflecting man but in a moment i shall be more composedmore manlyless unworthy of your attention and pity  pity is a word i should never have thought of applying to the person character attainments or as i hoped fortunes of mr blunt and i sincerely trust that you will acquit me of impertinence i have felt an interest in you young man that i have long ceased to feel in most of my species and i trust this will be some apology for the liberty i have taken perhaps the suspicion that you were anxious to stand well in the good opinion of my little cousin was at the bottom of it all  indeed you have not misconceived my anxiety sir for who is there that could be indifferent to the good opinion of one so simple and yet so cultivated with a mind in which nature and knowledge seem to struggle for the possession one mr effingham so little like the cold sophistication and heartlessness of europe on the one hand and the unformed girlishness of america on the other one in short so every way what the fondest father or the most sensitive brother could wish  john effingham smiled for to smile at any weakness was with him a habit but his eye glistened after a moment of doubt he turned to his young companion and with a delicacy of expression and a dignity of manner that none could excel him in when he chose he put a question that for several days had been uppermost in his thoughts though no fitting occasion had ever before offered on which he thought he might venture  this frank confidence emboldens meone who ought to be ashamed to boast of his greater experience when every day shows him to how little profit it has been turned to presume to render our acquaintance less formal by alluding to interests more personal than strangers have a right to touch on you speak of the two parts of the world just mentioned in a way to show me you are equally acquainted with both  i have often crossed the ocean and for so young a man have seen a full share of their societies perhaps it increases my interest in your lovely kinswoman that like myself she properly belongs to neither  be cautious how you whisper that in her ear my youthful friend for eve effingham fancies herself as much american in character as in birth singleminded and totally without managementdevoted to her duties religious without canta warm friend of liberal institutions without the slightest approach to the impracticable in heart and soul a woman you will find it hard to persuade her that with all her practice in the world and all her extensive attainments she is more than a humble copy of heir own great beau idéal  paul smiled and his eyes met those of john effinghamthe expression of both satisfied the parties that they thought alike in more things than in their common admiration of the subject of their discourse  i feel i have not been as explicit as i ought to be with you mr effingham the young man resumed after a pause but on a more fitting occasion i shall presume on your kindness to be less reserved my lot has thrown me on the world almost without friends quite without relatives so far as intercourse with them is concerned and i have known little of the language or the acts of the affections  john effingham pressed his hand and from that time he cautiously abstained from any allusion to his personal concerns for a suspicion crossed his mind that the subject was painful to the young man he knew that thousands of welleducated and frequently of affluent people of both sexes were to be found in europe to whom from the circumstance of having been born out of wedlock through divorces or other family misfortunes their private histories were painful and he at once inferred that some such event quite probably the first lay at the bottom of paul blunts peculiar situation notwithstanding his warm attachment to eve he had too much confidence in her own as well as in her fathers judgment to suppose an acquaintance of any intimacy would be lightly permitted and as to the mere prejudices connected with such subjects he was quite free from them perhaps his masculine independence of character caused him on all such points to lean to the side of the ultra in liberality  in this short dialogue with the exception of the slight though unequivocal allusion of john effingham both bad avoided any farther allusions to mr sharp or to his supposed attachment to eve both were confident of its existence and this perhaps was one reason why neither felt any necessity to advert to it for it was a delicate subject and one under the circumstances that they would mutually wish to forget in their cooler moments the conversation then took a more general character and for several hours that day while the rest of the passengers were kept below by the state of the weather these two were together laying what perhaps it was now too late to term the foundation of a generous and sincere friendship hitherto paul had regarded john effingham with distrust and awe but he found him a man so different from what report and his own fancy had pictured that the reaction in his feelings served to heighten them and to aid in increasing his respect on the other hand the young man exhibited so much modest good sense a fund of information so much beyond his years such integrity and justice of sentiment that when they separated for the night the old bachelor was full of regret that nature had not made him the parent of such a son  all this time the business of the ship had gone on the wind increased steadily until as the sun went down captain truck announced it in the cabin to be a regularbuilt gale of wind sail after sail had been reduced or furled until the montauk was lyingto under her foresail a closereefed maintopsail a foretopmast staysail and a mizzen staysail doubts were even entertained whether the second of these sails would not have to be handed soon and the foresail itself reefed  the ships head was to the southsouthwest her drift considerable and her way of course barely sufficient to cause her to feel her helm the foam had gained on her several miles during the time sail could be carried but she also had been obliged to heaveto at the same increase of the sea and wind as that which had forced mr truck to lash his wheel down this state of things made a considerable change in the relative positions of the two vessels again the next morning showing the sloopofwar hull down and well on the weatherbeam of the packet her sharper mould and more weatherly qualities had done her this service as became a ship intended for war and the chase  at all this however captain truck laughed he could not be boarded in such weather and it was matter of indifference where his pursuer might be so long as he had time to escape when the gale ceased on the whole he was rather glad than otherwise of the present state of things for it offered a chance to slip away to leeward as soon as the weather would permit if indeed his tormentor did not altogether disappear in the northern board or to windward  the hopes and fears of the worthy master however were poured principally into the ears of his two mates for few of the passengers were visible until the afternoon of the second day of the gale then indeed a general relief to their physical suffering occurred though it was accompanied by apprehensions that scarcely permitted the change to be enjoyed about noon on that day the wind came with such power and the seas poured down against the bows of the ship with a violence so tremendous that it got to be questionable whether she could any longer remain with safety in her present condition several times in the course of the morning the waves had forced her bows off and before the ship could recover her position the succeeding billow would break against her broadside and throw a flood of water on her decks this is a danger peculiar to lyingto in a gale for if the vessel get into the trough of the sea and is met in that situation by a wave of unusual magnitude she runs the double risk of being thrown on her beamends and of having her decks cleared of everything by the cataract of water that washes athwart them landsmen entertain little notion of the power of the waters when driven before a tempest and are often surprised in reading of naval catastrophes at the description of the injuries done but experience shows that boats hurricanehouses guns anchors of enormous weight bulwarks and planks are even swept off into the ocean in this manner or are ripped up from their fastenings  the process of lyingto has a double advantage so long as it can be maintained since it offers the strongest portion of the vessel to the shock of the seas and has the merit of keeping her as near as possible to the desired direction but it is a middle course being often adopted as an expedient of safety when a ship cannot scud and then again it is abandoned for scudding when the gale is so intensely severe that it becomes in itself dangerous in nothing are the high qualities of ships so thoroughly tried as in their manner of behaving as it is termed in these moments of difficulty nor is the seamanship of the accomplished officer so triumphantly established in any other part of his professional knowledge as when he has had an opportunity of showing that he knows how to dispose of the vast weight his vessel is to carry so as to enable her mould to exhibit its perfection and on occasion to turn both to the best account  nothing will seem easier to a landsman than for a vessel to run before the wind let the force of the gale be what it may but his ignorance overlooks most of the difficulties nor shall we anticipate their dangers but let them take their places in the regular thread of the narrative  long before noon or the hour mentioned captain truck foresaw that in consequence of the seas that were constantly coming on board of her he should be compelled to put his ship before the wind he delayed the manoeuvre to the last moment however for what he deemed to be sufficient reasons the longer he kept the ship lyingto the less he deviated from his proper course to new york and the greater was the probability of his escaping stealthily and without observation from the foam since the latter by maintaining her position better allowed the montauk to drift gradually to leeward and of course to a greater distance  but the crisis would no longer admit of delay all hands were called the maintopsail was hauled up not without much difficulty and then captain truck reluctantly gave the order to haul down the mizzenstaysail to put the helm hard up and to help the ship round with the yards this is at all times a critical change as has just been mentioned for the vessel is exposed to the ravages of any sea larger than common that may happen to strike her as she lies nearly motionless with her broadside exposed to its force to accomplish it therefore captain truck went up a few ratlines in the forerigging he was too nice a calculator to offer even a surface as small as his own body to the wind in the after shrouds whence he looked out to windward for a lull and a moment when the ocean had fewer billows than common of the larger and more dangerous kind at the desired instant he signed with his hand and the wheel was shifted from harddown to hardup  this is always a breathless moment in a ship for as none can foresee the result it resembles the entrance of a hostile battery a dozen men may be swept away in an instant or the ship herself hove over on her side john effingham and paul who of all the passengers were alone on deck understood the hazards and they watched the slightest change with the interest of men who had so much at stake at first the movement of the ship was sluggish and such as illsuited the eagerness of the crew then her pitching ceased and she settled into the enormous trough bodily or the whole fabric sunk as it were never to rise again so low did she fall that the foresail gave a tremendous flap one that shook the hull and spars from stem to stern as she rose on the next surge happily its foaming crest slid beneath her and the tall masts rolled heavily to windward recovering her equilibrium the ship started through the brine and as the succeeding roller came on she was urging ahead fast still the sea struck her abeam forcing her bodily to leeward and heaving the lower yardarms into the ocean tons of water fell on her decks with the dull sound of the clod on the coffin at this grand moment old jack truck who was standing in the rigging dripping with he spray that had washed over him with a naked head and his grey hair glistening shouted like a stentor haul in your forebraces boys away with the yard like a fiddlestick every nerve was strained the unwilling yards pressed upon by an almost irresistible column of air yielded slowly and as the sail met the gale more perpendicularly or at right angles to its surface it dragged the vast hull through the sea with a power equal to that of a steamengine ere another sea could follow the montauk was glancing through the ocean at a furious rate and though offering her quarter to the billows their force was now so much diminished by her own velocity as to deprive them of their principal danger  the motion of the ship immediately became easy though her situation was still far from being without risk no longer compelled to buffet the waves but sliding along in their company the motion ceased to disturb the systems of the passengers and ten minutes had not elapsed before most of them were again on deck seeking the relief of the open air among the others was eve leaning on the arm of her father  it was a terrific scene though one might now contemplate it without personal inconvenience the gentlemen gathered around the beautiful and appalled spectatress of this grand sight anxious to know the effect it might produce on one of her delicate frame and habits she expressed herself as awed but not alarmed for the habits of dependence usually leave females less affected by fear in such cases than those who by their sex are supposed to be responsible  mademoiselle viefville has promised to follow me she said and as i have a national claim to be a sailor you are not to expect hysterics or even ecstasies from me but reserve yourselves gentlemen for the parisienne  the parisienne sure enough soon came out of the hurricanehouse with elevated hands and eyes eloquent of admiration wonder and fear her first exclamations were those of terror and then turning a wistful look on eve she burst into tears ah ceci est décisif she exclaimed when we part we shall be separated for life  then we will not part at all my dear mademoiselle you have only to remain in america to escape all future inconveniences of the ocean but forget the danger and admire the sublimity of this terrific panorama  well might eve thus term the scene the hazards now to be avoided were those of the ships broachingto and of being pooped nothing may seem easier as has been said than to sail before the wind the words having passed into a proverb but there are times when even a favouring gale becomes prolific of dangers that we shall now briefly explain  the velocity of the water urged as it is before a tempest is often as great as that of the ship and at such moments the rudder is useless its whole power being derived from its action as a moving body against the element in comparative repose when ship and water move together at an equal rate in the same direction of course this power of the helm is neutralized and then the hull is driven much at the mercy of the winds and waves nor is this all the rapidity of the billows often exceeds that of a ship and then the action of the rudder becomes momentarily reversed producing an effect exactly opposite to that which is desired it is true this last difficulty is never of more than a few moments continuance else indeed would the condition of the mariner be hopeless but it is of constant occurrence and so irregular as to defy calculations and defeat caution in the present instance the montauk would seem to fly through the water so swift was her progress and then as a furious surge overtook her in the chase she settled heavily into the element like a wounded animal that despairing of escape sinks helplessly in the grass resigned to fate at such times the crests of the waves swept past her like vapour in the atmosphere and one unpractised would be apt to think the ship stationary though in truth whirling along in company with a frightful momentum  it is scarcely necessary to say that the process of scudding requires the nicest attention to the helm in order that the hull may be brought speedily back to the right direction when thrown aside by the power of the billows for besides losing her way in the caldron of wateran imminent danger of itselfif left exposed to the attack of the succeeding wave her decks at least would be swept even should she escape a still more serious calamity  pooping is a hazard of another nature and is also peculiar to the process of scudding it merely means the ships being overtaken by the waters while running from them when the crest of a sea broken by the resistance is thrown inboard over the taffrail or quarter the term is derived from the name of that particular portion of the ship in order to avoid this risk sail is carried on the vessel as long as possible it being deemed one of the greatest securities of scudding to force the hull through the water at the greatest attainable rate in consequence of these complicated risks ships that sail the fastest and steer the easiest scud the best there is however a species of velocity that becomes of itself a source of new danger thus exceedingly sharp vessels have been known to force themselves so far into the watery mounds in their front and to receive so much of the element on decks as never to rise again this is a fate to which those who attempt to sail the american clipper without understanding its properties are peculiarly liable on account of this risk however there was now no cause of apprehension the fullbowed kettlebottomed montauk being exempt from the danger though captain truck intimated his doubts whether the corvette would like to brave the course he had himself adopted  in this opinion the fact would seem to sustain the master of the packet for when the night shut in the spars of the foam were faintly discernible drawn like spiders webs on the bright streak of the evening sky in a few more minutes even this tracery which resembled that of a magiclantern vanished from the eyes of those aloft for it had not been seen by any on deck for more than an hour  the magnificent horrors of the scene increased with the darkness eve and her companions stood supported by the hurricanehouse watching it for hours the supernaturallooking light emitted by the foaming sea rendering the spectacle one of attractive terror even the consciousness of the hazards heightened the pleasure for there was a solemn and grand enjoyment mingled with it all and the first watch had been set an hour before the party had resolution enough to tear themselves from the sublime sight of a raging sea     chapter xii      touch wast ever in court shepherd   cor no truly   touch then thou art damnd   cor nay i hope   touch truly thou art damnd like an illroasted egg all on                 one side    as you like it   no one thought of seeking his berth when all the passengers were below some conversed in broken half intelligible dialogues a few tried unavailingly to read and more sat looking at each other in silent misgivings as the gale howled through the cordage and spars or among the angles and bulwarks of the ship eve was seated on a sofa in her own apartment leaning on the breast of her father gazing silently through the open doors into the forward cabin for all idea of retiring within oneself unless it might be to secret prayer was banished from the mind even mr dodge had forgotten the gnawings of envy his philanthropical and exclusive democracy and what was perhaps more convincing still of his passing views of this sublunary world his profound deference for rank as betrayed in his strong desire to cultivate an intimacy with sir george templemore as for the baronet himself he sat by the cabintable with his face buried in his hands and once he had been heard to express a regret that he had ever embarked  saunders broke the moody stillness of this characteristic party with preparations for a supper he took but one end of the table for his cloth and a single cover showed that captain truck was about to dine a thing he had not yet done that day the attentive steward had an eye to his commanders tastes for it is not often one sees a better garnished board than was spread on this occasion so far at least as quantity was concerned besides the usual solids of ham cornedbeef and roasted shoat there were carcasses of ducks pickled oystersa delicacy almost peculiar to americaand all the minor condiments of olives anchovies dates figs almonds raisins cold potatoes and puddings displayed in a single course and arranged on the table solely with regard to the reach of captain trucks arm although saunders was not quite without taste he too well knew the propensities of his superior to neglect any of these important essentials and great care was had in particular so to dispose of everything as to render the whole so many radii diverging from a common centre which centre was the stationary armchair that the master of the packet loved to fill in his hours of ease  you will make many voyages mr toastthe steward affectedly gave his subordinate or as he was sometimes facetiously called the stewards mate reason to understand when they had retired to the pantry to await the captains appearancebefore you accumulate all the niceties of a gentlemans dinner every plat saunders had been in the havre line where he had caught a few words of this nature every plat should be within reach of the convives arm and particularly if it happen to be captain truck who has a great awersion to delays at his diet as for the entremets they may be scattered miscellaneously with the salt and the mustard so that they can come with facility in their proper places  i dont know what an entremet is returned the subordinate and i exceedingly desire sir to receive my orders in such english as a gentleman can diwine  an entremet mr toast is a mouthful thrown in promiscuously between the reliefs of the solids now suppose a gentleman begins on pig when he has eaten enough of this he likes a little brandy and water or a glass of porter before he cuts into the beef and while im mixing the first or starting the cork he refreshes himself with an entremet such as a wing of a duck or perhaps a plate of pickled oysters you must know that there is great odds in passengers one set eating and jollifying from the hour we sail till the hour we get in while another takes the ocean as it might be sentimentally  sentimentally sir i spose those be they as uses the basins uncommon  that depends on the weather ive known a party not eat as much as would set one handsome table in a week and then when they conwalesced it was intimidating how they dewoured it makes a great difference too whether the passengers acquiesce well together or not for agreeable feelings give a fine appetite lovers make cheap passengers always  that is extrornary for i thought such as they was always hard to please with every thing but one another  you never were more mistaken ive seen a lover who couldnt tell a sweet potato from an onion or a canvasback from an old wife but of all mortals in the way of passengers the bagman or gobetween is my greatest animosity these fellows will sit up all night if the captain consents and lie abed next day and do nothing but drink in their berths now this time we have a compliable set and on the whole it is quite a condescension and pleasure to wait on them  well i think mr saunders they isnt alike as much as they might be nother  not more so than wenison and pig perfectly correct sir for this cabin is a lobskous as regards deportment and character i set all the effinghams down as tiptops or a no 1 as mr leach calls the ship and then mr sharp and mr blunt are quite the gentlemen nothing is easier mr toast than to tell a gentleman and as you have set up a new professionin which i hope for the credit of the colour you will be prosperousit is well worth your while to know how this is done especially as you need never expect much from a passenger that is not a true gentleman but trouble there is mr john effingham in particular his man says he never anticipates change and if a coat confines his arm he repudiates it on the spot  well it must be a satisfaction to serve such a companion i think mr dodge sir quite a feller  your taste toast is getting to be observable and by cultivating it you will soon be remarkable for a knowledge of mankind mr dodge as you werry justly insinuate is not werry refined or particularly well suited to figure in genteel society  and yet he seems attached to it mr saunders for he has purposed to establish five or six societies since we sailed  werry true sir but then every society is not genteel when we get back to new york toast i must see and get you into a better set than the one you occupied when we sailed you will not do yet for our circle which is altogether conclusive but you might be elevated mr dodge has been electioneering with me to see if we cannot inwent a society among the steeragepassengers for the abstinence of liquors and another for the perpetration of the morals and religious principles of our forefathers as for the first toast i told him it was sufficiently indurable to be confined in a hole like the steerage without being percluded from the consolation of a little drink and as for the last it appeared to me that such a preposition inwolwed an attack on liberty of conscience  there you gived him sir quite as good as he sent returned the stewards mate chuckling or perhaps sniggering would be a word better suited to his habits of cachinnation and i should have been glad to witness his confusion it seems to me mr saunders that mr dodge loves to get up his societies in support of liberty and religion that he may predominate over both by his own inwentions  saunders laid his long yellow finger on the broad flat nose of his mate with an air of approbation as he replied  toast you have hit his character as pat as i touch your roman he is a man fit to make proselytes among the wulgar and irishthe hibernian peasant and the american negro are sworn enemiesbut quite unfit for anything respectable or decent were it not for sir george i would scarcely descend to clean his stateroom  what is your sentiments mr saunders respecting sir george  why sir george is a titled gentleman and of course is not to be strictured too freely he has complimented me already with a sovereign and apprised me of his intention to be more particular when we get in  i feel astonished such a gentleman should neglect to insure a stateroom to his own convenience  sir george has elucidated all that in a conversation we had in his room soon after our acquaintance commenced he is going to canada on public business and sailed at an hours interval he was too late for a single room and his own man is to follow with most of his effects by the next ship oh sir george may be safely put down as respectable and liberalized though thrown into disparagement perhaps by forty circumstances  mr saunders who had run his vocabulary hard in this conversation meant to say fortuitous and toast thought that so many circumstances might well reduce a better man to a dilemma after a moment of thought or what in his orbicular shining features he fancied passed for thought he said  i seem to diwine mr saunders that the effinghams do not much intimate sir george  saunders looked out of the pantrydoor to reconnoitre and finding the sober quiet already described reigning he opened a drawer and drew forth a london newspaper  to treat you with the confidence of a gentleman in a situation as respectable and responsible as the one you occupy mr toast he said a little ewent has transpired in my presence yesterday that i thought sufficiently particular to be designated by retaining this paper mr sharp and sir george happened to be in the cabin together alone and the last as it suggested to me toast was desirous of removing some of the haughter of the first for you may have observed that there has been no conversation between any of the effinghams or mr blunt or mr sharp and the baronet and so to break the ice of his haughter as it might be sir george says really mr sharp the papers have got to be so personally particular that one cannot run into the country for a mouthful of fresh air that they dont record it now i thought not a soul knew of my departure for america and yet here you see they have mentioned it with more particulars than are agreeable on concluding sir george gave mr sharp this paper and indicated this here paragraph mr sharp perused it laid down the paper and retorted coldly it is indeed quite surprising sir but impudence is a general fault of the age and then he left the cabin solus sir george was so wexed he went into his stateroom and forgot the paper which fell to the steward you know on a principle laid down in wattel toast  here the two worthies indulged in a smothered merriment of their own at the expense of their commander for though a dignified man in general mr saunders could laugh on occasion and according to his own opinion of himself he danced particularly well  would you like to read the paragraph mr toast  quite unnecessary sir your account will be perfectly legible and satisfactory  by this touch of politeness mr toast who knew as much of the art of reading as a monkey commonly knows of mathematics got rid of the awkwardness of acknowledging the careless manner in which he had trifled with his early opportunities luckily mr saunders who had been educated as a servant in a gentlemans family was better off and as he was vain of all his advantages he was particularly pleased to have an opportunity of exhibiting them turning to the paragraph he read the following lines in that sort of didactic tone and elaborate style with which gentlemen who commence the graces after thirty are a little apt to make bows  we understand sir george templemore bart the member for boodleigh is about to visit our american colonies with a view to make himself intimately acquainted with the merits of the unpleasant questions by which they are just now agitated and with the intention of entering into the debates in the house on that interesting subject on his return we believe that sir george will sail in the packet of the first from liverpool and will return in time to be in his seat after the easter holidays his people and effects left town yesterday by the liverpool coach during the baronets absence his country will be hunted by sir gervaise de brush though the establishment at templemore hall will be kept up  how came sir george here then mr toast very naturally inquired  having been kept too late in london he was obliged to come this way or to be left it is sometimes as close work to get the passengers on board mr toast as to get the people i have often admired how gentlemen and ladies love procrastinating when dishes that ought to be taken hot are getting to be quite insipid and uneatable  saunders cried the hearty voice of captain truck who had taken possession of what he called his throne in the cabin all the stewards elegant diction and finish of demeanour vanished at the wellknown sound and thrusting his head out of the pantrydoor he gave the prompt shipanswer to a call  ay ay sir  come none of your dictionary in the pantry there but show your physiognomy in my presence what the devil do you think vattel would say to such a supper as this  i think sir he would call it a werry good supper for a ship in a hard gale of wind thats my honest opinion captain truck and i never deceive any gentleman in a matter of food i think mr wattel would approve of that there supper sir  perhaps he might for he has made blunders as well as another man go mix me a glass of just what i love when ive not had a drop all day gentlemen will any of you honour me by sharing in a cut this beef is not indigestible and here is a real marylander in the way of a ham no want of oakum to fill up the chinks with either  most of the gentlemen were too full of the gale to wish to eat besides they had not fasted like captain truck since morning but mr monday the bagman as john effingham had termed him and who had been often enough at sea to know something of its varieties consented to take a glass of brandy and water as a corrective of the madeira he had been swallowing the appetite of captain truck was little affected by the state of the weather however for though too attentive to his duties to quit the deck until he had ascertained how matters were going on now that he had fairly made up his mind to eat he set about it with a heartiness and simplicity that proved his total disregard of appearances when his hunger was sharp for some time he was too much occupied to talk making regular attacks upon the different plats as mr saunders called them without much regard to the cookery or the material the only pauses were to drink and this was always done with a steadiness that never left a drop in the glass still mr truck was a temperate man for he never consumed more than his physical wants appeared to require or his physical energies knew how to dispose of at length however he came to the stewards entremets or he began to stuff what he himself had called oakum into the chinks of his dinner  mr sharp had watched the whole process from the ladies cabin as indeed had eve and thinking this a favourable occasion to ascertain the state of things on deck the former came into the maincabin commissioned by the latter to make the inquiry  the ladies are desirous of knowing where we are and what is the state of the gale captain truck said the gentleman when he had seated himself near the throne  my dear young lady called out the captain by way of cutting short the diplomacy of employing ambassadors between them i wish in my heart i could persuade you and mademoiselle vav for so he called the governess in imitation of eves pronunciation of her name to try a few of these pickled oysters they are as delicate as yourselves and worthy to be set before a mermaid if there were any such thing  i thank you for the compliment captain truck and while i ask leave to decline it i beg leave to refer you to the plenipotentiary mademoiselle viefville eve would not say herself has intrusted with her wishes  thus you perceive sir interposed mr sharp again you will have to treat with me by all the principles laid down by vattel  and treat you too my good sir let me persuade you to try a slice of this antiabolitionist laying his knife on the ham which he still continued to regard himself with a sort of melancholy interest no well i hold overpersuasion as the next thing to neglect i am satisfied sir after all as saunders says that vattel himself unless more unreasonable at his grub than in matters of state would be a happier man after he had been at his table twenty minutes than before he sat down  mr sharp perceiving that it was idle to pursue his inquiry while the other was in one of his discursive humours determined to let things take their course and fell into the captains own vein  if vattel would approve of the repast few men ought to repine at their fortune in being so well provided  i flatter myself sir that i understand a supper especially in a gale of wind as well as mr vattel or any other man could do  and yet vattel was one of the most celebrated cooks of his day  captain truck stared looked his grave companion steadily in the eye for he was too much addicted to mystifying not to distrust others and picked his teeth with redoubled vigilance  vattel a cook this is the first i ever heard of it  there was a vattel in a former age who stood at the head of his art as a cook this i can assure you on my honour he may not have been your vattel however  sir there never were two vattels this is extraordinary news to me and i scarcely know how to receive it  if you doubt my information you may ask any of the other passengers either of the mr effinghams or mr blunt or miss effingham or mademoiselle viefville will confirm what i tell you i think especially the latter for he was her countryman  hereupon captain truck began to stuff in the oakum again for the calm countenance of mr sharp produced an effect and as he was pondering on the consequences of his oracles turning out to be a cook he thought it not amiss to be eating as it were incidentally after swallowing a dozen olives six or eight anchovies as many pickled oysters and raisins and almonds as the advertisements say à volonté he suddenly struck his fist on the table and announced his intention of putting the question to both the ladies  my dear young lady he called out will you do me the honour to say whether you ever heard of a cook of the name of vattel  eve laughed and her sweet tones were infectious amid the dull howling of the gale which was constantly heard in the cabins like a bass accompaniment or the distant roar of a cataract among the singing of birds  certainly captain she answered mr vattel was not only a cook but perhaps the most celebrated on record for sentiment at least if not for skill  i make no doubt the man did his work well let him be set about what he might and mademoiselle he was a countryman of yours they tell me  assurement monsieur vattel has left more distinguished souvenirs than any other cook in france  captain truck turned quickly to the elated and admiring saunders who felt his own glory enhanced by this important discovery and said in that shorthand way he had of expressing himself to the chief of the pantry  do you hear that sir see and find out what they are and dress me a dish of these souvenirs as soon as we get in i dare say they are to be had at the fulton market and mind while there to look out for some tongues and sounds ive not made half a supper tonight for the want of them i dare say these souvenirs are capital eating if monsieur vattel thought so highly of them pray mademoiselle is the gentleman dead  hélas oui how could he live with a sword run through his body  ha killed in a duel i declare died fighting for his principles if the truth were known i shall have a double respect for his opinion for this is the touchstone of a mans honesty mr sharp let us take a glass of geissenheimer to his memory we might honour a less worthy man  as the captain poured out the liquor a fall of several tons of water on the deck shook the entire ship and one of the passengers in the hurricanehouse opening a door to ascertain the cause the sound of the hissing waters and of the roaring winds came fresher and more distinct into the cabin mr truck cast an eye at the telltale over his head to ascertain the course of the ship and paused just an instant and then tossed off his wine  this hint reminds me of my mission mr sharp re joined the ladies desire to know your opinion of the state of the weather  i owe them an answer if it were only in gratitude for the hint about vattel who the devil would have supposed the man ever was a cook but these frenchmen are not like the rest of mankind and half the nation are cooks or live by food in some way or other  and very good cooks too monsieur le capitaine said mademoiselle viefville monsieur vattel did die for the honour of his art he fell on his own sword because the fish did not arrive in season for the dinner of the king  captain truck looked more astonished than ever then turning short round to the steward he shook his head and exclaimed  do you hear that sir how often would you have died if a sword had been run through you every time the fish was forgotten or was too late once to a dead certainty about these very tongues and sounds  but the weather interrupted mr sharp  the weather my dear sir the weather my dear ladies is very good weather with the exception of winds and waves of which unfortunately there are just now more of both than we want the ship must scud and as we go like a racehorse without stopping to take breath we may see the canary islands before the voyage is over of danger there is none in this ship as long as we can keep clear of the land and in order that this may be done i will just step into my stateroom and find out exactly where we are  on receiving this information the passengers retired for the night captain truck setting about his task in good earnest the result of his calculations showed that they would run westward of madeira which was all he cared about immediately intending always to haul up to his course on the first good occasion     chapter xiii      there are yet two things in my destiny   world to roam oer and a home with thee    byron   eve effingham slept little although the motion of the ship had been much more severe and uncomfortable while contending with headwinds on no other occasion were there so many signs of a fierce contention of the elements as in this gale as she lay in her berth her ear was within a foot of the roaring waters without and her frame trembled as she heard them gurgling so distinctly that it seemed as if they had already forced their way through the seams of the planks and were filling the ship sleep she could not for a long time therefore and during two hours she remained with closed eyes an entranced and yet startled listener of the fearful strife that was raging over the ocean night had no stillness for the roar of the winds and waters was incessant though deadened by the intervening decks and sides but now and then an open door admitted as it might be the whole scene into the cabins at such moments every sound was fresh and frightfully grandeven the shout of the officer coming to the ear like a warning cry from the deep  at length eve wearied by her apprehensions even fell into a troubled sleep in which her frightened faculties however kept so much on the alert that at no time was the roar of the tempest entirely lost to her sense of hearing about midnight the glare of a candle crossed her eyes and she was broad awake in an instant on rising in her berth she found nanny sidley who had so often and so long watched over her infant and childish slumbers standing at her side and gazing wistfully in her face  tis a dread night miss eve half whispered the appalled domestic i have not been able to sleep for thinking of you and of what might happen on these wide waters  and why of me particularly my good nanny returned eve smiling in the face of her old nurse as sweetly as the infant smiles in its moments of tenderness and recollection why so much of me my excellent annare there not others too worthy of your care my beloved fatheryour own good selfmademoiselle viefvillecousin jackand the warm colour deepened on the cheek of the beautiful girl she scarcely knew why herselfand many others in the vessel that one kind as you might think of i should hope when your thoughts become apprehensions and your wishes prayers  there are many precious souls in the ship maam out of all question and im sure no one wishes them all safe on land again more than myself but it seems to me no one among them all is so much loved as you  eve leaned forward playfully and drawing her old nurse towards her kissed her cheek while her own eyes glistened and then she laid her flushed cheek on that bosom which had so frequently been its pillow before after remaining a minute in this affectionate attitude she rose and inquired if her nurse had been on deck  i go every halfhour miss eve for i feel it as much my duty to watch over you here as when i had you all to myself in the cradle i do not think your father sleeps a great deal tonight and several of the gentlemen in the other cabins remain dressed they ask me how you spend the time in this tempest whenever i pass their stateroom doors  eves colour deepened and ann sidley thought she had never seen her child more beautiful as the bright luxuriant golden hair which had strayed from the confinement of the cap fell on the warm cheek and rendered eyes that were always full of feeling softer and more brilliant even than common  they conceal their uneasiness for themselves under an affected concern for me my good nanny she said hurriedly and your own affection makes you an easy dupe to the artifice  it may be so maam for i know but little of the ways of the world it is fearful is it not miss eve to think that we are in a ship so far from any land whirling along over the bottom as fast as a horse could plunge  the danger is not exactly of that nature perhaps nanny  there is a bottom to the ocean is there not i have heard some maintain there is no bottom to the seaand that would make the danger so much greater i think if i felt certain that the bottom was not very deep and there was only a rock to be seen now and then i should not find it so very dreadful  eve laughed like a child and the contrast between the sweet simplicity of her looks her manners and her more cultivated intellect and the matronly appearance of the less instructed ann made one of those pictures in which the superiority of mind over all other things becomes most apparent  your notions of safety my dear nanny she said are not precisely those of a seaman for i believe there is nothing of which they stand more in dread than of rocks and the bottom  i fear im but a poor sailor maam for in my judgment we could have no greater consolation in such a tempest than to see them all around us do you think miss eve that the bottom of the ocean if there is truly a bottom is whitened with the bones of shipwrecked mariners as people say  i doubt not my excellent nanny that the great deep might give up many awful secrets but you ought to think less of these things and more of that merciful providence which has protected us through so many dangers since we have been wanderers you are in much less danger now than i have known you to be and escape unharmed  i miss evedo you suppose that i fear for myself what matters it if a poor old woman like me die a few years sooner or later or where her frail old body is laid i have never been of so much account when living as to make it of consequence where the little which will remain to decay when dead moulders into dust do not i implore you miss effingham suppose me so selfish as to feel any uneasiness tonight on my own account  is it then as usual all for me my dear my worthy old nurse that you feel this anxiety put your heart at ease for they who know best betray no alarm and you may observe that the captain sleeps as tranquilly this night as on any other  but he is a rude man and accustomed to danger he has neither wife nor children and ill engage has never given a thought to the horrors of having a form precious as this floating in the caverns of the ocean amidst ravenous fish and seamonsters  here her imagination overcame poor nanny sidley and she folded her arms about the beautiful person of eve and sobbed violently her young mistress accustomed to similar exhibitions of affection soothed her with blandishments and assurances that soon restored her selfcommand when the dialogue was resumed with a greater appearance of tranquillity on the part of the nurse they conversed a few minutes on the subject of their reliance on god eve returning fourfold or with the advantages of a cultivated intellect many of those simple lessons of faith and humility that she had received from her companion when a child the latter listening as she always did to these exhortations which sounded in her ears like the echoes of all her own better thoughts with a love and reverence no other could awaken eve passed her small white hand over the wrinkled cheek of nanny in kind fondling as it had been passed a thousand times when a child an act she well knew her nurse delighted in and continued  and now my good old nanny you will set your heart at ease i know for though a little too apt to trouble yourself about one who does not deserve half your care you are much too sensible and too humble to feel distrust out of reason we will talk of something else a few minutes and then you will lie down and rest your weary body  weary i should never feel weary in watching when i thought there was a cause for it  although nanny made no allusion to herself eve understood in whose behalf this watchfulness was meant she drew the face of the old woman towards her and left a kiss on each cheek ere she continued  these ships have other things to talk about besides their dangers she said do you not find it odd at least that a vessel of war should be sent to follow us about the ocean in this extraordinary way  quite so maam and i did intend to speak to you about it some time when i saw you had nothing better to think of at first i fancied but i believe it was a silly thought that some of the great english lords and admirals that used to be so much about us at paris and rome and vienna had sent this ship to see you safe to america miss eve for i never supposed they would make so much fuss concerning a poor runaway couple like these steeragepassengers  eve did not refrain from laughing again at this conceit of nannys for her temperament was gay as childhood though well restrained by cultivation and manner and once more she patted the cheek of her nurse kindly  those great lords and admirals are not great enough for that dear nanny even had they the inclination to do so silly a thing but has no other reason suggested itself to you among the many curious circumstances you may have had occasion to observe in the ship  nanny looked at eve and turned her eyes aside glanced furtively at the young lady again and at last felt compelled to answer  i endeavour maam to think well of everybody though strange thoughts will sometimes arise without our wishing it i suppose i know to what you allude but i dont feel quite certain it becomes me to speak  with me at least nanny you need have no reserves and i confess a desire to learn if we have thought alike about some of our fellowpassengers speak freely then for you can have no more apprehension in communicating all your thoughts to me than in communicating them to your own child  not as much maam not half as much for you are both child and mistress to me and i look quite as much to receiving advice as to giving it it is odd miss eve that gentlemen should not pass under their proper names and i have had unpleasant feelings about it though i did not think it became me to be the first to speak while your father was with you and mamerzelle for so nanny always styled the governess and mr john all of whom love you almost as much as i do and all of whom are so much better judges of what is right but now you encourage me to speak my mind miss eve i will say i should like that no one came near you who does not carry his heart in his open hand that the youngest child might know his character and understand his motives  eve smiled as her nurse grew warm but she blushed in spite of an effort to seem indifferent  this would be truly a vain wish dear nanny in the mixed company of a ship she said it is too much to expect that strangers will throw aside all their reserves on first finding themselves in close communion the wellbred and prudent will only stand more on their guard under such circumstances  strangers maam  i perceive that you recollect the face of one of our shipmates why do you shake your head the telltale blood of eve again mantled over her lovely countenance i suppose i ought to have said two of our shipmates though i had doubted whether you retained any recollection of one of them  no gentleman ever speaks to you twice miss eve that i do not remember him  thank you dearest nanny for this and a thousand other proofs of your neverceasing interest in my welfare but i had not believed you so vigilant as to take heed of every face that happens to approach me  ah miss eve neither of these gentlemen would like to be mentioned by you in this careless manner im sure they both did a great deal more than happen to approach you for as to  hist dear nanny we are in a crowded place and you may be overheard you will use no names therefore as i believe we understand each other without going into all these particulars now my dear nurse would i give something to know which of these young men has made the most favourable impression on your upright and conscientious mind i  nay miss eve what is my judgment in comparison with your own and that of mr john effingham and  my cousin jack in the name of wonder nanny what has he to do with the matter  nothing maam only i can see he has his favourites as well as another and ill venture to say mr dodge is not the greatest he has in this ship  i think you might add sir george templemore too returned eve laughing  ann sidley looked hard at her young mistress and smiled before she answered and then she continued the discourse naturally as if there had been no interruption  quite likely maam and mr monday and all the rest of that set but you see how soon he discovers a real gentleman for he is quite easy and friendly with mr sharp and mr blunt particularly the last  eve was silent for she did not like the open introduction of these names though she scarce knew why herself  my cousin is a man of the world she resumed on perceiving that nanny watched her countenance with solicitude as if fearful of having gone too far and there is nothing surprising in his discovering men of his own class we know both these persons to be not exactly what they seem though i think we know no harm of either unless it be the silly change of names it would have been better had they come on board bearing their proper appellations to us at least it would have been more respectful though both affirm they were ignorant that my father had taken passage in the montauka circumstance that may very well be true as you know we got the cabin that was first engaged by another party  i should be sorry maam if either failed in respect  it is not quite adulatory to make a young woman the involuntary keeper of the secrets of two unreflecting young men that is all my good nanny we cannot well betray them and we are consequently their confidants par force the most amusing part of the thing is that they are masters of each others secrets in part at least and feel a delightful awkwardness in a hundred instances for my own part i pity neither but think each is fairly enough punished they will be fortunate if their servants do not betray them before we reach new york  no fear of that maam for they are discreet cautious men and if disposed to blab mr dodge has given both good opportunities already as i believe he has put to them as many questions as there are speeches in the catechism  mr dodge is a vulgar man  so we all say maam in the servants cabin and everybody is so set against him there that there is little chance of his learning much i hope miss eve mamerzelle does not distrust either of the gentlemen  surely you cannot suspect mademoiselle viefville of indiscretion nanny a better spirit or a better tone than hers does not exist  no maam tis not that but i should like to have one more secret with you all to myself i honour and respect mamerzelle who has done a thousand times more for you than a poor ignorant woman like me could have done with all my zeal but i do believe miss eve i love your shoe tie better than she loves your pure and beautiful spirit  mademoiselle viefville is an excellent woman and i believe is sincerely attached to me  she would be a wretch else i do not deny her attachment but i only say it is nothing it ought to be nothing it can be nothing it shall be nothing compared to that of the one who first held you in her arms and who has always held you in her heart mamerzelle can sleep such a night as this which im sure she could not do were she as much concerned for you as i am  eve knew that jealousy of mademoiselle viefville was nannys greatest weakness and drawing the old woman to her she entwined her arms around her neck and complained of drowsiness accustomed to watching and really unable to sleep the nurse now passed a perfectly happy hour in holding her child who literally dropped asleep on her bosom after which nanny slid into the berth beneath in her clothes and finally lost the sense of her apprehensions in perturbed slumbers  a cry on dock awoke all in the cabins early on the succeeding morning it was scarcely light but a common excitement seized every passenger and ten minutes had not elapsed when eve and her governess appeared in the hurricanehouse the last of those who came from below few questions had been asked but all hurried on deck with their apprehensions awakened by the gale increased to the sense of some positive and impending danger  nothing however was immediately apparent to justify all this sudden clamour the gale continued if anything with increased power the ocean was rolling over its cataracts of combing seas with which the ship was still racing driven under the strain of a reefed forecourse the only canvas that was set even with this little sail the hull was glancing through the raging seas or rather in their company at a rate a little short of ten miles in the hour  captain truck was in the mizzenrigging bareheaded every lock of hair he had blowing out like a pennant occasionally he signed to the man at the wheel which way to put the helm for instead of sleeping as many had supposed he had been conning the ship for hours in the same situation as eve appeared he was directing the attention of several of the gentlemen to some object astern but a very few moments put all on deck in possession of the facts  about a cables length on one of the quarters of the montauk was a ship careering before the gale like themselves though carrying more canvas and consequently driving faster through the water the sudden appearance of this vessel in the sombre light of the morning when objects were seen distinctly but without the glare of day the dark hull relieved by a single narrow line of white paint dotted with ports the glossy hammockcloths and all those other coverings of dark glistening canvas which give to a cruiser an air of finish and comfort like that of a travelling carriage the symmetry of the spars and the gracefulness of all the lines whether of the hull or hamper told all who knew anything of such subjects that the stranger was a vessel of war to this information captain truck added that it was their old pursuer the foam  she is corvettebuilt said the master of the montauk and is obliged to carry more canvas than we in order to keep out of the way of the seas for if one of these big fellows should overtake her and throw its crest into her waist she would become like a man who has taken too much saturdaynight and with whom a second dose might settle the pursers books forever  such in fact was the history of the sudden appearance of this ship she had lainto as long as possible and on being driven to scud carried a closereefed maintopsail a show of canvas that urged her through the water about two knots to the hour faster than the rate of thepacket necessarily following the same coarse she overtook the latter just as the day began to dawn the cry had arisen on her sudden discovery and the moment had now arrived when she was about to come up quite abreast of her late chase the passage of the foam under such circumstances was a grand but thrilling thing her captain too was seen in the mizzenrigging of his ship rocked by the gigantic billows over which the fabric was careering he held a speakingtrumpet in his hand as if still bent on his duty in the midst of that awful warring of the elements captain truck called for a trumpet in his turn and fearful of consequences he waved it to the other to keep more aloof the injunction was either misunderstood the manofwars man was too much bent on his object or the ocean was too uncontrollable for such a purpose the corvette driving up on a sea quite abeam of the packet and in fearful proximity the englishman applied the trumpet and words were heard amid the roaring of the winds at that time the white field of old albion with the st georges cross rose over the bulwarks and by the time it had reached the gaffend the bunting was whipping in ribbons  show em the gridiron growled captain truck through his trumpet with its mouth turned in board  as everything was ready this order was instantly obeyed and the stripes of america were soon seen fluttering nearly in separate pieces the two ships now ran a short distance in parallel lines rolling from each other so heavily that the bright copper of the corvette was seen nearly to her keel the englishman who seemed a portion of his ship again tried his trumpet the detached words of liebyorderscommunicate were caught by one or two but the howling of the gale rendered all connexion in the meaning impossible the englishman ceased his efforts to make himself heard for the two ships were now rollingto and it appeared as if their spars would interlock there was an instant when mr leach had his hand on the mainbrace to let it go but the foam started away on a sea like a horse that feels the spur and disobeying her helm shot forward as if about to cross the montauks forefoot  a breathless instant followed for all on board the two ships thought they must now inevitably come foul of each other and this the more so because the montauk took the impulse of the sea just as it was lost to the foam and seemed on the point of plunging directly into the stern of the latter even the seamen clenched the ropes around them convulsively and the boldest held their breaths for a time the port hard a port and be dd to you of captain truck and the starboard starboard hard of the englishman were both distinctly audible to all in the two ships for this was a moment in which seamen can speak louder than the tempest the affrighted vessels seemed to recede together and they shot asunder in diverging lines the foam leading all further attempts at a communication were instantly useless the corvette being half a mile ahead in a quarter of an hour rolling her yardarms nearly to the water  captain truck said little to his passengers concerning this adventure but when he had lighted a cigar and was discussing the matter with his chiefmate he told the latter there was just one minute when he would not have given a ships biscuit for both vessels nor much more for their cargoes a man must have a small regard for human souls when he puts them and their bodies too in so much jeopardy for a little tobacco  throughout the day it blew furiously for the ship was running into the gale a phenomenon that we shall explain as most of our readers may not comprehend it all gates of wind commence to leeward or in other words the wind is first felt at some particular point and later as we recede from that point proceeding in the direction from which the wind blows it is always severest near the point where it commences appearing to diminish in violence as it recedes this therefore is an additional motive for mariners to lieto instead of scudding since the latter not only carries them far from their true coarse but it carries them also nearer to the scene of the greatest fury of the elements     chapter xiv      good boatswain have care    tempest   at sunset the speck presented by the reefed topsail of the corvette had sunk beneath the horizon in the southern board and that ship was seen no longer several islands had been passed looking tranquil and smiling amid the fury of the tempest but it was impossible to haul up for any one among them the most that could be done was to keep the ship dead before it to prevent her broachingto and to have a care that she kept clear of those rocks and of that bottom for which nanny sidley had so much pined  familiarity with the scene began to lessen the apprehensions of the passengers and as scudding is an easy process for those who are liable to seasickness ere another night shut in the principal concern was connected with the course the ship was compelled to steer the wind had so far hauled to the westward as to render it certain that the coast of africa would lie in their way if obliged to scud many hours longer for captain trucks observations actually placed him to the southward and eastward of the canary islands this was a long distance out of his course but the rate of sailing rendered the fact sufficiently clear  this too was the precise time when the montauk felt the weight of the tempest or rather when she experienced the heaviest portion of that which it was her fate to feel lucky was it for the good ship that she had not been in this latitude a few hours earlier when it had blown something very like a hurricane the responsibility and danger of his situation now began seriously to disturb captain truck although he kept his apprehensions to himself like a prudent officer all his calculations were gone over again with the utmost care the rate of sailing was cautiously estimated and the result showed that ten or fifteen hours more would inevitably produce shipwreck of another sort unless the wind moderated  fortunately the gale began to break about midnight the wind still blew tremendously but it was less steadily and there were intervals of halfanhour at a time when the ship might have carried much more canvas even on a bowline of course her speed abated in proportion and after the day had dawned a long and anxious survey from aloft showed no land to the eastward when perfectly assured of this important fact captain truck rubbed his hands with delight ordered a coal for his cigar and began to abuse saunders about the quality of the coffee during the blow  let there be something creditable this morning sir added the captain after a sharp rebuke and remember we are down here in the neighbourhood of the country of your forefathers where a man ought in reason to be on his good behaviour if i hear any more of your washy compounds ill put you ashore and let you run naked a summer or two with the monkeys and ouranoutangs  i endeavour on all proper occasions to render myself agreeable to you captain truck and to all those with whom i have the happiness to sail returned the steward but the coffee sir cannot be very good sir in such weater sir i do diwine that the wind must blow away its flavour for i am ready to confess it has not been as odorous as it usually is when i have had the honour to prepare it as for africa sir i flatter myself captain truck that you esteem me too highly to believe i am suited to consort or besort with the illformed and inedicated men who inhabit that wild country i misremember whether my ancestors came from this part of the world or not but if they did sir my habits and profession entirely unqualify me for their company i hope i know i am only a poor steward sir but youll please to recollect that your great mr vattel was nothing but a cook  dn the fellow leach i believe it is this conceit that has spoiled the coffee the last day or two do you suppose it can be true that a great writer like this man could really be no better than a cook or was that englishman roasting me by way of showing how cooking is done ashore if it were not for the testimony of the ladies i might believe it but they would not share in such an indecent trick what are you lyingby for sir go to your pantry and remember that the gale is broken and we shall all sit down to table this morning as keenset as a party of your brethren ashore here who had a broiled baby for breakfast  saunders who exofficio might be said to be trained in similar lectures went pouting to his work taking care to expend a proper part of his spleen on mr toast who quite as a matter of course suffered in proportion as his superior was made to feel in his own person the weight of captain trucks authority it is perhaps fortunate that nature points out this easy and selfevident mode of relief else would the rude habits of a ship sometimes render the relations between him who orders and him whose duty it is to obey too nearly approaching to the intolerable  the captains squalls however were of short duration and on the present occasion he was soon in even a better humour than common as every minute gave the cheering assurance that the tempest was fast drawing to a close he had finished his third cigar and was actually issuing his orders to turn the reef out of the foresail and to set the maintopsail closereefed when most of the passengers appeared on deck for the first time that morning  here we are gentlemen cried captain truck in the way of salutation nearer to guinea than i could wish with every prospect now of soon working our way across the atlantic and possibly of making a thirty or thirtyfive days passage of it yet we have this sea to quiet and then i hope to show you what the montauk has in her besides her passengers and cargo i think we have now got rid of the foam as well as of the gale i did believe at one time her people might be walking and wading on the coast of cornwall but i now believe they are more likely to try the sands of the great desert of sahara  it is to be hoped they have escaped the latter calamity as fortunately as they escaped the first observed mr effingham  it may be so but the wind has got round to norwest and has not been sighing these last twelve hours cape bianco is not a hundred leagues from us and at the rate he was travelling that gentleman with the speakingtrumpet may now be philosophizing over the fragments of his ship unless he had the good sense to haul off more to the westward than he was steering when last seen his ship should have been christened the scud instead of the foam  every one expressed the hope that the ship to which their own situation was fairly enough to be ascribed might escape this calamity and all faces regained their cheerfulness as they saw the canvas fall in sign that their own danger was past so rapidly indeed did the gale now abate that the topsails were hardly hoisted before the order was given to shake out another reef and within an hour all the heavier canvas that was proper to carry before the wind was set solely with a view to keep the ship steady the sea was still fearful and captain truck found himself obliged to keep off from his course in order to avoid the danger of having his decks swept  the racing with the crest of the waves however was quite done for the seas soon cease to comb and break after the force of the wind is expended  at no time is the motion of the vessel more unpleasant or indeed more dangerous than in the interval that occurs between the ceasing of a violent gale and the springing up of a new wind the ship is unmanageable and falling into the troughs of the sea the waves break in upon her decks often doing serious injury while the spars and rigging are put to the severest trial by the sudden and violent surges which they have to withstand of all this captain truck was fully aware and when he was summoned to breakfast he gave many cautions to mr leach before quitting the deck  i do not like the new shrouds we got up in london he said for the rope has stretched in this gale in a way to throw too much strain on the old rigging so see all ready for taking a fresh drag on them as soon as the people have breakfasted mind and keep her out of the trough sir and watch every roller that you find comes tumbling upon us  after repeating these injunctions in different ways looking to windward some time and aloft five or six minutes captain truck finally went below to pass judgment on mr saunders coffee once in his throne at the head of the long table the worthy master after a proper attention to his passengers set about the duty of restoration as the steward affectedly called eating with a zeal that never failed him on such occasions he had just swallowed a cup of the coffee about which he had lectured saunders when a heavy flap of the sails announced the sudden failure of the wind  that is bad news said captain truck listening to the fluttering blows of the canvas against the masts i never like to hear a ship shaking its wings while there is a heavy sea on but this is better than the desert of sahara and so my dear young lady let me recommend to you a cup of this coffee which is flavoured this morning by a dread of ouranoutangs as mr saunders will have the honour to inform you  a jerk of the whole ship was followed by a report like that made by a musket captain truck rose and stood leaning on one hand in a bent attitude expectation and distrust intensely portrayed in every feature another helpless roil of the ship succeeded and three or four similar reports were immediately heard as if large ropes had parted in quick succession a rending of wood followed and then came a chaotic crash in which the impending heavens seemed to fall on the devoted ship most of the passengers shut their eyes and when they were opened again or a moment afterwards mr truck had vanished it is scarcely necessary to describe the confusion that followed eve was frightened but she behaved well though mademoiselle viefville trembled so much as to require the assistance of mr effingham  we have lost our masts john effingham coolly remarked an accident that will not be likely to be very dangerous though by prolonging the passage a month or two it may have the merit of making this good company more intimately acquainted with each other a pleasure for which we cannot express too much gratitude  eve implored his forbearance by a glance for she saw his eye was unconsciously directed towards mr monday and mr dodge for both of whom she knew her kinsman entertained an incurable dislike his words however explained the catastrophe and most of the men hastened on deck to assure themselves of the fact  john effingham was right the new rigging which had stretched so much during the gale had permitted too much of the strain in the tremendous rolls of the ship to fall upon the other ropes the shroud most exposed had parted first three or four more followed in succession and before there was time to secure anything the remainder had gone together and the mainmast had broken at a place where a defect was now seen in its heart falling over the side the latter had brought down with it the mizzenmast and all its hamper and as much of the foremast as stood above the top in short of all the complicated tracery of ropes the proud display of spars and the broad folds of canvas that had so lately overshadowed the deck of the montauk the mutilated foremast the foreyard and sail and the fallen headgear alone remained all the rest either cumbered the deck or was beating against the side of the ship in the water  the hard red weatherbeaten face of captain truck was expressive of mortification and concern for a single instant when his eye glanced over the ruin we have just described his mind then seemed made up to the calamity and he ordered toast to bring him a coal of fire with which he quietly lighted a cigar  here is a category and be dd to it mr leach he said after taking a single whiff you are doing quite right sir cut away the wreck and force the ship free of it or we shall have some of those sticks poking themselves through the planks i always thought the chandler in london into whose hands the agent has fallen was arogue and now i know it well enough to swear to it cut away carpenter and get us rid of all this thumping as soon as possible a very capital vessel mr monday or she would have rolled the pumps out of her and capsized the galley  no attempt being made to save anything the wreck was floating astern in five minutes and the ship was fortunately extricated from this new hazard mr truck in spite of his acquired coolness looked piteously at all that gallant hamper in which he had so lately rejoiced as yardarm crosstrees tresseltrees and tops rose on the summits of swells or settled in the troughs like whales playing their gambols but habit is a seamans philosophy and in no one feature is his character more respectable than in that manliness which disinclines him to mourn over a misfortune that is inevitable  the montauk now resembled a tree stripped of its branches or a courser crippled in his sinews her glory had in a great degree departed the foremast alone remained and of this even the head was gone a circumstance of which captain truck complained more than of any other as to use his own expressions it destroyed the symmetry of the spar which had proved itself to be a good stick what however was of more real importance it rendered it difficult if not impossible to get up a spare topmast forward as both the main and mizzenmast had gone quite near the deck this was almost the only tolerably easy expedient that remained and within an hour of the accident mr truck announced his intentions to stand as far south as he could to strike the trades and then to make a fair wind of it across the atlantic unless indeed he might be able to fetch into the cape de verde islands where it would be possible perhaps to get something like a now outfit  all i now ask my dear young lady he said to eve who ventured on deck to look at the desolation as soon the wreck was cut adrift all i now ask my dear young lady is an end to westerly winds for two or three weeks and i will promise to place you all in america yet in time to eat your christmas dinner i do not think sir george will shoot many white bears among the rocky mountains this year but then there will be so many more left for another season the ship is in a category and he will be an impudent scoundrel who denies it but worse categories than this have been reasoned out of countenance all headsail is not a convenient show of cloth to claw off a leeshore with but i still hope to escape the misfortune of laying eyes on the coast of africa  are we far from it asked eve who sufficiently understood the danger of being on an uninhabitable shore in their present situation one in which it was vain to seek for a port i would rather be in the neighbourhood of any other land i think than that of africa  especially africa between the canaries and cape blanco returned captain truck with an expressive shrug more hospitable regions exist certainly for if accounts are to be credited the honest people alongshore never get a christian that they do not mount him on a camel and trot him through the sands a thousand miles or so under a hot sun with a sort of haggis for food that would go nigh to take away even a scotchmans appetite  and you do not tell us how far we are from this frightful land mons le capitaine inquired mademoiselle viefville  in ten minutes you shall know ladies for i am about to observe for the longitude it is a little late but it may yet be done  and we may rely on the fidelity of your information  on the honour of a sailor and a man  the ladies were silent while mr truck proceeded to get the sun and the time as soon as he had run through his calculations he came to them with a face in which the eye was roving though it was still goodhumoured and smiling  and the result said eve  is not quite as flattering as i could wish we are materially within a degree of the coast but as the wind is gone or nearly so we may hope to find a shift that will shove us farther from the land and now i have dealt frankly with you let me beg you will keep the secret for my people will be dreaming of turks instead of working if they knew the fact  it required no great observation to discover that captain truck was far from satisfied with the position of his ship without any aftersail and almost without the means of making any it was idle to think of hauling off from the land more especially against the heavy sea that was still rolling in from the northwest and his present object was to make the cape de verdes before reaching which he would be certain to meet the trades and where of course there would be some chance of repairing damages his apprehensions would have been much less were the ship a degree further west as the prevailing winds in this part of the ocean are from the northward and eastward but it was no easy matter to force a ship that distance under a foresail the only regular sail that now remained in its place it is true he had some of the usual expedients of seamen at his command and the people were immediately set about them but in consequence of the principal spars having gone so near the decks it became exceedingly difficult to rig jurymasts  something must be attempted however and the spare spars were got out and all the necessary preparations were commenced in order that they might be put into their places and rigged as well as circumstances would allow as soon as the sea went down and the steadiness of the ship would permit mr leach succeeded in getting up an awkward lower studdingsail and a sort of a staysail forward and with these additions to their canvas the ship was brought to head south with the wind light at the westward the sea was greatly diminished about noon but a mile an hour for those who had so long a road before them and who were so near a coast that was known to be fearfully inhospitable was a cheerless progress and the cry of sail ho early in the afternoon diffused a general joy in the montauk  the stranger was made to the southward and eastward and was standing on a course that must bring her quite near to their own track as the montauk then headed the wind was so light however that captain truck gave it as his opinion they could not speak until night had set in  unless the coast has brought him up yonder flaunting gentleman who seems to have had better luck with his light canvas than ourselves must be the foam he said tobacco or no tobacco bride or bridegroom the fellow has us at last and all the consolation that is left is that we shall be much obliged to him now if he will carry us to portsmouth or into any other christian haven we have shown him what a kettlebottom can do before the wind and now let him give us a tow to windward like a generous antagonist that is what i call vattel my dear young lady  if he do this he will indeed prove himself a generous adversary said eve and we shall be certain to speak well of his humanity whatever we may think of his obstinacy  are you quite sure the ship in sight is the corvette asked paul blunt  who else can it betwo vessels are quite sufficient to be jammed down here on the coast of africa and we know that the englishman must be somewhere to leeward of us though i will confess i had believed him much farther if not plump up among the mohammedans beginning to reduce to a featherweight like captain riley who came out with just his skin and bones after a journey across the desert  i do not think those topgallantsails have the symmetry of the canvas of a shipofwar  captain truck looked steadily at the young man an instant as one regards a sound criticism and then he turned his eye towards the object of which they were speaking  you are right sir he rejoined after a moment of examination and i have had a lesson in my own trade from one young enough to be my son the stranger is clearly no cruiser and as there is no port inshore of us anywhere near this latitude he is probably some trader who has been driven down here like ourselves  and im very sure captain put in sir george templemore we ought to rejoice sincerely that like ourselves he has escaped shipwreck for my part i pity the poor wretches on board the foam most sincerely and could almost wish myself a catholic that one might yet offer up sacrifices in their behalf  you have shown yourself a christian throughout all that affair sir george and i shall not forget your hand some offers to befriend the ship rather than let us fall into the jaws of the philistines we were in a category more than once with that nimblefooted racer in our wake and you were the man sir george who manifested the most hearty desire to get us out  i ever feel an interest in the ship in which i embark returned the gratified baronet who was not displeased at hearing his liberality so openly commended and i would cheerfully have given a thousand pounds in preference to being taken i rather think now that is the true spirit for a sportsman  or for an admiral my good sir to be frank with you sir george when i first had the honour of your acquaintance i did not think you had so much in you there was a sort of english attention to small wares a species of kneebuckleism about your debutt as mr dodge calls it that made me distrust your being the wholesouled and oneidead man i find you really are  oh i do like my comforts said sir george laughing  that you do and i am only surprised you dont smoke now mr dodge your roommate there tells me you have sixandthirty pair of breeches  i haveyes indeed i have one would wish to go abroad decently clad  well if it should be our luck to travel in the deserts your wardrobe would rig out a whole harem  i wish captain you would do me the favour to step into our stateroom some morning i have many curious things i should like to show you a set of razors in particularand a dressingcaseand a pair of patent pistolsand that lifepreserver that you admire so much mr dodge mr dodge has seen most of my curiosities i believe and will tell you some of them are really worth a moments examination  yes captain i must say observed mr dodgefor this conversation was held apart between the three the mate keeping an eye the while on the duty of the ship for habit had given mr truck the faculty of driving his people while he entertained his passengersyes captain i must say i have met no gentleman who is better supplied with necessaries than my friend sir george but english gentlemen are curious in such things and i admit that i admire their ingenuity  particularly in breeches mr dodge have you coats to match sir george  certainly sir one would be a little absurd in his shirt sleeves i wish captain we could make mr dodge a little less of a republican i find him a most agreeable roommate but rather annoying on the subject of kings and princes  you stick up for the people mr dodge or to the old category  on that subject sir george and i shall never agree for he is obstinately monarchial but i tell him we shall treat him none the worse for that when he gets among us he has promised me a visit in our part of the country and i have pledged myself to his being unqualifiedly well received and i think i know the whole meaning of a pledge  i understand mr dodge pursued the baronet that he is the editor of a public journal in which he entertains his readers with an account of his adventures and observations during his travels the active inquirer is it not mr dodge  that is the name sir george the active inquirer is the present name though when we supported mr adams it was called the active enquirer with an e  a distinction without a difference i like that interrupted captain truck this is the second time i have had the honour to sail with mr dodge and a more active inquirer never put foot in a ship though i did not know the use he put his information to before it is all in the way of trade i find  mr dodge claims to belong to a profession captain and is quite above trade he tells me many things have occurred on board this ship since we sailed that will make very eligible paragraphs  the d he doesi should like particularly well mr dodge to know what you will find to say concerning this category in which the montauk is placed  oh captain no fear of me when you are concerned you know i am a friend and you have no cause to apprehend any thing though ill not answer for everybody else on board for there are passengers in this ship to whom i have decided antipathies and whose deportment meets with my unqualified disapprobation  and you intend to paragraph them  mr dodge was now swelling with the conceit of a vulgar and inflated man who not only fancies himself in possession of a power that others dread but who was so far blinded to his own qualities as to think his opinion of importance to those whom he felt in the minutest fibre of his envious and malignant system to be in every essential his superiors he did not dare express all his rancour while he was unequal to suppressing it entirely  these effinghams and this mr sharp and that mr blunt he muttered think themselves everybodys betters but we shall see america is not a country in which people can shut themselves up in rooms and fancy they are lords and ladies  bless my soul said captain truck with his affected simplicity of manner how did you find this out mr dodge what a thing it is sir george to be an active inquirer  oh i know when a man is blown up with notions of his own importance as for mr john effingham he has been so long abroad that he has forgotten that he is a going home to a country of equal rights  very true mr dodge a country in which a man cannot shut himself up in his room whenever the notion seizes him this is the spirit sir george to make a great nation and you see that the daughter is likely to prove worthy of the old lady but my dear sir are you quite sure that mr john effingham has absolutely so high a sentiment in his own favour it would be awkward business to make a blunder in such a serious matter and murder a paragraph for nothing you should remember the mistake of the irishman  what was that asked the baronet who was completely mystified by the indomitable gravity of captain truck whose character might be said to be actually formed by the long habit of treating the weaknesses of his fellowcreatures with cool contempt we hear many good things at our club but i do not remember the mistake of the irishman  he merely mistook the drumming in his own ear for some unaccountable noise that disturbed his companions  mr dodge felt uncomfortable but there is no one in whom a vulgarminded man stands so much in awe as an immovable quiz who has no scruple in using his power he shook his head therefore in a menacing manner and affecting to have something to do he went below leaving the baronet and captain by themselves  mr dodge is a stubborn friend of liberty said the former when his roommate was out of hearing  that is he and you have his own word for it he has no notion of letting a man do as he has a mind to we are full of such active inquirers in america and i dont care how many you shoot before you begin upon the white bears sir george  but it would be more gracious in the effinghams you must allow captain if they shut themselves up in their cabin less and admitted us to their society a little oftener i am quite of mr dodges way of thinking that exclusion is excessively odious  there is a poor fellow in the steerage sir george to whom i have given a piece of canvas to repair a damage to his mainsail who would say the same thing did he know of your sixandthirtys take a cigar my dear sir and smoke away sorrow  thankee captain i never smoke we never smoke at our club though some of us go at times to the divan to try a chibouk  we cant all have cabins to ourselves or no one would live forward if the effinghams like their own apartment i do honestly believe it is for a reason as simple as that it is the best in the ship ill warrant you if there were a better that they would be ready enough to change i suppose when we get in mr dodge will honour you with an article in the active inquirer  to own the truth he has intimated some such thing  and why not a very instructive paragraph might be made about the sixandthirty pair of breeches and the patent razors and the dressingcase to say nothing of the rocky mountains and the white bears  sir george now began to feel uncomfortable and making a few unmeaning remarks about the late accident he disappeared  captain truck who never smiled except at the corner of his left eye turned away and began rattling off his people and throwing in a hint or two to saunders with as much indifference as if he were a firm believer in the unfailing orthodoxy of a newspaper and entertained a profound respect for the editor of the active inquirer in particular  the prognostic of the master concerning the strange ship proved true for about nine at night she came within hail and backed her maintopsail this vessel proved to be an american in ballast bound from gibraltar to new york a return storeship from the squadron kept in the mediterranean she had met the gale to the westward of madeira and after holding on as long as possible had also been compelled to scud according to the report of her officers the foam had run in much closer to the coast than herself and it was their opinion she was lost their own escape was owing entirely to the winds abating for they had actually been within sight of the land though having received no injury they had been able to haul off in season  luckily this ship was ballasted with fresh water and captain truck passed the night in negotiating a transfer of his steerage passengers under an apprehension that in the crippled state of his own vessel his supplies might be exhausted before he could reach america in the morning the offer of being put on board the storeship was made to those who chose to accept it and all in the steerage with most from the cabin profited by the occasion to exchange a dismasted vessel for one that was at least full rigged provisions were transferred accordingly and by noon next day the stranger made sail on a wind the sea being tolerably smooth and the breeze still ahead in three hours she was out of sight to the northward and westward the montauk holding her own dull course to the southward with the double view of striking the trades or of reaching one of the cape de verdes     chapter xv      stephhis forward voice now is to speak well of his friend his   backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract    tempest   the situation of the montauk appeared more desolate than ever after the departure of so many of her passengers so long as her decks were thronged there was an air of life about her that served to lessen disquietude but now that she was left by all in the steerage and by so many in the cabins those who remained began to entertain livelier apprehensions of the future when the upper sails of the storeship sunk as a speck in the ocean mr effingham regretted that he too had not overcome his reluctance to a crowded and inconvenient cabin and gone on board her with his own party thirty years before he would have thought himself fortunate in finding so good a ship and accommodations so comfortable but habit and indulgence change all our opinions and he had now thought it next to impossible to place eve and mademoiselle viefville in a situation that was so common to those who travelled by sea at the commencement of the century  most of the cabin passengers as has just been stated decided differently none remaining but the effinghams and their party mr sharp mr blunt sir george templemore mr dodge and mr monday mr effingham had been influenced by the superior comforts of the packet and his hopes that a speedy arrival at the islands would enable the ship to refit in time to reach america almost as soon as the dullsailing vessel which had just left them mr sharp and mr blunt had both expressed a determination to share his fortunes which was indirectly saying that they would share the fortunes of his daughter john effingham remained as a matter of course though he had made a proposition to the stranger to tow them into port an arrangement that failed in consequence of the two captains disagreeing as to the course proper to be steered as well as to a more serious obstacle in the way of compensation the stranger throwing out some pretty plain hints about salvage and mr monday staying from an inveterate attachment to the stewards stores more of which he rightly judged would now fall to his share than formerly  sir george templemore had gone on board the storeship and had given some very clear demonstrations of an intention to transfer himself and the thirtysix pair of breeches to that vessel but on examining her comforts and particularly the confined place in which he should be compelled to stow himself and his numerous curiosities he was unequal to the sacrifice on the other hand he knew an entire stateroom would now fall to his share and this selfindulged and feebleminded young man preferred his immediate comfort and the gratification of his besetting weakness to his safety  as for mr dodge he had the american mania of hurry and was one of the first to propose a general swarming as soon as it was known the stranger could receive them during the night he had been actively employed in fomenting a party to resolve that prudence required the montauk should be altogether abandoned and even after this scheme failed he had dwelt eloquently in corners mr dodge was too meek and too purely democratic ever to speak aloud unless under the shadow of public opinion on the propriety of captain trucks yielding his own judgment to that of the majority he might as well have scolded against the late gale in the expectation of outrailing the tempest as to make such an attempt on the firmset notions of the old seaman concerning his duty for no sooner was the thing intimated to him than he growled a denial in a tone that he was little accustomed to use to his passengers and one that effectually silenced remonstrance when these two plans had failed mr dodge endeavoured strenuously to show sir george that his interests and safety were on the side of a removal but with all his eloquence and with the hold that incessant adulation had actually given him on the mind of the other he was unable to overcome his love of ease and chiefly the passion for the enjoyment of the hundred articles of comfort and curiosity in which the baronet so much delighted the breeches might have been packed in a trunk it is true and so might the razors and the dressingcase and the pistols and most of the other things but sir george loved to look at them daily and as many as possible were constantly paraded before his eyes  to the surprise of every one mr dodge on finding it impossible to prevail on sir george templemore to leave the packet suddenly announced his own intention to remain also few stopped to inquire into his motives in the hurry of such a moment to his roommate he affirmed that the strong friendship he had formed for him could alone induce him to relinquish the hope of reaching home previously to the autumn elections  nor did mr dodge greatly colour the truth in making this statement he was an american demagogue precisely in obedience to those feelings and inclinations which would have made him a courtier any where else it is true he had travelled or thought he had travelled in a diligence with a countess or two but from these he had been obliged to separate early on account of the force of things while here he had got a bonâfide english baronet all to himself in a confined stateroom and his imagination revelled in the glory and gratification of such an acquaintance what were the proud and distant effinghams to sir george templemore he even ascribed their reserve with the baronet to envy a passion of whose existence he had very lively perceptions and he found a secret charm in being shut up in so small an apartment with a man who could excite envy in an effingham rather than abandon his aristocratical prize therefore whom he intended to exhibit to all his democratic friends in his own neighbourhood mr dodge determined to abandon his beloved hurry looking for his reward in the future pleasure of talking of sir george templemore and his curiosities and of his sayings and his jokes in the circle at home odd moreover as it may seem mr dodge had an itching desire to remain with the effinghams for while he was permitting jealousy and a consciousness of inferiority to beget hatred he was willing at any moment to make peace provided it could be done by a frank admission into their intimacy as to the innocent family that was rendered of so much account to the happiness of mr dodge it seldom thought of that individual at all little dreaming of its own importance in his estimation and merely acted in obedience to its own cultivated tastes and high principles in disliking his company it fancied itself in this particular the master of its own acts and this so much the more that with the reserve of goodbreeding its members seldom indulged in censorious personal remarks and never in gossip  as a consequence of these contradictory feelings of mr dodge and of the fastidiousness of sir george templemore the interest her two admirers took in eve the devotion of mr monday to sherry and champaigne and the decision of mr effingham these persons therefore remained the sole occupants of the cabins of the montauk of the oi polloi who had left them we have hitherto said nothing because this separation was to remove them entirely from the interest of our incidents  if we were to say that captain truck did not feel melancholy as the storeship sunk beneath the horizon we should represent that stouthearted mariner as more stoical than he actually was in the course of a long and adventurous professional life he had encountered calamities before but he had never before been compelled to call in assistance to deliver his passengers at the stipulated port since he had commanded a packet he felt the necessity in the present instance as a sort of stain upon his character as a seaman though in fact the accident which had occurred was chiefly to be attributed to a concealed defect in the mainmast the honest master sighed often smoked nearly double the usual number of cigars in the course of the afternoon and when the sun went down gloriously in the distant west he stood gazing at the sky in melancholy silence as long as any of the magnificent glory that accompanies the decline of day lingered among the vapours of the horizon he then summoned saunders to the quarterdeck where the following dialogue took place between them  this is a devil of a category to be in master steward  well he might be better sir i only wish the good butter may endure until we get in  if it fail i shall go nigh to see you clapt into the states prison or at least into that gothic cottage on blackwells island  there is an end to all things captain truck if you please sir even to butter i presume sir mr vattel if he know anything of cookery will admit that  harkee saunders if you ever insinuate again that vattel belonged to the coppers in my presence ill take the liberty to land you on the coast here where you may amuse yourself in stewing young monkeys for your own dinner i saw you aboard the other ship sir overhauling her arrangements what sort of a time will the gentlemen be likely to have in her  atrocious sir i give you my honour as a real gentleman sir why would you believe it captain truck the steward is a downright nigger and he wears earrings and a red flannel shirt without the least edication as for the cook sir he wouldnt pass an examination for jemmy ducks aboard here and there is but one camboose and one set of coppers  well the steeragepassengers in that case will fare as well as the cabin  yes sir and the cabin as bad as the steerage and for my part i abomernate liberty and equality  you should converse with mr dodge on that subject master saunders and let the hardest fend off in the argument may i inquire sir if you happen to remember the day of the week  beyond controversy sir tomorrow will be sunday captain truck and i think it a thousand pities we have not an opportunity to solicit the prayers and praises of the church sir in our behalf sir  if tomorrow will be sunday today must be saturday mr saunders unless this last gale has deranged the calendar  quite naturally sir and werry justly remarked every body admits there is no better navigator than captain truck sir  this may be true my honest fellow returned the captain moodily after making three or four heavy puffs on the cigar but i am sadly out of my road down here in the country of your amiable family just now if this be saturday there will be a saturday night before long and look to it that we have our sweethearts and wives though i have neither myself i feel the necessity of something cheerful to raise my thoughts to the future  depend on my discretion sir and i rejoice to hear you say it for i think sir a ship is never so respectable and genteel as when she celebrates all the anniwersaries you will be quite a select and agreeable party tonight sir  with this remark mr saunders withdrew to confer with toast on the subject and captain truck proceeded to give his orders for the night to mr leach the proud ship did indeed present a sight to make a seaman melancholy for to the only regular sail that stood the foresail by this time was added a lower studdingsail imperfectly rigged and which would not resist a fresh puff while a very inartificial jurytopmast supported a topgallantsail that could only be carried in a free wind aft preparations were making of a more permanent nature it is true the upper part of the mainmast had been cut away as low as the steeragedeck where an arrangement had been made to step a spare topmast the spar itself was lying on the deck rigged and a pair of sheers were in readiness to be hoisted in order to sway it up but night approaching the men had been broken off to rig the yards bend the sails and to fit the other spars it was intended to use postponing the last act that of sending all up until morning  we are likely to have a quiet night of it said the captain glancing his eyes round at the heavens and at eight oclock tomorrow let all hands be called when we will turnto with a will and make a brig of the old hussey this topmast will do to bear the strain of the spare mainyard unless there come another gale and by reefing the new mainsail we shall be able to make something out of it the topgallantmast will fit of course above and we may make out by keeping a little free to carry the sail at need we may possibly coax the contrivance into carrying a studdingsail also we have sticks for no more though well endeavour to get up something aft out of the spare spars obtained from the storeship you may knock off at four bells mr leach and let the poor fellows have their saturdays night in peace it is a misfortune enough to be dismasted without having ones grog stopped  the mate of course obeyed and the evening shut in beautifully and placid with all the glory of a mild night in a latitude as low as that they were in they who have never seen the ocean under such circumstances know little of its charms in its moments of rest the term of sleeping is well applied to its impressive stillness for the long sluggish swells on which the ship rose and fell hardly disturbed its surface the moon did not rise until midnight and eve accompanied by mademoiselle viefville and most of her male companions walked the deck by the bright starlight until fatigued with pacing their narrow bounds  the song and the laugh rose frequently from the forecastle where the crew were occupied with their saturday night and occasionally a rude sentiment in the way of a toast was heard but weariness soon got the better of merriment forward and the hardworked mariners who had the watch below soon went down to their berths leaving those whose duty it was to remain to doze away the long hours in such places as they could find on deck  a white squall said captain truck looking up at the uncouth sails that hardly impelled the vessel a mile in the hour through the water would soon furl all our canvas for us and we are in the very place for such an interlude  and what would then become of us asked mademoiselle viefville quickly  you had better ask what would become of that apology for a topsail mamselle and yonder stunsail which looks like an american in london without straps to his pantaloons the canvas would play kite and we should be left to renew our inventions a ship could scarcely be in better plight than we are at this moment to meet with one of these african flurries  in which case captain observed mr monday who stood by the skylight watching the preparations below we can go to our saturdaynight without fear for i see the steward has everything ready and the punch looks very inviting to say nothing of the champaigne  gentlemen we will not forget our duty returned the captain we are but a small family and so much the greater need that we should prove a jolly one mr effingham i hope we are to have the honour of your company at sweethearts and wives  mr effingham had no wife and the invitation coming under such peculiar circumstances produced a pang that eve who felt his arm tremble well understood she mildly intimated her intention to go below however the whole party followed and lucky it was for the captains entertainment that she quitted the deck as few would otherwise have been present at it by pressing the passengers to favour him with their company he succeeded in the course of a few minutes in getting all the gentlemen seated at the cabintable with a glass of delicious punch before each man  mr saunders may not be a conjuror or a mathematician gentlemen cried captain truck as he ladled out the beverage but he understands the philosophy of sweet and sour strong and weak and i will venture to praise his liquor without tasting it well gentlemen there are betterrigged ships on the ocean than this of ours but there are few with more comfortable cabins or stouter hulls or better company please god we can get a few sticks aloft again now that we are quit of our troublesome shadow i think i may flatter myself with a reasonable hope of landing you that do me the honour to stand by me in new york in less time than a common drogger would make the passage with his legs and arms let our first toast be if you please a happy end to that which has had a disastrous beginning  captain trucks hard face twitched a little while he was making this address and as he swallowed the punch his eyes glistened in spite of himself mr dodge sir george and mr monday repeated the sentiment sonorously word for word while the other gentlemen bowed and drank it in silence  the commencement of a regular scene of merriment is usually dull and formal and it was some time before captain truck could bring any of his companions up to the point where he wished to see them for though a perfectly sober man he loved a social glass and particularly at those times and seasons which conformed to the practice of his calling although eve and her governess had declined taking their seats at the table they consented to place themselves where they might be seen and where they might share occasionally in the conversation  here have i been drinking sweethearts and wives of a saturdaynight my dear young lady these forty years and more said captain truck after the party had sipped their liquor for a minute or two without ever falling into lucks latitude or furnishing myself with either but though so negligent of my own interests and happiness i make it an invariable rule to advise all my young friends to get spliced before they are thirty many is the man who has come aboard my ship a determined bachelor in his notions who has left it at the end of the passage ready to marry the first pretty young woman he fell in with  as eve had too much of the selfrespect of a lady and of the true dignity of her sex to permit jokes concerning matrimony or a treatise on love to make a part of her conversation and all the gentlemen of her party understood her character too well to say nothing of their own habits to second this attempt of the captains after a vapid remark or two from the others this rally of the honest mariner produced no suites  are we not unusually low captain truck inquired paul blunt with a view to change the discourse not to have fallen in with the trades i have commonly met with those winds on this coast as high as twentysix or twenty seven and i believe you observed today in twentyfour  captain truck looked hard at the speaker and when he had done he nodded his head in approbation  you have travelled this road before mr blunt i perceive i have suspected you of being a brother chip from the moment i saw you first put your foot on the sidecleets in getting out of the boat you did not come aboard parrottoed like a countrygirl waltzing but set the ball of the foot firmly on the wood and swung off the length of your arms like a man who knows how to humour the muscles your present remark too shows you understand where a ship ought to be in order to be in her right place as for the trades they are a little uncertain like a ladys mind when she has more than one good offer for ive known them to blow as high as thirty and then again to fail a vessel as low as twentythree or even lower it is my private opinion gentlemen and i gladly take this opportunity to make it public that we are on the edge of the trades or in those light baffling winds which prevail along their margin as eddies play near the track of strong steady currents in the ocean if we can force the ship fairly out of this trimming regionthat is the word i believe mr dodgewe shall do well enough for a northeast or an east wind would soon send us up with the islands even under the rags we carry we are very near the coast certainlymuch nearer than i could wish but when we do get the good breeze it will be all the better for us as it will find us well to windward  but these trades captain truck asked eve if they always blow in the same direction how is it possible that the late gale should drive a ship into the quarter of the ocean where they prevail  always means sometimes my dear young lady although light winds prevail near the edge of the trades gales and tremendous fellows too sometimes blow there also as we have just seen i think we shall now have settled weather and that our chance of a safe arrival more particularly in some southern american port is almost certain though our chance for a speedy arrival be not quite as good i hope before twentyfour hours are passed to see our decks white with sand  is that a phenomenon seen here asked the father  often mr effingham when ships are close in with africa and are fairly in the steady winds to say the truth the country abreast of us some twenty or thirty miles distant is not the most inviting and though it may not be easy to say where the garden of eden is it is no hazardous to say it is not there  if we are so very near the coast why do we not see it  perhaps we might from aloft if we had any aloft just now we are to the southward of the mountains however and off a part of the country where the great desert makes from the coast and now gentlemen i perceive mr monday finds all this sand arid and i ask permission to give you one and all sweethearts and wives  most of the company drank the usual toast with spirit though both the effinghams scarce wetted their lips eve stole a timid glance at her father and her own eyes were filled with tears as she withdrew them for she knew that every allusion of this nature revived in him mournful recollections as for her cousin jack he was so confirmed a bachelor that she thought nothing of his want of sympathy with such a sentiment  you must have a care for your heart in america sir george templemore cried mr dodge whose tongue loosened with the liquor he drank our ladies are celebrated for their beauty and are immensely popular i can assure you  sir george looked pleased and it is quite probable his thoughts ran on the one particular vestment of the sixandthirty in which he ought to make his first appearance in such a society  i allow the american ladies to be handsome said mr monday but i think no englishman need be in any particular danger of his heart from such a cause after having been accustomed to the beauty of his own island captain truck i have the honour to drink your health  fairly said cried the captain bowing to the compliment and i ascribe my own hard fortune to the fact that i have been kept sailing between two countries so much favoured in this particular that i have never been able to make up my mind which to prefer i have wished a thousand times there was but one handsome woman in the world when a man would have nothing to do but fall in love with her and make up his mind to get married at once or to hang himself  that is a cruel wish to us men returned sir george as we should be certain to quarrel for the beauty  in such a case resumed mr monday we common men would have to give way to the claims of the nobility and gentry and satisfy ourselves with plainer companions though an englishman loves his independence and might rebel i have the honour to drink your health and happiness sir george  i protest against your principle mr monday said mr dodge which is an invasion on human rights perfect freedom of action is to be maintained in this matter as in all others i acknowledge that the english ladies are extremely beautiful but i shall always maintain the supremacy of the american fair  we will drink their healths sir i am far from denying their beauty mr dodge but i think you must admit that they fade earlier than our british ladies god bless them both however and i empty this glass to the two entire nations with all my heart and soul  perfectly polite mr monday but as to the fading of the ladies i am not certain that i can yield an unqualified approbation to your sentiment  nay sir your climate you will allow is none of the best and it wears out constitutions almost as fast as your states make them  i hope there is no real danger to be apprehended from the climate said sir george i particularly detest bad climates and for that reason have always made it a rule never to go into lincolnshire  in that case sir george you had better have stayed at home in the way of climate a man seldom betters himself by leaving old england now this is the tenth time ive been in america allowing that i ever reach there and although i entertain a profound respect for the country i find myself growing older every time i quit it mr effingham i do myself the favour to drink to your health and happiness  you live too well when amongst us mr monday said the captain there are too many soft crabs hard clams and canvasbacks too much old madeira and generous sherry for a man of your wellknown taste to resist them sit less time at table and go oftener to church this trip and let us hear your report of the consequences a twelvemonth hence  you quite mistake my habits captain truck i give you my honour although a judicious eater i seldom take anything that is compounded being a plain roast and boiled man a true oldfashioned englishman in this respect satisfying my appetite with solid beef and mutton and turkey and pork and puddings and potatoes and turnips and carrots and similar simple food and then i never drinkladies i ask the honour to be permitted to wish you a happy return to your native countriesi ascribe all the difficulty sir to the climate which will not permit a man to digest properly  well mr monday i subscribe to most of your opinions and i believe few men cross the ocean together that are more harmonious in sentiment in general than has proved to be the case between you and sir george and myself observed mr dodge glancing obliquely and pointedly at the rest of the party as if he thought they were in a decided minority but in this instance i feel constrained to record my vote in the negative i believe america has as good a climate and as good general digestion as commonly falls to the lot of mortals more than this i do not claim for the country and less than this i should be reluctant to maintain i have travelled a little gentlemen not as much perhaps as the messrs effinghams but then a man can see no more than is to be seen and i do affirm captain truck that in my poor judgment which i know is good for nothing  why do you use it then abruptly asked the straightforward captain why not rely on a better  we must use such as we have or go without sir and i suspect in my very poor judgment which is probably poorer than that of most others on board that america is a very good sort of a country at all events after having seen something of other countries and governments and people i am of opinion that america as a country is quite good enough for me  you never said truer words mr dodge and i beg you will join mr monday and myself in a fresh glass of punch just to help on the digestion you have seen more of human nature than your modesty allows you to proclaim and i dare say this company would be gratified if you would overcome all scruples and let us know your private opinions of the different people you have visited tell us something of that dittur you made on the rhine  mr dodge intends to publish it is to be hoped observed mr sharp and it may not be fair to anticipate his matter  i beg gentlemen you will have no scruples on that score for my work will be rather philosophical and general than of the particular nature of private anecdotes saunders hand me the manuscript journal you will find on the shelf of our stateroom next to sir georges patent toothpick case this is the book and now gentlemen and ladies i beg you to remember that these are merely the ideas as they arose and not my more mature reflections  take a little punch sir interrupted the captain again whose hard norwest face was set in the most demure attention there is nothing like punch to clear the voice mr dodge the acid removes the huskiness the sugar softens the tones the water mellows the tongue and the jamaica braces the muscles with a plenty of punch a man soon gets to be anotheri forget the name of that great orator of antiquityit wasnt vattel however  you mean demosthenes sir and gentlemen i beg you to remark that this orator was a republican but there can be no question that liberty is favourable to the encouragement of all the higher qualities would you prefer a few notes on paris ladies or shall i commence with some extracts about the rhine  oh de grace monsieur be so very kind as not to overlook paris said mademoiselle viefville  mr dodge bowed graciously and turning over the leaves of his private journal he alighted in the heart of the great city named after some preliminary hemming he commenced reading in a grave didactic tone that sufficiently showed the value he had attached to his own observations  dejjuned at ten as usual an hour that i find exceedingly unreasonable and improper and one that would meet with general disapprobation in america i do not wonder that a people gets to be immoral and depraved in their practices who keep such improper hours the mind acquires habits of impurity and all the sensibilities become blunted by taking the meals out of the natural seasons i impute much of the corruption of france to the periods of the day in which the food is taken  voilà une drole didée ejaculated mademoiselle viefville  in which food is taken repeated mr dodge who fancied the involuntary exclamation was in approbation of the justice of his sentiments indeed the custom of taking wine at this meal together with the immorality of the hour must be chief reasons why the french ladies are so much in the practice of drinking to excess  mais monsieur  you perceive mademoiselle calls in question the accuracy of your facts observed mr blunt who in common with all the listeners sir george and mr monday excepted began to enjoy a scene which at first had promised nothing but ennui and disgust  i have it on the best authority i give you my honour or i would not introduce so grave a charge in a work of his contemplated importance i obtained my information from an english gentleman who has resided twelve years in paris and he informs me that a very large portion of the women of fashion in that capital let them belong to what country they will are dissipated  a la bonne heure monsieurmais to drink it is very different  not so much so mademoiselle as you imagine rejoined john effingham mr dodge is a purist in language as well as in morals and he uses terms differently from us lessinstructed prattlers by dissipated he understands a drunkard  comment  certainly mr john effingham i presume will at least give us the credit in america in speaking our language better than any other known people after dejjunying took a phyacre and rode to the palace to see the king and royal family leave for nully  pour où  pour neuilly mademoiselle eve quietly answered  for nully his majesty went on horseback preceding his illustrious family and all the rest of the noble party dressed in a red coat laced with white on the seams wearing blue breeches and a cocked hat  ciel  i made the king a suitable republican reverence as he passed which he answered with a gracious smile and a benignant glance of his royal eye the hon louis philippe orleans the present sovereign of the french is a gentleman of portly and commanding appearance and in his state attire which he wore on this occasion looks every inch a king he rides with grace and dignity and sets an example of decorum and gravity to his subjects by the solemnity of his air that it is to be hoped will produce a beneficial and benign influence during this reign on the manners of the nation his dignity was altogether worthy of the schoolmaster of haddonfield  par exemple  yes mamselle in the way of example it is that i mean although a pure democrat and every way opposed to exclusion i was particularly struck with the royalty of his majestys demeanour and the great simplicity of his whole deportment i stood in the crowd next to a very accomplished countess who spoke english and she did me the honour to invite me to pay her a visit at her hotel in the vicinity of the bourse  mon dieumon dieumon dieu  after promising my fair companion to be punctual i walked as far as notter dam  i wish mr dodge would be a little more distinct in his names said mademoiselle viefville who had begun to take an interest in the subject that even valueless opinions excite in us concerning things that touch the affections  mr dodge is a little profane mademoiselle observed the captain but his journal probably was not intended for the ladies and you must overlook it well sir you went to that naughty place  to notter dam captain truck if you please and i flatter myself that is pretty good french  i think ladies and gentlemen we have a right to insist on a translation for plain roast and boiled men like mr monday and myself are sometimes weeping when we ought to laugh so long as the discourse is in anything but oldfashioned english help yourself mr monday and remember you never drink  notter dam i believe mamselle means our mother the church of our mothernotter or noster ourdam mother notter dam here i was painfully impressed with the irreligion of the structure and the general absence of piety in the architecture idolatry abounded and so did holy water how often have i occasion to bless providence for having made me one of the descendants of those pious ancestors who cast their fortunes in the wilderness in preference to giving up their hold on faith and charity the building is much inferior in comfort and true taste to the commoner american churches and met with my unqualified disapprobation  est il possible que cela soit vrai ma chère  je lespère bien mademoiselle  you may despair bien cousin eve said john effingham whose fine curvilinear face curled even more than usual with contempt  the ladies whispered a few explanations and mr dodge who fancied it was only necessary to resolve to be perfect to achieve his end went on with his comments with all the selfsatisfaction of a provincial critic  from notter dam i proceeded in a cabrioly to the great national buryingground pere la chaise so termed from the circumstance that its distance from the capital renders chaises necessary for the convoys  hows this hows this interrupted mr truck is one obliged to sail under a convoy about the streets of paris  monsieur dodge veut dire convoi mr dodge mean to say convoi kindly interposed mademoiselle viefville  mr dodge is a profound republican and is an advocate for rotation in language as well as in office i must accuse you of inconstancy my dear friend if i die for it you certainly do not pronounce your words always in the same way and when i had the honour of carrying you out this time six months when you were practising the continentals as you call them you gave very different sounds to many of the words i then had the pleasure and gratification of hearing you use  we all improve by travelling sir and i make no question that my knowledge of foreign language is considerably enlarged by practice in the countries in which they are spoken  here the reading of the journal was interrupted by a digression on language in which messrs dodge monday templemore and truck were the principal interlocutors and during which the pitcher of punch was twice renewed we shall not record much of this learned discussion which was singularly commonplace though a few of the remarks may be given as a specimen of the whole  i must be permitted to say replied mr monday to one of mr dodges sweeping claims to superiority in favour of his own nation that i think it quite extraordinary an englishman should be obliged to go out of his own country in order to hear his own language spoken in purity and as one who has seen your people mr dodge i will venture to affirm that nowhere is english better spoken than in lancashire sir george i drink your health  more patriotic than just mr monday every body allows that the american of the eastern states speaks the best english in the world and i think either of these gentlemen will concede that  under the penalty of being nobody cried captain truck for my own part i think if a man wishes to hear the language in perfection he ought to pass a week or ten days in the river i must say mr dodge i object to many of your sounds particularly that of inyon which i myself heard you call onion no later than yesterday  mr monday is a little peculiar in fancying that the best english is to be met with in lancashire observed sir george templemore for i do assure you that in town we have difficulty in understanding gentlemen from your part of the kingdom  this was a hard cut from one in whom mr monday expected to find an ally and that gentleman was driven to washing down the discontent it excited in punch  but all this time we have interrupted the convoi or convoy captain said mr sharp and mr dodge to say nothing of the mourners has every right to complain i beg that gentleman will proceed with his entertaining extracts  mr dodge hemmed sipped a little more liquor blew his nose and continued  the celebrated cemetery is indeed worthy of its high reputation the utmost republican simplicity prevails in the interments ditches being dug in which the bodies are laid side by side without distinction of rank and with regard only to the order in which the convoys arrive i think this sentence gentlemen will have great success in america where the idea of any exclusiveness is quite odious to the majority  well for my part said the captain i should have no particular objection to being excluded from such a grave one would be afraid of catching the cholera in so promiscuous a company  mr dodge turned over a few leaves and gave other extracts  the last six hours have been devoted to a profound investigation of the fine arts my first visit was to the gullyteen after which i passed an instructive hour or two in the galleries of the musy  où done  le musée mademoiselle  where i discovered several very extraordinary things in the way of sculpture and painting i was particularly struck with the manner in which a plate was portrayed in the celebrated marriage of cana which might very well have been taken for real delft and there was one finger on the hand of a lady that seemed actually fitted to receive and to retain the hymeneal ring  did you inquire if she were engagedmr monday we will drink her health  saint michael and the dragon is a shefdowory  un quoi  un chefdoeuvre mademoiselle   the manner in which the angel holds the dragon with his feet looking exactly like a worm trodden on by the foot of a child is exquisitely plaintive and interesting indeed these touches of nature abound in the works of the old masters and i saw several fruitpieces that i could have eaten one really gets an appetite by looking at many things here and i no longer wonder that a raphael a titian a correggio a guideo  un qui  un guido mademoiselle  or a cooley  and pray who may he be asked mr monday  a young genius in dodgetown who promises one day to render the name of an american illustrious he has painted a new sign for the store that in its way is quite equal to the marriage of cana i have stood with tears over the despair of a niobe continuing to read and witnessed the contortions of the snakes in the laocoon with a convulsive eagerness to clutch them that has made me fancy i could hear them hiss that sentence i think will be likely to be noticed even in the newoldnewyorker one of the very best reviews of our days gentlemen  take a little more punch mr dodge put in the attentive captain this grows affecting and needs alleviation as saunders would say mr monday you will get a bad name for being too sober if you never empty your glass proceed in the name of heaven mr dodge  in the evening i went to the grand opery  où done  au grand hoppery mademoiselle replied john effingham  to the grand opery resumed mr dodge with emphasis his eyes beginning to glisten by this time for he had often applied to the punch for inspiration where i listened to music that is altogether inferior to that which we enjoy in america especially at the general trainings and on the sabbath the want of science was conspicuous and if this be music then do i know nothing about it  a judicious remarkexclaimed the captainmr dodge has great merit as a writer for he loses no occasion to illustrate his opinions by the most unanswerable facts he has acquired a taste for zip coon and long tail blue and it is no wonder he feels a contempt for your inferior artists  as for the dancing continued the editor of the active inquirer it is my decided impression that nothing can be worse the movement was more suited to a funeral than the ballroom and i affirm without fear of contradiction that there is not an assembly in all america in which a cotillion would not be danced in onehalf the time that one was danced in the bally tonight  dans le quoi  i believe i have not given the real parisian pronunciation to this word which the french call ballay continued the reader with great candour  belay or make all fast as we say on shipboard mr dodge as master of this vessel i beg to return you the united or as saunders would say the condensed thanks of the passengers for this information and next saturday we look for a renewal of the pleasure the ladies are getting to be sleepy i perceive and as mr monday never drinks and the other gentlemen have finished their punch we may as well retire to get ready for a hard days work tomorrow  captain truck made this proposal because he saw that one or two of the party were plenum punch and that eve and her companion were becoming aware of the propriety of retiring it was also true that he foresaw the necessity of rest in order to be ready for the exertions of the morning  after the party had broken up which it did very contrary to the wishes of messrs dodge and monday mademoiselle viefville passed an hour in the stateroom of miss effingham during which time she made several supererogatory complaints of the manner in which the editor of the active inquirer had viewed things in paris besides asking a good many questions concerning his occupation and character  i am not quite certain my dear mademoiselle that i can give you a very learned description of the animal you think worthy of all these questions but by the aid of mr john effinghams information and a few words that have fallen from mr blunt i believe it ought to be something as followsamerica once produced a very distinguished philosopher named franklin  comment ma chère tout le monde le connait  this monsieur franklin commenced life as a printer but living to a great age and rising to high employments he became a philosopher in morals as his studies had made him one in physics now america is full of printers and most of them fancy themselves franklins until time and failures teach them discretion  mais the world has not seen but un seul franklin  nor is it likely to see another very soon in america the young men are taught justly enough that by merit they may rise to the highest situations and always according to mr john effingham too many of them fancy that because they are at liberty to turn any high qualities they may happen to have to account they are actually fit for anything even he allows this peculiarity of the country does much good but he maintains that it also does much harm by causing pretenders to start up in all directions of this class he describes mr dodge to be this person instead of working at the mechanical part of a press to which he was educated has the ambition to control its intellectual and thus edits the active inquirer  it must be a very useful journal  it answers his purposes most probably he is full of provincial ignorance and provincial prejudices you perceive and i dare say he makes his paper the circulator of all these in addition to the personal rancour envy and uncharitableness that usually distinguish a pretension that mistakes itself for ambition my cousin jack affirms that america is filled with such as he  and monsieur effingham  oh my dear father is all mildness and charity you snow mademoiselle and he only looks at the bright side of the picture for he maintains that a great deal of good results from the activity and elasticity of such a state of things while he confesses to a great deal of downright ignorance that is paraded as knowledge to much narrow intolerance that is offensively prominent in the disguise of principle and a love of liberty and to vulgarity and personalities that wound all taste and every sentiment of right he insists on it that the main result is good  in such a case there is need of an umpire you mentioned the opinion of mr blunt comme ce jeune homme parle bien français  eve hesitated and she changed colour slightly before she answered  i am not certain that the opinion of mr blunt ought to be mentioned in opposition to those of my father and cousin jack on such a subject she said he is very young and it is now quite questionable whether he is even an american at all  tant mieux ma chère he has been much in the country and it is not the native that make the best judge when the stranger has many opportunities of seeing  on this principle mademoiselle you are then to give up your own judgment about france on all those points in which i have the misfortune to differ from you said eve laughing  pas tout à fait returned the governess goodhumouredly age and experience must pass pour quelque chose et monsieur blunt  monsieur blunt leans nearer to the side of cousin jack i fear than to that of my dear dear father he says men of mr dodges character propensities malignancy intolerance ignorance vulgarity and peculiar vices abound in and about the american press he even insists that they do an incalculable amount of harm by influencing those who have no better sources of information by setting up low jealousies and envy in the place of principles and the right by substitutingi use his own words mademoiselle said eve blushing with the consciousness of the fidelity of her memoryby substituting uninstructed provincial notions for true taste and liberality by confounding the real principles of liberty with personal envies and the jealousies of station and by losing sight entirely of their duties to the public in the effort to advance their own interests he says that the government is in truth a pressocracy and a pressocracy too that has not the redeeming merit of either principles tastes talents or knowledge  ce monsieur blunt has been very explicit and suffisamment eloquent returned mademoiselle viefville gravely for the prudent governess did not fail to observe that eve used language so very different from that which was habitual to her as to make her suspect she quoted literally for the first time the suspicion was painfully awakened that it was her duty to be more vigilant in relation to the intercourse between her charge and the two agreeable young men whom accident had given them as fellowpassengers after a short but musing pause she again adverted to the subject of their previous conversation  ce monsieur dodge est il ridicule  on that point at least my dear mademoiselle there can be no mistake and yet cousin jack insists that this stuff will be given to his readers as views of europe worthy of their attention  ce conte du roimais cest trop fort  with the coat laced at the seams and the cocked hat  et lhonorable louis philippe dorleans  orleans mademoiselle dorleans would be antirepublican  then the two ladies sat looking at each other a few moments in silence when both although of a proper retenue of manner in general burst into a hearty and longcontinued fit of laughter indeed so long did eve in the buoyancy of her young spirits and her keen perception of the ludicrous indulge herself that her fair hair fell about her rosy cheeks and her bright eyes fairly danced with delight     chapter xvi      and there he went ashore without delay   having no customhouse or quarantine   to ask him awkward questions on the way   about the time and place where he had been    byron   captain truck was in a sound sleep as soon as his head touched the pillow with the exception of the ladies the others soon followed his example and as the people were excessively wearied and the night was so tranquil ere long only a single pair of eyes were open on deck those of the man at the wheel the wind died away and even this worthy was not innocent of nodding at his post  under such circumstances it will occasion no great surprise that the cabin was aroused next morning with the sudden and startling information that the land was close aboard the ship every one hurried on deck where sure enough the dreaded coast of africa was seen with a palpable distinctness within two miles of the vessel it presented a long broken line of sandhills unrelieved by a tree or by so few as almost to merit this description and with a hazy background of remote mountains to the northeast the margin of the actual coast nearest to the ship was indented with bays and even rocks appeared in places but the general character of the scene was that of a fierce and burning sterility on this picture of desolation all stood gazing in awe and admiration for some minutes as the day gradually brightened until a cry arose from forward of a ship  whereaway sternly demanded captain truck for the sudden and unexpected appearance of this dangerous coast had awakened all that was forbidding and severe in the temperament of the old master whereaway sir  on the larboard quarter sir and at anchor  she is ashore exclaimed halfadozen voices at the same instant just as the words came from the last speaker the glass soon settled this important point at the distance of about a league astern of them were indeed to be seen the spars of a ship with the hull looming on the sands in a way to leave no doubt of her being a wreck it was the first impression of all that this at last was the foam but captain truck soon announced the contrary  it is a swede or a dane he said by his rig and his model a stout solid compact seaboat that is high and dry on the sands looking as if he had been built there he does not appear even to have bilged and most of his sails and all of his yards are in their places not a living soul is to be seen about her ha there are signs of tents made of sails on shore and broken bales of goods her people have been seized and carried into the desert as usual and this is a fearful hint that we must keep the montauk off the bottom turnto the people mr leach and get up your sheers that we may step our jurymasts at once the smallest breeze on the land would drive us ashore without any aftersail  while the mates and the crew set about completing the work they had prepared the previous day captain truck and his passengers passed the time in ascertaining all they could concerning the wreck and the reasons of their being themselves in a position so very different from what they had previously believed  as respects the first little more could be ascertained she lay absolutely high and dry on a hard sandy beach where she had probably been cast during the late gale and sufficient signs were made out by the captain to prove to him that she had been partly plundered more than this could not be discovered at that distance and the work of the montauk was too urgent to send a boat manned with her own people to examine mr blunt mr sharp mr monday and the servants of the two former however volunteering to pull the cutter it was finally decided to look more closely into the facts captain truck himself taking charge of the expeditionwhile the latter is getting ready a word of explanation will suffice to tell the reader the reason why the montauk had fallen so much to leeward  the ship being so near the coast it became now very obvious she was driven by a current that set along the land but which it was probable had set towards it more in the offing the imperceptible drift between the observation of the previous day and the discovery of the coast had sufficed to carry the vessel a great distance and to this simple cause coupled perhaps with some neglect in the steerage during the past night was her present situation to be solely attributed just at this moment the little air there was came from the land and by keeping her head offshore captain truck entertained no doubt of his being able to escape the calamity that had befallen the other ship in the fury of the gale a wreck is always a matter of so much interest with mariners therefore that taking all these things into view he had come to the determination we have mentioned of examining into the history of the one in sight so far as circumstances permitted  the montauk carried three boats the launch a large safe and wellconstructed craft which stood in the usual chucks between the foremast and mainmast a jollyboat and a cutter it was next to impossible to get the first into the water deprived as the ship was of its mainmast but the other hanging at davits one on each quarter were easily lowered the packets seldom carry any arms beyond a light gun to fire signals with the pistols of the master and perhaps a fowlingpiece or two luckily the passengers were better provided all the gentlemen had pistols mr monday and mr dodge excepted if indeed they properly belonged to this category as captain truck would say and most of them had also fowlingpieces although a careful examination of the coast with the glasses offered no signs of the presence of any danger from enemies these arms were carefully collected loaded and deposited in the boats in order to be prepared for the worst provisions and water were also provided and the party were about to proceed  captain truck and one or two of the adventurers were still on the deck when eve with that strange love of excitement and adventure that often visits the most delicate spirits expressed an idle regret that she could not make one in the expedition  there is something so strange and wild in landing on an african desert she said and i think a near view of the wreck would repay us mademoiselle for the hazard  the young men hesitated between their desire to have such a companion and their doubts of the prudence of the step but captain truck declared there could be no risk and mr effingham consenting the whole plan was altered so as to include the ladies for there was so much pleasure in varying the monotony of a calm and escaping the confinement of ship that everybody entered into the new arrangement with zeal and spirit  a single whip was rigged on the foreyard a chair was slung and in ten minutes both ladies were floating on the ocean in the cutter this boat pulled six oars which were manned by the servants of the two messrs effinghams mr blunt and mr sharp together with the two latter gentlemen in person mr effingham steered captain truck had the jollyboat of which he pulled an oar himself aided by saunders mr monday and sir george templemore the mates and the regular crew being actively engaged in rigging their jurymast mr dodge declined being of the party feeding himself with the hope that the present would be a favourable occasion to peep into the staterooms to run his eye over forgotten letters and papers and otherwise to increase the general stock of information of the editor of the active inquirer  look to your chains and see all clear for a run of the anchors mr leach should you set within a mile of the shore called out the captain as they pulled off from the vessels side the ship is drifting along the land but the wind you have will hardly do more than meet the send of the sea which is on shore should any thing go wrong show an ensign at the head of the jurystick forward  the mate waved his hand and the adventurers passed without the sound of the voice it was a strange sensation to most of those in the boats to find themselves in their present situation eve and mademoiselle viefville in particular could scarcely credit their senses when they found the eggshells that held them heaving and setting like bubbles on those long sluggish swells which had seemed of so little consequence while in the ship but which now resembled the heavy respirations of a leviathan the boats indeed though always gliding onward impelled by the oars appeared at moments to be sent helplessly back and forth like playthings of the mighty deep and it was some minutes before either obtained a sufficient sense of security to enjoy her situation as they receded fast from the montauk too their situation seemed still more critical and with all her sexs love of excitement eve heartily repented of her undertaking before they had gone a mile the gentlemen however were all in good spirits and as the boats kept near each other captain truck enlivening their way with his peculiar wit and mr effingham who was influenced by a motive of humanity in consenting to come being earnest and interested eve soon began to entertain other ideas  as they drew near the end of their little expedition entirely new feelings got the mastery of the whole party the solitary and gloomy grandeur of the coasts the sublime sterilityfor even naked sands may become sublime by their vastnessthe heavy moanings of the ocean on the beach and the entire spectacle of the solitude blended as it was with the associations of africa time and the changes of history united to produce sensations of a pleasing melancholy the spectacle of the ship bringing with it the images of european civilization as it lay helpless and deserted on the sands too heightened all  this vessel beyond a question had been driven up on a sea during the late gale at a point where the water was of sufficient depth to float her until within a few yards of the very spot where she now lay captain truck giving the following probable history of the affair  on all sandy coasts he said the return waves that are cast on the beach form a bar by washing back with them a portion of the particles this bar is usually within thirty or forty fathoms of the shore and there is frequently sufficient water within it to float a ship as this bar however prevents the return of all the water on what is called the undertow narrow channels make from point to point through which this excess of the element escapes these channels are known by the appearance of the water over them the seas breaking less at those particular places than in the spots where the bottom lies nearer to the surface and all experienced mariners are aware of the fact no doubt the unfortunate master of this ship finding himself reduced to the necessity of running ashore to save the lives of his crew has chosen such a place and has consequently forced his vessel up to a spot where she has remained dry as soon as the sea fell so worthy a fellow deserved a better fate for this wreck is not three days old and yet no signs are to be seen of any who were in that stout ship  these remarks were made as the crew of the two boats lay on their oars at a short distance without the line on the water where the breaking of the sea pointed out the position of the bar the channel also was plainly visible directly astern of the ship the sea merely rising and falling in it without combing a short distance to the southward a few bold black rocks thrust themselves forward and formed a sort of bay in which it was practicable to land without risk for they had come on the coast in a region where the monotony of the sands as it appeared when close in was little relieved by the presence of anything else  if you will keep the cutter just without the breakers mr effingham captain truck continued after standing up a while and examining the shore i will pull into the channel and land in yonder bay if you feel disposed to follow you may do so by giving the tiller to mr blunt on receiving a signal to that effect from me be steady gentlemen at your oars and look well to the arms on landing for we are in a knavish part of the world should any of the monkeys or ouranoutangs claim kindred with mr saunders we may find it no easy matter to persuade them to leave us the pleasure of his society  the captain made a sign and the jollyboat entered the channel inclining south it was seen rising and falling just within the breakers and then it was hid by the rocks in another minute mr truck followed by all but mr monday who stood sentinel at the boat was on the rocks making his way towards the wreck on reaching the latter he ascended swiftly even to the main crosstrees here a long examination of the plain beyond the bank that hid it from the view of all beneath succeeded and then the signal to come on was made to those who were still in the boat  shall we venture cried paul blunt soliciting an assent by the very manner in which he put the question  what say you dear father  i hope we may not yet be too late to succour some christian in distress my child take the tiller mr blunt and in heavens good name and for humanitys sake let us proceed  the boat advanced paul blunt standing erect to steer his ardour to proceed corrected by apprehensions on account of her precious freight there was an instant when the ladies trembled for it seemed as if the light boat was about to be cast upon the shore like the froth of the sea that shot past them but the steady hand of him who steered averted the danger and in another minute they were floating at the side of the jollyboat the ladies got ashore without much difficulty and stood on the summit of the rocks  nous voici donc en afrique exclaimed mademoiselle viefville with that sensation of singularity that comes over all when they first find themselves in situations of extraordinary novelty  the wreckthe wreck murmured eve let us go to the wreck there may be yet a hope of saving some wretched sufferer  toward the wreck they all proceeded after leaving two of the servants to relieve mr monday on his watch  it was an impressive thing to stand at the side of a ship on the sands of africa a scene in which the desolation of an abandoned vessel was heightened by the desolation of a desert the position of the vessel which stood nearly erect imbedded in the sands rendered it less difficult than might be supposed for the ladies to ascend to and to walk her decks a rude staging having been made already to facilitate the passage here the scene became thrice exciting for it was the very type of a hastily deserted and cherished dwelling  before eve and mademoiselle viefville gained the deck the other party had ascertained that no living soul remained the trunks chests furniture and other appliances of the cabin had been rummaged and many boxes had been raised from the hold and plundered a part of their contents still lying scattered on the decks the ship however had been lightly freighted and the bulk of her cargo which was salt was apparently untouched a danish ensign was found bent to the halyards a proof that captain trucks original conjecture concerning the character of the vessel was accurate her name too was ascertained to be the carrier as translated into english and she belonged to copenhagen more than this it was not easy to ascertain no papers were found and her cargo or as much of it as remained was so mixed and miscellaneous as saunders called it that no plausible guess could be given as to the port where it had been taken in if indeed it had all been received on board at the same place  several of the light sails had evidently been carried off but all the heavy canvas was left on the yards which remained in their places the vessel was large exceedingly strong as was proved by the fact that she had not bilged in beaching and apparently well found nothing was wanting to launch her into the ocean but machinery and force and a crew to sail her when she might have proceeded on her voyage as if nothing unusual had occurred but such a restoration was hopeless and this admirable machine like a man cut off in his youth and vigour had been cast upon the shores of this inhospitable region to moulder where it lay unless broken up for the wood and iron by the wanderers of the desert  there was no object more likely to awaken melancholy ideas in a mind resembling that of captain trucks than a spectacle of this nature a fine ship complete in nearly all her parts virtually uninjured and yet beyond the chance of further usefulness in his eyes was a picture of the most cruel loss he cared less for the money it had cost than for the qualities and properties that were thus destroyed  he examined the bottom which he pronounced capital for stowing and excellent as that of a seaboat he admired the fastenings applied his knife to try the quality of the wood and pronounced the norway pine of the spars to be almost equal to anything that could be found in our own southern woods the rigging too he regarded as one loves to linger over the regretted qualities of a deceased friend  the tracks of camels and horses were abundant on the sand around the ship and especially at the bottom of the rude staging by which the party had ascended and which had evidently been hastily made in order to carry articles from the vessel to the backs of the animals that were to bear them into the desert the footprints of men were also to be seen and there was a startling and mournful certainty in distinguishing the marks of shoes as well as those of the naked foot  judging from all these signs captain truck was of opinion the wreck must have taken place but two or three days before and that the plunderers had not left the spot many hours  they probably went off with what they could carry at sunset last evening and there can be no doubt that before many days they or others in their places will be back again god protect the poor fellows who have fallen into this miserable bondage what an occasion would there now be to rescue one of them should he happen to be hid near this spot  the idea seized the whole party at once and all eagerly turned to examine the high bank which rose nearly to the summit of the masts in the hope of discovering some concealed fugitive the gentlemen went below again and mr sharp and mr blunt called out in german and english and french to invite any one who might be secreted to come forth no sound answered these friendly calls again captain truck went aloft to look into the interior but he beheld nothing more than the broad and unpeopled desert  a place where the camels had descended to the beach was at no great distance and thither most of the party proceeded mounting to the level of the plain beyond in this little expedition paul blunt led the advance and as he rose over the brow of the bank he cocked both barrels of his fowlingpiece uncertain what might be encountered they found however a silent waste almost without vegetation and nearly as trackless as the ocean that lay behind them at the distance of a hundred rods an object was just discernible lying on the plain halfburied in sand and thither the young men expressed a wish to go first calling to those in the ship to send a man aloft to give the alarm in the event of any party of the mussulmans being seen mr effingham too on being told their intention had the precaution to cause eve and mademoiselle viefville to get into the cutter which he manned and caused to pull out over the bar where she lay waiting the issue  a camels path of which the tracks were nearly obliterated by the sands led to the object and after toiling along it the adventurers soon reached the desired spot it proved to be the body of a man who had died by violence his dress and person denoted that of a passenger rather than that of a seaman and he had evidently been dead but a very few hours probably not twelve the cut of a sabre had cleft his skull agreeing not to acquaint the ladies with this horrible discovery the body was hastily covered with the sand the pockets of the dead man having been first examined for contrary to usage his person had not been stripped a letter was found written by a wife to her husband and nothing more it was in german and its expressions and contents though simple were endearing and natural it spoke of the travellers return for she who wrote it little thought of the miserable fate that awaited her beloved in this remote desert  as nothing else was visible the party returned hastily to the beach where they found that captain truck had ended his investigation and was impatient to return in the interest of the scene the montauk had disappeared behind a headland towards which she had been drifting when they left her her absence created a general sense of loneliness and the whole party hastened into the jollyboat as if fearful of being left when without the bar again the cutter took in her proper crew and the boats pulled away leaving the dane standing on the beach in his solitary desolationa monument of his own disaster  as they got further from the land the montauk came in sight again and captain truck announced the agreeable intelligence that the jury mainmast was up and that the ship had aftersail set diminutive and defective as it might be instead of heading to the southward however as heretofore mr leach was apparently endeavouring to get back again to the northward of the headland that had shut in the ship or was trying to retrace his steps mr truck rightly judged that this was proof his mate disliked the appearance of the coast astern of him and that he was anxious to get an offing the captain in consequence urged his men to row and in little more than an hour the whole party were on the deck of the montauk again and the boats were hanging at the davits     chapter xvii      i boarded the kings ship now on the beak   now in the waist the deck in every cabin   i flamd amazement    tempest   if captain truck distrusted the situation of his own ship when he saw that the mate had changed her course he liked it still less after he was on board and had an opportunity to form a more correct judgment the current had set the vessel not only to the southward but inshore and the send of the groundswell was gradually but inevitably heaving her in towards the land at this point the coast was more broken than at the spot where the dane had been wrecked some signs of trees appearing and rocks running off in irregular reefs into the sea more to the south these rocks were seen without the ship while directly astern they were not half a mile distant still the wind was favourable though light and baffling and mr leach had got up every stitch of canvas that circumstances would at all allow the lead too had been tried and the bottom was found to be a hard sand mixed with rocks and the depth of the water such as to admit of anchoring it was a sign that captain truck did not absolutely despair after ascertaining all these facts that he caused mr saunders to be summoned for as yet none of those who had been in the boats had breakfasted  step this way mr steward said the captain and report the state of the coppers you were rummaging as usual among the lockers of yonder unhappy dane and i desire to know what discoveries you have made you will please to recollect that on all public expeditions of this nature there must be no peculation or private journal kept did you see any stockfish  sir i should deem this ship disgraced by the admission into her pantry of such an article sir we have tongues and sounds in plenty captain truck and no gentleman that has such diet need ambition a stockfish  i am not quite of your way of thinking but the earth is not made of stockfish did you happen to fall in with any butter  some sir that is scarcely fit to slush a mast with and i do think one of the most atrocious cheeses sir it was ever my bad fortune to meet with i do not wonder the africans left the wreck  you followed their example of course mr saunders and left the cheese  i followed my own judgment sir for i would not stay in a ship with such a cheese captain truck sir even to have the honour of serving under so great a commander as yourself i think it no wonder that vessel was wrecked even the sharks would abandon her the very thoughts of her impurities sir make me feel unsettled in the stomach  the captain nodded his head in approbation of this sentiment called for a coal and then ordered breakfast the meal was silent thoughtful and even sad every one was thinking of the poor danes and their sad fate while they who had been on the plain had the additional subject of the murdered man for their contemplation  is it possible to do nothing to redeem these poor people father from captivity eve at length demanded  i have been thinking of this my child but i see no other method than to acquaint their government of their situation  might we not contribute something from our own means to that effect money i fancy is the chief thing necessary  the gentlemen looked at each other in approbation though a reluctance to be the first to speak kept most of them silent  if a hundred pounds miss effingham will be useful sir george templemore said after the pause had continued an awkward minute laying a banknote of that amount on the table and you will honour us by becoming the keeper of the redemption money i have great pleasure in making the offer  this was handsomely said and as captain truck afterwards declared handsomely done too though it was a little abrupt and caused eve to hesitate and redden  i shall accept your gift sir she said and with your permission will transfer it to mr effingham who will better know what use to put it to in order to effect our benevolent purpose i think i can answer for as much more from himself  you may with certainty my dearand twice as much if necessary john this is a proper occasion for your interference  put me down at what you please said john effingham whose charities in a pecuniary sense were as unlimited as in feeling they were apparently restrained one hundred or one thousand to rescue that poor crew  i believe sir we must all follow so good an example mr sharp observed and i sincerely hope that this scheme will not prove useless i think it may be effected by means of some of the public agents at mogadore  mr dodge raised many objections for it really exceeded his means to give so largely and his character was formed in a school too envious and jealous to confess an inferiority on a point even as worthless as that of money indeed he had so long been accustomed to maintain that one man was as good as another in opposition to his senses that like most of those who belong to this impracticable school he had tacitly admitted in his own mind the general and vulgar ascendency of mere wealth and quite as a matter of course he was averse to confessing his own inferiority on a point that he had made to be all in all while loudest in declaiming against any inferiority whatever he walked out of the cabin therefore with strong heartburnings and jealousies because others had presumed to give that which it was not really in his power to bestow  on the other hand both mademoiselle viefville and mr monday manifested the superiority of the opinions in which they had been trained the first quietly handed a napoleon to mr effingham who took it with as much attention and politeness as he received any of the larger contributions while the latter produced a fivepound note with a hearty goodwill that redeemed the sin of many a glass of punch in the eyes of his companions  eve did not dare to look towards paul blunt while this collection was making but she felt regret that he did not join in it he was silent and thoughtful and even seemed pained and she wondered if it were possible that one who certainly lived in a style to prove that his income was large could be so thoughtless as to have deprived himself of the means of doing that which he so evidently desired to do but most of the company was too wellbred to permit the matter to become the subject of conversation and they soon rose from table in a body the mind of eve however was greatly relieved when her father told her that the young man had put a hundred sovereigns in gold into his hands as soon as possible and that he had seconded this offering with another of embarking for mogadore in person should they get into the cape de verds or the canaries with a view of carrying out the charitable plan with the least delay  he is a noblehearted young man said the pleased father as he communicated this fact to his daughter and cousin and i shall not object to the plan  if he offer to quit this ship one minute sooner than is necessary he does indeed deserve a statue of gold said john effingham for it has all that can attract a young man like him and all too that can awaken his jealousy  cousin jack exclaimed eve reproachfully quite thrown off her guard by the abruptness and plainness of this language  the quiet smile of mr effingham proved that he understood both but he made no remark eve instantly recovered her spirits and angry at herself for the girlish exclamation that had escaped her she turned on her assailant i do not know that i ought to be seen in an aside with mr john effingham she said even when it is sanctioned with the presence of my own father  and may i ask why so much sudden reserve my offended beauty  merely that the report is already active concerning the delicate relation in which we stand towards each other  john effingham looked surprised but he suppressed his curiosity from a long habit of affecting an indifference he did not always feel the father was less dignified for he quietly demanded an explanation  it would seem returned eve assuming a solemnity suited to a matter of interest that our secret is discovered while we were indulging our curiosity about this unfortunate ship mr dodge was gratifying the laudable industry of the active inquirer by prying into our staterooms  this meanness is impossible exclaimed mr effingham  nay said john no meanness is impossible to a demagoguea pretender to things of which he has even no just conceptiona man who lives to envy and traduce in a word a quasi gentleman let us hear what eve has to say  my information is from ann sidley who saw him in the act now the kind letter you wrote my father cousin jack just before we left london and which you wrote because you would not trust that honest tongue of yours to speak the feelings of that honest heart is the subject of my daily study not on account of its promises you will believe me but on account of the strong affection it displays to a girl who is not worthy of one half you feel and do for her  pshaw  well let it then be pshaw i had read that letter this very morning and carelessly left it on my table this letter mr dodge in his undying desire to lay everything before the public as becomes his high vocation and as in duty bound has read and misconstruing some of the phrases as will sometimes happen to a zealous circulator of news he has drawn the conclusion that i am to be made a happy woman as soon as we reach america by being converted from miss eve effingham into mrs john effingham  impossible no man can be such a fool or quite so great a miscreant  i should rather think my child added the milder father that injustice has been done mr dodge no person in the least approximating to the station of a gentleman could even think of an act so base as this you mention  oh if this be all your objection to the tale observed the cousin i am ready to swear to its truth but eve has caught a little of captain trucks spirit of mystifying and is determined to make a character by a bold stroke in the beginning she is clever and in time may rise to be a quiz  thank you for the compliment cousin jack which however i am forced to disclaim as i never was more serious in my life that the letter was read nanny who is truth itself affirms she saw that mr dodge has since been industriously circulating the report of my great good fortune she has heard from the mate who had it from the highest source of information direct and that such a man would be likely to come to such a conclusion you have only to recall the terms of the letter yourself to believe  there is nothing in my letter to justify any notion so silly  an active inquirer might make discoveries you little dream of dear cousin jack you speak of its being time to cease roving of settling yourself at last of never parting and prodigal as you are of making eve the future mistress of your fortune now to all this recreant confess or i shall never again put faith in man  john effingham made no answer but the father warmly expressed his indignation that any man of the smallest pretensions to be admitted among gentlemen should be guilty of an act so base  we can hardly tolerate his presence john and it is almost a matter of conscience to send him to coventry  if you entertain such notions of decorum your wisest way edward will be to return to the place whence you have come for trust me you will find scores of such gentlemen where you are going  i shall not allow you to persuade me i know my own country so little conduct like this will stamp a man with disgrace in america as well as elsewhere  conduct like this would but it will no longer the pellmell that rages has brought honourable men into a sad minority and even mr dodge will tell you the majority must rule were he to publish my letter a large portion of his readers would fancy he was merely asserting the liberty of the press heavens save us you have been dreaming abroad ned effingham while your country has retrograded in all that is respectable and good a century in a dozen years  as this was the usual language of john effingham neither of his listeners thought much of it though mr effingham more decidedly expressed an intention to cut off even the slight communication with the offender he had permitted himself to keep up since they had been on board  think better of it dear father said eve for such a man is scarcely worthy of even your resentment he is too much your inferior in principles manners character station and everything else to render him of so much account and then were we to clear up this masquerade into which the chances of a ship have thrown us we might have our scruples concerning others as well as concerning this wolf in sheeps clothing  say rather an ass shaved and painted to resemble a zebra muttered john the fellow has no property as respectable as the basest virtue of a wolf  he has at least rapacity  and can howl in a pack this much then i will concede to you but i agree with eve we must either punish him affirmatively by pulling his ears or treat him with contempt which is always negative or silent i wish he had entered the stateroom of that fine young fellow paul blunt who is of an age and a spirit to give him a lesson that might make a paragraph for his active inquirer if not a scissors extract of himself  eve knew that the offender had been there too but she had too much prudence to betray him  this will only so much the more oblige him she said laughingly for mr blunt in speaking of the editor of the active inquirer said that he had the failing to believe that this earth and all it contained was created merely to furnish materials for newspaper paragraphs  the gentlemen laughed with the amused eve and mr effingham remarked that there did seem to be men so perfectly selfish so much devoted to their own interests and so little sensible of the rights and feelings of others as to manifest a desire to render the press superior to all other power not he concluded in the way of argument or as an agent of reason but as a master coarse corrupt tyrannical and vile the instrument of selfishness instead of the right and when not employed as the promoter of personal interests to be employed as the tool of personal passions  your father will become a convert to my opinions miss effingham said john and he will not be home a twelvemonth before he will make the discovery that the government is a pressocracy and its ministers selfchosen and usurpers composed of those who have the least at stake even as to character  mr effingham shook his head in dissent but the conversation changed in consequence of a stir in the ship the air from the land had freshened and even the heavy canvas on which the montauk was now compelled principally to rely had been asleep as mariners term it or had blown out from the mast where it stood inflated and steady a proof at sea where the water is always in motion that the breeze is getting to be fresh aided by this power the ship had overcome the united action of the heavy groundswell and of the current and was stealing out from under the land when the air murmured for an instant as if about to blow still fresher and then all the sails flapped the wind had passed away like a bird and a dark line to seaward denoted the approach of the breeze from the ocean the stir in the vessel was occasioned by the preparations to meet this change  the new wind brought little with it beyond the general danger of blowing on shore the breeze was light and not more than sufficient to force the vessel through the water in her present condition a mile and a half in the hour and this too in a line nearly parallel with the coast captain truck saw therefore at a glance that he should be compelled to anchor previously however to doing this he had a long talk with his mates and a boat was lowered  the lead was cast and the bottom was found to be still good though a hard sand which is not the best holding ground  a heavy sea would cause the ship to drag captain truck remarked should it come on to blow and the lines of dark rocks astern of them would make chips of the pennsylvania in an hour were that great ship to lie on it  he entered the boat and pulled along the reefs to examine an inlet that mr leach reported to have been seen before he got the ships head to the northward could an entrance be found at this point the vessel might possibly be carried within the reef and a favourite scheme of the captains could be put in force one to which he now attached the highest importance a mile brought the boat up to the inlet where mr truck found the following appearances the general formation of the coast in sight was that of a slight curvature within which the ship had so far drifted as to be materially inside a line drawn from headland to headland there was consequently little hope of urging a vessel crippled like the montauk against wind sea and current out again into the ocean for about a league abreast of the ship the coast was rocky though low the rocks running off from the shore quite a mile in places and every where fully half that distance the formation was irregular but it had the general character of a reef the position of which was marked by breakers as well as by the black heads of rocks that here and there showed themselves above the water the inlet was narrow crooked and so far environed by rocks as to render it questionable whether there was a passage at all though the smoothness of the water had raised hopes to that effect in mr leach  as soon as captain truck arrived at the mouth of this passage he felt so much encouraged by the appearance of things that he gave the concerted signal for the ship to veer round and to stand to the southward this was losing ground in the way of offing but tack the montauk could not with so little wind and the captain saw by the drift she had made since he left her that promptitude was necessary the ship might anchor off the inlet as well as anywhere else if reduced to anchoring outside at all and then there was always the chance of entering  as soon as the ships head was again to the southward and captain truck felt certain that she was lying along the reef at a reasonably safe distance and in as good a direction as he could hope for he commenced his examination like a discreet seaman he pulled off from the rocks to a suitable distance for should an obstacle occur outside he well knew any depth of water further in would be useless the day was so fine and in the absence of rivers the ocean so limpid in that low latitude that it was easy to see the bottom at a considerable depth but to this sense of course the captain did not trust for he kept the lead going constantly although all eyes were also employed in searching for rocks  the first cast of the lead was in five fathoms and these soundings were held nearly up to the inlet where the lead struck a rock in three fathoms and a half at this point then a more careful examination was made but three and a half was the shallowest cast as the montauk drew nearly a fathom less than this the cautious old master proceeded closer in directly in the mouth of the inlet was a large flat rock that rose nearly to the surface of the sea and which when the tide was low was probably bare this rock captain truck at first believed would defeat his hopes of success which by this time were strong but a closer examination showed him that on one side of it was a narrow passage just wide enough to admit a ship  from this spot the channel became crooked but it was sufficiently marked by the ripple on the reef and after a careful investigation he found it was possible to carry three fathoms quite within the reef where a large space existed that was gradually filling up with sand but which was nearly all covered with water when the tide was in as was now the case and which had channels as usual between the banks following one of these channels a quarter of a mile he found a basin of four fathoms of water large enough to take a ship in and fortunately it was in close proximity to a portion of the reef that was always bare when a heavy sea was not beating over it here he dropped a buoy for he had come provided with several fragments of spars for this purpose and on his return the channel was similarly marked off at all the critical points on the flat rock in the inlet one of the men was left standing up to his waist inthe water it being certain that the tide was failing  the boat now returned to the ship which it met at the distance of half a mile from the inlet the current setting southwardly her progress had been more rapid than when heading north and her drift had been less towards the land still there was so little wind so steady a groundswell and it was possible to carry so little aftersail that great doubts were entertained of being able to weather the rocks sufficiently to turn into the inlet twenty times in the next half hour was the order to let go the anchor on the point of being given as the wind baffled and as often was it countermanded to take advantage of its reviving these were feverish moments for the ship was now so near the reef as to render her situation very insecure in the event of the winds rising or of a seas getting up the sand of the bottom being too hard to make good holdingground still as there was a possibility in the present state of the weather of kedging the ship off a mile into the offing if necessary captain truck stood on with a boldness he might not otherwise have felt the anchor hung suspended by a single turn of the stopper ready to drop at a signal and mr truck stood between the knightheads watching the slow progress of the vessel and accurately noticing every foot of leeward set she made as compared with the rocks  all this time the poor fellow stood in the water awaiting the arrival of his friends who in their turn were anxiously watching his features as they gradually grew more distinct  i see his eyes cried the captain cheerily take a drag at the bowlines and let her head up as much as she will mr leach and never mind those sham topsails take them in at once sir they do us now more harm than good  the clewline blocks rattled and the topgallant sails which were made to do the duty of topsails but which would hardly spread to the lower yards so as to set on a wind came rapidly in five minutes of intense doubt followed when the captain gave the animating order toman the mainclew garnets boys and stand by to make a run of it  this was understood to be a sign that the ship was far enough to windward and the command to in mainsail which soon succeeded was received with a shout  hard up with the helm and stand by to lay the foreyard square cried captain truck rubbing his hands look that both bowers are clear for a run and you toast bring me the brightest coal in the galley  the movements of the montauk were necessarily slow but she obeyed her helm and fell off until her bows pointed in towards the sailor in the water this fine fellow the moment he saw the ship approaching waded to the verge of the rock where it went off perpendicularly to the bottom and waved to them to come on without fear  come within ten feet of me he shouted there is nothing to spare on the other side  as the captain was prepared for this the ship was steered accordingly and as she hove slowly past on the rising and falling water a rope was thrown to the man who was hauled on board  port cried the captain as soon as the rock was passed port your helm sir and stand for the first buoy  in this manner the montauk drove slowly but steadily on until she had reached the basin where one anchor was let go almost as soon as she entered the chain was paid out until the vessel was forced over to some distance and then the other bower was dropped the foresail was hauled up and handed and chain was given the ship which was pronounced to be securely moored  now cried the captain all his anxiety ceasing with the responsibility i expect to be made a member of the new york philosophical society at least which is learned company for a man who has never been at college for discovering a port on the coast of africa which harbour ladies and gentlemen without too much vanity i hope to be permitted to call port truck if mr dodge however should think this too antirepublican we will compromise the matter by calling it port truck and dodge or the town that no doubt will sooner or later arise on its banks may be called dodgeborough and i will keep the harbour to myself  should mr dodge consent to this arrangement he will render himself liable to the charge of aristocracy said mr sharp for as all felt relieved by finding themselves in a place of security so all felt disposed to join in the pleasantry i dare say his modesty would prevent his consenting to the plan  why gentlemen returned the subject of these remarks i do not know that we are to refuse honours that are fairly imposed on us by the popular voice and the practice of naming towns and counties after distinguished citizens is by no means uncommon with us a few of my own neighbours have been disposed to honour me in this way already and my paper is issued from a hamlet that certainly does bear my own unworthy name so you perceive there will be no novelty in the appellation  i would have made oath to it cried the captain from your wellestablished humility is the place as large as london  it can boast of little more than my own office a tavern a store and a blacksmiths shop captain as yet but rome was not built in a day  your neighbours sir must be people of extraordinary discernment but the name  that is not absolutely decided at first it was called dodgetown but this did not last long being thought vulgar and commonplace six or eight weeks afterwards we  we mr dodge  i mean the people siri am so much accustomed to connect myself with the people that whatever they do i think i had a hand in  and very properly sir observed john effingham as probably without you there would have been no people at all  what may be the population of dodgetown sir asked the persevering captain on this hint  at the census of january it was seventeen but by the census of march there were eighteen i have made a calculation that shows if we go on at this rate or by arithmetical progression it will be a hundred in about ten years which will be a very respectable population for a country place i beg pardon sir the people six or eight weeks afterwards altered the name to dodgeborough but a new family coming in that summer a party was got up to change it to dodgeville a name that was immensely popular as ville means city in latin but it must be owned the people like change or rotation in names as well as in office and they called the place butterfield hollow for a whole month after the new inhabitant whose name is butterfield he moved away in the fall and so after trying belindy anglice belinda nineveh grand cairo and pumpkin valley they made me the offer to restore the ancient name provided some addendum more noble and proper could be found than town or ville or borough it is not yet determined what it shall be but i believe we shall finally settle down in dodgeople or dodgeopolis  for the season and a very good name it will prove for a short cruise i make no question the butterfield hollow was a little like rotation in office in truth sir  i didnt like it captain so i gave squire butterfield to understand privately for as he had a majority with him i didnt approve of speaking too strongly on the subject as soon as i got him out of the tavern however the current set the other way  you fairly uncorked him  that i did and no one ever heard of him or of his hollow after his retreat there are a few discontented and arrogant innovators who affect to call the place by its old name of morton but these are the mere vassals of a man who once owned the patent and who has now been dead these forty years we are not the people to keep his old musty name or to honour dry bones  served him right sir and like men of spirit if he wants a place called after himself let him live like other people a dead man has no occasion for a name and there should be a law passed that when a man slips his cables he should bequeath his name to some honest fellow who has a worse one it might be well to compel all great men in particular to leave their renown to those who cannot get any for themselves  i will venture to suggest an improvement on the name if mr dodge will permit me said mr sharp who had been an amused listener to the short dialogue dodgeople is a little short and may be offensive by its brusquerie by inserting a single letter it will become dodgepeople or there is the alternative of dodgeadrianople which will be a truly sonorous and republican title adrian was an emperor and even mr dodge might not disdain the conjunction  by this time the editor of the active inquirer began to be extremely elevatedfor this was assailing him on his weakest sideand he laughed and rubbed his hands as if he thought the joke particularly pleasant this person had also a peculiarity of judgment that was singularly in opposition to all his open professions a peculiarity however that belongs rather to his class than to the individual member of it ultra as a democrat and an american mr dodge had a sneaking predilection in favour of foreign opinions although practice had made him intimately acquainted with all the frauds deceptions and vileness of the ordinary arts of paragraphmaking he never failed to believe religiously in the veracity judgment good faith honesty and talents of anything that was imported in the form of types he had been weekly for years accusing his nearest brother of the craft of lying and he could not be altogether ignorant of his own propensity in the same way but notwithstanding all this experience in the secrets of the trade whatever reached him from a european journal he implicitely swallowed whole one who knew little of the man might have supposed he feigned credulity to answer his own purposes but this would be doing injustice to his faith which was perfect being based on that provincial admiration and provincial ignorance that caused the countryman who went to london for the first time to express his astonishment at finding the king a man as was due to his colonial origin his secret awe and reverence for an englishman was in proportion to his protestations of love for the people and his deference for rank was graduated on a scale suited to the heartburning and jealousies he entertained for all whom he felt to be his superiors indeed one was the cause of the other for they who really are indifferent to their own social position are usually equally indifferent to that of others so long as they are not made to feel the difference by direct assumptions of superiority  when mr sharp whom even mr dodge had discovered to be a gentlemanand an english gentleman of courseentered into the trifling of the moment therefore so far from detecting the mystification the latter was disposed to believe himself a subject of interest with this person against whose exclusiveness and haughty reserve notwithstanding he had been making sidehits ever since the ship had sailed but the avidity with which the americans of mr dodges temperament are apt to swallow the crumbs of flattery that fall from the englishmans table is matter of history and the editor himself was never so happy as when he could lay hold of a paragraph to republish in which a few words of comfort were doled out by the condescending mother to the neverdying faith of the daughter so far therefore from taking umbrage at what had been said he continued the subject long after the captain had gone to his duty and with so much perseverance that paul blunt as soon as mr sharp escaped took an occasion to compliment that gentleman on his growing intimacy with the refined and singleminded champion of the people the other admitted his indiscretion and if the affair had no other consequences it afforded these two fine young men a moments merriment at a time when anxiety had been fast getting the ascendency over their more cheerful feelings when they endeavoured to make miss effingham share in the amusement however that young lady heard them with gravity for the meanness of the act discovered by nanny sidley had indisposed her to treat the subject of their comments with the familiarity of even ridicule perceiving this though unable to account for it the gentlemen changed the discourse and soon became sufficiently grave by contemplating their own condition  the situation of the montauk was now certainly one to excite uneasiness in those who were little acquainted with the sea as well as in those who were it was very much like that for which miss effinghams nurse had pined having many rocks and sands in sight with the land at no great distance in order that the reader may understand it more clearly we shall describe it with greater minuteness  to the westward of the ship lay the ocean broad smooth glittering but heaving and setting with its eternal breathings which always resemble the respiration of some huge monster between the vessel and this waste of water and within three hundred feet of the first stretched an irregular line of ripple dotted here and there with the heads of low naked rocks marking the presence and direction of the reef  this was all that would interpose between the basin and the raging billows should another storm occur but captain truck thought this would suffice so far to break the waves as to render the anchorage sufficiently secure astern of the ship however a rounded ridge of sand began to appear as the tide fell within forty fathoms of the vessel and as the bottom was hard and difficult to get an anchor into it there was the risk of dragging on this bank we say that the bottom was hard for the reader should know that it is not the weight of the anchor that secures the ship but the hold its pointed fluke and broad palm get of the ground the coast itself was distant less than a mile and the entire basin within the reef was fast presenting spits of sand as the water fell on the ebb still there were many channels and it would have been possible for one who knew their windings to have sailed a ship several leagues among them without passing the inlet these channels forming a sort of intricate network in every direction from the vessel  when captain truck had coolly studied all the peculiarities of his position he set about the duty of securing his ship in good earnest the two light boats were brought under the bows and the stream anchor was lowered and fastened to a spar that lay across both this anchor was carried to the bank astern and by dint of sheer strength was laid over its summit with a fluke buried to the shank in the hard sand by means of a hawser and a purchase applied to its end the men on the banks next roused the chain out and shackled it to the ring the bight was hovein and the ship secured astern so as to prevent a shift of wind off the land from forcing her on the reef as no sea could come from this quarter the single anchor and chain were deemed sufficient for this purpose as soon as the boats were at liberty and before the chain had been got ashore two kedges were carried to the reef and laid among the rocks in such a way that their flukes and stocks equally got hold of the projections to these kedges lighter chains were secured and when all the bights were hovein to as equal a strain as possible captain truck pronounced his ship in readiness to ride out any gale that would be likely to blow so far as the winds and waves might affect her the montauk was in truth reasonably safe for on the side where danger was most to be apprehended she had two bowers down and four parts of smaller chain were attached to the two kedges nor had captain truck fallen into the common error of supposing he had so much additional strength in his fastenings by simply running the chains through the rings but he had caused each to be separately fastened both inboard and to the kedges by which means each length of the chain formed a distinct and independent fastening of itself  so absolute is the sovereignty of a ship that no one had presumed to question the master as to his motives for all this extraordinary precaution though it was the common impression that he intended to remain where they were until the wind became favourable or at least until all danger of being thrown upon the coast from the currents and the groundswell should have ceased paul blunt observed that he fancied it was the intention to take advantage of the smooth water within the reef to get up a better and a more efficient set of jurymasts but captain truck soon removed all doubts by letting the truth be known while on board the danish wreck he had critically examined her spars sails and rigging and though adapted for a ship two hundred tons smaller than the montauk he was of opinion they might be fitted to the latter vessel and made to answer all the necessary purposes for crossing the ocean provided the mussulmans and the weather would permit the transfer  we have smooth water and light airs he said when concluding his explanation and the current sets southwardly along this coast by means of all our force hard working a kind providence and our own enterprise i hope yet to see the montauk enter the port of new york with royals set and ready to carry sail on a wind the seaman who cannot rig his ship with sticks and ropes and blocks enough might as well stay ashore mr dodge and publish an hebdomadal and so my dear young lady by looking along the land the day after tomorrow in the northern board here you may expect to see a raft booming down upon you that will cheer your heart and once more raise the hope of a christmas dinner in new york in all lovers of good fare     chapter xviii      here in the sands thee ill rake up    lear   his mind made up his intentions announced and his ship in readiness captain truck gave his orders to proceed with promptitude and clearness the ladies remaining behind he observed that the two messrs effingham as a matter of course would stay with them as protectors though little could harm them where they were  i propose to leave the ship in the care of mr blunt he said for i perceive something about that gentleman which denotes a nautical instinct if mr sharp choose to remain also your society will be the more agreeable and in exchange gentlemen i ask the favour of the strong arms of all your servants mr monday is my man in fair or foul and so i flatter myself will be sir george templemore and as for mr dodge if he stay behind why the active inquirer will miss a notable paragraph for there shall be no historian to the expedition but one of my own appointing mr saunders shall have the honour of cooking for you in the meanwhile and i propose taking every one else to the dane  as no serious objections could be made to this arrangement within an hour of the time when the ship was fastened the cutter and jollyboat departed it being the intention of captain truck to reach the wreck that evening in season to have his sheers ready to raise by daylight in the morning or he hoped to be back again in the course of the succeeding day no time was to be lost he knew the return of the arabs being hourly expected and the tranquillity of the open sea being at all times a matter of the greatest uncertainty with the declared view of making quick work and with the secret apprehension of a struggle with the owners of the country the captain took with him every officer and man in his ship that could possibly be spared and as many of the passengers as he thought might be useful as numbers might be important in the way of intimidation he cared almost as much for appearances as for any thing else or certainly he would not have deemed the presence of mr dodge of any great moment for to own the truth he expected the editor of the active inquirer would prove the quality implied by the first word of the title of his journal as much in any other way as in fighting  neither provisions nor water beyond what might be necessary in pulling to the wreck nor ropes nor blocks nor any thing but arms and ammunition were taken in the boats for the examination of the morning had shown the captain that notwithstanding so much had been plundered a sufficiency still remained in the stranded vessel indeed the fact that so much had been left was one of his reasons for hastening off himself as he deemed it certain that they who had taken away what was gone would soon return for the remainder the fowlingpieces and pistols with all the powder and ball in the ship were taken a light gun that was on board for the purpose of awaking sleepy pilots being left loaded with the intention of serving for a signal of alarm should any material change occur in the situation of the ship  the party included thirty men and as most had firearms of one sort or another they pulled out of the inlet with spirit and great confidence in their eventual success the boats were crowded it is true but there was room to row and the launch had been left in its place on deck because it was known that two boats were to be found in the wreck one of which was large in short as captain truck had meditated this expedient from the moment he ascertained the situation of the dane he now set about carrying it into effect with method and discrimination we shall first accompany him on his way leaving the small party in the montauk for our future attention in another chapter  the distance between the two vessels was about four leagues and a headland intervening those in the boats in less than an hour lost sight of their own ship as she lay shorn of her pride anchored within the reef at almost the same moment the wreck came into view and captain truck applied his glass with great interest in order to ascertain the state of things in that direction all was tranquilno signs of any one having visited the spot since morning being visible this intelligence was given to the people who pulled at their oars the more willingly under the stimulus of probable success driving the boats ahead with increasing velocity  the sun was still some distance above the horizon when the cutter and jollyboat rowed through the narrow channel astern of the wreck and brought up as before by the side of the rocks leaping ashore captain truck led the way to the vessel and in five minutes he was seen in the forward crosstrees examining the plain with his glass all was as solitary and deserted as when before seen and the order was immediately given to commence operations without delay  a gang of the best seamen got out the spare topmast and loweryard of the dane and set about fitting a pair of sheers a job that would be likely to occupy them several hours mr leach led a party up forward and the second mate went up with another further aft each proceeding to send down its respective topgallantmast topsailyard and topmast while captain truck from the deck superintended the same work on the mizenmast as the men worked with spirit and a strong party remained below to give the drags and to come up the lanyards spar came down after spar with rapidity and just as the sun dipped into the ocean to the westward everything but the lowermasts was lying on the sands alongside of the ship nothing having been permitted to touch the decks in descending previously however to sending down the loweryards the launch had been lifted from its bed and landed also by the side of the vessel  ail hands were now mustered on the sands and the boat was launched an operation of some delicacy as heavy rollers were occasionally coming in as soon as it floated this powerful auxiliary was swept up to the rocks and then the men began to load it with the standing rigging and sails the latter having been unbent as fast as each spar came down two kedges were found and a hawser was bent to one when the launch was carried outside of the bar and anchored lines being brought in the yards were hauled out to the same place and strongly lashed together for the night a great deal of running rigging many blocks and divers other small articles were put into the boats of the montauk and the jollyboat of the wreck which was still hanging at her stern was also lowered and got into the water with these acquisitions the party had now four boats one of which was heavy and capable of carrying a considerable freight  by this time it was so late and so dark that captain truck determined to suspend his labours until morning in the course of a few hours of active toil he had secured all the yards the sails the standing and running rigging the boats and many of the minor articles of the dane and nothing of essential importance remained but the three lower masts these it is true were all in all to him for without them he would be but little better off than he was before since his own ship had spare canvas and spare yards enough to make a respectable show above the foundation this foundation however was the great requisite and his principal motive in taking the other things was to have a better fit than could be obtained by using spars and sails that were not intended to go together  at eight oclock the people got their suppers and prepared to turn in for the night some conversation passed between captain truck and his mates concerning the manner of disposing of the men while they slept which resulted in the formers keeping a wellarmed party of ten with him in the ship while the remainder were put in the boats all of which were fastened to the launch as she lay anchored off the bar here they made beds of the sails and setting a watch the greater portion of both gangs were soon as quietly asleep as if lying in their own berths on board the montauk not so with captain truck and his mates they walked the deck of the dane fully an hour after the men were silent and for some time after mr monday had finished the bottle of wine he had taken the precaution to bring with him from the packet and had bestowed his person among some old sails in the cabin the night was a bright starlight but the moon was not to be expected until near morning the wind came off the sands of the interior in hot puffs but so lightly as to sound that it breathed past them like the sighings of the desert  it is lucky mr leach said the captain continuing the discourse he had been holding with his mate in a low voice under the sense of the insecurity of their situation it is lucky mr leach that we got out the stream anchor astern else we should have had the ship rubbing her copper against the corners of the rocks this air seems light but under all her canvas the montauk would soon flap her way out from this coast if all were ready  ay ay sir if all were ready repeated mr leach as if he knew how much honest labour was to be expended before that happy moment could arrive  if all were ready i think we may be able to whip these three sticks out of this fellow by breakfasttime in the morning and then a couple of hours will answer for the raft after which a pull of six or eight more will take us back to our own craft  if all goes well it may be done sir  well or ill it must be done we are not in a situation to play at jackstraws  i hope if may be done sir  mr leach  captain truck  we are in a dle category sir if the truth must be spoken  that is a word i am not much acquainted with but we have an awkward berth of it here if that be what you mean  a long pause during which these two seamen one of whom was old the other young paced the deck diligently  mr leach  captain truck  do you ever pray  i have done such a thing in my time sir but since i have sailed with you i have been taught to work first and pray afterwards and when the difficulty has been gotten over by the work the prayers have commonly seemed surplusage  you should take to your thanksgivings i think your grandfather was a parson leach  yes he was sir and i have been told your father followed the same trade  you have been told the truth mr leach my father was as meek and pious and humble a christian as ever thumped a pulpit a poor man and if truth must be spoken a poor preacher too but a zealous one and thoroughly devout i ran away from him at twelve and never passed a week at a time under his roof afterwards he could not do much for me for he had little education and no money and i believe carried on the business pretty much by faith he was a good man leach notwithstanding there might be a little of a takein for such a person to set up as a teacher and as for my mother if there ever was a pure spirit on earth it was in her body  ay that is the way commonly with the mothers sir  she taught me to pray added the captain speaking a little thick but since ive been in this london line to own the truth i find but little time for any thing but hard work until for want of practice praying has got to be among the hardest things i can turn my hand to  that is the way with all of us it is my opinion captain truck these london and liverpool liners will have a good many lost souls to answer for  ay ay if we could put it on them it would do well enough but my honest old father always maintained that every man must stand in the gap left by his own sins though he did assert also that we were all foreordained to shape our courses starboard or port even before we were launched  that doctrine makes an easy tidesway of life for i see no great use in a mans carrying sail and jamming himself up in the wind to claw off immoralities when he knows he is to fetch up upon them after all his pains  i have worked all sorts of traverses to get hold of this matter and never could make any thing of it it is harder than logarithms if my father had been the only one to teach it i should have thought less about it for he was no scholar and might have been paying it out just in the way of business but then my mother believed it body and soul and she was too good a woman to stick long to a course that had not truth to back it  why not believe it heartily sir and let the wheel fly one gets to the end of the vyge on this tack as well as on another  there is no great difficulty in working up to or even through the passage of death leach but the great point is to know the port we are to moor in finally my mother taught me to pray and when i was ten i had underrun all the commandments knew the lords creed and the apostles prayer and had made a handsome slant into the catechism but dear me dear me it has all oozed out of me like the warmth from a greenlander  folks were better educated in your time captain truck than they are nowadays by all i can learn  no doubt of that in the world in my time younkers were taught respect for their betters and for age and their catechism and piety and the apostles prayer and all those sort of things but america has fallen astern sadly in manners within the last fifty years i do not flatter myself with being as good as i was when under my excellent dear mothers command but there are worse men in the world and out of newgate too than john truck now in the way of vices leach i never swear  not you sir and mr monday never drinks  as the protestation of sobriety on the part of their passenger had got to be a joke with the officers and men of the ship captain truck had no difficulty in understanding his mate and though nettled at a retort that was like usurping his own right to the exclusive quizzing of the vessel he was in a mood much too sentimental and reflecting to be angry after a moments pause he resumed the dialogue as if nothing had been said to disturb its harmony  no i never swear or if i do it is in a small gentlemanly way and with none of your foulmouthed oaths such as are used by the horsejockeys that formerly sailed out of the river  were they hard swearers  is a norwester a hard wind those fellows after they have been choked off and jammed by the religion ashore for a month or two would break out like a hurricane when they had made an offing and were once fairly out of hearing of the parsons and deacons it is said that old joe bunk began an oath on the bar that he did not get to the end of until his brig was off montauk i have my doubts leach if any thing be gained by screwing down religion and morals like a cotton bale as is practised in and about the river  a good many begin to be of the same way of thinking for when our people do break out it is like the smallpox  i am an advocate for education nor do i think i was taught in my own case more than was reasonable i think even a prayer is of more use to a shipmaster than latin and i often have even now recourse to one though it may not be exactly in scripture language i seldom want a wind without praying for it mentally as it might be and as for the rheumatis i am always praying to be rid of it when im not cursing it starboard and larboard has it never struck you that the world is less moral since steamboats were introduced than formerly  the boats date from before my birth sir  very trueyou are but a boy mankind appear to be hurried and no one likes to stop to pray or to foot up his sins as used to be the case life is like a passage at sea we feel our way cautiously until off soundings on our own coast and then we have an easy time of it in the deep water but when we get near the shoals again we take out the lead and mind a little how we steer it is the going off and coming on the coast that gives us all the trouble  you had some object in view captain truck when you asked me if i ever prayed  certain if i were to set to work to pray myself just now it would be for smooth water tomorrow that we may have a good time in towing the raft to the shiphist leach did you hear nothing  there was a sound different from what is common in the air from the land it is probably some savage beast for africa is full of them  i think we might manage a lion from this fortress unless the fellow found the stage he could hardly board us and a plank or two thrown from that would make a drawbridge of it at once look yonder there is something moving on the bank or my eyes are two jewelblocks  mr leach looked in the required direction and he too fancied he saw something in motion on the margin of the bank at the point where the wreck lay the beach was far from wide and her flying jibboom which was still out projected so near the low acclivity where the coast rose to the level of the desert as to come within ten feet of the bushes by which the latter was fringed although the spar had drooped a little in consequence of having lost the support of the stays its end was still sufficiently high to rise above the leaves and to permit one seated on it to overlook the plain as well as the starlight would allow believing the duty to be important captain truck first giving his orders to mr leach as to the mode of alarming the men should it become necessary went cautiously out on the bowsprit and thence by the footropes to the farther extremity of the booms as this was done with the steadiness of a seaman and with the utmost care to prevent discovery he was soon stretched on the spar balancing his body by his legs beneath and casting eager glances about though prevented by the obscurity from seeing either far or very distinctly  after lying in this position a minute captain truck discovered an object on the plains at the distance of a hundred yards from the bushes that was evidently in motion he was now all watchfulness for had he not seen the proofs that the arabs or moors had already been at the wreck he knew that parties of them were constantly hovering along the coast especially after every heavy gale that blew from the westward in the hope of booty as all his own people were asleep the mates excepted and the boats could just be discovered by himself who knew their position he was in hopes that should any of the barbarians be near the presence of his own party could hardly be known it is true the alteration in the appearance of the wreck by the removal of the spars must strike any one who had seen it before but this change might have been made by another party of marauders or those who had now come if any there were might see the vessel for the first time  while such thoughts were rapidly glancing through his mind the reader will readily imagine that the worthy master was not altogether at his ease still he was cool and as he was resolved to fight his way off even against an army he clung to the spar with a species of physical resolution that would have done credit to a tiger the object on the plain moved once more and the clouds opening beyond he plainly made out the head and neck of a dromedary there was but one however nor could the most scrupulous examination show him a human being after remaining a quarter of an hour on the boom during all which time the only sounds that were heard were the sighings of the nightair and the sullen and steady wash of the surf captain truck came on deck again where he found his mate waiting his report with intense anxiety the former was fully aware of the importance of his discovery but being a cool man he had not magnified the danger to himself  the moors are down on the coast he said in an undertone but i do not think there can be more than two or three of them at the most probably spies or scouts and could we seize them we may gain a few hours on their comrades which will be all we want after which they shall be welcome to the salt and the other dunnage of the poor dane leach are you the man to stand by me in this affair  have i ever failed you captain truck that you put the question  that you have never my fine fellow give me a squeeze of your honest hand and let there be a pledge of life or death in it  the mate met the iron grasp of his commander and each knew that he received an assurance on which he might rely  shall i awake the men sir asked mr leach  not one of them every hour of sleep the people get will be a lower mast saved these sticks that still remain are our foundation and even one of them is of more account to us just now than a fleet of ships might be at another time take your arms and follow me but first we will give a hint to the secondmate of what we are about  this officer was asleep on the deck for he had been so much wearied with his great exertions that afternoon as to catch a little rest as the sweetest of all gifts it had been the intention of captain truck to dismiss him to the boats but observing him to be overcome with drowsiness he had permitted him to catch a nap where he lay the lookout too was also slumbering under the same indulgence but both were now awakened and made acquainted with the state of things on shore  keep your eyes open but keep a dead silence concluded captain truck for it is my wish to deceive these scouts and to keep them ignorant of our presence when i cry out alarm you will muster all hands and clear away for a brush but not before god bless you my lads mind and keep your eyes open leach i am ready  the captain and his companion cautiously descended to the sands and passing astern of the ship they first took their way to the jollyboat which lay at the rocks in readiness to carry off the two officers to the launch here they found the two men in charge so soundly asleep that nothing would have been easier than to bind them without giving the alarm after a little hesitation it was determined to let them dream away their sorrows and to proceed to the spot where the bank was ascended  at this place it became necessary to use the greatest precaution for it was literally entering the enemys country the steepness of the short ascent requiring them to mount nearly on their hands and feet this part of their progress was made without much hazard and the two adventurers stood on the plain sheltered by some bushes  yonder is the camel whispered the captain you see his crooked neck with the head tossing at moments the fellow is not fifty yards from the body of the poor german now let us follow along this line of bushes and keep a sharp lookout for the rider  they proceeded in the manner mentioned until they came to a point where the bushes ceased and there was an opening that overlooked the beach quite near the wreck  do you see the boats leach here away in a line with the starboard davit of the dane they look like dark spots on the water and an ignorant arab might be excused for taking them for rocks  except that they rise and fall with the rollers he must be doubly a turk who could make such a blunder  your wanderers of the desert are not so particular the wreck has certainly undergone some changes since yesterday and i should not wonder if even a mussulman found them out but  the gripe of mr leach whose fingers almost entered the flesh of his arm and a hand pointed towards the bushes on the other side of the opening silenced the captains whisper a human form was seen standing on the fringe of the bank directly opposite the jibboom it was swaddled in a sort of cloak and the long musket that was borne in a hollow of an arm was just discernible diverging from the line of the figure the arab for such it could only be was evidently gazing on the wreck and presently he ventured out more boldly and stood on the spot that was clear of bushes the deathlike stillness on the beach deceived him and he advanced with less caution towards the spot where the two officers were in ambush still keeping his own eye on the ship a few steps brought him within reach of captain truck who drew back his arm until the elbow reached his own hip when he darted it forward and dealt the incautious barbarian a severe blow between the eyes the arab fell like a slaughtered ox and before his senses were fairly recovered he was bound hands and feet and rolled over the bank down upon the beach with little ceremony his firearms remaining with his captors  that lad is in a category whispered the captain it now remains to be seen if there is another  a long search was not rewarded with success and it was determined to lead the camel down the path with a view to prevent his being seen by any wanderer in the morning  if we get the lower masts out betimes continued the captain these land pirates will have no beacons in sight to steer by and in a country in which one grain of sand is so much like another they might hunt a week before they made a happy landfall  the approach of the two towards the camel was made with less caution than usual the success of their enterprise throwing them off their guard and exciting their spirits they believed in short that their captive was either a solitary wanderer or that he had been sent ahead as a scout by some party that would be likely to follow in the morning  we must be up and at work before the sun mr leach said the captain speaking clearly but in a low tone as they approached the camel the head of the animal was tossed then it seemed to snuff the air and it gave a shriek in the twinkling of an eye an arab sprang from the sand on which he had been sleeping and was on the creatures back he was seen to look around him and before the startled mariners had time to decide on their course the beast which was a dromedary trained to speed was out of sight in the darkness captain truck had thrown forward his fowlingpiece but he did not fire  we have no right to shoot the fellow he said and our hope is now in the distance he will have to ride to join his comrades if we have got a chief as i suspect we will make a hostage of him and turn him to as much account as he can possibly turn one of his own camels depend on it we shall see no more of them for several hours and we will seize the opportunity to get a little sleep a man must have his watch below or he gets to be as dull and as obstinate as a topmaul  the captain having made up his mind to this plan was not slow in putting it in execution returning to the beach they liberated the legs of their prisoner whom they found lying like a log on the sands and made him mount the staging to the deck of the ship leading the way into the cabin mr truck examined the fellow by a light turning him round and commenting on his points very much as he might have done had the captive been any other animal of the desert  the arab was a swarthy sinewy man of forty with all his fibres indurated and worked down to the whipcord meagreness and rigidity of a racer his frame presenting a perfect picture of the sort of being one would fancy suited to the exhausting motion of a dromedary and to the fare of a desert he carried a formidable knife in addition to the long musket of which he had been deprived and his principal garment was the coarse mantle of camels hair that served equally for cap coat and robe his wild dark eyes gleamed as captain truck passed the lamp before his face and it was sufficiently apparent that he fancied a very serious misfortune had befallen him as any verbal communication was out of the question some abortive attempts were essayed by the two mariners to make themselves understood by signs which like some mens reasoning produced results exactly contrary to what had been expected  perhaps the poor fellow fancies we mean to eat him leach observed the captain after trying his skill in pantomime for some time without success and he has some grounds for the idea as he was felled like an ox that is bound to the kitchen try and let the miserable wretch understand at least that we are not cannibals  hereupon the mate commenced an expressive pantomime which described with sufficient clearness the process of skinning cutting up cooking and eating the carcass of the arab with the humane intention of throwing a negative over the whole proceeding by a strong sign of dissent at the close but there are no proper substitutes for the little monosyllables of yes and no and the meaning of the interpreter got to be so confounded that the captain himself was mystified  dn it leach he interrupted the man fancies that he is not good eating you make so many wry and outoftheway contortions a sign is a jurymast for the tongue and every seaman ought to know how to practise them in case he should be wrecked on a savage and unknown coast old joe bunk had a dictionary of them and in calm weather he used to go among his horses and horned cattle and talk with them by the hour he made a diagram of the language and had it taught to all us younkers who were exposed to the accidents of the bea now i will try my hand on this arab for i could never go to sleep while the honest black imagined we intended to breakfast on him  the captain now recommenced his own explanations in the language of nature he too described the process of cooking and eating the prisonerfor this he admitted was indispensable by way of prefaceand then to show his horror of such an act he gave a very good representation of a process he had often witnessed among his seasick passengers by way of showing his loathing of cannibalism in general and of eating this arab in particular by this time the man was thoroughly alarmed and by way of commentary on the captains eloquence he began to utter wailings in his own language and groans that were not to be mistaken to own the truth mr truck was a good deal mortified with this failure which like all other unsuccessful persons he was ready to ascribe to anybody but himself  i begin to think mr leach he said that this fellow is too stupid for a spy or a scout and that after all he is no more than a driveller who has strayed from his tribe from a want of sense to keep the road in a desert a man of the smallest information must have understood me and yet you perceive by his lamentations and outcries that he knows no more what i said than if he were in another parallel of latitude the chap has quite mistaken my character for if i really did intend to make a beast of myself and devour my species no one of the smallest knowledge of human nature would think id begin on a nigger what is your opinion of the mans mistake mr leach  it is very plain sir that he supposes you mean to broil him and then to eat so much of his steaks that you will be compelled to heave up like a marine two hours out and if i must say the truth i think most people would have inferred the same thing from your signs which are as plainly cannibal as any thing of the sort i ever witnessed  and what the devil did he make of yours master cookerybook cried the captain with some heat did he fancy you meant to mortify the flesh with a fortnights fast no no sir you are a very respectable first officer but are no more acquainted with joe bunks principles of signs than this editor here knows of truth and propriety it is your blundering manner of soliloquizing that has set the lad on a wrong traverse he has just grafted your own idea on my communication and has got himself into a category that a book itself would not reason him out of until his fright is passed logic is thrown away on all skeary animals said old joe bunk hearkee leach ive a mind to set the rascal adrift condemning the gun and the knife for the benefit of the captors i think i should sleep better for the certainty that he was trudging along the sand satisfied he was not to be barbecued in the morning  there is no use in detaining him sir for his messmate who went off on the dromedary will sail a hundred feet to his one and if an alarm is really to be given to their party it will not come from this chap he will be unarmed and by taking away his pouch we shall get some ammunition for this gun of his which will throw a shot as far as queen annes pocketpiece for my part sir i think there is no great use in keeping him for i do not think he would understand us if he stayed a month and went to school the whole time  you are quite right and as long as he is among us we shall be liable to unpleasant misconceptions so cut his lashings and set him adrift and be dd to him  the mate who by this time was drowsy did as desired and in a moment the arab was at liberty at first the poor creature did not know what to make of his freedom but a smart application à posteriori from the foot of captain truck whose humanity was of the rough quality of the seas soon set him in motion up the cabinladder when the two mariners reached the deck their prisoner was already leaping down the staging and in another minute his active form was obscurely seen clambering up the bank on gaining which he plunged into the desert and was seen no more  none but men indurated in their feelings by long exposure would be likely to sleep under the circumstances in which these two seamen were placed but they were both too cool and too much accustomed to arouse themselves on sudden alarms to lose the precious moments in womanish apprehensions when they knew that all their physical energies would be needed on the morrow whether the arabs arrived or not they accordingly regulated the lookouts gave strong admonitions of caution to be passed from one to another and then the captain stretched himself in the berth of the poor dane who was now a captive in the desert while mr leach got into the jollyboat and was pulled off to the launch both were sound asleep in less than five minutes after their heads touched their temporary pillows     chapter xix      ay he does well enough if he be disposed   and so do i too he does it with a better grace but   i do it more natural    twelfth night   the sleep of the weary is sweet of all the party that lay thus buried in sleep on the verge of the great desert exposed at any moment to an assault from its ruthless and predatory occupants but one bethought him of the danger though he was in truth so little exposed as to have rendered it of less moment to himself than to most of the others had he not been the possessor of a fancy that served oftener to lead him astray than for any purposes that were useful of pleasing this person was in one of the boats and as they lay at a reasonable distance from the land and the barbarians would not probably have known how to use any craft had they even possessed one he was consequently safe from everything but a discharge from their long muskets but this remote risk sufficed to keep him awake it being very different things to foster malice circulate gossip write scurrilous paragraphs and cant about the people and to face a volley of firearms for the one employment nature tradition education and habit had expressly fitted mr dodge while for the other he had not the smallest vocation although mr leach in setting his lookouts on board the boats had entirely overlooked the editor of the active inquirer never before had that vigilant persons inquiries been more active than they were throughout the whole of that long night and twenty times would he have aroused the party on false alarms but for the cool indifference of the phlegmatic seamen to whom the duty more properly belonged these brave fellows knew too well the precious qualities of sleep to allow that of their shipmates to be causelessly disturbed by the nervous apprehensions of one who carried with him an everlasting stimulant to fear in the consciousness of demerit the night passed away undisturbed therefore nor was the order of the regular watch broken until the lookouts in the wreck agreeably to their orders awoke captain truck and his mates  it was now precisely at the moment when the first and as it might be the fugitive rays of the sun glide into the atmosphere and to use a quaint expression dilute its darkness one no longer saw by starlight or by moonlight though a little of both were still left but objects though indistinct and dusky had their true outlines while every moment rendered their surfaces more obvious  when captain truck appeared on deck his first glance was at the ocean for were its tranquillity seriously disturbed it would be a deathblow to all his hopes fortunately in this particular there was no change  the winds seem to have put themselves out of breath in the last gale mr leach he said and we are likely to get the spars round as quietly as if they were so many sawlogs floating in a millpond even the groundswell has lessened and the breakers on the bar look like the ripple of a washtub turn the people up sir and let us have a drag at these sticks before breakfast or we may have to broil an arab yet  mr leach hailed the boats and ordered them to send their gang of labourers on shore he then gave the accustomed raps on the deck and called all hands in the ship in a minute the men began to appear yawning and stretching their armsfor no one had thrown aside his clothesmost of them launching their seajokes right and left with as much indifference as if they lay quietly in the port to which they were bound after some eight or ten minutes to shake themselves and to get aired as mr leach expressed it the whole party was again mustered on the deck of the dane with the exception of a hand or two in the launch and mr dodge the latter had assumed the office of sentinel over the jollyboat which as usual lay at the rocks to carry such articles off as might be wanted  send a hand up into the foretop mr leach said the captain gaping like a greyhound a fellow with sharp eyes none of your chaps who read with their noses down in the cloudy weather of an almanack and let him take a look at the desert in search of arabs  although the lower rigging was down and safe in the launch a girtline or as captain truck in the true doric of his profession pronounced it a guntline was rove at each mast and a man was accordingly hauled up forward as soon as possible as it was still too dusky to distinguish far with accuracy the captain hailed him and bade him stay where he was until ordered down and to keep a sharp lookout  we had a visit from one chap in the night he added and as he was a hungrylooking rascal he is a greater fool than i think him or he will be back before long after some of the beef and stockfish of the wreck keep a bright lookout  the men though accustomed to their commanders manner looked at each other more seriously glanced around at their arms and then the information produced precisely the effect that had been intended that of inducing them to apply to their work with threefold vigour  let the boys chew upon that instead of their tobacco observed the captain to mr leach as he hunted for a good coal in the galley to light his cigar with ill warrant you the sheers go up none the slower for the information desperate philosophers as some of these gentry are  this prognostic was true enough for instead of gaping and stretching themselves about the deck as had been the case with most of them a minute before the men now commenced their duty in good earnest calling to each other to come to the falls and the capstanbars and to stand by the heels of the sheers  heave away cried the mate smiling to see how quick the captains hint had been taken heave round with a will men and let us set these legs on end that they may walk  as the order was obeyed to the letter the day had not fairly opened when the sheers were in their places and secured every man was all activity and as their work was directed by those whose knowledge was never at fault a landsman would have been surprised at the readiness with which the crew next raised a spar as heavy as the mainmast and had it suspended top and all in the air high enough to be borne over the side the lowering was a trifling affair and the massive stick was soon lying at its length on the sands captain truck well knew the great importance of this particular spar for he might make out with the part of the foremast that remained in the packet whereas without this mast he could not possibly rig any thing of much available use aft he called out to the men therefore as he sprang upon the staging to follow him and to launch the spar into the water before they breakfasted  let us make sure of this fellow men he added for it is our mainstay with this stick fairly in our raft we may yet make a passage no one must think of his teeth till it is out of all risk this stick we must have if we make war on the emperor of morocco for its possession  the people knew the necessity for exertion and they worked accordingly the top was knocked off and carried down to the water the spar was then cut round and rolled after it not without trouble however as the trestle trees were left on but the descent of the sands favoured the labour when on the margin of the sea by the aid of handspikes the head was got afloat or so nearly so as to require but little force to move it when a line from the boats was fastened to the outer end and the top was secured alongside  now clap your handspikes under it boys and heave away cried the captain heave together and keep the stick straightheave and his head is afloathaul haul away in the boatheave all at once and as if you were giantsyou gained three feet that tug my heartiestry him again gentlemen as you areand move together like girls in a cotillionaway with itwhat the devil are you staring at in the foretop there have you nothing better to do than to amuse yourself in seeing us heave our insides out  the intense interest attached to the securing of this spar had extended to the lookout in the top and instead of keeping his eye on the desert as ordered he was looking down at the party on the beach and betraying his sympathy in their efforts by bending his body and appearing to heave in common with his messmates admonished of his neglect by this sharp rebuke he turned round quickly towards the desert and gave the fearful alarm of the arabs  every man ceased his work and the whole were on the point of rushing in a body towards their arms when the greater steadiness of captain truck prevented it  whereaway he demanded sternly  on the most distant hillock of sand may be a mile and a half inland  how do they head  dead down upon us sir  how do they travel  they have camels and horses all are mounted sir  what is their number  the man paused as if to count and then he called out  they are stronghanded sir quite a hundred i think they have brought up sir and seem to be sounding about them for an anchorage  captain truck hesitated and he looked wistfully at the mast  boys said he shaking his hand over the bit of massive wood with energy this spar is of more importance to us than our mothers milk in infancy it is our victuals and drink life and hopes let us swear we will have it in spite of a thousand arabs stoop to your handspikes and heave at the wordheave as if you had a world to moveheave men heave  the people obeyed and the mast advanced more than half the necessary distance into the water but the man now called out that the arabs wore advancing swiftly towards the ship  one more effort men said captain truck reddening in the face with anxiety and throwing down his hat to set the example in personheave  the men hove and the spar floated  now to your arms boys and you sir in the top keep yourself hid behind the head of the mast we must be ready to show these gentry we are not afraid of them a sign of the hand told the men in the launch to haul away and the allimportant spar floated slowly across the bar to join the raft  the men now hurried up to the ship a post that captain truck declared he could maintain against a whole tribe while mr dodge began incontinently to scull the jollyboat in the best manner he could off to the launch all remonstrance was useless as he had got as far as the bar before he was perceived both sir george templemore and mr monday loudly denounced him for deserting the party on the shore in this scandalous manner but quite without affect mr dodges skill unfortunately for his success did not quite equal his zeal and finding when he got on the bar that he was unable to keep the boats head to the sea or indeed to manage it at all he fairly jumped into the water and swam lustily towards the launch as he was expert at this exercise he arrived safely cursing in his heart all travelling the desert the arabs and mankind in general wishing himself quietly back in dodgeopolis again among his beloved people the boat drove upon the sands of course and was eventually taken care of by two of the montauks crew  as soon as captain truck found himself on the deck of the dane the arms were distributed among the people it was clearly his policy not to commence the war for he had nothing in an affirmative sense to gain by it though without making any professions his mind was fully made up not to be taken alive as long as there was a possibility of averting such a disaster the man aloft gave constant notice of the movements of the arabs and he soon announced that they had halted at a pistols shot from the bank where they were securing their camels and that his first estimate of their force was true  in the mean time captain truck was far from satisfied with his position the bank was higher than the deck of the ship and so near it as to render the bulwarks of little use had those of the dane been of any available thickness which they were not then the position of the ship lying a little on one side with her bows towards the land exposed her to being swept by a raking fire a cunning enemy having it in his power by making a cover of the bank to pick off his men with little or no exposure to himself the odds were too great to sally upon the plain and although the rocks offered a tolerable cover towards the land they had none towards the ship divide his force he dared not doand by abandoning the ship he would allow the arabs to seize her thus commanding the other position besides the remainder of the stores which he was desirous of securing  men think fast in trying circumstances and although the captain was in a situation so perfectly novel his practical knowledge and great coolness rendered him an invaluable commander to those under his orders  i do not know gentlemen he said addressing his passengers and mates that vattel has laid down any rule to govern this case these arabs no doubt are the lawful owners of the country in one sense but it is a desertand a desert like a sea is common property for the time being to all who find themselves in it there are no wreckmasters in africa and probably no law concerning wrecks but the law of the strongest we have been driven in here moreover by stress of weatherand this is a category on which vattel has been very explicit we have a right to the hospitality of these arabs and if it be not freely accorded dn me gentlemen but i feel disposed to take just as much of it as i find i shall have occasion for mr monday i should like to hear your sentiments on this subject  why sir returned mr monday i have the greatest confidence in your knowledge captain truck and am equally ready for peace or war although my calling is for the first i should try negotiation to begin with sir if it be practicable and you will allow me to express an opinion after which i would offer war  i am quite of the same mind sir but in what way are we to negotiate with a people we cannot make understand a word we say it is true if they were versed in the science of signs one might do something with them but i have reason to know that they are as stupid as boobies on all such subjects we shall get ourselves into a category at the first protocol as the writers say  now mr monday thought there was a language that any man might understand and he was strongly disposed to profit by it in rummaging the wreck he had discovered a case of liquor besides a cask of hollands and he thought an offering of these might have the effect to put the arabs in good humour at least  i have known men who treated with dry in matters of trade were as obstinate as mules become reasonable and pliable sir over a bottle he said after explaining where the liquor was to be found and i think if we offer the arabs this after they have been in possession a short time we shall find them better disposed towards us if it should not prove so i confess for one i should feel less reluctance in shooting them than before  i have somewhere heard that the mussulmans never drink observed sir george in which case we shall find our offering despised then there is the difficulty of a first possession for if these people are the same as those that were here before they may not thank us for giving them so small a part of that of which they may lay claim to all im very sure were any one to offer me my patent pistols as a motive for letting him carry away my patent razors or the east india dressingcase or any thing else i own i should not feel particularly obliged to him  capitally put sir george and i should be quite of your way of thinking if i did not believe these arabs might really be mollified by a little drink if i had a proper ambassador to send with the offering i would resort to the plan at once  mr monday after a moments hesitation spiritedly offered to be one of two to go to the arabs with the proposal for he had sufficient penetration to perceive that there was little danger of his being seized while an armed party of so much strength remained to be overcomeand he had sufficient nerve to encounter the risk all he asked was a companion and captain truck was so much struck with the spirit of the volunteer that he made up his mind to accompany him himself to this plan however both the mates and all the crew stoutly but respectfully objected they felt his importance too much to consent to this exposure and neither of the mates even would be allowed to go on an expedition of so much hazard without a sufficient motive they might fight if they pleased but they should not run into the mouth of the lion unarmed and unresisting  it is of no moment said mr monday i could have liked a gentlemen for my companion but no one of the brave fellows will have any objection to passing an hour in company with an arab sheik over a bottle what say you my lads will any one of you volunteer  ay ay sir cried a dozen in a breath  this will never do interrupted the captain i have need of the men for my heart is still set on these two sticks that remain and we have a headsea and a stiff breeze to struggle with in getting back to the ship by george i have it what do you say to mr dodge for a companion mr monday he is used to committees and likes the service and then he has need of some stimulant after the ducking he has received mr leach take a couple of hands and go off in the jollyboat and bring mr dodge on shore my compliments to him and tell him he has been unanimously chosen to a most honourable and lucrativeay and a popular employment  as this was an order the mate did not scruple about obeying it he was soon afloat and on his way towards the launch captain truck now hailed the top and inquired what the arabs were about the answer was satisfactory as they were still busy with their camels and in pitching their tents this did not look much like an immediate war and bidding the man aloft to give timely notice of their approach mr truck fancied he might still have time to shift his sheers and to whip out the mizzenmast and he accordingly set about it without further delay  as every one worked as it might be for life in fifteen minutes this light spar was suspended in the falls in ten more its heel was clear of the bulwarks and it was lowered on the sands almost by the run to knock off the top and roll it down to the water took but a few minutes longer and then the people were called to their breakfast the sentinel aloft reporting that the arabs were employed in the same manner and in milking their camels this was a fortunate relief and every body ate in peace and in the full assurance that those whom they so much distrusted were equally engaged in the same pacific manner  neither the arabs nor the seamen however lost any unnecessary time at the meal the former were soon reported to be coming and going in parties of fifteen or twenty arriving and departing in an eastern direction occasionally a single runner went or came alone on a fleet dromedary as if communications were held with other bodies which lay deeper in the desert all this intelligence rendered captain truck very uneasy and he thought it time seriously to take some decided measures to bring this matter to an issue still as time gained was all in his favour if improved he first ordered the men to begin to shift the sheers forward in hopes of being yet able to carry off the foremast a spar that would be exceedingly useful as it would save the necessity of fishing a new head to the one which still stood in the packet he then went aside with his two ambassadors with a view to give his instructions  mr dodge had no sooner found himself safe in the launch than he felt his courage revive and with his courage his ingenuity selflove and assurance while in the water a meeker man there was not on earth he had even some doubts as to the truth of all his favourite notions of liberty and equality for men think fast in danger and there was an instant when he might have been easily persuaded to acknowledge himself a demagogue and a hypocrite in his ordinary practices one whose chief motive was self and whose besetting passions were envy distrust and malice or in other words very much the creature he was shame came next and he eagerly sought an excuse for the want of manliness he had betrayed but passing over the language he had held in the launch and the means mr leach found to persuade him to land again we shall give his apology in his own words as he now somewhat hurriedly delivered it to captain truck in his own person  i must have misunderstood your arrangement captain he said for somehow though how i do not exactly knowbut somehow the alarm of the arabs was no sooner given than i felt as if i ought to be in the launch to be at my post but i suppose it was because i knew that the sails and spars that brought us here are mostly there and that this was the spot to be most resolutely defended i do think if they had waded off to us i should have fought like a tiger  no doubt you would my dear sir and like a wild cat too we all make mistakes in judgment in war and in politics and no fact is better known than that the best soldiers in the end are they who give a little ground at the first attack but mr leach has explained to you the plan of mr monday and i rely on your spirit and zeal which there is now an excellent opportunity to prove as before it was only demonstrated  if it were only an opportunity of meeting the arabs sword in hand captain  pooh pooh my dear friend take two swords if you choose one who is full of fight can never get the battle on his own terms fill the arabs with the schnaps of the poor dane and if they should make the smallest symptom of moving down towards us i rely on you to give the alarm in order that we may be ready for them trust to us for the overture of the piece as i trust to you for the overtures of peace  in what way can we possibly do this mr monday how can we give the alarm in season  why interposed the unmoved captain you may just shoot the sheik and that will be killing two birds with one stone you will take your pistols of course and blaze away upon them starboard and larboard rely on it we shall hear you  of that i make no doubt but i rather distrust the prudence of the step that is i declare mr monday it looks awfully like tempting providence i begin to have conscientious scruples i hope you are quite certain captain there is nothing in all this against the laws of africa good moral and religious influences are not to be overlooked my mind is quite exercised in the premises  you are much too conscientious for a diplomatic man said mr truck between the puffs at a fresh cigar you need not shoot any of the women and what more does a man want come no more words but to the duty heartily every one expects it of you since no one can do it half so well and if you ever get back to dodgeopolis there will be matter for a paragraph every day of the year for the next six months if any thing serious happen to you trust to me to do your memory justice  captain captain this trifling with the future is blasphemous men seldom talk of death with impunity and it really hurts my feelings to touch on such awful subjects so lightly i will go for i do not well see how the matter is to be helped but let us go amicably and with such presents as will secure a good reception and a safe return  mr monday takes the liquorcase of the dane and you are welcome to any thing that is left but the foremast that i shall fight for even if lions come out of the desert to help the arabs  mr dodge had many more objections some of which he urged openly and more of which he felt in his inmost spirit but for the unfortunate dive into the water he certainly would have pleaded his immunities as a passenger and plumply refused to be put forward on such an occasion but he felt that he was a disgraced man and that some decided act of spirit was necessary to redeem his character the neutrality observed by the arabs moreover greatly encouraged him for he leaned to an opinion captain truck had expressed that so long as a strongarmed party remained in the wreck the sheik if a man of any moderation and policy would not proceed to violence  you may tell him gentlemen continued mr truck that as soon as i have whipped the foremast out of the dane i will evacuate and leave him the wreck and all it contains the stick can do him no good and i want it in my hearts core put this matter before him plainly and there is no doubt we shall part the best friends in the world remember one thing however we shall set about lifting the spar the moment you quit us and should there be any signs of an attack give us notice in season that we may take to our arms  by this reasoning mr dodge suffered himself to be persuaded to go on the mission though his ingenuity and fears supplied an additional motive that he took very good care not to betray should there be a battle he knew he would be expected to fight if he remained with his own party and if with the other he might plausibly secrete himself until the affair was over for with a man of his temperament eventual slavery had less horrors than immediate death  when mr monday and his cocommissioner ascended the bank bearing the case of liquors and a few light offerings that the latter had found in the wreck it was just as the crew assured that the arabs still remained tranquil had seriously set about pursuing their great object on the margin of the plain captain truck took his leave of the ambassadors though he remained some time to reconnoitre the appearance of things in the wildlooking camp which was placed within two hundred yards of the spot on which he stood the number of the arabs had not certainly been exaggerated and what gave him the most uneasiness was the fact that parties appeared to be constantly communicating with more who probably lay behind a ridge of sand that bounded the view less than a mile distant inland as they all went and came in that direction after waiting to see his two envoyés in the very camp he stationed a lookout on the bank and returned to the wreck to hurry on the allimportant work  mr monday was the efficient man of the two commissioners so soon as they were fairly embarked in their enterprise he was strong of nerves and without imagination to fancy dangers where they were not very obvious and had a great faith in the pacific virtues of the liquorcase an arab advanced to meet them when near the tents and although conversation was quite out of the question by pure force of gesticulations aided by the single word sheik they succeeded in obtaining an introduction to that personage  the inhabitants of the desert have been so often described that we shall assume they are known to our readers and proceed with our narrative the same as if we had to do with christians much of what has been written of the hospitality of the arabs if true of any portion of them is hardly true of those tribes which frequent the atlantic coast where the practice of wrecking would seem to have produced the same effect on their habits and morals that it is known to produce elsewhere but a ship protected by a few weatherworn and stranded mariners and a ship defended by a strong and an armed party like that headed by captain truck presented very different objects to the cupidity of these barbarians they knew the great advantage they possessed by being on their own ground and were content to await events in preference to risking a doubtful contest several of the party had been at mogadore and other parts and had acquired tolerably accurate ideas of the power of vessels and as they were confident the men now at work at the wreck had not the means of carrying away the cargo their own principal object curiosity and caution connected with certain plans that were already laid among their leaders kept them quiet for the moment at least  these people were not so ignorant as to require to be told that some other vessel was at no great distance and their scouts had been out in all directions to ascertain the fact previously to taking their ultimate measures for the sheik himself had some pretty just notions of the force of a vessel of war and of the danger of contending with one the result of his policy therefore will better appear in the course of the narrative  the reception of the two envoys of captain truck was masked by that smiling and courteous politeness which seems to diminish as one travels west and to increase as he goes eastward though it was certainly less elaborate than would have been found in the palace of an indian rajah the sheik was not properly a sheik nor was the party composed of genuine arabs though we have thus styled them from usage the first however was a man in authority and he and his followers possessed enough of the origin and characteristics of the tribes east of the red sea to be sufficiently described by the appellation we have adopted  mr monday and mr dodge were invited by signs to be seated and refreshments were offered as the last were not particularly inviting mr monday was not slow in producing his own offering and in recommending its quality by setting an example of the way in which it ought to be treated although mussulmans the hosts did not scruple about tasting the cup and ten minutes of pantomime potations and grimaces brought about a species of intimacy between the parties  the man who had been so unceremoniously captured the previous night by captain truck was now introduced and much curiosity was manifested to know whether his account of the disposition in the strangers to eat their fellow creatures was true the inhabitants of the desert in the course of ages had gleaned certain accounts of mariners eating their shipmates from their different captives and vague traditions to that effect existed among them which the tale of this man had revived had the sheik kept a journal like mr dodge the result of these inquiries would probably have been some entries concerning the customs and characters of the americans that were quite as original as those of the editor of the active inquirer concerning the different nations he had visited  mr monday paid great attention to the pantomime of the arab in which that worthy endeavoured to explain the disposition of captain truck to make a barbecue of him when it was ended he gravely informed his companions that the sheik had invited them to stay for dinnera proposition that he was disposed to accept but the sensitiveness of mr dodge viewed the matter otherwise for with a conformity of opinion that really said something in favour of the science of signs he arrived at the same conclusion as the poor arab himselfwith the material difference that he fancied that the arabs were disposed to make a meal of himself mr monday who was a hearty beef and brandy personage scouted the idea and thought the matter settled by pointing to two or three young camels and asking the editor if he thought any man turk or christian would think of eating one so lank meagre and uninviting as himself when they had so much capital food of another sort at their elbow take your share of the liquor while it is passing man and set your heart at ease as to the dinner which i make no doubt will be substantial and decent had i known of the favour intended us i should have brought out the sheik a service of knives and forks from birmingham for he really seems a welldisposed and gentlemanlike man a very capital fellow i dare say we shall find him after he has had a few camels steaks and a proper allowance of schnaps mr sheik i drink your health with all my heart  the accidents of life could scarcely have brought together in circumstances so peculiar men whose characters were more completely the converse of each other than mr monday and mr dodge they were perfect epitomes of two large classes in their respective nations and so diametrically opposed to each other that one could hardly recognise in them scions from a common stock the first was dull obstinate straightforward hearty in his manners and not without sincerity though wily in a bargain with all his seeming frankness the last distrustful cunning rather than quick of comprehension insincere fawning when he thought his interests concerned and jealous and detracting at all other times with a coldness of exterior that had at least the merit of appearing to avoid deception both were violently prejudiced though in mr monday it was the prejudice of old dogmas in religion politics and morals and in the other it was the vice of provincialism and an education that was not entirely free from the fanaticism of the seventeenth century one consequence of this discrepancy of character was a perfectly opposite manner of viewing matters in this interview while mr monday was disposed to take things amicably mr dodge was all suspicion and had they then returned to the wreck the last would have called to arms while the first would have advised captain truck to go out and visit the sheik in the manner one would visit a respectable and agreeable neighbour     chapter xx      tis of more worth than kingdoms far more precious   than all the crimson treasures of lifes fountain   oh let it not elude thy grasp    cotton   things were in this state the sheik and his guests communicating by signs in such a way as completely to mystify each other mr monday drinking mr dodge conjecturing and parties quitting the camp and arriving every ten minutes when an arab pointed eagerly with his finger in the direction of the wreck the head of the foremast was slowly rising and the lookout in the top was clinging to the spar which began to cant in order to keep himself from falling the sheik affected to smile but he was evidently disturbed and two or three messengers were sent out into the camp in the meanwhile the spar began to lower and was soon entirely concealed beneath the bank  it was now apparent that the arabs thought the moment had arrived when it was their policy to interfere the sheik therefore left his guests to be entertained by two or three others who had joined in the potations and making the best assurances he could by means of signs of his continued amity he left the tent laying aside all his arms attended by two or three old men like himself he went boldly to the plank and descended quietly to the sands where he found captain truck busied in endeavouring to get the spar into the water the top was already afloat and the stick itself was cut round in the right position for rolling when the foul but gravelooking barbarians appeared among the workmen as the latter had been apprised of their approach and of the fact of their being unarmed no one left his employment to receive them with the exception of captain truck himself  bear a hand with the spar mr leach he said while i entertain these gentlemen it is a good sign that they come to us without arms and it shall never be said that we are behind them in civility half an hour will settle our affairs when these gentry are welcome to what will be left of the daneyour servant gentlemen im glad to see you and beg the honour to shake hands with all of you from the oldest to the youngest  although the arabs understood nothing that was said they permitted captain truck to give each of them a hearty shake of the hand smiling and muttering their own compliments with as much apparent good will as was manifested by the old seaman himself  god help the danes if they have fallen into servitude among these blackguards said the captain aloud while he was shaking the sheik a second time most cordially by the hand for a fouler set of thieves i never laid eyes on leach mr monday has tried the virtue of the schnaps on them notwithstanding for the odour of gin is mingled with that of grease about the old scoundrelroll away at the spar boys halfadozen more such heaves and you will have him in his native element as the newspapers call itim glad to see you gentlemen we are badly off as to chairs on this beach but to such as we have you are heartily welcomemr leach the arab sheikarab sheik mr leachon the bank there  sir  any movement among the arabs  about thirty have just ridden back into the desert mounted on camels sir nothing more  no signs of our passengers  ay ay sir here comes mr dodge under full sail heading for the bank as straight as he can lay his course  hais he pursued  the men ceased their work and glanced aside at their arms  not at all sir mr monday is calling after him and the arabs seem to be laughing mr monday is just splicing the mainbrace with one of the rascals  let the atlantic ocean then look out for itself for mr dodge will be certain to run over it heave away my hearties and the stick will be afloat yet before that gentleman is fairly docked  the men worked with good will but their zeal was far less efficient than that of the editor of the active inquirer who now broke through the bushes and plunged down the bank with a velocity which if continued would have carried him to dodgeopolis itself within the month the arabs started at this sudden apparition but perceiving that those around them laughed they were disposed to take the interruption in good part the lookout now announced the approach of mr monday followed by fifty arabs the latter however being without arms and the former without his hat the moment was critical but the steadiness of captain truck did not desert him issuing a rapid order to the second mate with a small party previously selected for that duty to stand by the arms he urged the rest of the people to renewed exertions just as this was done mr monday appeared on the bank with a bottle in one hand and a glass in the other calling aloud to mr dodge to return and drink with the arabs  do not disgrace christianity in this unmannerly way he said but show these gentlemen of the desert that we know what propriety is captain truck i beg of you to urge mr dodge to return i was about to sing the arabs god save the king and in a few more minutes we should have had rule britannia when we should have been the best friends and companions in the world captain truck ive the honour to drink your health  but captain truck viewed the matter differently both his ambassadors were now safely back for mr monday came down upon the beach followed it is true by all the arabs and the mast was afloat he thought it better therefore that mr dodge should remain and that the two parties should be as quietly but as speedily as possible separated he ordered the hauling line to be fastened to the mast and as the stick was slowly going out through the surf he issued the order for the men to collect their implements take their arms and to assemble in a body at the rocks where the jollyboat still lay  be quick men but be steady for there are a hundred of these rascals on the beach already and all the lastcomers are armed we might pick up a few more useful things from the wreck but the wind is coming in from the westward and our principal concern now will be to save what we have got lead mr monday along with you leach for he is so full of diplomacy and schnaps just now that he forgets his safety as for mr dodge i see he is stowed away in the boat already as snug as the groundtier in a ship loaded with molasses count the men off sir and see that no one is missing  by this time the state of things on the beach had undergone material changes the wreck was full of arabs some of whom were armed and some not while mauls crows handspikes purchases coils of rigging and marlingspikes were scattered about on the sands just where they had been dropped by the seamen a party of fifty arabs had collected around the rocks where by this time all the mariners were assembled intermingling with the latter and apparently endeavouring to maintain the friendly relations which had been established by mr monday as a portion of these men were also armed captain truck disliked their proceedings but the inferiority of his numbers and the disadvantage under which he was placed compelled him to resort to management rather than force in order to extricate himself  the arabs now crowded around and intermingled with the seamen thronged the ship and lined the bank to the number of more than two hundred it became evident that their true force had been underrated and that additions were constantly making to it from those who lay behind the ridges of sand all those who appeared last had arms of one kind or another and several brought firearms which they gave to the sheik and to those who had first descended to the beach still every face seemed amicable and the men were scarcely permitted to execute their orders from the frequent interruptions to exchange tokens of friendship  but captain truck fully believed that hostilities were intended and although he had suffered himself in some measure to be surprised he set about repairing his error with great judgment and admirable steadiness his first step was to extricate his own people from those who pressed upon them a thing that was effected by causing a few to take a position that might be defended higher among the rocks as they afforded a good deal of cover and which communicated directly with the place where they had landed and then ordering the remainder of the men to fall back singly to prevent an alarm each man was called off by name and in this manner the whole party had got within the prescribed limits before the arabs who were vociferating and talking altogether seemed to be aware of the movement when some of the latter attempted to follow they were gently repulsed by the sentinels all this time captain truck maintained the utmost cordiality towards the sheik keeping near him and amongst the arabs himself the work of plunder in the meantime had begun in earnest in the wreck and this he thought a favourable symptom as men thus employed would be less likely to make a hostile attack still he knew that prisoners were of great account among these barbarians and that an attempt to tow the raft off from the land in open boats where his people would be exposed to every shot from the wreck would subject them to he greatest danger of defeat were the former disposed to prevent it  having reflected a few minutes on his situation captain truck issued his final orders the jollyboat might carry a dozen men at need though they would be crowded and much exposed to fire and he therefore caused eight to get into her and to pull out to the launch mr leach went with this party for the double purpose of directing its movements and of being separated from his commander in order that one of those who were of so much importance to the packet might at least stand a chance of being saved this separation also was effected without alarming the arabs though captain truck observed that the sheik watched the proceeding narrowly  as soon as mr leach had reached the launch he caused a light kedge to be put into the jollyboat and coils of the lightest rigging he had were laid on the top of it or were made on the bows of the launch as soon as this was done the boat was pulled a long distance off from the land paying out the ropes first from the launch and then from the boat itself until no more of the latter remained the kedge was then dropped and the men in the launch began to haul in upon the ropes that were attached to it as the jollyboat returned immediately and her crew joined in the work the line of boats the kedge by which they had previously ridden having been first raised began slowly to recede from the shore  captain truck had rightly conjectured the effect of this movement it was so unusual and so gradual that the launch and the raft were warped up to the kedge before the arabs fully comprehended its nature the boats were now more than a quarter of a mile from the wreck for mr leach had run out quite two hundred fathoms of small rope and of course so distant as greatly to diminish the danger from the muskets of the arabs though still within reach of their range near an hour was passed in effecting this point which as the sea and wind were both rising could not probably have been effected in any other manner half as soon if at all  the state of the weather and the increasing turbulence of the barbarians now rendered it extremely desirable to all on the rocks to be in their boats again a very moderate blow would compel them to abandon their hardearned advantages and it began to be pretty evident from the manners of those around them that amity could not much longer be maintained even the old sheik retired and instead of going to the wreck he joined the party on the beach where he was seen in earnest conversation with several other old men all of whom gesticulated vehemently as they pointed towards the boats and to the party on the rocks  mr leach now pulled in towards the bar with both the jollyboats and the cutter having only two oars each half his men being left in the launch this was done that the people might not be crowded at the critical moment and that at need there might be room to fight as well as to row all these precautions having been taken in consequence of captain trucks previous orders when the boats reached the rocks the people did not hurry into them but a quarter of an hour was passed in preparations as if they were indifferent about proceeding and even then the jollyboat alone took in a portion and pulled leisurely without the bar here she lay on her oars in order to cover the passage of the other boats if necessary with her fire the cutter imitated this manoeuvre and the boat of the wreck went last captain truck quitted the rock after all the others though his embarkation was made rapidly by a prompt and sudden movement  not a shot was fired however and contrary to his own most ardent hopes the captain found himself at the launch with all his people unhurt and with all the spars he had so much desired to obtain the forbearance of the arabs was a mystery to him for he had fully expected hostilities would commence every moment for the last two hours nor was he yet absolutely out of danger though there was time to pause and look about him and to take his succeeding measures more deliberately the first report was a scarcity of both food and water for both these essentials the men had depended on the wreck and in the eagerness to secure the foremast and subsequently to take care of themselves these important requisites had been overlooked quite probably too as much from a knowledge that the montauk was so near as from hurry still both were extremely desirable if not indispensable to men who had the prospect of many hours hard work before them and captain trucks first impulse was to despatch a boat to the ship for supplies this intention was reluctantly abandoned however on account of the threatening appearance of the weather  there was no danger of a gale but a smart sea breeze was beginning to set in and the surface of the ocean was as usual getting to be agitated changing all his plans therefore the captain turned his immediate attention to the safety of the allimportant spars  we can eat tomorrow men he said but if we lose these sticks our chance for getting any more will indeed be small take a gang on the raft mr leach and double all the lashings while i see that we get an offing if the wind rises any more we shall need it and even then be worse off than we could wish  the mate passed upon the raft and set about securing all the spars by additional fastenings for the working occasioned by the sea already rendered them loose and liable to separate while this was in train the two jollyboats took in lines and kedges of which luckily they had one that was brought from the packet besides two found in the wreck and pulled off into the ocean as soon as one kedge was dropped that by which the launch rode was tripped and the boats were hauled up to it the other jollyboat proceeding on to renew the process in this manner in the course of two more hours the whole raft and all were warped broad off from the land and to windward quite two miles when the water became so deep that captain truck reluctantly gave the order to cease  i would gladly work our way into the offing in this mode three or four leagues he said by which means we might make a fair wind of it as it is we must get all clear and do as well as we can rig the masts in the launch mr leach and we will see what can be done with this dull craft we have in tow  while this order was in course of execution the glass was used to ascertain the manner in which the arabs were occupied to the surprise of all in the boats every soul of them had disappeared the closest scrutiny could not detect one near the wreck on the beach nor even at the spot where the tents had so lately stood  they are all off by george cried captain truck when fully satisfied of the fact camels tents and arabs the rascals have loaded their beasts already and most probably have gone to hide their plunder that they may be back and make sure of a second haul before any of their precious brother vultures up in the sands get a scent of the carrion dn the rogues i thought at one time they had me in a category well joy be with them mr monday i return you my hearty thanks for the manly frank and diplomatic manner in which you have discharged the duties of your mission without you we might not have succeeded in getting the foremast mr dodge you have the high consolation of knowing that throughout this trying occasion you have conducted yourself in a way no other man of the party could have done  mr monday was sleeping off the fumes of the schnaps but mr dodge bowed to the compliment and foresaw many capital things for the journal and for the columns of the active inquirer he even began to meditate a book  now commenced much the most laborious and critical part of the service that captain truck had undertaken if we except the collision with the arabsthat of towing all the heavy spars of a large ship in one raft in the open sea near a coast and with the wind blowing on shore it is true he was stronghanded being able to put ten oars in the launch and four in all the other boats but after making sail and pulling steadily for an hour it was discovered that all their exertions would not enable them to reach the ship if the wind stood before the succeeding day the drift to leeward or towards the beach was seriously great every heave of the sea setting them bodily down before it and by the time they were half a mile to the southward they were obliged to anchor in order to keep clear of the breakers which by this time extended fully a mile from shore  decision was fortunately captain trucks leading quality he foresaw the length and severity of the struggle that was before them and the men had not been pulling ten minutes before he ordered mr leach who was in the cutter to cast off his line and to come alongside the launch  pull back to the wreck sir he said and bring off all you can lay hands on in the way of bread water and other comforts we shall make a night of it i see we will keep a lookout for you and if any arabs heave in sight on the plain a musket will be fired if so many as to render a hint to abscond necessary two muskets will be fired and the mainsail of the launch will be furled for two minutes more time than that we cannot spare you  mr leach obeyed this order and with great success luckily the cook had left the coppers full of food enough to last twentyfour hours and this had escaped the arabs who were ignorant where to look for it in addition there was plenty of bread and water and a bull of jamaica had been discovered by the instinct of one of the hands which served admirably to keep the people in good humour this timely supply had arrived just as the launch anchored and mr truck welcomed it with all his heart for without it he foresaw he should soon be obliged to abandon his precious prize  when the people were refreshed the long and laborious process of warping off the land was resumed and in the course of two hours more the raft was got fully a league into the offing a shoal permitting the kedges to be used farther out this time than before then sail was again made and the oars were once more plied but the sea still proved their enemy though they had struck the current which began to set them south had there been no wind and sea the progress of the boats would now have been comparatively easy and quick but these two adverse powers drove them in towards the beach so fast that they had scarcely made two miles from the wreck when they were compelled a second time to anchor  no alternative remained but to keep warping off in this manner and then to profit by the offing they had made as well as they could the result bringing them at sunset nearly up with the headland that shut out the view of their own vessel from which captain truck now calculated that he was distant a little less than two leagues the wind had freshened and though it was not by any means so strong as to render the sea dangerous it increased the toil of the men to such a degree that he reluctantly determined to seek out a proper anchorage and to give his wearied people some rest  it was not in the power of the seamen to carry their raft into any haven for to the northward of the headland or on the side on which they were there was no reef nor any bay to afford them shelter the coast was one continued waving line of sandbanks and in most places when there was a wind the water broke at the distance of a mile from the beach the precise spot where the dane had stranded his vessel having most probably been chosen for that purpose with a view to save the lives of the people under these circumstances nothing remained but to warp off again to a safe distance and to secure the boats as well as they could for the night this was effected by eight oclock and captain truck gave the order to let go two additional kedges being determined not to strike adrift in the darkness if it was in his power to prevent it when this was done the people had their suppers a watch was set and the remainder went to sleep  as the three passengers had been exempted from the toil they volunteered to look out for the safety of the boats until midnight in order that the men might obtain as much rest as possible and half an hour after the crew were lost in the deep slumber of seamen captain truck and these gentlemen were seated in the launch holding a dialogue on the events of the day  you found the arabs conversable and ready at the cup mr monday observed the captain lighting a cigar which with him was a neverfailing sign for a gossip men that if they had been sent to school young taught to dance and were otherwise civilized might make reasonably good ship mates in this roving world of ours  upon my word sir i look upon the sheik as uncommon gentlemanlike and altogether as a good fellow he took his glass without any grimaces smiled whenever he said any thing though i could not understand a word he said and answered all my remarks quite as civilly as if he spoke english i must say i think mr dodge manifested a want of consideration in quitting his company with so little ceremony the gentleman was hurt ill answer for it and he would say as much if he could only make out to explain himself on the subject sir george i regret we had not the honour of your company on the occasion for i have been told these arabs have a proper respect for the nobility and gentry mr dodge and myself were but poor substitutes for a gentleman like yourself  the trained humility of mr monday was little to the liking of mr dodge who by the sheer force of the workings of envy had so long been endeavouring to persuade others that he was the equal of any and every other mana delusion however in which he could not succeed in persuading himself to fall intoand he was not slow in exhibiting the feeling it awakened  sir george templemore has too just a sense of the rights of nations to make this distinction mr monday he said if i left the arab sheik a little abruptly it was because i disliked his ways for i take it africa is a free country and that no man is obliged to remain longer in a tent than it suits his own convenience captain truck knows that i was merely running down the beach to inform him that the sheik intended to follow and he no doubt appreciates my motive  if not mr dodge put in the captain like other patriots you must trust to posterity to do you justice the joints and sinews are so differently constructed in different men that one never knows exactly how to calculate on speed but this much i will make affidavit to if you wish it on reaching home and that is that a better messenger could not be found than mr steadfast dodge for a man in a hurry sir george templemore we have had but a few of your opinions since you came out on this expedition and i should be gratified to hear your sentiments concerning the arabs and any thing else that may suggest itself at the moment  oh captain i think the wretches odiously dirty and judging from appearances i should say sadly deficient in comforts  in the way of breeches in particular for i am inclined to think sir george you are master of more than are to be found in their whole nation well gentlemen one must certainly travel who wishes to see the world but for this sheer down here upon the coast of africa neither of us might have ever known how an arab lives and what a nimble wrecker he makes for my own part if the choice lay between filling the office of jemmy ducks on board the montauk and that of sheik in this tribe i should as we say in america mr dodge leave it to the people and do all in my power to obtain the first situation sir george im afraid all these county tongues as mr dodge calls them in the way of wind and weather will quite knock the buffalo hunt on the prairies in the head for this fall at least  i beg captain truck you will not discredit my french in this way i do not call a disappointment county tongues but contra toms the phrase probably coming from some person of the name of tom who was contra or opposed to every one else  perfectly explained and as clear as bilgewater sir george has mr dodge mentioned to you the manner in which these arabs enjoy life the gentlemen by way of saving dishwater eat halfadozen at a time out of the same plate quite republican and altogether without pride mr dodge in their notions  why sir many of their habits struck me as being simple and praiseworthy during the short time i remained in their country and i dare say one who had leisure to study them might find materials for admiration i can readily imagine situations in which a man has no right to appropriate a whole dish to himself  no doubt and he who wishes a thing so unreasonable must be a great hog what a thing is sleep here are these fine fellows as much lost to their dangers and toils as if at home and tucked in by their careful and pious mothers little did the good souls who nursed them and sung pious songs over their cradles fancy the hardships they were bringing them up to but we never know our fates or miserable dogs most of us would be is it not so sir george  the baronet started at this appeal which crossed the quaint mind of the captain as a cloud darkens a sunny view and he muttered a hasty expression of hope that there was now no particular reason to expect any more serious obstacles to their reaching the ship  it is not an easy thing to tow a heavy raft in light boats like these exactly in the direction you wish it to go returned the captain gaping he who trusts to the winds and waves trusts an uncertain friend and one who may fail him at the very moment when there is most need of their services fair as things now seem i would give a thousand dollars of a small stock in which no single dollar has been lightly earned to see these spars safely on board the montauk and snugly fitted to their proper places sticks gentlemen are to a ship what limbs are to a man without them she rolls and tumbles about as winds currents and seas will while with them she walks and dances and jumps jim crow ay almost talks the standing rigging are the bones and gristle the running gear the veins in which her life circulates and the blocks the joints  and which is the heart asked sir george  her heart is the master with a sufficient commander no stout ship is ever lost so long as she has a foot of water beneath her false keel or a ropeyarn left to turn to account  and yet the dane had all these  all but the water the best craft that was ever launched is of less use than a single camel if laid high and dry on the sands of africa these poor wretches truly and yet their fate might have been ours though i thought little of the risk while we were in the midst of the arabs it is still a mystery to me why they let us escape especially as they so soon deserted the wreck they were stronghanded too counting all who came and went i think not less than several hundreds  the captain now became silent and thoughtful and as the wind continued to rise he began to feel uneasiness about his ship once or twice he expressed a halfformed determination to pull to her in one of the light boats in order to look after her safety in person and then he abandoned it as he witnessed the rising of the sea and the manner in which the massive raft caused the cordage by which it was held to strain at length he too fell asleep and we shall leave him and his party for awhile and return to the montauk to give an account of what occurred on board that ship     chapter xxi      nothing beside remains round the decay   of that colossal wreck boundless and bare   the lone and level sands stretch far away    shelley   as captain truck was so fully aware of the importance of rapid movements to the success of his enterprise it will be remembered that he left in the ship no seaman no servant except saunders the steward and in short no men but the two messrs effingham mr sharp mr blunt and the other person just mentioned if to these be added eve effingham mademoiselle viefville ann sidley and a french femme de chambre the whole party will be enumerated at first it had been the intention of the master to leave one of his mates behind him but encouraged by the secure berth he had found for his vessel the great strength of his moorings the little hold the winds and waves could get of spars so robbed of their proportions and of a hull so protected by the reef and feeling a certain confidence in the knowledge of mr blunt who several times during the passage had betrayed a great familiarity with ships he came to the decision named and had formally placed the last named gentleman in full charge ad interim of the montauk  there was a solemn and exciting interest in the situation of those who remained in the vessel after the party of bustling seamen had left them the night came in bland and tranquil and although there was no moon they walked the deck for hours with strange sensations of enjoyment mingled with those of loneliness and desertion mr effingham and his cousin retired to their rooms long before the others who continued their exercise with a freedom and an absence of restraint that they had not before felt since subjected to the confinement of the ship  our situation is at least novel eve observed for a party of parisians viennois romans or by whatever name we may be properly styled  say swiss then returned mr blunt for i believe that even the cosmopolite has a claim to choose his favourite residence  eve understood the allusion which carried her back to the weeks they had passed in company among the grand scenery of the alps but she would not betray the consciousness for whatever may be the ingenuousness of a female she seldom loses her sensitiveness on the subject of her more cherished feelings  and do you prefer switzerland to all the other countries of your acquaintance asked mr sharp england i leave out of the question for though we who belong to the island see so many charms in it it must be conceded that strangers seldom join us very heartily in its praises i think most travellers would give the palm to italy  i am quite of the same opinion returned the other and were i to be confined to a choice of a residence for life italy should be my home still i think that we like change in our residence as well as in the seasons italy is summer and one i fear would weary of even an eternal june  is not italy rather autumn a country in which the harvest is gathered and where one begins already to see the fall of the leaf  to me said eve it would be an eternal summer as things are eternal with young ladies my ignorance would be always receiving instruction and my tastes improvement but if italy be summer or autumn what is poor america  spring of course civilly answered mr sharp  and do you mr blunt who seem to know all parts of the world equally well agree in giving our country my country at least this encouraging title  it is merited in many respects though there are others in which the term winter would perhaps be better applied america is a country not easily understood for in some particulars like minerva it has been born fullgrown while in others it is certainly still an infant  in what particulars do you especially class it with the latter inquired mr sharp  in strength to commence answered the other slightly smiling in opinions too and in tastes and perhaps in knowledge as to the latter essential however and practical things as well as in the commoner comforts america may well claim to be in midsummer when compared with other nations i do not think you americans miss effingham at the head of civilisation certainly as so many of your own people fancy nor yet at the bottom as so many of those of mademoiselle viefville and mr sharp so piously believe  and what are the notions of the countrymen of mr blunt on the subject  as far from the truth perhaps as any other i perceive there exist some doubts as to the place of my nativity he added after a pause that denoted a hesitation which all hoped was to end in his setting the matter at rest by a simple statement of the fact and i believe i shall profit by the circumstance to praise and condemn at pleasure since no one can impeach my candour or impute either to partialities or prejudices  that must depend on the justice of your judgments in one thing however you will have me on your side and that is in giving the pas to delicious dreamy italy though mademoiselle viefville will set this down as lèse majesté against cher paris and i fear mr sharp will think even london injured  do you really hold london so cheap inquired the latter gentleman with more interest than he himself was quite aware of betraying  indeed no this would be to discredit my own tastes and knowledge in a hundred things i think london quite the finest town of christendom it is not rome certainly and were it in ruins fifteen centuries i question if people would flock to the banks of the thames to dream away existence among its crumbling walls but in conveniences beauty of verdure a mixture of parklike scenery and architecture and in magnificence of a certain sort one would hardly know where to go to find the equal of london  you say nothing of its society miss effingham  it would be presuming in a girl of my limited experience to speak of this i hear so much of the good sense of the nation that i dare not say aught against its society and it would be affectation for me to pretend to commend it but as for your females judging by my own poor means they strike me as being singularly well cultivated and accomplished and yet  go on i entreat you recollect we have solemnly decided in a general congress of states to be cosmopolites until safe within sandy hook and that la franchise is the mot dordre  well then i should not certainly describe you english as a talking people continued eve laughing in the way of society you are quite as agreeable as a people who never laugh and seldom speak can possibly make themselves  et les jeunes americaines said mademoiselle viefville laconically  my dear mademoiselle your question is terrific mr blunt has informed me that they actually giggle  quelle horreur  it is bad enough certainly but i ascribe the report to calumny no if i must speak let me have paris for its society and naples for its nature as respects new york mr blunt i suspend my judgment  whatever may be the particular merit which shall most attract your admiration in favour of the great emporium as the grandiloquent writers term the capital of your own state i think i can venture to predict it will be neither of those just mentioned of society indeed new york has positively none like london it has plenty of company which is disciplined something like a regiment of militia composed of drafts from different brigades and which sometimes mistakes the drummajor for the colonel  i had fancied you a new yorker until now observed mr sharp  and why not now is a man to be blind to facts as evident as the noonday sun because he was born here or there if i have told you an unpleasant truth miss effingham you must accuse la franchise of the offence i believe you are not a manhattanese  i am a mountaineer having been born at my fathers country residence  this gives me courage then for no one here will have his filial piety shocked  not even yourself  as for myself returned paul blunt it is settled i am a cosmopolite in fact while you are only a cosmopolite by convention indeed i question if i might take the same liberties with either paris or london that i am about to take with palmy manhattan i should have little confidence in the forbearance of my auditors mademoiselle viefville would hardly forgive me were i to attempt a criticism on the first for instance  cest impossible you could not monsieur blunt vous parlez trop bien français not to love paris  i do love paris mademoiselle and what is more i love londres or even la nouvelle yorck as a cosmopolite i claim this privilege at least though i can see defects in all if you will recollect miss effingham that new york is a social bivouac a place in which families encamp instead of troops you will see the impossibility of its possessing a graceful wellordered and cultivated society then the town is commercial and no place of mere commerce can well have a reputation for its society such an anomaly i believe never existed whatever may be the usefulness of trade i fancy few will contend that it is very graceful  florence of old said eve  florence and her commerce were peculiar and the relations of things change with circumstances when florence was great trade was a monopoly in a few hands and so conducted as to remove the principals from immediate contact with its affairs the medici traded in spices and silks as men traded in politics through agents they probably never saw their ships or had any farther connexion with their commerce than to direct its spirit they were more like the legislator who enacts laws to regulate trade than the dealer who fingers a sample smells at a wine or nibbles a grain the medici were merchants a class of men altogether different from the mere factors who buy of one to sell to another at a stated advance in price and all of whose enterprise consists in extending the list of safe customers and of doing what is called a regular business monopolies do harm on the whole but they certainly elevate the favoured few the medici and the strozzi were both princes and merchants while those around them were principally dependants competition in our day has let in thousands to share in the benefits and the pursuit while it is enlarged as a whole has suffered in its parts by division  you surely do not complain that a thousand are comfortable and respectable today for one that was il magnifico three hundred years since  certainly not i rejoice in the change but we must not confound names with things if we have a thousand mere factors for one merchant society in the general signification of the word is clearly a gainer but if we had one medici for a thousand factors society in its particular signfication might also be a gainer all i mean is that in lowering the pursuit we have necessarily lowered its qualifications in other words every man in trade in new york is no more a lorenzo than every printers devil is a franklin  mr blunt cannot be an american cried mr sharp for these opinions would be heresy  jamais jamais joined the governess  you constantly forget the treaty of cosmopolitism but a capital error is abroad concerning america on this very subject of commerce in the way of merchandise alone there is not a christian maritime nation of any extent that has a smaller portion of its population engaged in trade of this sort than the united states of america the nation as a nation is agricultural though the state of transition in which a country in the course of rapid settlement must always exist causes more buying and selling of real property than is usual apart from this peculiarity the americans as a whole people have not the common european proportions of ordinary dealers  this is not the prevalent opinion said mr sharp  it is not and the reason is that all american towns or nearly all that are at all known in other countries are purely commercial towns the trading portion of a community is always the concentrated portion too and of course in the absence of a court of a political or of a social capital it has the greatest power to make itself heard and felt until there is a direct appeal to the other classes the elections commonly show quite as little sympathy between the majority and the commercial class as is consistent with the public welfare in point of fact america has but a very small class of real merchants men who are the cause and not a consequence of commerce though she has exceeding activity in the way of ordinary traffic the portion of her people who are engaged as factorsfor this is the true calling of the man who is a regular agent between the common producer and the common consumerare of a high class as factors but not of the high class of merchants the man who orders a piece of silk to be manufactured at lyons at three francs a yard to sell it in the regular course of the season to the retailer at three francs and a half is no more a true merchant than the attorney who goes through the prescribed forms of the court in his pleadings is a barrister  i do not think these sentiments will be very popular at home as mr dodge says eve laughingly remarked but when shall we reach that home while we are talking of these things here are we in an almost deserted ship within a mile of the great desert of sahara how beautiful are the stars mademoiselle we have never before seen a vault so studded with brilliants  that must be owing to the latitude mr sharp observed  certainly can any one say in what latitude we are precisely as eve asked this question she unconsciously turned towards mr blunt for the whole party had silently come to the conclusion that he knew more of ships and navigation than all of them united  i believe we are not far from twentyfour which is bringing us near the tropics and places us quite sixteen degrees to the southward of our port these two affairs of the chase and of the gale have driven us fully twelve hundred miles from the course we ought to have taken  fortunately mademoiselle there are none to feel apprehensions on our account or none whose interest will be so keen as to create a very lively distress i hope gentlemen you are equally at ease on this score  this was the first time eve had ever trusted herself to out an interrogatory that might draw from paul blunt any communication that would directly touch upon his connexions she repented of the speech as soon as made but causelessly as it drew from the young man no answer mr sharp observed that his friends in england could scarcely know of their situation until his own letters would arrive to relieve their minds as for mademoiselle viefville the hard fortune which reduced her to the office of a governess had almost left her without natural ties  i believe we are to have watch and ward tonight resumed eve after the general pause had continued some little time is it not possible for the elements to put us in the same predicament as that in which we found the poor dane  possible certainly but scarcely probable returned mr blunt the ship is well moored and this narrow ledge of rocks between us and the ocean serves admirably for a breakwater one would not like to be stranded helpless as we are at this moment on a coast like this  why so particularly helpless you allude to the absence of our crew  to that and to the fact that i believe we could not muster as much as a pocketpistol to defend ourselves with everything in the shape of firearms having been sent with the party in the boats  might we not lie on the beach here for days even weeks inquired mr sharp without being discovered by the arabs  i fear not mariners have told me that the barbarians hover along the shores especially after gales in the hope of meeting with wrecks and that it is surprising how soon they gain intelligence of any disaster it is seldom there is even an opportunity to escape in a boat  i hope here at least we are safe cried eve in a little terror and shuddering as much in playfulness as in real alarm  i see no grounds of concern where we are so long as we can keep the ship off the shore the arabs have no boats and if they had they would not dare to attack a vessel that floated in one unless aware of her being as truly helpless as we happen at this moment to be  this is a chilling consolation but i shall trust in your good care gentlemen mademoiselle it is drawing near midnight i believe  eve and her companion then courteously wished the two young men good night and retired to their staterooms mr sharp remained an hour longer with mr blunt who had undertaken to watch the first few hours conversing with a light heart and gaily for though there was a secret consciousness of rivalry between these two young men on the subject of eves favour it was a generous and manly competition in which each did the other ample justice they talked of their travels their views of customs and nations their adventures in different countries and of the pleasure each had felt in visiting spots renowned by association or the arts but not a word was hazarded by either concerning the young creature who had just left them and whom each still saw in his minds eye long after her light and graceful form had disappeared at length mr sharp went below his companion insisting on being left alone under the penalty of remaining up himself during the second watch from this time for several hours there was no other noise in the ship than the tread of the solitary watchman at the appointed period of the night a change took place and he who had watched slept while he who had slept watched just as day dawned however paul blunt who was in a deep sleep felt a shake at his shoulder  pardon me cautiously whispered mr sharp i fear we are about to have a most unpleasant interruption to our solitude  heavenly powersnot the arabs  i fear no less but it is still too dark to be certain of the fact if you will rise we can consult on the situation in which we are placed i beg you to be quick  paui blunt had hastily risen on an arm and he now passed a hand over his brow as if to make certain that he was awake he had not undressed himself and in another moment he stood on his feet in the middle of the stateroom  this is too serious to allow of mistake we will not alarm her then we will not give any alarm sir until certain of the calamity  in that i entirely agree with you returned mr sharp who was perfectly calm though evidently distressed i may be mistaken and wish your opinion all on board but us two are in a profound sleep  the other drew on his coat and in a minute both were on deck the day had not yet dawned and the light was scarce sufficient to distinguish objects even near as those on the reef particularly when they were stationary the rocks themselves however were visible in places for the tide was out and most of the upper portion of the ledge was bare the two gentlemen moved cautiously to the bows of the vessel and concealed by the bulwarks mr sharp pointed out to his companion the objects that had given him the alarm  do you see the pointed rock a little to the right of the spot where the kedge is placed he said pointing in the direction that he meant it is now naked and i am quite cenain there was an object on it when i went below that has since moved away  it may have been a seabird for we are so near the day some of them are probably in motion was it large  of the size of a mans head apparently but this is by no means all here farther to the north i distinguished three objects in motion wading in the water near the point where the rocks are never bare  they may have been herons the bird is often found in these low latitudes i believe i can discover nothing  i would to god i may have been mistaken though i do not think i could be so much deceived  paul blunt caught his arm and held it like one who listened intently  heard you that he whispered hurriedly  it sounded like the clanking of iron  looking around the other found a handspike and passing swiftly up the heel of the bowsprit he stood between the knightheads here he bent forward and looked intently towards the lines of chains which lay over the bulwarks as bowfasts of these chains the parts led quite near each other in parallel lines and as the ships moorings were taut they were hanging in merely a slight curve from the rocks or the place where the kedges were laid to a point within thirty feet of the ship these chains were dotted with living beings crawling cautiously upward it was even easy at a second look to perceive that they were men stealthily advancing on their hands and feet  raising the handspike mr blunt struck the chains several violent blows the effect was to cause the whole of the arabsfor it could be no otherssuddenly to cease advancing and to seat themselves astride the chains  this is fearful said mr sharp but we must die rather than permit them to reach the ship  we must stand you here and if they advance strike the chains there is not an instant to lose  paul blunt spoke hurriedly and giving the other the handspike he ran down to the bitts and commenced loosening the chains from their fastenings the arabs heard the clanking of the ironrings as he threw coil after coil on the deck and they did not advance presently two parts yielded together beneath them and then two more these were the signals for a common retreat and mr sharp now plainly counted fifteen human forms as they scrambled back towards the reef some hanging by their arms some half in the water and others lying along the chains as best they might mr blunt having loosened the chains so as to let their bights fall into the sea the ship slowly drifted astern and rode by her cables when this was done the two young men stood together in silence on the forecastle as if each felt that all which had just occurred was some illusion  this is indeed terrible exclaimed paul blunt we have not even a pistol left no means of defencenothing but this narrow belt of water between us and these barbarians no doubt too they have firearms and as soon as it is light they will render it unsafe to remain on deck  mr sharp took the hand of his companion and pressed it fervently god bless you he said in a stifled voice god bless you for even this brief delay but for this happy thought of yours miss effinghamthe otherswe should all have been by this time at the mercy of these remorseless wretches this is not a moment for false pride or pitiful deceptions i think either of us would willingly die to rescue that beautiful and innocent creature from a fate like this which threatens her in common with ourselves  cheerfully would i lay down my life to be assured that she was at this instant safe in a civilized and christian country  these generous young men squeezed each others hands and at that moment no feeling of rivalry or of competition even entered the heart of either both were influenced by a pure and ardent desire to serve the woman they loved and it would be true to say that scarce a thought of any but eve was uppermost in their minds indeed so engrossing was their common care in her behalf so much more terrible than that of any other person did her fate appear on being captured that they forgot for the moment there were others in the ship and others too who might be serviceable in arresting the very calamity they dreaded  they may not be a strong party said paul blunt after a little thought in which case failing of a surprise they may not be able to muster a force sufficient to hazard an open attack until the return of the boats we have god be praised escaped being seized in our sleep and made unconscious victims of so cruel a fate fifteen or twenty will scarcely dare attempt a ship of this size without a perfect knowledge of our feebleness and particularly of our want of arms there is a light gun on board and it is loaded with this too we may hold them at bay by not betraying our weakness let us awake the others for this is not a moment for sleep we are safe at least for an hour or two since without boats they cannot possibly find the means to board us in less than that time  the two young men went below unconsciously treading lightly like those who moved about in the presence of an impending danger paul blunt was in advance and to his great surprise he met eve at the door of the ladies cabin apparently awaiting their approach she was dressed for apprehension and the novelty of their situation had caused her to sleep in most of her clothes and a few moments had sufficed for a hasty adjustment of the toilet miss effingham was pale but a concentration of all her energies seemed to prevent the exhibition of any womanly terror  something is wrong she said trembling in spite of herself and laying her hand unwittingly on the arm of paul blunt i heard the heavy fall of iron on the deck  compose yourself dearest miss effingham compose yourself i entreat you i mean that we have come to awaken the gentlemen  tell me the worst powis i implore you i am equali think i am equal to hearing it  i fear your imagination has exaggerated the danger  the coast  of that there is no cause for apprehension the sea is calm and our fasts are perfectly good  the boats  will doubtless be back in good time  surelysurely said eve recoiling a step as if she saw a monster not the arabs  they cannot enter the ship though a few of them are hovering about us but for the vigilance of mr sharp indeed we might have all been captured in our sleep as it is we have warning and there is now little doubt of our being able to intimidate the few barbarians who have shown themselves until captain truck shall return  then from my soul i thank you sir george templemore and for this good office will you receive the thanks of a father and the prayers of all whom you have so signally served  nay miss effingham although i find this interest in me so grateful that i have hardly the heart to lessen your gratitude truth compels me to give it a juster direction but for the promptitude of mr bluntor as i now find i ought to address him mr powiswe should truly have all been lost  we will not dispute about your merits gentlemen you have both deserved our most heartfelt thanks and if you will awaken my father and mr john effingham i will arouse mademoiselle viefville and my own women surely surely this is no time to sleep  the summons was given at the stateroom doors and the two young men returned to the deck for they felt it was not safe to leave it long at such a moment all was quite tranquil above however nor could the utmost scrutiny now detect the presence of any person on the reef  the rocks are cut off from the shore farther to the southward by deeper water said paul bluntfor we shall continue to call both gentlemen except on particular occasions by their noms de guerreand when the tide is up the place cannot be forded of this the arabs are probably aware and having failed in their first attempt they will probably retire to the beach as the water is rising for they might not like to be left on the riband of rock that will remain in face of the force that would be likely to be found in such a vessel  may they not be acquainted with the absence of most of our people and be bent upon seizing the vessel before they can return  that indeed is the gloomy side of the conjecture and it may possibly be too true but as the day is beginning to break we shall soon learn the worst and anything is better than vague distrust  for some time the two gentlemen paced the quarterdeck together in silence mr sharp was the first to speak  the emotions natural to such an alarm he said have caused miss effingham to betray an incognito of mine that i fear you find sufficiently absurd it was quite accidental i do assure you as much so perhaps as it was motiveless  except as you might distrust american democracy returned paul smiling and feel disposed to propitiate it by a temporary sacrifice of rank and title  i declare you do me injustice my man whose name is sharp had taken the stateroom and finding myself addressed by his appellation i had the weakness to adopt it under the impression it might be convenient in a packet had i anticipated in the least meeting with the effinghams i should not have been guilty of the folly for mr and miss effingham are old acquaintances  while you are thus apologising for a venial offence you forget it is to a man guilty of the same error i knew your person from having seen you on the continent and finding you disposed to go by the homely name of sharp in a moment of thoughtlessness i took its counterpart blunt a travelling name is sometimes convenient though sooner or later i fancy all deceptions bring with them their own punishments  it is certain that falsehood requires to be supported by falsehood having commenced in untruth would it not be expedient to persevere until we reach america i at least cannot now assert a right to my proper name without deposing an usurper  it will be expedient for you certainly if it be only to escape the homage of that doubledistilled democrat mr dodge as for myself few care enough about me to render it a matter of moment how i am styled though on the whole i should prefer to let things stand as they are for reasons i cannot well explain  no more was said on the subject though both understood that the old appellations were to be temporarily continued just as this brief dialogue ended the rest of the party appeared on deck all preserved a forced calmness though the paleness of the ladies betrayed the intense anxiety they felt eve struggled with her fears on account of her father who had trembled so violently when the truth was first told him as to be quite unmanned but who now comported himself with dignity though oppressed with apprehension almost to anguish john effingham was stern and in the bitterness of his first sensations he had muttered a few imprecations on his own folly in suffering himself to be thus caught without arms once the terrible idea of the necessity of sacrificing eve in the last resort as an expedient preferable to captivity had flashed across his mind but the real tenderness he felt for her and his better nature soon banished the unnatural thought still when he joined the party on deck it was with a general but vague impression that the moment was at hand when circumstances had required that they were all to die together no one was more seemingly collected than mademoiselle viefville her life had been one of sacrifices and she had now made up her mind that it was to pass away in a scene of violence and with a species of heroism that is national her feelings had been aroused to a sort of roman firmness and she was prepared to meet her fate with a composure equal to that of the men  these were the first feelings and impressions of those who had been awakened from the security of the night to hear the tale of their danger but they lessened as the party collected in the open air and began to examine into their situation by means of the steadily increasing light as the day advanced paul blunt in particular carefully examined the rocks near the ship even ascending to the foretop from which elevation he overlooked the whole line of the reef and something like hope revived in every bosom when he proclaimed the joyful intelligence that nothing having life was visible in that direction  god be praised he said with fervour as his foot touched the deck again on descending we have at least a respite from the attacks of these barbarians the tide has risen so high that they dare not stay on the rocks lest they might be cut off for they probably think us stronger than we are and armed the light gun on the forecastle is loaded gentlemen though not shotted for there are no shot in the vessel saunders tells me and i would suggest the propriety of firing it both to alarm the arabs and as a signal to our friends the distance from the wreck is not so great but it might be heard and i think they would at least send a boat to our relief sound flies fast and a short time may bring us succour the water will not be low enough for our enemies to venture on the reef again under six or eight hours and all may yet be well  this proposal was discussed and it proving on inquiry that all the powder in the ship after loading the gun for this very purpose of firing a signal had been taken in the boats and that no second discharge could be made it was decided to lose no more time but to let their danger be known to their friends at once if it were possible to send the sound so far when this decision was come to mr blunt aided by mr sharp made the necessary preparations without delay the latter though doing all he could to assist envied the readiness practical skill and intelligence with which his companion a man of cultivated and polished mind in higher things performed every requisite act that was necessary to effect their purpose instead of hastily discharging the piece an iron fourpound gun mr blunt first doubled the wad which he drove home with all his force and then he greased the muzzle as he said to increase the report  i shall not attempt to explain the philosophy of this he added with a mournful smile but all lovers of salutes and salvos will maintain that it is useful and be it so or not too much depends on our making ourselves heard to neglect any thing that has even a chance of aiding that one great object if you will now assist me sir george we will run the gun over to starboard in order that it may be fired on the side next the wreck  judging from the readiness you have shown on several occasions as well as your familiarity with the terms i should think you had served returned the real baronet as he helped his companion to place the gun at a port on the northern side of the vessel  you have not mistaken my trade i was certainly bred almost born a seaman and though as a traveller i have now been many years severed from my early habits little of what i knew has been lost were there five others here who had as much familiarity as myself with vessels i think we could carry the ship outside the reef crippled as she is and set the arabs at defiance would to god our worthy captain had never brought her inside  he did all for the best no doubt  beyond a question and no more than a commendable prudence required still he has left us in a most critical position this priming is a little damp and i distrust it the coal if you please  why do you not fire  at the last moment i almost repent of my own expedient is it quite certain no pistols remain among any of our effects  i fear not saunders reports that all even to those of the smallest size were put in requisition for the boats  the charge in this gun might serve for many pistols or for several fowlingpieces i might even sweep the reef on an emergency by using old iron for shot it appears like parting with a last friend to part with this single precious charge of gunpowder  nay you certainly know best though i rather think the messrs effingham are of your first opinion  it is puerile to waver on such a subject and i will hesitate no longer there are moments when the air seems to float in the direction of our friends on the first return of one of those currents i will fire  a minute brought the opportunity and paul blunt or paul powis as his real name would now appear to be applied the coal the report was sharp and lively but as the smoke floated away he again expressed his doubts of the wisdom of what had just been done had he then known that the struggling sounds had diffused themselves in their radii without reaching the wreck his regrets would have been increased fourfold this was a fact however that could not be then ascertained and those in the packet were compelled to wait two or three hours before they even got the certainty of their failure  as the light increased a view was obtained of the shore which seemed as silent and deserted as the reef for half an hour the whole party experienced the revulsion of feeling that accompanies all great changes of emotion and the conversation had even got to be again cheerful and to turn into its former channels when suddenly a cry from saunders renewed the alarm the steward was preparing the breakfast in the galley from which he gave occasional glances towards the land and his quick eye had been the first to detect a new and still more serious danger that now menaced them  a long train of camels was visible travelling across the desert and holding its way towards the part of the reef which touched the shore at this point too were now to be seen some twenty arabs waiting the arrival of their friends among whom it was fair to conclude were those who had attempted to carry the ship by surprise as the events which next followed were closely connected with the policy and forbearance of the party of barbarians near the wreck this will be a suitable occasion to explain the motives of the latter in not assailing captain truck and the real state of things among these children of the desert  the dane had been driven ashore as conjectured in the last gale and the crew had immediately been captured by a small wandering party of the arabs with whom the coast was then lined as is usually the case immediately after tempestuous weather unable to carry off much of the cargo this party had secured the prisoners and hurried inland to an oasis to give the important intelligence to their friends leaving scouts on the shore however that they might be early apprised of any similar disaster or of any change in the situation of their present prize these scouts had discovered the montauk drifting along the coast dismasted and crippled and they had watched her to her anchorage within the reef the departure of her boats had been witnessed and though unable to foresee the whole object of this expedition the direction taken pointed out the wreck as the point of destination all this of course had been communicated to the chief men of the different parties on the coast of which there were several who had agreed to unite their forces to secure the second ship and then to divide the spoils  when the arabs reached the coast near the wreck that morning the elders among them were not slow in comprehending the motives of the expedition and having gained a pretty accurate idea of the number of men employed about the dane they had come to the just conclusion that few were left in the vessel at anchor they had carried off the spyglass of their prize too and several among them knew its use from having seen similar things in other stranded ships by means of this glass they discovered the number and quality of those on board the montauk as soon as there was sufficient light and directed their own operations accordingly the parties that had appeared and disappeared behind the sandy ridges of the desert about the time at which we have now arrived in the narrative and those who have been already mentioned in a previous chapter were those who came from the interior and those who went in the direction of the reef the first of the latter of which saunders had just discovered owing to the rounded formation of the coast and to the intervention of a headland the distance by water between the two ships was quite double that by land between the two encampments and those who now arrived abreast of the packet deliberately pitched their tents as if they depended more on a display of their numbers for success than on concealment and as if they felt no apprehension of the return of the crew  when the gentlemen had taken a survey of this strong party which numbered more than a hundred they held a consultation of the course it would be necessary to pursue to paul blunt as an avowed seaman and as one who had already shown the promptitude and efficiency of his resources all eyes were turned in expectation of an opinion  so long as the tide keeps in this gentleman observed i see no cause for apprehensions we are beyond the reach of musketry or at all events any fire of the arabs at this distance must be uncertain and harmless and we have always the hope of the arrival of the boats should this fail us and the tide fall this afternoon as low as it fell in the morning our situation will indeed become critical the water around the ship may possibly serve as a temporary protection but the distance to the reef is so small that it might be passed by swimming  surely we could make good the vessel against men raising themselves out of the water and clambering up a vessels side said mr sharp  it is probable we might if unmolested from the shore but imagine twenty or thirty resolute swimmers to put off together for different parts of the vessel protected by the long muskets these arabs carry and you will easily conceive the hopelessness of any defence the first man among us who should show his person to meet the boarders would be shot down like a dog  it was a cruel oversight to expose us to this horrible fate exclaimed the appalled father  this is easier seen now than when the mistake was committed observed john effingham as a seaman and with his important object in view captain truck acted for the best and we should acquit him of all blame let the result be what it may regrets are useless and it remains for us to devise some means to arrest the danger by which we are menaced before it be too late mr blunt you must be our leader and counsellor is it not possible for us to carry the ship outside of the reef and to anchor her beyond the danger of our being boarded  i have thought of this expedient and if we had a boat it might possibly be done in this mild weather without a boat it is impossible  but we have a boat glancing his eye towards the launch that stood in the chocks or chucks  one that would be too unwieldy for our purposes could it be got into the water a thing in itself that would be almost impracticable for us to achieve  a long silence succeeded during which the gentlemen were occupied in the bootless effort of endeavouring to devise expedients to escape the arabs bootless because on such occasions the successful measure is commonly the result of a sort of sudden inspiration rather than of continued and laborious thought     chapter xxii                                with religious awe   grief heard the voice of virtue no complaint   the solemn silence broke tears ceased to flow    glover   hope is the most treacherous of all human fancies so long as there is a plausible ground to expect relief from any particular quarter men will relax their exertions in the face of the most imminent danger and they cling to their expectations long after reason has begun to place the chances of success on the adverse side of the scale thus it was with the party in the montauk two or three precious hours were lost in the idle belief that the gun would be heard by captain truck and that they might momentarily look for the appearance of at least one of the boats  paul blunt was the first to relinquish this delusion he knew that if it reached their friends at all the report must have been heard in a few seconds and he knew also that it peculiarly belonged to the profession of a seaman to come to quick decisions an hour of smart rowing would bring the cutter from the wreck to the headland where it would be visible by means of a glass from the foretop two hours had now passed away and no signs of any boat were to be discovered and the young man felt reluctantly compelled to yield all the strong hopes of timely aid that he had anticipated from this quarter john effingham who had much more energy of character than his kinsman though not more personal fortitude and firmness was watching the movements of their young leader and he read the severe disappointment in his face as he descended the last time from the top where he had often been since the consultation to look out for the expected succour  i see it in your countenance said that gentleman we have nothing to look for from the boats our signal has not been heard  there is no hope and we are now thrown altogether on our own exertions aided by the kind providence of god  this calamity is so sudden and so dire that i can scarcely credit it are we then truly in danger of becoming prisoners to barbarians is eve effingham the beautiful innocent good angelic daughter of my cousin to be their victimperhaps the inmate of a seraglio  there is the pang had i a thousand bodies a thousand lives i could give all of the first to unmitigated suffering lay down all the last to avert so shocking a calamity do you think the ladies are sensible of their real situation  they are uneasy rather than terrified in common with us all they have strong hopes from the boats though the continued arrival of the barbarians who are constantly coming into their camp has helped to render them a little more conscious of the true nature of the danger  here mr sharp who stood on the hurricanehouse called out for the glass in order to ascertain what a party of the arabs who were collected near the inshore end of the reef were about paul blunt went up to him and made the examination his countenance fell as he gazed and an expression like that of hopelessness was again apparent on his fine features when he lowered the glass  here is some new cause of uneasiness  the wretches have got a number of spars and are lashing them together to form a raft they are bent on our capture and i see no means of preventing it  were we alone men only we might have the bitter consolation of selling our lives dearly but it is terrible to have those with us whom we can neither save nor yet devote to a common destruction with our enemies  it is indeed terrible and the helplessness of our situation adds to its misery  can we not offer termsmight not a promise of ransom with hostages do something i would cheerfully remain in the hands of the barbarians in order to effect the release of the rest of the party  mr blunt grasped his hand and for a moment he envied the other the generous thought but smiling bitterly he shook his head as if conscious of the futility of even this desperate selfdevotion  gladly would i be your companion but the project is in every sense impracticable ransom they might consent to receive with us all in their power but not on the condition of our being permitted to depart indeed no means of quitting them would be left for once in possession of the ship as in a few hours they must be captain truck though having the boats will be obliged to surrender for want of food or to run the frightful hazard of attempting to reach the islands on an allowance scarcely sufficient to sustain life under the most favourable circumstances these flinthearted monsters are surrounded by the desolation of their desert and they are aware of all their appalling advantages  the real state of things ought to be communicated to our friends in order that they may be prepared for the worst  to this mr blunt agreed and they went together to inform john effingham of the new discovery this sternminded man was in a manner prepared for the worst and he now agreed on the melancholy propriety of letting his kinsman know the actual nature of the new danger that threatened them  i will undertake this unpleasant office he said though i could in my inmost soul pray that the necessity for it might pass away should the worst arrive i have still hopes of effecting something by means of a ransom but what will have been the fate of the youthful and delicate and lovely ere we can make ourselves even comprehended by the barbarians a journey in the desert as these journeys have been described to me would be almost certain death to all but the strongest of our party and even gold may fail of its usual power when weighed against the evil nature of savages  is there no hope then really left us demanded mr sharp when the last speaker had left them to descend to the cabins is it not possible to get the boat into the water and to make our escape in that  that is an expedient of which i have thought but it is next to impracticable as anything is better than capture however i will make one more close examination of the proceedings of the demons and look nearer into our own means  paul blunt now got a lead and dropped it over the side of the ship in the almost forlorn hope that possibly she might lie over some hole on the bottom the soundings proved to be as indeed he expected but a little more than three fathoms  i had no reason to expect otherwise he said as he drew in the line though he spoke like a disappointed man had there been sufficient water the ship might have been scuttled and the launch would have floated off the deck but as it is we should lose the vessel without a sufficient object it would appear heroic were you and i to contrive to get on the reef and to proceed to the shore with a view to make terms with the arabs but there could be no real use in it as the treachery of their character is too well established to look for any benefit from such a step  might they not be kept in play until our friends returned providence may befriend us in some unexpected manner in our uttermost peril  we will examine them once more with the glass by a movement among the arabs there has probably been a new accession to their numbers  the two gentlemen now ascended to the top of the hurricanehouse again in feverish haste and once more they applied the instrument a minute of close study induced mr blunt to drop the glass with an expression that denoted increased concern  can any thing possibly make our prospects worse eagerly inquired his companion  do you not remember a flag that was on board the danethat by which we identified his nation  certainly it was attached to the halyards and lay on the quarterdeck  that flag is now flying in the camp of these barbarians you may see it here among the tents last pitched by the party that arrived while we were conversing forward  and from this you infer  that our people are captives that flag was in the ship when we left it had the arabs returned before our party got there the captain would have been back long ere this and in order to obtain this ensign they must have obtained possession of the wreck after the arrival of the boats an event that could scarcely occur without a struggle i fear the flag is a proof on which side the victory has fallen  this then would seem to consummate our misfortunes  it does indeed for the faint hope that existed of being relieved by the boats must now be entirely abandoned  in the name of god look again and see in what condition the wretches have got their raft  a long examination followed for on this point did the fate of all in the ship now truly seem to depend  they work with spirit said mr blunt when his examination had continued a long time but it seems less like a raft than beforethey are lashing spars together lengthwisehere is a dawning of hope or what would be hope rather if the boats had escaped their fangs  god bless you for the wordswhat is there encouraging  it is not much returned paul blunt with a mournful smile but trifles become of account in moments of extreme jeopardy they are making a floating stage doubtless with the intention to pass from the reef to the ship and by veering on the chains we may possibly drop astern sufficiently to disappoint them in the length of their bridge if i saw a hope of the final return of the boats this expedient would not be without its use particularly if delayed to the last moment as it might cause the arabs to lose another tide and a reprieve of eight or ten hours is an age to men in our situation  mr sharp caught eagerly at this suggestion and the young men walked the deck together for half an hour discussing its chances and suggesting various means of turning it to the best account still both felt convinced that the trifling delay which might thus be obtained would in the end be perfectly useless should captain truck and his party have really fallen into the hands of the common enemy they were thus engaged sometimes in deep despondency and sometimes buoyant with revived expectations when saunders on the part of mr effingham summoned them below  on reaching the cabin whither both immediately hastened the two gentlemen found the family party in the distress that the circumstances would naturally create mr effingham was seated his daughters head resting on a knee for she had thrown herself on the carpet by his side mademoiselle viefville paced the cabin occasionally stopping to utter a few words of consolation to her young charge and then again reverting in her mind to the true dangers of their situation with a force that completely undid all she had said by betraying the extent of her own apprehensions ann sidley knelt near her young mistress sometimes praying fervently though in silence and at other moments folding her beloved in her arms as if to protect her from the ruffian grasp of the barbarians the femme de chambre was sobbing in a stateroom while john effingham leaned with his arms folded against a bulkhead a picture of stern submission rather than of despair the whole party was now assembled with the exception of the steward whose lamentations throughout the morning had not been noiseless but who was left on deck to watch the movements of the arabs  the moment was not one of idle forms and eve effingham who would have recoiled under other circumstances at being seen by her fellow travellers in her present situation scarce raised her head in acknowledgement of their melancholy salute as they entered she had been weeping and her hair had fallen in profusion around her shoulders the tears fell no longer but a warm flushed look one which denoted that a struggle of the mind had gotten the better of womanly emotions had succeeded to deadly paleness and rendered her loveliness of feature and expression bright and angelic both of the young men thought she had never seemed so beautiful and both felt a secret pang as the conviction forced itself on them at the same instant that this surpassing beauty was now likely to prove her most dangerous enemy  gentlemen said mr effingham with apparent calmness and a dignity that no uneasiness could disturb my kinsman has acquainted us with the hopeless nature of our condition and i have begged the favour of this visit on your own account we cannot separate the ties of blood and affection unite us and our fate must be common but on you there is no such obligation young bold and active some plan may suggest itself by which you may possibly escape the barbarians and at least save yourselves i know that generous temperaments like yours will not be disposed to listen at first to such a suggestion but reflection will tell you that it is for the interest of us all you may let our fate be known earlier than it otherwise would be to those who will take immediate measures to procure our ransoms  this is impossible mr sharp said firmly we can never quit you could never enjoy a moments peace under the consciousness of having been guilty of an act so selfish  mr blunt is silent continued mr effingham after a short pause in which he looked from one of the young men to the other he thinks better of my proposition and will listen to his own best interests  eve raised her head quickly but without being conscious of the anxiety she betrayed and gazed with melancholy intentness at the subject of this remark  i do credit to the generous feelings of mr sharp paul blunt now hurriedly answered and should be sorry to admit that my own first impulses were less disinterested but i confess i have already thought of this and have reflected on all the chances of success or failure it might be practicable for one who can swim easily to reach the reef thence to cross the inlet and possibly to gain the shore under cover of the opposite range of rocks which are higher than those near us after which by following the coast one might communicate with the boats by signal or even go quite to the wreck if necessary all of this i have deliberated on and once i had determined to propose it but  but what demanded eve quickly why not execute this plan and save yourself is it a reason because case is hopeless that you should perish go then at once for the moments are precious an hour hence it may be too late  were it merely to save myself miss effingham do you really think me capable of this baseness  i do not call it baseness why should we draw you down with us in our misery you have already served us powis in a situation of terrible trial and it is not just that you should always devote yourself in behalf of those who seem fated never to do you good my father will tell you he thinks it your duty now to save yourself if possible  i think it the duty of every man mildly resumed mr effingham when no imperious obligation requires otherwise to save the life and liberty which god has bestowed these gentlemen have doubtless ties and claims on them that are independent of us and why should they inflict a pang on those who love them in order to share in our disaster  this is placing useless speculations before a miserable certainty observed john effingham as there can be no hope of reaching the boats it is vain to discuss the propriety of the step  is this true powis is there truly no chance of your escaping you will not deceive usdeceive yourselfon a vain point of empty pride  i can say with truth almost with joy for i thank god i am spared the conflict of judging between my duty and my feelings that there can no longer be any chance of finding the wreck in the possession of our friends returned paul fervently there were moments when i thought the attempt should be made and it would perhaps have properly fallen to my lot to be the adventurer but we have now proof that the arabs are masters and if captain truck has escaped at all it is under circumstances that scarcely admit the possibility of his being near the land the whole coast must be watched and in possession of the barbarians and one passing along it could hardly escape being seen  might you not escape into the interior notwithstanding asked eve impetuously  with what motive to separate myself from those who have been my fellows in misfortune only to die of want or to fall into the hands of another set of masters it is every way our interest to keep together and to let those already on the coast become our captors as the booty of two ships may dispose them to be less exacting with their prisoners  slaves muttered john effingham  his cousin bowed his head over the delicate form of eve which he folded with his arms as if to shield it from the blasts and evils of the desert  as we may be separated immediately on being taken resumed paul blunt it will be well to adopt some common mode of acting and a uniform account of ourselves in order that we may impress the barbarians with the policy of carrying us as soon as possible into the vicinity of mogadore with a view to obtaining a speedy ransom  can any thing be better than the holy truth exclaimed eve no no no let us not deform this chastening act of god by colouring any thought or word with deception  deception in our case will hardly be needed but by understanding those facts which will most probably influence the arabs we may dwell the most on them we cannot do better than by impressing on the minds of our captors the circumstance that this is no common ship a fact their own eyes will corroborate and that we are not mere mariners but passengers who will be likely to reward their forbearance and moderation  i think sir interrupted ann sidley looking up with tearful eyes from the spot where she still knelt that if these people knew how much miss eve is sought and beloved they might be led to respect her as she deserves and this at least would temper the wind to the shorn lamb  poor nanny murmured eve stretching forth a hand towards her old nurse though her face was still buried in her own hair thou wilt soon learn that there is another leveller beside the grave  maam  thou wilt find that eve in the hands of barbarians is not thy eve it will now become my turn to become a handmaiden and to perform for others offices a thousand times more humiliating than any thou hast ever performed for me  such a consummation of their misery had never struck the imagination of the simpleminded ann and she gazed at her child with tender concern as if she distrusted her senses  this is too improbable dear miss eve she said and you will distress your father by talking so wildly the arabs are human beings though they are barbarians and they will never dream of anything so wicked as this  mademoiselle viefville made a rapid and fervent ejaculation in her own language that was keenly expressive of her own sense of misery and ann sidley who always felt uneasiness when anything was said affecting eve that she could not understand looked from one to the other as if she demanded an explanation  im sure mamerzelle cannot think any such thing likely to take place she continued more positively and sir you at least will not permit miss eve to torment herself with any notions as unreasonable as monstrous as this  we are in the hands of god my worthy ann and you may live to see all your fixed ideas of propriety violated returned mr effingham let us pray that we may not be separated for there will at least be a tender consolation in being permitted to share our misery in company should we be torn asunder then indeed will the infliction be one of insupportable agony  and who will think of such a cruelty sir me they cannot separate from miss eve for i am her servant her own longtried faithful attendant who first held her in arms and nursed her when a helpless infant and you too sir you are her father her own beloved revered parent and mr john is he not her kinsman of her blood and name and even mamerzelle also has claims to remain with miss eve for she has taught her many things i dare say that it is good to know oh no no no no one has a right to tear us asunder and no one will have the heart to do it  nanny nanny murmured eve you do not cannot know the cruel arabs  they cannot be crueller and more unforgiving than our own savages maam and they keep the mother with the child and when they spare life they take the prisoners into their huts and treat them as they treat their own god has caused so many of the wicked to perish for their sins in these eastern lands that i do not think a man can be left that is wretch enough to harm one like miss eve take courage then sir and put your trust in his holy providence i know the trial is hard to a tender fathers heart but should their customs require them to keep the men and women asunder and to separate you from your daughter for a short time remember that i shall be with her as i was in her childhood when by the mercy of god we carried her through so many mortal diseases in safety and have got her in the pride of her youth without a blemish or a defect the perfect creature she is  if the world had no other tenants but such as you devoted and simplehearted woman there would indeed be little cause for apprehension for you are equally unable to imagine wrong yourself or to conceive it in others it would remove a mountain from my heart could i indeed believe that even you will be permitted to remain near this dependent and fragile girl during the months of suffering and anguish that are likely to occur  father said eve hurriedly drying her eyes and rising to her feet with a motion so easy and an effort so slight that it appeared like the power of mere volitionthe superiority of the spirit over her light framefather do not let a thought of me distress you at this awful moment you have known me only in happiness and prosperityan indulged and indolent girl but i feel a force which is capable of sustaining me even in this blank desert the arabs can have no other motive than to preserve us all as captives likely to repay their care with a rich ransom i know that a journey according to their habits will be painful and arduous but it may be borne trust then more to my spirit than to my feeble body and you will find that i am not as worthless as i fear you fancy  mr effingham passed his arm round the slender waist of his child and folded her almost frantically to his bosom but eve was aroused and gently extricating herself with bright tearless eyes she looked round at her companions as if she would reverse the order of their sympathies and drive them to their own wants and hazards  i know you think me the most exposed by this dreadful disaster she said that i may not be able to bear up against the probable suffering and that i shall sink first because i am the feeblest and frailest in frame but god permits the reed to bend when the oak is destroyed i am stronger able to bear more than you imagine and we shall all live to meet again in happier scenes should it be our present hard fortune to be separated  as eve spoke she cast affectionate looks on those dear to her by habit and blood and services nor did she permit an unnecessary reserve at such a moment to prevent glances of friendly interest towards the two young men whose very souls seemed wrapped in her movements words of encouragement from such a source however only served to set the frightful truth more vividly before the minds of her auditors and not one of them heard what she said who did not feel an awful presentiment that a few weeks of the suffering of which she made so light did she even escape a crueller fate would consign that form now so winning and lovely to the sands mr effingham now rose and for the first time the flood of sensations that had been so long gathering in his bosom seemed ready to burst through the restraints of manhood struggling to command himself he turned to his two young male companions and spoke with an impressiveness and dignity that carried with them a double force from the fact of his ordinary manners being so tempered and calm  gentlemen he said we may serve each other by coming to an understanding in time or at least you may confer on me a favour that a life of gratitude would not repay you are young and vigorous bold and intelligent qualities that will command the respect of even savages the chances that one of you will survive to reach a christian land are much greater than those of a man of my years borne down as i shall be with the neverdying anxieties of a parent  father father  hush darling let me entreat these gentlemen to bear us in mind should they reach a place of safety for after all youth may do that in your behalf which time will deny to john and myself money will be of no account you know to rescue my child from a fate far worse than death and it may be some consolation to you young men to recollect at the close of your own careers which i trust will yet be long and happy that a parent in his last moments found a consolation in the justifiable hopes he had placed on your generous exertions  father i cannot bear this for you to be the victim of these barbarians is too much and i would prefer trusting all to a raft on the terrible ocean to incurring the smallest chance of such a calamity mademoiselle you will join me in the entreaty to the gentlemen to prepare a few planks to receive us where we can perish together and at least have the consolation of knowing that our eyes will be closed by friends the longest survivor will be surrounded and supported by the spirits of those who have gone before into a world devoid of care  i have thought this from the first returned mademoiselle viefville in french with an energy of manner that betokened a high and resolved character i would not expose gentlewomen to the insults and outrages of barbarians but did not wish to make a proposition that the feelings of others might reject  it is a thousand times preferable to capture if indeed it be practicable said john effingham looking inquiringly towards paul the latter however shook his head in the negative for the wind blowing on shore he knew it would be merely meeting captivity without the appearance of a selfreliance and dignity that might serve to impress their captors favourably  it is impossible said eve reading the meaning of the glances and dropping on her knees before mr effingham well then may our trust be in god we have yet a few minutes of liberty and let them not be wasted idly in vain regrets father kiss me and give me once more that holy and cherished blessing with which you used to consign me to sleep in those days when we scarce dreamed of never realised misfortune  bless you bless you my babe my beloved my cherished eve said the father solemnly but with a quivering lip may that dread being whose ways though mysterious are perfect wisdom and mercy sustain you in this trial and bring you at last spotless in spirit and person to his own mansions of peace god took from me early thy sainted mother and i had impiously trusted in the hope that thou wert left to be my solace in age bless you my eve i shall pray god without ceasing that thou mayest pass away as pure and as worthy of his love as her to whom thou owest thy being  john effingham groaned the effort he made to repress his feelings causing the outbreaking of his soul to be deep though smothered  father let us pray together ann my good ann thou who first taught me to lisp a thanksgiving and a request kneel here by my sideand you too mademoiselle though of a different creed we have a common god cousin john you pray often i know though so little apt to show your emotions there is a place for you too with those of your blood i know not whether these gentlemen are too proud to pray  both the young men knelt with the others and there was a long pause in which the whole party put up their supplications each according to his or her habits of thought  father resumed eve looking up as she still knelt between the knees of mr effingham and smiling fondly in the face of him she so piously loved there is one precious hope of which even the barbarians cannot rob us we may be separated here but our final meeting rests only with god  mademoiselle viefville passed an arm round the waist of her sweet pupil and pressed her against her heart  there is but one abode for the blessed my dear mademoiselle and one expiation for us all then rising from her knees eve said with the grace and dignity of a gentlewoman cousin jack kiss me we know not when another occasion may offer to manifest to each other our mutual regard you have been a dear and an indulgent kinsman to me and should i live these twenty years a slave i shall not cease to think of you with kindness and regret  john effingham folded the beautiful and ardent girl in his arms with the freedom and fondness of a parent  gentlemen continued eve with a deepening colour but eyes that were kind and grateful i thank you too for lending your supplications to ours i know that young men in the pride of their security seldom fancy such a dependence on god necessary but the strongest are overturned and pride is a poor substitute for the hope of the meek i believe you have thought better of me than i merit and i should never cease to reproach myself with a want of consideration did i believe that any thing more than accident has brought you into this illfated vessel will you permit me to add one more obligation to the many i feel to you both advancing nearer to them and speaking lower you are young and likely to endure bodily exposure better than my fatherthat we shall be separated i feel persuadedand it might be in your power to solace a heartbroken parenti see i know i may depend on your good offices  evemy blessed daughtermy only my beloved child exclaimed mr effingham who overheard her lowest syllable so deathlike was the stillness of the cabincome to me dearest no power on earth shall ever tear us asunder  eve turned quickly and beheld the arms of her parent extended she threw herself into them when the pent and irresistible emotions broke loose in both for they wept together as she lay on his bosom with a violence that in a man it was awfully painful to witness  mr sharp had advanced to take the offered hand of eve when she suddenly left him for the purpose just mentioned and he now felt the grasp of pauls fingers on his arm as if they were about to penetrate the bone fearful of betraying the extent of their feelings the two young men rushed on deck together where they paced backward and forward for many minutes quite unable to exchange a word or even a look     chapter xxiii      o domine deus speravi in te   o care mi jesu nune libera me       in durâ catenâ       in miserâ poenâ           desidero te       languendo gemendo       et genuflectendo   adora imploro ut liberes me    queen mary   the sublime consolations of religion were little felt by either of the two generousminded and ardent young men who were pacing the deck of the montauk the gentle and the plastic admit the most readily of the divine influence and of all on board the devoted vessel at that moment they who were the most resigned to their fate were those who by their physical force were the least able to endure it  this heavenly resignation said mr sharp half whispering is even more heartrending than the outbreakings of despair  it is frightful returned his companion any thing is better than passive submission in such circumstances i see but little indeed no hope of escape but idleness is torture if i endeavour to raise this boat will you aid me  command me like your slave would to heaven there were the faintest prospects of success  there is but little and should we even succeed there are no means of getting far from the ship in the launch as all the oars have been carried off by the captain and i can hear of neither masts nor sails had we the latter with this wind which is beginning to blow we might indeed prolong the uncertainty by getting on some of those more distant spits of sand  then in the name of the blessed maria exclaimed one behind them in french delay not an instant and all on board will join in the labour  the gentlemen turned in surprise and beheld mademoiselle viefville standing so near them as to have overheard their conversation accustomed to depend on herself coming of a people among whom woman is more energetic and useful perhaps than in any other christian nation and resolute of spirit naturally this cultivated and generous female had come on deck purposely to see if indeed there remained no means by which they might yet escape the arabs had her knowledge of a vessel at all equalled her resolution it is probable that many fruitless expedients would already have been adopted but finding herself in a situation so completely novel as that of a ship until now she had found no occasion to suggest any thing to which her companions would be likely to lend themselves but seizing the hint of paul she pressed it on him with ardour and after a few minutes of urging by her zeal and persuasion she prevailed on the two gentlemen to commence the necessary preparations without further delay john effingham and saunders were immediately summoned by mademoiselle viefville herself who once engaged in the undertaking pursued it fervently while she went in person into the cabins to make the necessary preparations connected with their subsistence and comforts should they actually succeed in quitting the vessel  no experienced mariner could set about the work with more discretion or with a better knowledge of what was necessary to be done than mr blunt now showed saunders was directed to clear the launch which had a roof on it and still contained a respectable provision of poultry sheep and pigs the roof he was told not to disturb since it might answer as a substitute for a deck but everything was passed rapidly from the inside of the boat which the steward commenced scrubbing and cleaning with an assiduity that he seldom manifested in his cabins fortunately the tackles with which mr leach had raised the sheers and stepped the jurymast the previous morning were still lying on the deck and paul was spared the labour of reeving new ones he went to work therefore to get up two on the substitute for a mainstay a job that he had completed through the aid of the two gentlemen on deck by the time saunders pronounced the boat to be in a fit condition to receive its cargo the gripes were now loosened and the fall of one of the tackles was led to the capstan  by this time mademoiselle viefville by her energy and decision had so far aroused eve and her woman that mr effingham had left his daughter and appeared on deck among those who were assisting paul so intense was the interest however which all took in the result that the ladies and even ann sidley with the femme de chambre suspended their own efforts and stood clustering around the capstan as the gentlemen began to heave almost breathless between their doubts and hopes for it was a matter of serious question whether there was sufficient force to lift so heavy a body at all turn after turn was made the fall gradually tightening until those at the bars felt the full strain of their utmost force  heave together gentlemen said paul blunt who directed every thing besides doing so much with his own hands we have its weight now and all we gain is so much towards lifting the boat  a steady effort was continued for two or three minutes with but little sensible advantage when all stopped far breath  i fear it will surpass our strength observed mr sharp the boat seems not to have moved and the ropes are stretched in a way to menace parting  we want but the force of a boy added to our own said paul looking doubtingly towards the females in such cases a pound counts for a ton  allons cried mademoiselle viefville motioning to the femme de chambre to follow we will not be defeated for the want of such a trifle  these two resolute women applied their strength to the bars and the power which had been so equally balanced preponderated in favour of the machine the capstan which a moment before was scarcely seen to turn and that only by short and violent efforts now moved steadily but slowly round and the end of the launch rose eve was only prevented from joining the labourers by nanny who held her folded in her arms fearful that some accident might occur to injure her  paul blunt now cheerfully announced the certainty that they had a force sufficient to raise the boat though the operation would still be long and laborious we say cheerfully for while this almost unhopedfor success promised little relief in the end there is always something buoyant and encouraging in success of any sort  we are masters of the boat he said provided the arabs do not molest us and we may drift away by means of some contrivance of a sail to such a distance as will keep us out of their power until all chance of seeing our friends again is finally lost  this then is a blessed relief exclaimed mr effingham and god may yet avert from us the bitterest portion of this calamity  the pent emotions again flowed and eve once more wept in her fathers arms a species of holy joy mingling with her tears in the mean time paul having secured the fall by which they had just been heaving brought the other to the capstan when the operation was renewed with the same success in this manner in the course of half an hour the launch hung suspended from the stay at a sufficient height to apply the yardtackles as the latter however were not aloft paul having deemed it wise to ascertain their ability to lift the boat at all before he threw away so much toil the females renewed their preparations in the cabins while the gentlemen assisted the young sailor in getting up the purchases during this pause in the heaving saunders was sent below to search for sails and masts both of which paul thought must be somewhere in the ship as he found the launch was fitted to receive them  it was apparent in the mean time that the arabs watched their proceedings narrowly for the moment paul appeared on the yard a great movement took place among them and several muskets were discharged in the direction of the ship though the distance rendered the fire harmless the gentlemen observed with concern however that the balls passed the vessel a fearful proof of the extraordinary power of the arms used by these barbarians luckily the reef which by this time was nearly bare ahead of the ship was still covered in a few places nearer to the shore to a depth that forbade a passage except by swimming john effingham however who was examining the proceedings of the arabs with a glass announced that a party appeared disposed to get on the naked rocks nearest the ship as they had left the shore dragging some light spars after them with which they seemed to be about to bridge the different spots of deep water most of which were sufficiently narrow to admit of being passed in this manner  although the operation commenced by the arabs would necessarily consume a good deal of time this intelligence quickened the movements of all in the ship saunders in particular who had returned to report his want of success worked with redoubled zeal for as is usual with those who are the least fortified by reason he felt the greatest horror of falling into the hands of barbarians it was a slow and laborious thing notwithstanding to get upon the yards the heavy blocks and falls and had not paul blunt been quite as conspicuous for personal strength as he was ready and expert in a knowledge of his profession he would not have succeeded in the unaided effortunaided aloft though the others of course relieved him much by working at the whips on deck at length this important arrangement was effected the young man descended and the capstan was again manned  this time the females were not required it being in the power of the gentlemen to heave the launch out to the side of the ship paul managing the different falls so adroitly that the heavy boat was brought so near and yet so much above the rail as to promise to clear it john effingham now stood at one of the staytackle falls and paul at the other when the latter made a signal to ease away the launch settled slowly towards the side of the vessel until it reached the rail against which it lodged catching a turn with his fall mr blunt sprang forward and bending beneath the boat he saw that its keel had hit a belayingpin one blow from a capstanbar cleared away this obstruction and the boat swung off the staytackle falls were let go entirely and all on board saw with an exultation that words can scarcely describe the important craft suspended directly over the sea no music ever sounded more sweetly to the listeners than the first plash of the massive boat as it fell heavily upon the surface of the water its size its roof and its great strength gave it an appearance of security that for the moment deceived them all for in contemplating the advantage they had so unexpectedly gained they forgot the many obstacles that existed to their availing themselves of it  it was not many minutes before paul was on the roof of the launch had loosened the tackles and had breasted the boat to at the side of the ship in readiness to receive the stores that the females had collected in order that the reader may better understand the nature of the ark that was about to receive those who remained in the montauk however it may be well to describe it  the boat itself was large strong and capable of resisting a heavy sea when well managed and of course unwieldy in proportion to pull it at a moderate rate eight or ten large oars were necessary whereas all the search of the gentlemen could not find one they succeeded however in discovering a rudder and tiller appliances not always used in launches and paul blunt shipped them instantly around the gunwales of the boat stanchions which sustained a slightlyrounded roof were fitted a provision that it is usual to make in the packets in order to protect the stock they carry against the weather this stock having been turned loose on the deck and the interior cleaned the latter now presented a snug and respectable cabin one coarse and cramped compared with those of the ship certainly but on the other hand one that might be well deemed a palace by shipwrecked mariners as it would be possible to retain this roof until compelled by bad weather to throw it away paul who had never before seen a boat afloat with such a canopy regarded it with delight for it promised a protection to that delicate form he so much cherished in his inmost heart that he had not even dared to hope for between the roof and the gunwale of the boat shutters buttoned in so as to fill the entire space and when these were in their places the whole of the interior formed an enclosed apartment of a height sufficient to allow even a man to stand erect without his hat it is true this arrangement rendered the boat clumsy and to a certain extent topheavy and unmanageable but so long as it could be retained it also rendered it infinitely more comfortable than it could possibly be without it the roof moreover might be cut away in five minutes at any time should circumstances require it  paul had just completed a hasty survey of his treasure for such he now began to consider the launch when casting his eye upward with the intention to mount the ships side he saw eve looking down at him as if to read their fate in the expression of his own countenance  the arabs she hurriedly remarked are moving along the reef as my father says faster than he could wish and all our hopes are centred in you and the boat the first i know will not fail us so long as means allow but can we do anything with the launch  for the first time dearest miss effingham i see a little chance of rescuing ourselves from the grasp of these barbarians there is no time to lose but everything must be passed into the boat with as little delay as possible  bless you bless you powis for this gleam of hope your words are cordials and our lives can scarcely serve to prove the gratitude we owe you  this was said naturally and as one expresses a strong feeling without reflection or much weighing of words but even at that fearful moment it thrilled on every pulse of the young man the ardent look that he gave the beautiful girl caused her to redden to the temples and she hastily withdrew  the gentlemen now began to pass into the boat the different things that had been provided principally by the foresight of mademoiselle viefville where they were received by paul who thrust them beneath the roof without stopping to lose the precious moments in stowage they included mattresses the trunks that contained their ordinary seaattire or those that were not stowed in the baggageroom blankets counterpanes potted meats bread wine various condiments and prepared food from the stores of saunders and generally such things as had presented themselves in the hurry of the moment nearly half of the articles were rejected by paul as unnecessary though he received many in consideration of the delicacy of his feebler companions which would otherwise have been cast aside when he found however that food enough had been passed into the boat to supply the wants of the whole party for several weeks he solicited a truce declaring it indiscreet to render themselves uselessly uncomfortable in this manner to say nothing of the effect on the boat the great requisite water was still wanting and he now desired that the two domestics might get into the boat to arrange the different articles while he endeavoured to find something that might serve as a substitute for sails and obtain the allimportant supply  his attention was first given to the water without which all the other preparations would be rendered totally useless before setting about this however he stole a moment to look into the state of things among the arabs it was indeed time for the tide had now fallen so low as to leave the rocks nearly bare and several hundreds of the barbarians were advancing along the reef towing their bridge the slow progress of which alone prevented them from coming up at once to the point opposite the ship paul saw there was not a moment to lose and calling saunders he hurried below  three or four small casks were soon found when the steward brought them to the tank to be filled luckily the water had not to be pumped off but it ran in a stream into the vessel that was placed to receive it as soon as one cask was ready it was carried on deck by the gentlemen and was struck into the boat with as little delay as possible the shouts of the arabs now became audible even to those who were below and it required great steadiness of nerve to continue the allimportant preparation at length the last of the casks was filled when paul rushed on deck for by this time the cries of the barbarians proclaimed their presence near the ship when he reached the rail he found the reef covered with them some hailing the vessel others menacing hundreds still busied with their floating bridge while a few endeavoured to frighten those on board by discharging their muskets over their heads happily aim was impossible so long as care was taken not to expose the body above the bulwarks  we have not a moment to lose cried mr effingham on whose bosom eve lay nearly incapable of motion the food and water are in the boat and in the name of a merciful god let us escape from this scene of frightful barbarity  the danger is not yet so inevitable returned paul steadily frightful and pressing as it truly seems we have a few minutes to think in let me entreat that miss effingham and mademoiselle viefville will receive a drop of this cordial  he poured into a glass a restorative from a bottle that had been left on the capstan as superfluous in the confusion of providing stores and held it to the pallid lips of eve as she swallowed a mouthful nearly as helpless as the infant that receives nourishment from the hand of its nurse the blood returned and raising herself from her fathers arms she smiled though with an effort and thanked him for his care  it was a dread moment she said passing a hand over her brow but it is past and i am better mademoiselle viefville will be obliged to you also for a little of this  the firmminded and spirited frenchwoman though pale as death and evidently suffering under extreme apprehension put aside the glass courteously declining its contents  we are sixty fathoms from the rocks said paul calmly and they must cross this ditch yet to reach us none of them seem disposed to attempt it by swimming and their bridge though ingeniously put together may not prove long enough  would it be safe for the ladies to get into the boat where she lies exposed as they would be to the muskets of the arabs inquired mr sharp  all that shall be remedied returned paul i cannot quit the deck would you slightly bowing to mr sharp go below again with saunders and look for some light sail without one we cannot move away from the ship even when in the boat i see a suitable spar and necessary rigging on deck but the canvas must be looked for in the sailroom it is a nervous thing i confess to be below at such a moment but you have too much faith in us to dread being deserted  mr sharp grasped the hand as a pledge of a perfect reliance on the others faith but he could not speak calling saunders the steward received his instructions when the two went hastily below  i could wish the ladies were in the boat with their women said paul for ann sidley and the femme de chambre were still in the launch busied in disposing of its mixed cargo of stores though concealed from the arabs by the roof and shutters but it would be hazardous to attempt it while exposed to the fire from the reef we shall have to change the position of the ship in the end and it may as well be done at once  beckoning to john effingham to follow he went forward to examine into the movements of the arabs once more before he took any decided step the two gentlemen placed themselves behind the high defences of the forecastle where they had a fair opportunity of reconnoitring their assailants the greater height of the ships deck completely concealing all that had passed on it from the sight of those on the rocks  the barbarians who seemed to be and who in truth were fully apprised of the defenceless and feeble condition of the party on board were at work without the smallest apprehension of receiving any injury from that quarter their great object was to get possession of the ship before the returning water should again drive them from the rocks in order to effect this they had placed all who were willing and sufficiently subordinate on the bridge though a hundred were idle shouting clapping their hands menacing and occasionally discharging a musket of which there were probably fifty in their possession  they work with judgment at their pontoon said paul after he had examined the proceedings of those on the reef for a few minutes you may perceive that they have dragged the outer end of the bridge up to windward and have just shoved it from the rocks with the intention to permit it to drift round until it shall bring up against the bows of the ship when they will pour on board like so many tigers it is a disjointed and loose contrivance that the least sea would derange but in this perfectly smooth water it will answer their purpose it moves slowly but will surely drift round upon us in the course of fifteen or twenty minutes more and of this they appear to be quite certain themselves for they seem as well satisfied with their work as if already assured of its complete success  it is then important to us to be prompt since our time will be so brief  we will be prompt but in another mode if you will assist me a little i think this effort at least may be easily defeated after which it will be time enough to think of escape  paul aided by john effingham now loosened the chains altogether from the bitts and suffered the ship to drop astern as this was done silently and stealthily it occupied several minutes but the wind being by this time fresh the huge mass yielded to its power with certainty and when the bridge had floated round in a direct line from the reef or dead to leeward there was a space of water between its end and the ship of more than a hundred feet the arabs had rushed on it in readiness to board but they set up a yell of disappointment as soon as the truth was discovered a tumult followed several fell from the wet and slippery spars but after a short time wasted in confusion and clamour the directions of their chiefs were obeyed and they set to work with energy to break up their bridge in order to convert its materials into a raft  by this time mr sharp and saunders had returned bringing with them several light sails such as spare royals and topgallant studdingsails paul next ordered a spare mizzentopgallant mast with a topgallant studdingsail boom and a quantity of light rope to be laid in the gangway after which he set about the final step as time now pressed in earnest the arabs working rapidly and with increasing shouts he called upon all the gentlemen for assistance giving such directions as should enable them to work with intelligence  bear a hand saunders he said having taken the steward forward with him as one more accustomed to ships than the others bear a hand my fine fellow and light up this chain ten minutes just now are of more value than a year at another time  tis awful mr blunt sirwerry awful i do confirm returned the steward blubbering and wiping his eyes between the drags at the chains such a fate to befall such cabins sirand the crockery of the werry best quality out of london or new york had i diwined such an issue for the montauk sir i never would have counselled captain truck to lay in half the stores we did and most essentially not the new lots of vines oh sir it is truly awful to have such a calamity wisit so much elegant preparation  forget it all my fine fellow and light up the chain hashe touches abaft ten or fifteen fathoms more will answer  ive paid great dewotion to the silver mr blunt sir for its all in the launch even to the broken mustardspoon and i do hope if captain trucks soul is permitted to superintend the pantry any longer it will be quite beatified and encouraged with my prudence and oversight i left all the rest of the table furniture sir though i suppose these musclemen will not have much use for any but the oysterknives as i am informed they eat with their fingers i declare it is quite oppressive and unhuman to have such wagabonds rummaging ones lockers  rouse away my man and light up the ship has caught the breeze on her larboard bow and begins to take the chain more freely remember that precious beings depend on us for safety  ay ay sir light up it is i feel quite a concern for the ladies sir and more especially for the stores we abandon to the underwriters a betterfound ship never came out of st catherines docks or the east river particularly in the pantry department and i wonder what these wretches will do with her they will be quite abashed with her conveniences sir and unable to enjoy them poor toast too he will have a monstrous unpleasant time with the musclemen for he never eats fish and has quite a genteel and ameliorated way with him i shouldnt wonder if he forgot all i have taken so much pains to teach him sir unless hes dead in which case it will be of no use to him in another world  that will do interrupted paul ceasing his labour the ship is aground from forward aft we will now hurry the spars and sails into the boat and let the ladies get into her  in order that the reader may better understand the present situation of the ship it may be necessary to explain what mr powis and the steward had been doing all this time by paying out the chains the ship had fallen farther astern until she took the ground abaft on the edge of the sandbank so often mentioned and once fast at that end her bows had fallen off pressed by the wind as long as the depth of the water would allow she now lay aground forward and aft with her starboard side to the reef and the launch between the vessel and the naked sands was completely covered from the observations and assaults of the barbarians by the former  eve mademoiselle viefville and mr effingham now got into the launch while the others still remained in the ship to complete the preparations  they get on fast with their raft said paul while he both worked himself and directed the labour of the others though we shall be safe here until they actually quit the rocks their spars will be certain to float down upon the ship but the movement will necessarily be slow as the water is too deep to admit of setting even if they had poles of which i see none throw these spare sails on the roof of the launch saunders they may be wanted before we reach a port should god protect us long enough to effect so much pass two compasses also into the boat with all the carpenters tools that have been collected  while giving these orders paul was busied in sawing off the larger end of the polemizzentopgallantmast to convert it into a spar for the launch this was done by the time he ceased speaking a step was made and jumping down on the roof of the boat he cut out a hole to receive it at a spot he had previously marked for that purpose by the time he had done the spar was ready to be entered and in another minute they had the satisfaction of seeing a very sufficient mast in its place a royal was also stretched to its yard and halyards tack and sheet being bent everything was ready to run up a sail at a moments warning as this supplied the means of motion the gentlemen began to breathe more freely and to bethink them of those minor comforts and essentials that in the hurry of such a scene would be likely to be overlooked after a few more busy minutes all was pronounced to be ready and john effingham began seriously to urge the party to quit the ship but paul still hesitated he strained his eyes in the direction of the wreck in the vain hope of yet receiving succour from that quarter but of course uselessly as it was about the time when captain truck was warping off with his raft in order to obtain an offing just at this moment a party of twenty arabs got upon the spars which they had brought together into a single body and began to drift down slowly upon the ship  paul cast a look about him to see if anything else that was useful could be found and his eyes fell upon the gun it struck him that it might be made serviceable as a scarecrow in forcing their way through the inlet and he determined to lodge it on the roof of the launch for the present at least and to throw it overboard as soon as they got into rough water if indeed they should be so fortunate as to get outside of the reef at all the stay and yard tackles offered the necessary facilities and he instantly slung the piece a few rounds of the capstan lifted it from the deck a few more bore it clear of the side and then it was easily lowered on the roof saunders being sent into the boat to set up a stanchion beneath in order that its weight might do no injury  the gentlemen at last got into the launch with the exception of paul who still lingered in the ship watching the progress of the arabs and making his calculations for the future  it required great steadiness of nerve perfect selfreliance and an entire confidence in his resources and knowledge for one to remain a passive spectator of the slow drift of the raft while it gradually settled down on the ship as it approached paul was seen by those on it and with the usual duplicity of barbarians they made signs of amity and encouragement these signs did not deceive the young man however who only remained to be a close observer of their conduct thinking some useful hint might thus be obtained though his calmness so far imposed on the arabs that they even made signs to him to throw them a rope believing it now time to depart he answered the signal favourably and disappeared from their sight  even in descending to the boat this trained and cool young seaman betrayed no haste his movements were quick and everything was done with readiness and knowledge certainly but no confusion or trepidation occasioned the loss of a moment he hoisted the sail brought down the tack and then descended beneath the roof having first hauled in the painter and given the boat a long and vigorous shove to force it from the side of the vessel by this last expedient he at once placed thirty feet of water between the boat and the montauk a space that the arabs had no means of overcoming as soon as he was beneath the roof the sheet was hauled in and paul seized the tiller which had been made by means of a narrow cut in the boards to play in one of the shutters mr sharp took a position in the bows where he could see the sands and channels through the crevices directing the other how to steer and just as a shout announced the arrival of the raft at the other side of the ship the flap of their sail gave those in the boat the welcome intelligence that they had got so far from her cover as to feel the force of the wind     chapter xxiv      speed gallant bark richer cargo is thine   than brazilian gem or peruvian mine   and the treasures thou bearest thy destiny wait   for they if thou perish must share in thy fate    park   the departure of the boat was excellently timed had it left the side of the ship while the arabs on the raft were unoccupied and at a little distance it would have been exposed to their fire for at least a dozen of those who boarded had muskets whereas the boat now glided away to leeward while they were busy in getting up her side or were so near the ship as not to be able to see the launch at all when paul powis who was looking astern through a crevice saw the first arab on the deck of the montauk the launch was already near a cables length from her running with a fresh and free wind into one of the numerous little channels that intersected the naked banks of sand the unusual construction of the boat with its enclosed roof and the circumstance that no one was visible on board her had the effect to keep the barbarians passive until distance put her beyond the reach of danger a few muskets were discharged but they were fired at random and in the bravado of a semisavage state of feeling  paul kept the launch running off free until he was near a mile from the ship when finding he was approaching the reef to the northward and eastward and that a favourable sandbank lay a short distance ahead he put down the helm let the sheet fly and the boats forefoot shot upon the sands by a little management the launch was got broadside to the bank the water being sufficiently deep and when it was secured the females were enabled to land through the opening of a shutter  the change from the apparent hopelessness of their situation was so great as to render the whole party comparatively happy paul and john effingham united in affirming it would be quite possible to reach one of the islands to leeward in so good a boat and that they ought to deem themselves fortunate under the circumstances in being the masters of a little bark so well found in every essential eve and mademoiselle viefville who had fervently returned their thanks to the great ruler of events while in the boat walked about the hard sand with even a sense of enjoyment and smiles began again to brighten the beautiful features of the first mr effingham declared with a grateful heart that in no park or garden had he ever before met with a promenade that seemed so delightful as this spot of naked and moistened sand on the sterile coast of the great desert its charm was its security for its distance from every point that could be approached by the arabs rendered it in their eyes a paradise  paul powis however though he maintained a cheerful air and the knowledge that he had been so instrumental in saving the party lightened his heart of a load and disposed him even to gaiety was not without some lingering remains of uneasiness he remembered the boats of the dane and as he thought it more than probable captain truck had fallen into the hands of the barbarians he feared that the latter might yet find the means to lay hands on themselves while he was at work fitting the rigging and preparing a jigger with a view to render the launch more manageable he cast frequent uneasy glances to the northward with a feverish apprehension that one of the solongwishedfor boats might at length appear their friends he no longer expected but his fears were all directed towards the premature arrival of enemies from that quarter none appeared however and saunders actually lighted a fire on the bank and prepared the grateful refreshment of tea for the whole party none of which had tasted food since morning though it was now drawing near night  our caterers said paul smiling as he cast his eyes over the repast which ann sidley had spread on the roof of the boat where they were all seated on stools boxes and trunks our caterers have been of the gentler sex as any one may see for we have delicacies that are fitter for a banquet than a desert  i thought miss eve would relish them sir nanny meekly excused herself by saying she is not much accustomed to a coarse diet and mamerzelle too likes niceties as i believe is the case with all of french extraction  eves eyes glistened though she felt it necessary to say something by way of apology  poor ann has been so long accustomed to humour the caprices of a petted girl she said that i fear those who will have occasion for all their strength may be the sufferers i should regret it for ever mr powis if you who are every way of so much importance to us should not find the food you required  i have very inadvertently and unwittingly drawn down upon myself the suspicion of being one of mr mondays gourmets a plain roast and boiled person the young man answered laughingly when it was merely my desire to express the pleasure i had in perceiving that those whose comfort and ease are of more account than any thing else have been so well cared for i could almost starve with satisfaction miss effingham if i saw you free from suffering under the extraordinary circumstances in which we are placed  eve looked grateful and the emotion excited by this speech restored all that beauty which had so lately been chilled by fear  did i not hear a dialogue between you and mr saunders touching the merits of sundry stores that had been left in the ship asked john effingham turning to paul by way of relieving his cousins distress  indeed you might he relieved the time we were rousing at the chains with a beautiful jeremiad on the calamities of the lockers i fancy steward that you consider the misfortunes of the pantry as the heaviest disaster that has befallen the montauk  saunders seldom smiled in this particular he resembled captain truck the one subduing all light emotions from an inveterate habit of serious comicality and the responsibility of command and the other having lost most of his disposition to merriment as the carthorse loses his propensity to kick from being overworked the steward moreover had taken up the conceit that it was indicative of a nigger to be merry and between dignity a proper regard to his colourwhich was about halfway between that of a gold coast importation and a riceplantation overseer down with the fever in his third seasonand dodged submission to unmitigated calls on his time the prevailing character of the poor fellows physiognomy was that of a dolorous sentimentality he believed himself to be materially refined by having had so much intimate communication with gentlemen and ladies suffering under seasickness and he knew that no man in the ship could use language like that he had always at his fingers ends while so strongly addicted to melancholy therefore he was fond of hearing himself talk and palpably encouraged as he had now been by john effingham and paul and a little emboldened by the familiarity of a shipwreck he did not hesitate about mingling in the discourse though holding the effinghams habitually in awe  i esteem it a great privilege ladies and gentlemen he observed as soon as paul ceased to have the honour of being wracked for so the steward in conformity with the doric of the forecastle pronounced the word in such company i should deem it a disgrace to be cast away in some society i could name although i will predicate as we say in america nothing on their absence as to what inwolves the stores it surgested itself to me that the ladies would like delicate diet and i intermated as much to mrs sidley and tother french waitingwoman do you imagine gentlemen that the souls of the dead are permitted to look back at such ewents of this life as touches their own private concerns and feelings  that would depend i should think steward on the nature of the employment of the souls themselves returned john effingham there must be certain souls to which any occupation would be more agreeable than that of looking behind them but may i ask why you inquire  because mr john effingham sir i do not believe captain truck can ever be happy in heaven as long as the ship is in the hands of the arabs if she had been honourably and fairly wracked and the captain suffercated by drowning he could go to sleep like another christian but i do think sir if there be any special perdition for seamen it must be to see their vessel rummaged by arabs ill warrant now those blackguards have had their fingers in everything already sugar chocolate raisins coffee cakes and all i wonder who they think would like to use articles they have handled and there is poor toast gentlemen an aspiring and improving young man one who had the materials of a good steward in him though i can hardly say they were completely deweloped i did look forward to the day when i could consign him to mr leach as my own predecessor when captain truck and i should retire as i have no doubt we should have done on the same day but for this distressing accident i dewoutly pray that toast is deceased for i would rather any misfortune should befall him in the other world than that he should be compelled to associate with arab niggers in this dead or alive ladies i am an advocate for a mans keeping himself respectable and in proper company  so elastic had the spirits of the whole become by their unlookedfor escape that saunders was indulged to the top of his humour and while he served the meal passing between his fire on the sands and the roof of the launch he enjoyed a heartier gossip than any he had had since they left the dock not even excepting those sniggering scenes with mr toast in the pantry in which he used to unbend himself a little forgetting his dignity as steward in the native propensities of the black  paul powis entered but a moment into the trifling for on him rested the safety of all he alone could navigate or even manage the boat in rough water and while the others confided so implicitly in his steadiness and skill he felt the usual burden of responsibility when the supper was ended and the party were walking up and down the little islet of sand he took his station on the roof therefore and examined the proceedings of the arabs with the glass mr sharp with a species of chivalrous selfdenial that was not lost on his companion foregoing the happiness of walking at the side of eve to remain near him  the wretches have laid waste the cabins already observed mr sharp when paul had been looking at the ship some little time that which it took months to produce they will destroy in an hour  i do not see that returned paul there are but about fifty in the ship and their efforts seem to be directed to hauling her over against the rocks they have no means of landing their plunder where she lies and i suspect there is a sort of convention that all are to start fair one or two who appear to be chiefs go in and out of the cabins but the rest are actively engaged in endeavouring to move the ship  and with what success  none apparently it exceeds their knowledge of mechanics to force so heavy a mass from its position the wind has driven the ship firmly on the bank and nothing short of the windlass or capstan can remove her these ignorant creatures have got two or three small ropes between the vessel and the reef and are pulling fruitlessly at both ends but our chief concern will be to find an outlet into the ocean when we will make the best of our way towards the cape de verds  paul now commenced a long and close examination of the reef to ascertain by what openings he might get the launch on the outside to the northward of the great inlet there was a continued line of rocks on which he was sorry to perceive armed arabs beginning to show themselves a sign that the barbarians still entertained the hope of capturing the party southward of the inlet there were many places in which a boat might pass at halftide and he trusted to getting through one of them as soon as it became dark as the escape in the boat could not have been foreseen the arabs had not yet brought down upon them the boats of the wreck but should morning dawn and find them still within the reef he saw no hope of final escape against boats that would posess the advantage of oars ignorant as the barbarians might be of their proper use  every thing was now ready the interior of the launch was divided into two apartments by counterpanes trunks and boxes the females spreading their mattresses in the forward room and the males in the other some of those profound interpreters of the law who illustrate legislation by the devices of trade had shipped in the montauk several hundred rude leaden busts of napoleon with a view to save the distinction in duties between the metal manufactured and the metal unmanufactured four or five of these busts had been struck into the launch as ballast they were now snugly stowed together with the water and all the heavier articles in the bottom of the boat the jigger had been made and bent and a suitable mast was stepped by means of the roof in short every provision for comfort or safety that paul could think of had been attended to and every thing was in readiness to reembark as soon as the proper hour should arrive  the gentler portion of the party were seated on the edge of the roof watching the setting sun and engaged in a discourse with feelings more attempered to their actual condition than had been the case immediately after their escape the evening had a little of that wild and watery aspect which about the same hour had given captain truck so much concern but the sun dipped gorgeously into the liquid world of the west and the whole scene including the endless desert the black reef the stranded ship and the movements of the bustling arabs was one of gloomy grandeur  could we foretell the events of a month said john effingham with what different feelings from the present would life be chequered when we left london the twenty days since our eyes and minds were filled with the movements cares refinements and interest of a great and polished capital and here we sit houseless wanderers gazing at an eventide on the coast of africa in this way young men and young ladies too will you find as life glides away that the future will disappoint the expectations of the present moment  all futures are not gloomy cousin jack said eve nor is all hope doomed to meet with disappointment a merciful god cares for us when we are reduced to despair on our own account and throws a ray of unexpected light on our darkest hours certainly we of all his creatures ought not to deny this  i do not deny it we have been rescued in a manner so simple as to seem unavoidable and yet so unexpected as to be almost miraculous had not mr blunt or mr powis as you call himalthough i am not in the secret of the masqueradebut had not this gentleman been a seaman it would have surpassed all our means to get this boat into the water or even to use her properly were she even launched i look upon his profession as being the first great providential interference or provision in our behalf and his superior skill and readiness in that profession as a circumstance of no less importance to us  eve was silent but the glow in the western sky was scarcely more radiant and bright than the look she cast on the subject of the remark  it is no great merit to be a seaman for the trade is like another a mere matter of practice and education observed paul after a moment of awkward hesitation if as you say i have been instrumental in serving you i shall never regret the accidentscruel accidents of my early life i had almost called themthat cast my fortunes so early on the ocean  a falling pin would have been heard and all hoped the young man would proceed but he chose to be silent saunders happened to overhear the remark for he was aiding ann sidley in the boat and he took up the subject where it was left by the other in a little aside with his companion  it is a misfortune that mr dodge is not here to question the gentleman said the steward to his assistant and then we might hear more of his adwentures which i make no doubt have been werry pathetic and romantical mr dodge is a genuine inquisitor mistress ann not such an inquisitor as burns people and flays them in spain where i have been but such an inquisitor as torments people and of whom we have lots in america  let the poor man rest in peace said nanny sighing hes gone to his great account steward and i fear we shall none of us make as good a figure as we might at the final settling besides miss eve i never knew a mortal that wasnt more or less a sinner  so they all say and i must allow that my experience leans to the wicked side of the question captain truck now was a worthy man but he had his faults as well as toast in the first place he would swear when things took him aback and then he had no prewarication about speaking his mind of a fellowcreature if the coffee happened to be thick or the poultry didnt take fat kindly ive known him box the compass with oaths if the ship was got in irons  its very sinful and it is to be feared that the poor man was made to think of all this in his latter moments  if the arabs undertook to cannibalize him i think he must have given it to them right and left continued saunders wiping an eye for between him and the captain there had existed some such affection as the prisoner comes to feel for the handcuffs with which he amuses his ennui some of his oaths would choke a dog  well let him restlet him rest providence is kind and the poor man may have repented in season  and toast too im sure mrs ann i forgive toast all the little mistakes he made from the bottom of my heart and particularly that affair of the beefsteak that he let fall into the coffee the morning that captain truck took me so flat aback about it and i pray most dewoutly that the captain now he has dropped this mortal coil and that there is nothing left of him but soul may not find it out lest it should breed illblood between them in heaven  steward you scarcely know what you say interrupted ann shocked at his ignorance and i will speak of it no more  mr saunders was compelled to acquiesce and he amused himself by listening to what was said by those on the roof as paul did not choose to explain farther however the conversation was resumed as if he had said nothing they talked of their escape their hopes and of the supposed fate of the rest of the party the discourse leaving a feeling of sadness on all that harmonized with the melancholy but not unpicturesque scene in which they were placed at length the night set in and as it threatened to be dark and damp the ladies early made their arrangements to retire the gentlemen remained on the sands much later and it was ten o clock before paul powis and mr sharp who had assumed the watch were left alone  this was about an hour later than the period already described as the moment when captain truck disposed himself to sleep in the launch of the dane the weather had sensibly altered in the brief interval and there were signs that to the understanding of our young seaman denoted a change the darkness was intense so deep and pitchy black indeed had the night become that even the land was no longer to be distinguished and the only clues the two gentlemen had to its position were the mouldering watchfires of the arab camp and the direction of the wind  we will now make an attempt said paul stopping in his short walk on the sand and examining the murky vault over head midnight is near and by two oclock the tide will be entirely up it is a dark night to thread these narrow channels in and to go out upon the ocean too in so frail a bark but the alternative is worse  would it not be better to allow the water to rise still higher i see by these sands that it has not yet done coming in  there is not much tide in these low latitudes and the little rise that is left may help us off a bank should we strike one if you will get upon the roof i will bring in the grapnels and force the boat off  mr sharp complied and in a few minutes the launch was floating slowly away from the hospitable bank of sand paul hauled out the jigger a small spritsail that kept itself closehauled from being fastened to a stationary boom and a little mast stepped quite aft the effect of which was to press the boat against the wind this brought the launchs head up and it was just possible to see by close attention that they had a slight motion through the water  i quit that bank of sand as one quits a tried friend said paul all the conversation now being in little more than whispers when near it i know where we are but presently we shall be absolutely lost in this intense darkness  we have the fires of the arabs for lighthouses still  they may give us some faint notions of our position but light like that is a very treacherous guide in so dark a night we have little else to do but to keep an eye on the water and to endeavour to get to windward  paul set the lugsail into which he had converted the royal and seated himself directly in the eyes of the boat with a leg hanging down on each side of the cutwater he had rigged lines to the tiller and with one in each hand he steered as if managing a boat with yokelines mr sharp was seated at hand holding the sheet of the mainsail a boathook and a light spar lying on the roof near by in readiness to be used should they ground  while on the bank paul had observed that by keeping the boat near the wind he might stretch through one of the widest of the channels for near two miles unless disturbed by currents and that when at its southern end he should be far enough to windward to fetch the inlet but for the banks of sand that might lie in his way the distance had prevented his discerning any passage through the reef at the farther end of this channel but the boat drawing only two feet of water he was not without hopes of being able to find one a chasm that was deep enough to prevent the passage of the arabs when the tide was in would he thought certainly suffice for their purpose the progress of the boat was steady and reasonably fast but it was like moving in a mass of obscurity the gentleman watched the water ahead intently with a view to avoid the banks but with little success for as they advanced it was merely one pile of gloom succeeding another fortunately the previous observation of paul availed them and for more than half an hour their progress was uninterrupted  they sleep in security beneath us said paul while we are steering almost at random this is a strange and hazardous situation in which we are placed the obscurity renders all the risks double  by the watchfires we must have nearly crossed the bay and i should think we are now quite near the southern reef  i think the same but i like not this baffling of the wind it comes fresher at moments but it is in puffs and fear there will be a shift it is now my best pilot  that and the fires  the fires are treacherous always it looks darker than ever ahead  the wind ceased blowing altogether and the sail fell in heavily almost at the same moment the launch lost its way and paul had time to thrust the boothook forward just in season to prevent its striking a rock  this is a part of the reef then that is never covered said he if you will get on the rocks and hold the boat i will endeavour to examine the place for a passage were we one hundred feet to the southward and westward we should be in the open ocean and comparatively safe  mr sharp complied and paul descended carefully on the reef feeling his way in the intense darkness by means of the boathook he was absent ten minutes moving with great caution as there was the danger of his falling into the sea at every step his friend began to be uneasy and the whole of the jeopardy of their situation presented itself vividly to his mind in that brief space of time should accident befall their only guide he was looking anxiously in the direction in which paul had disappeared when he felt a gripe of his arm  breathe even with care whispered paul hurriedly these rocks are covered with arabs who have chosen to remain on the dry parts of the reef in readiness for their plunder in the morning thank heaven i have found you again for i was beginning to despair to have called to you would have been certain capture as eight or ten of the barbarians are sleeping within fifty feet of us get on the roof with the least possible noise and leave the rest to me  as soon as mr sharp was in the boat paul gave it a violent shove from the rocks and sprang on the roof at the same moment this forced the launch astern and procured a momentary safety but the wind had shifted it now came baffling and in puffs from the desert a circumstance that brought them again to leeward  this is the commencement of the trades said paul they have been interrupted by the late gale but are returning were we outside the reef our prayers could not be more kindly answered than by giving us this very wind but here where we are it comes unseasonably hathis at least helps her  a puff from the land filled the sails and the ripple of the water at the stern was just audible the helm was attended to and the boat drew slowly from the reef and ahead  we have all reason for gratitude that danger at least is avoided ha the boat is aground  sure enough the launch was on the sands they were still so near the rocks as to require the utmost caution in their proceedings using the spar with great care the gentlemen discovered that the boat hung astern and there remained no choice but patience  it is fortunate the arabs have no dogs with them on the rocks you hear them howling incessantly in their camps  it is truly think you we can ever find the inlet in this deep obscurity  it is our only course by following the rocks we should be certain to discover it but you perceive they are already out of sight though they cannot be thirty fathoms from us the helm is free and the boat must be clear of the bottom again this last puff has helped us  another silence succeeded during which the launch moved slowly onward though whither neither of the gentlemen could tell but a single fire remained in sight and that glimmered like a dying blaze at times the wind came hot and arid savouring of the desert and then intervals of deathlike calm would follow paul watched the boat narrowly for half an hour turning every breath of air to the best account though he was absolutely ignorant of his position the reef had not been seen again and three several times they grounded the tide as often floating them off the course too had been repeatedly varied the result was that painful and profound sensation of helplessness that overcomes us all when the chain of association is broken and reason becomes an agent less useful than instinct  the last fire is out whispered paul i fear that the day will dawn and find us still within the reef  i see an object near us can it be a high bank  the wind had entirely ceased and the boat was almost without motion paul saw a darkness more intense even than common ahead of him and he leaned forward naturally raising a hand before him in precaution something he touched he knew not what but feeling a hard smooth surface that he at first mistook for a rock he raised his eyes slowly and discerned by the little light that lingered in the vault of heaven a dim tracery that he recognized his hand was on the quarter of the ship  tis the montauk he whispered breathlessly and her decks must be covered with arabs histdo you hear nothing  they listened and smothered voices those of the watch mingled with low laughter were quite audible this was a crisis to disturb the coolness of one less trained and steady than paul but he preserved his selfpossession  there is good as well as evil in this he whispered i now know our precise position and god be praised the inlet is near could we but reach itby a strong shove we can always force the launch from the vessels side and prevent their boarding us and i think with extreme caution we may even haul the boat past the ship undetected  this delicate task was undertaken it was necessary to avoid even a tread heavier than common a fall of the boathook or a collision with the vessel as the slightest noise became distinctly audible in the profound stillness of deep night once enlightened as to his real position however paul saw with his minds eye obstructions that another might not have avoided he knew exactly where to lay his hand when to bear off and when to approach nearer to the side of the ship as he warily drew the boat along the massive hullthe yard of the launch luckily leaned towards the reef and offered no impediment in this manner then the two gentlemen hauled their boat as far as the bows of the ship and paul was on the point of giving a last push with a view to shove it to as great a distance possible ahead of the packet when its movement was suddenly and violently arrested     chapter xxv        and when the hours of rest   come like a calm upon the midsea brine     hushing its billowy breast   the quiet of that moment too is thine     it breathes of him who keeps   the vast and helpless city while it sleeps    bryant   it was chilling to meet with this unexpected and sudden check at so critical a moment the first impression was that some one of the hundreds of arabs who were known to be near had laid a hand on the launch but this fear vanished on examination no one was visible and the side of the boat was untouched the boathook could find no impediment in the water and it was not possible that they could again be aground raising the boathook over his head paul soon detected the obstacle the line used by the barbarians in their efforts to move the ship was stretched from the forecastle to the reef and it lay against the boats mast it was severed with caution but the short end slipped from the hand of mr sharp who cut the rope and fell into the water the noise was heard and the watch on the deck of the ship made a rush towards her side  no time was to be lost but paul who still held the outer end of the line pulled on it vigorously hauling the boat swiftly from the ship and at the same time a little in advance as soon as this was done he dropped the line and seized the tillerropes in order to keep the launchs head in a direction between the two dangersthe ship and the reef this was not done without some little noise the footfall on the roof and the plash of the water when it received the line were audible and even the element washing under the bows of the boat was heard the arabs of the ship called to those on the reef and the latter answered they took the alarm and awoke their comrades for knowing as they did that the party of captain truck was still at liberty they apprehended an attack  the clamour and uproar that succeeded were terrific muskets were discharged at random and the noises from the camp echoed the cries and tumult from the vessel and the rocks those who had been sleeping in the boat were rudely awaked and saunders joined in the cries through sheer fright but the two gentlemen on deck soon caused their companions to understand their situation and to observe a profound silence  they do not appear to see us whispered paul to eve as he bent over so as to put his head at an open window and a return of the breeze may still save us there is a great alarm among them and no doubt they know we are not distant but so long as they cannot tell precisely where we are comparatively safetheir cries do us good service as landmarks and you may be certain i shall not approach the spots were they are heard pray heaven for a wind dearest miss effingham pray heaven for a wind  eve silently but fervently did pray while the young man gave all his attention again to the boatas soon as they were clear of the lee of the ship the baffling puffs returned and there were several minutes of a steady little breeze during which the boat sensibly moved away from the noises of the ship on the reef however the clamour still continued and the gentlemen were soon satisfied that the arabs had stationed themselves along the whole line of rocks wherever the latter were bare at high water as was now nearly the case to the northward as well as to the southward of the opening  the tide is still entering by the inlet said paul and we have its current to contend with it is not strong but a trifle is important at a moment like this  would it not be possible to reach the bank inside of us and to shove the boat ahead by means of these light spars asked mr sharp  the suggestion was a good one but paul was afraid the noise in the water might reach the arabs and expose the party to their fire as the utmost distance between the reef and the inner bank at that particular spot did not exceed a hundred fathoms at length another puff of air from the land pressed upon their sails and the water once more rippled beneath the bows of the boat pauls heart beat hard and as he managed the tillerlines he strained his eyes uselessly in order to penetrate the massivelooking darkness  surely he said to mr sharp who stood constantly at his elbow these cries are directly ahead of us we are steering for the arabs  we have got wrong in the dark then lose not a moment to keep the boat away for here to leeward there are noises  as all this was selfevident though confused in his reckoning paul put up the helm and the boat fell off nearly dead before the wind her motion being now comparatively rapid a few minutes produced an obvious change in the direction of the different groups of clamorous arabs though they also brought a material lessening in the force of the air  i have it said paul grasping his companion almost convulsively by the arm we are at the inlet and heading i trust directly through it you hear the cries on our right they come from the end of the northern reef while these on our left are from the end of the southern the sounds from the ship the direction of the land breeze our distanceall confirm it and providence again befriends us  it will be a fearful error should we be mistaken  we cannot be deceived since nothing else will explain the circumstances therethe boat feels the groundswella blessed and certain sign that we are at the inlet would that this tide were done or that we had more wind  fifteen feverish minutes succeeded at moments the puffs of nightair would force the boat ahead and then again it was evident by the cries that she fell astern under the influence of an adverse current neither was it easy to keep her on the true course for the slightest variation from the direct line in a tides way causes a vessel to sheer to remedy the latter danger paul was obliged to watch his helm closely having no other guide than the noisy and continued vociferations of the arabs  these liftings of the boat are full of hope resumed paul i think too that they increase  i perceive but little difference though i would gladly see all you wish  i am certain the swell increases and that the boat rises and falls more frequently you will allow there is a swell  quite obviously i perceived it before we kept the boat away this variable air is cruelly tantalizing  sir george templemoremr powis said a soft voice at a window beneath them  miss effingham said paul so eager that he suffered the tillerline to escape him  these are frightful criesshall we never be rid of them  if it depended on meon either of usthey should distress you no more the boat is slowly entering the inlet but has to struggle with a headtide the wind baffles and is light or in ten minutes we should be out of danger  out of this danger but only to encounter another  nay i do not think much of the risk of the ocean in so stout a boat at the most we may be compelled to cut away the roof which makes our little bark somewhat clumsy in appearance though it adds infinitely to its comfort i think we shall soon get the trades before which our launch with its house even will be able to make good weather  we are certainly nearer those cries than before  paul felt his cheek glow and his hand hurriedly sought the tillerline for the boat had sensibly sheered towards the northern reef a puff of air helped to repair his oversight and all in the launch soon perceived that the cries were gradually but distinctly drawing more aft  the current lessens said paul and it is full time for it must be near high water we shall soon feel it in our favour when all will be safe  this is indeed blessed tidings and no gratitude can ever repay the debt we owe you mr powis  the puffs of air now required all the attention of paul for they again became variable and at last the wind drew directly ahead in a continued current for half an hour as soon as this change was felt the sails were trimmed to it and the boat began to stir the water under her bows  the shift was so sudden that we cannot be mistaken in its direction paul remarked besides those cries still serve as pilots never was uproar more agreeable  i feel the bottom with this spar said mr sharp suddenly  merciful providence protect and shield the weak and lovely  nay i feel it no longer we are already in deeper water  it was the rock on which the seamen stood when we entered paul exclaimed breathing more freely i like those voices settling more under our lee too we will keep this tack the boats head was to the northward until we hit the reef unless warned off again by the cries  the boat now moved at the rate of five miles in the hour or faster than a man walks even when in quick motion its rising and falling denoted the long heavy swell of the ocean and the wash of water began to be more and more audible as she settled into the sluggish swells  that sounds like the surf on the reef continued paul every thing denotes the outside of the rocks  god send it prove so  that is clearly a sea breaking on a rock it is awkwardly near and to leeward and yet it is sweet to the ear as music  the boat stood steadily on making narrow escapes from jutting rocks as was evinced by the sounds and once or twice by the sight even but the cries shifted gradually and were soon quite astern paul knew that the reef trended east soon after passing the inlet and he felt the hope that they were fast leaving its western extremity or the part that ran the farthest into the ocean after effecting which there would be more water to leeward his own course being nearly north as he supposed  the cries drew still farther aft and more distant and the sullen wash of the surf was no longer so near as to seem fresh and tangible  hand me the lead and line that lie at the foot of the mast it you please said paul our water seems sensibly to deepen and the seas have become more regular  he hove a cast and found six fathoms of water a proof he thought that they were quite clear of the reef  now dear mr effingham miss effingham mademoiselle he cried cheerfully now i believe we may indeed deem ourselves beyond the reach of the arabs unless a gale force us again on their inhospitable shores  is it permitted to speak asked mr effingham who had maintained a steady but almost breathless silence  freely we are quite beyond the reach of the voice and this wind though blowing from a quarter i do not like is carrying us away from the wretches rapidly  it was not safe in the darkness and under the occasional heaves of the boat for the others to come on the roof but they opened the shutters and looked out upon the gloomy water with a sense of security they could not have deemed possible for people in their situation the worst was over for the moment and there is a relief in present escape that temporarily conceals future dangers they could converse without the fear of alarming their enemies and paul spoke encouragingly of their prospects it was his intention to stand to the northward until he reached the wreck when failing to get any tidings of their friends they might make the best of their way to the nearest island to leeward  with this cheering news the party below again disposed themselves to sleep while the two young men maintained their posts on the roof  we must resemble an ark said paul laughing as he seated himself on a box near the stem of the boat and i should think would frighten the arabs from an attack had they even the opportunity to make one this house we carry will prove a troublesome companion should we encounter a heavy and a head sea  you say it may easily be gotten rid of  nothing would be easier the whole apparatus being made to ship and unship before the wind we might carry it a long time and it would even help us along but on a wind it makes us a little topheavy besides giving us a leeward set in the event of rain or of bad weather of any sort it would be a treasure to us all more especially to the females and i think we had better keep it as long as possible  the half hour of breeze already mentioned sufficed to carry the boat some distance to the northward when it failed and the puffs from the land returned paul supposed they were quite two miles from the inlet and trying the lead he found ten fathoms of water a proof that they had also gradually receded from the shore still nothing but a dense darkness surrounded them though there could no longer be the smallest doubt of their being in the open ocean  for near an hour the light baffling air came in puffs as before during which time the launchs head was kept as near as the two gentlemen could judge to the northward making but little progress and then the breeze drew gradually round into one quarter and commenced blowing with a steadiness that they had not experienced before that night paul suspected this change though he had no certain means of knowing it for as soon as the wind baffled his course had got to be conjectural again as the breeze freshened the speed of the boat necessarily augmented though she was kept always on a wind and after half an hours progress the gentlemen became once more uneasy as to the direction  it would be a cruel and awkward fate to hit the reef again said paul and yet i cannot be sure that we are not running directly for it  we have compasses let us strike a light and look into the matter  it were better had we done this more early for a light might now prove dangerous should we really have altered the course in this intense darkness there is no remedy however and the risk must be taken i will first try the lead again  a cast was made and the result was two and a half fathoms of water  put the helm down cried paul springing to the sheet lose not a moment but down with the helm  the boat did not work freely under her imperfect sail and with the roof she carried and a moment of painful anxiety succeeded paul managed however to get a part of the sail aback and he felt more secure  the boat has sternway shift the helm mr sharp  this was done the yard was dipped and the two young men felt a relief almost equal to that they had experienced on clearing the inlet when they found the launch again drawing ahead obedient to her rudder  we are near something reef or shore said paul standing with the leadline in his hand in readiness to heave i think it can hardly be the first as we hear no arabs  waiting a few minutes he hove the lead and to his infinite joy got three fathoms fairly  that is good news we are hauling off the danger whatever it may be he said as he felt the mark and now for the compass  saunders was called a light was struck and the compasses were both examined these faithful but mysterious guides which have so long served man while they have baffled all his ingenuity to discover the sources of their power were as usual true to their governing principle the boat was heading northnorthwest the wind was at northeast and before they tacked they had doubtless been standing directly for the beach from which they could not have been distant a half quarter of a mile if so much a few more minutes would have carried them into the breakers capsized the boat and most probably drowned all below the roof if not those on it  paul shuddered as these facts forced themselves on his attention and he determined to stand on his present course for two hours when daylight would render his return towards the land without danger  this is the trade he said and it will probably stand we have a current to contend with as well as a headwind but i think we can weather the cape by morning when we can get a survey of the wreck by means of the glass if we discover nothing i shall bear up at once for the cape de verds  the two gentlemen now took the helm in turns he who slept fastening himself to the mast as a precaution against being rolled into the sea by the motion of the boat in fifteen fathoms water they tacked again and stood to the eastsoutheast having made certain by a fresh examination of the compass that the wind stood in the same quarter as before the moon rose soon after and although the morning was clouded and lowering there was then sufficient light to remove all danger from the darkness at length this long and anxious night terminated in the usual streak of day which gleamed across the desert  paul was at the helm steering more by instinct than any thing else and occasionally nodding at his post for two successive nights of watching and a day of severe toil had overcome his sense of danger and his care for others strange fancies beset men at such moments and his busy imagination was running over some of the scenes of his early youth when either his sense or his wandering faculties made him hear the usual brief spirited hail of  boat ahoy  paul opened his eyes felt that the tiller was in his hand and was about to close the first again when the words were more sternly repeated  boat ahoywhat crafts that answer or expect a shot  this was plain english and paul was wide awake in an instant rubbing his eyes he saw a line of boats anchored directly on his weather bow with a raft of spars riding astern  hurrah shouted the young man this is heavens own tidings are these the montauks  ay ay who the devil are you  the truth is captain truck did not recognize his own launch in the royal roof and jigger he had never before seen a boat afloat in such a guise and in the obscurity of the hour and fresh awakened from a profound sleep like paul his faculties were a little confused but the latter soon comprehended the whole matter he clapped his helm down let fly the sheet and in a minute the launch of the packet was riding alongside of the launch of the dane heads were out of the shutters and every boat gave up its sleepers for the cry was general throughout the little flotilla  the party just arrived alone felt joy they found those whom they had believed dead or captives alive and free whereas the others now learned the extent of the misfortune that had befallen them for a few minutes this contrast in feeling produced an awkward meeting but the truth soon brought all down to the same sober level captain truck received the congratulations of his friends like one in a stupor toast looked amazed as his friend saunders shook his hand and the gentlemen who had been to the wreck met the cheerful greetings of those who had just escaped the arabs like men who fancied the others mad  we pass over the explanations that followed as every one will readily understand them captain truck listened to paul like one in a trance and it was some time after the young man had done before he spoke with a wish to cheer him he was told of the ample provision of stores that had been brought off in the launch of the trade winds that had now apparently set in and of the great probability of their all reaching the islands in safety still the old man made no reply he got on the roof of his own launch and paced backwards and forwards rapidly heeding nothing even eve spoke to him unnoticed and the consolations offered by her father were not attended to at length he stopped suddenly and called for his mate  mr leach  sir  here is a category for you  ay ay sir its bad enough in its way still we are better off than the danes  you tell me sir turning to paul that these foul blackguards were actually on the deck of the ship  certainly captain truck they took complete possession for we had no means of keeping them off  and the ship is ashore  beyond a question  bilged  i think not there is no swell within the reef and she lies on sand  we might have spared ourselves the trouble leach of culling these cursed spars as if they had been so many toothpicks  that we might sir for they will not now serve as ovenwood for want of the oven  a damnable category mr effingham im glad you are safe sir and you too my dear young ladygod bless yougod bless youit were better the whole line should be in their power than one like you  the old seamans eyes filled as he shook eve by the hand and for a moment he forgot the ship  mr leach  sir  let the people have their breakfasts and bear a hand about it we are likely to have a busy morning sir lift the kedge too and let us drift down towards these gentry and take a look at them we have both wind and current with us now and shall make quick work of it  the kedge was raised the sails were all set and with the two launches lashed together the whole line of boats and spars began to set to the southward at a rate that would bring them up with the inlet in about two hours  this is the course for the cape de verds gentlemen said the captain bitterly we shall have to pass before our own door to go and ask hospitality of strangers but let the people get their breakfasts mr leach just let the boys have one comfortable meal before they take to their oars  eat himself however mr truck would not he chewed the end of a cigar and continued walking up and down the roof  in half an hour the people had ended their meal the day had fairly opened and the boats and raft had made good progress  splice the mainbrace mr leach said the captain for we are a littled jammed and you gentlemen do me the favour to step this way for a consultation this much is due to your situation  captain truck assembled his male passengers in the stern of the danes launch where he commenced the following address  gentlemen he said every thing in this world has its nature and its principles this truth i hold you all to be too well informed and well educated to deny the nature of a traveller is to travel and see curiosities the nature of old men is to think on the past of a young man to hope for the future the nature of a seaman is to stick by his ship and of a ship to be treated like a vessel and not to be ransacked like a town taken by storm or a nunnery that is rifledyou are but passengers and doubtless have your own wishes and occupations as i have mine your wishes are beyond question to be safe in new york among your friends and mine are to get the montauk there too in as little time and with as little injury as possible you have a good navigator among you and i now propose that you take the montauks launch with such stores as are necessary and fill away at once for the islands where i pray god you may all arrive in safety and that when you reach america you may find all your relations in good health and in no manner uneasy at this little delay your effects shall be safely delivered to your respective orders should it please god to put it in the power of the line to honour your drafts  you intend to attempt recapturing the ship exclaimed paul  i do sir returned mr truck who having thus far opened his mind for the first time that morning gave a vigorous hem and set about lighting a cigarwe may do it gentlemen or we may not do it if we do it you will hear farther from me if we fail why tell them at home that we carried sail as long as a stitch would draw  the gentlemen looked at each other the young waiting in respect for the counsel of the old the old hesitating in deference to the pride and feelings of the young  we must join you in this enterprise captain said mr sharp quietly but with the manner of a man of spirit and nerve  certainly certainly cried mr monday we ought to make a common affair of it as i dare say sir george templemore will agree with me in maintaining the nobility and gentry are not often backward when their persons are to be risked  the spurious baronet acquiesced in the proposal as readily as it had been made by him whom he had temporarily deposed for though a weak and a vain young man he was far from being a dastard  this is a serious business observed paul and it ought to be ordered with method and intelligence if we have a ship to care for we have those also who are infinitely more precious  very true mr blunt very true interrupted mr dodge a little eagerly it is my maxim to let well alone and i am certain shipwrecked people can hardly be better off and more comfortable than we are at this very moment i dare say these gallant sailors if the question was fairly put to them would give it by a handsome majority in favour of things as they are i am a conservative captainand i think an appeal ought to be made to the ballotboxes before we decide on a measure of so much magnitude  the occasion was too grave for the ordinary pleasantry and this singular proposition was heard in silence to mr dodges great disgust  i think it the duty of captain truck to endeavour to retake his vessel continued paul but the affair will be serious and success is far from certain the montauks launch ought to be left at a safe distance with all the females and in prudent keeping for any disaster to the boarding party would probably throw the rest of the boats into the hands of the barbarians and endanger the safety of those left in the launchmr effingham and mr john effingham will of course remain with the ladies  the father assented with the simplicity of one who did not distrust his own motives but the eagleshaped features of his kinsman curled with a cool and sarcastic smile  will you remain in the launch the latter asked pointedly turning towards paul  certainly it would be greatly out of character were to think of it my trade is war and i trust that captain truck means to honour me with the command of one of the boats  i thought as much by jove exclaimed the captain seizing a hand which he shook with the utmost cordiality i should as soon expect to see the sheetanchor wink or the bestbower give a mournful smile as to see you duck still gentlemen i am well aware of the difference in our situations i ask no man to forget his duties to those on shore on my account and i fancy that my regular people aided by mr blunt who can really serve me by his knowledge will be as likely to do all that can be done as all of us united it is not numbers that carry ships as much as spirit promptitude and resolution  but the question has not yet been put to the people said mr dodge who was a little mystified by the word last used which he had yet to learn was strictly technical as applied to a vessels crew  it shall sir returned captain truck and i beg you to note the majority my lads he continued rising on a thwart and speaking aloud you know the history of the ship as to the arabs now they have got her they do not know how to sail her and it is no more than a kindness to take her out of their hands for this business i want volunteers those who are for the reef and an attack will rise up and cheer while they who like an offing have only to sit still and stay where they are  the words were no sooner spoken than mr leach jumped up on the gunwale and waved his hat the people rose as one man and taking the signal from the mate they gave three as hearty cheers as ever rung over the bottle  dead against you sir observed the captain nodding to the editor and i hope you are now satisfied  the ballot might have given it the other way muttered mr dodge there can be no freedom of election without the ballot  no one however thought any longer of mr dodge or his scruples but the whole disposition for the attack was made with promptitude and caution it was decided that mr effingham and his own servant should remain in the launch while the captain compelled his two mates to draw lots which of them should stay behind also a navigator being indispensable the chance fell on the second mate who submitted to his luck with an ill grace  a bust of napoleon was cut up and the pieces of lead were beaten as nearly round as possible so as to form a dozen leaden balls and a quantity of slugs or langrage the latter were put in canvas bags while the keg of powder was opened a flannel shirt or two were torn and cart ridges were filled ammunition was also distributed to the people and mr sharp examined their arms the gun was got off the roof of the montauks launch and placed on a grating forward in that of the dane the sails and rigging were cleared out of the boat and secured on the raft when she was properly manned and the command of her was given to paul  the three other boats received their crews with john effingham at the head of one the captain and his mate commanding the others mr dodge felt compelled to volunteer to go in the launch of the dane where paul had now taken his station though he did it with a reluctance that escaped the observation of no one who took the pains to observe him mr sharp and mr monday were with the captain and the false sir george templemore went with mr leach these arrangements completed the whole party waited impatiently for the wind and current to set them down towards the reef the rocks of which by this time were plainly visible even from the thwarts of the several boats     chapter xxvi      hark was it not the trumpets voice i heard   the soul of battle is awake within me   the fate of ages and of empires hangs   on this dread hour    massinger   the two launches were still sailing side by side and eve now appeared at the open window next the seat of paul her face was pale as when the scene of the cabin occurred and her lip trembled  i do not understand these warlike proceedings she said but i trust mr blunt we have no concern with the present movement  put your mind at ease on this head dearest miss effingham for what we now do we do in compliance with a general law of manhood were your interests and the interests of those with you alone consulted we might come to a very different decision but i think you are in safe hands should our adventure prove unfortunate  unfortunate it is fearful to be so near a scene like this i cannot ask you to do any thing unworthy of yourself but all that we owe you impels me to say i trust you have too much wisdom too much true courage to incur unnecessary risks  the young man looked volumes of gratitude but the presence of the others kept its expression within due bounds  we old sea dogs he answered smiling are rather noted for taking care of ourselves they who are trained to a business like this usually set about it too much in a businesslike manner to hazard anything for mere show  and very wisely mr sharp tooeves colour deepened with a consciousness that paul would have given worlds to understandhe has a claim on us we shall never forge my father can say all this better than i  mr effingham now expressed his thanks for all that had passed and earnestly enjoined prudence on the young men after which eve withdrew her head and was seen no more most of the next hour was passed in prayer by those in the launch  by this time the boats and rail were within half a mile of the inlet and captain truck ordered the kedge which had been transferred to the launch of the montauk to be let go as soon as this was done the old seaman threw down his hat and stood on a thwart in his grey hair  gentlemen you have your orders he said with dignity for from that moment his manner rose with the occasion and had something of the grandeur of the warrior you see the enemy the reef must first be cleared and then the ship shall be carried god knows who will live to see the end but that end must be success on the bones of john truck shall bleach on these sands our cry is the montauk and our own which is a principle vattel will sustain us in give way men a long pull a strong pull and a pull altogether each boat in its station  he waved his hand and the oars fell into the water at the same instant the heavy launch was the last for she had doublefasts to the other boat while loosening that forward the second mate deserted his post stepping nimbly on board the departing boat and concealing himself behind the foremost of the two lugsails she carried almost at the same instant mr dodge reversed this manoeuvre by pretending to be left clinging to the boat of the montauk in his zeal to shove off as the sails were drawing hard and the oars dashed the spray aside it was too late to rectify either of these mistakes had it been desirable  a few minutes of a stern calm succeeded each boat keeping its place with beautiful precision the arabs had left the northern reef with the light but the tide being out hundreds were strung along the southern range of rocks especially near the ship the wind carried the launch ahead as had been intended and she soon drew near the inlet  take in the sails said mr blunt see your gun clear forward  a fine tall straight athletic young seaman stood near the grating with a heated iron lying in a vessel of live coals before him in lieu of a loggerhead the fire being covered with a tarpaulin as paul spoke this young mariner turned towards him with the peculiar grace of a manofwarsman and touched his hat  ay ay sir all ready mr powis  paul started while the other smiled proudly like one who knew more than his companions  we have met before said the first  that have we sir and in boatduty too you were the first on board the pirate on the coast of cuba and i was second  a look of recognition and a wave of the hand passed between them the men cheering involuntarily it was too late for more the launch being fairly in the inlet where she received a general but harmless fire from the arabs an order had been given to fire the first shot over the heads of the barbarians but this assault changed the plan  depress the piece brooks said paul and throw in a bag of slugs  all ready sir was uttered in another minute  hold water menthe boat is steadylet them have it  men fell at that discharge but how many was never known as the bodies were hurried off the reef by those who fled a few concealed themselves along the rocks but most scampered towards the shore  bravely done cried captain truck as his boat swept past now for the ship sir  the people cheered again and dashed their oars into the water to clear the reef was nothing but to carry the ship was a serious affair she was defended by four times the number of those in the boats and there was no retreat the arabs as has already been seen had suspended their labour during the night having fruitlessly endeavoured to haul the vessel over to the reef before the tide rose more by accident than by calculation they had made such arrangements by getting a line to the rocks as would probably have set the ship off the sands when she floated at high water but this line had been cut by paul in passing and the wind coming on shore again during the confusion and clamour of the barbarians or at a moment when they thought they were to be attacked no attention was paid to the circumstance and the montauk was suffered to drive up still higher on the sands where she effectually grounded at the very top of the tide as it was now dead low water the ship had sewed materially and was now lying on her bilge partly sustained by the water and partly by the bottom  during the short pause that succeeded saunders who was seated in the captains boat as a smallarmsman addressed his subordinate in a low voice  now toast he said you are about to contend in battle for the first time and i diwine from experience that the ewent gives you some sentiments that are werry original my adwice to you is to shut both eyes until the word is given to fire and then to open them suddenly as if just awaking from sleep after which you may present and pull the trigger above all toast take care not to kill any of our own friends most especially not captain truck just at this werry moment  i shall do my endeavours mr saunders muttered toast with the apathy and submissive dependence on others with which the american black usually goes into action if i do any harm i hope it will be overlooked on account of my want of experience  imitate me toast in coolness and propriety and youll be certain not to offend i do not mean that you too are to kill the werry same musclemen that i kill but that when i kill one you are to kill another and be werry careful not to hurt captain truck wholl be certain to run right afore the muzzle of our guns if he sees any thing to be done there  toast growled an assent and then there was no other noise in the boat than that which was produced by the steady and vigorous falling of the oars an attempt had been made to lighten the vessel by unloading her and the bank of sand was already covered with bales and boxes which had been brought up from the hold by means of a stage and by sheer animal force the raft had been extended in size and brought round to the bank by the stern of the vessel with the intention to load it and to transfer the articles already landed to the rocks  such was the state of things about the montauk when the boats came into the channel that ran directly up to the bank the launch led again her sails having been set as soon as the reef was swept and she now made another discharge on the deck of the ship which inclining towards the gun offered no shelter the effect was to bring every arab in the twinkling of an eye down upon the bank  hurrah shouted captain truck that grist has purified the old bark and now to see who is to own her the thieves are out of the temple as my good father would have said  the four boats were in a line abreast the launch under one sail only a good deal of confusion existed on the bank but the arabs sought the cover of the bales and boxes and opened a sharp though irregular fire three times as they advanced the second mate and that gallantlooking young seaman called brooks discharged the gun and at each discharge the arabs were dislodged and driven to the raft the cheers of the seamen became animated though they still plied the oars  steadily men said captain truck and prepare to board  at this moment the launch grounded though still twenty yards from the bank the other boats passing her with loud cheers  we are all ready sir cried brooks  let em have it take in the sail boys  the gun was fired and the tall young seaman sprang upon the grating and cheered as he looked backward with a smile of triumph paul saw his eyes roll he leaped into the air and fell at his length dead upon the water for such is the passage of a man in battle from one state of existence to another  where do we hang asked paul steadily forward or aft  it was forward and deeper water lay ahead of them the sail was set again and the people were called aft the boat tipped and shot ahead towards the sands like a courser released from a sudden pull  all this time the others were not idle not a musket was fired from either boat until the whole three struck the bank almost at the same instant though at as many different points then all leaped ashore and threw in a fire so close that the boxes served as much for a cover to the assailants as to the assailed it was at this critical moment when the seamen paused to load that paul just clear of the bottom with his own hand applying the loggerhead swept the rear of the bank with a most opportune discharge  yardarm and yardarm shouted captain truck lay em aboard boys and give em jacks play  the whole party sprang forward and from that moment all order ceased fists handspikes of which many were on the bank and the butts of muskets were freely used and in a way that set the spears and weapons of the arabs at defiance the captain mr sharp john effingham mr monday the soidisant sir george templemore and the chief mate formed a sort of macedonian phalanx which penetrated the centre of the barbarians and which kept close to the enemy following up its advantages with a spirit that admitted of no rallying on their right and left pressed the men an athletic hearty wellfed gang the superiority of the arabs was in their powers of endurance for trained to the whipcord rigidity of racers force was less their peculiar merit than bottom had they acted in concert how ever or had they been on their own desert mounted and with room for their subtle evolutions the result might have been very different but unused to contend with an enemy who brought them within reach of the arm their tactics were deranged and all their habits violated still their numbers were formidable and it is probable that the accident to the launch after all decided the matter from the moment the mêlée began not a shot was fired but the assailants pressed upon the assailed until a large body of the latter had collected near the raft this was just as the launch reached the shore and paul perceived there was great danger that the tide might roll backward from sheer necessity the gun was loaded and filled nearly to the muzzle with slugs he caused the men to raise it on their oars and to carry it to a large box a little apart from the confusion of the fight all this was done in a moment for three minutes had not yet passed since the captain landed  instead of firing paul called aloud to his friends to cease fighting though chafing like a vexed lion captain truck complied surprise effecting quite as much as obedience the arabs hardest pressed upon profited by the pause to fall back on the main body of their friends near the raft this was all paul could ask and he ordered the gun to be pointed at the centre of the group while he advanced himself towards the enemy making a sign of peace  damn em lay em aboard cried the captain no quarter to the blackguards  i rather think we had better charge again added mr sharp who was thoroughly warmed with his late employment  hold gentlemen you risk all needlessly i will show these poor wretches what they have to expect and they will probably retire we want the ship not their blood  well well returned the impatient captain give em plenty of vattel for we have em now in a category  the men of the wilderness and of the desert seem to act as much by instinct as by reason an old sheik advanced smiling towards paul when the latter was a few yards in advance of his friends offering his hand with as much cordiality as if they met merely to exchange courtesies paul led him quietly to the gun put his hand in and drew out a bag of slugs replaced it and pointed significantly at the dense crowd of exposed arabs and at the heated iron that was ready to discharge the piece at all this the old arab smiled and seemed to express his admiration he was then showed the strong and wellarmed party all of whom by this time had a musket or a pistol ready to use paul then signed to the raft and to the reef as much as to tell the other to withdraw his party  the sheik exhibited great coolness and sagacity and unused to frays so desperate he signified his disposition to comply truces paul knew were common in the african combats which are seldom bloody and he hoped the best from the manner of the sheik who was now permitted to return to his friends a short conference succeeded among the arabs when several of them smilingly waved their hands and most of the party crowded on the raft others advanced and asked permission to bear away their wounded and the bodies of the dead in both of which offices they were assisted by the seamen as far as was prudent for it was allimportant to be on the guard against treachery  in this extraordinary manner the combatants separated the arabs hauling themselves over to the reef by a line their old men smiling and making signs of amity until they were fairly on the rocks here they remained but a very few minutes for the camels and dromedaries were seen trotting off towards the dane on the shore a sign that the compact between the different parties of the barbarians was dissolved and that each man was about to plunder on his own account this movement produced great agitation among the old sheiksand their followers on the reef and set them in motion with great activity towards the land so great was their hurry indeed that the bodies of all the dead and of several of the wounded were fairly abandoned on the rocks at some distance from the shore  the first step of the victors as a matter of course was to inquire into their own loss this was much less than would have otherwise been on account of their good conduct every man without a solitary exception had ostensibly behaved well one of the most infallible means of lessening danger several of the party had received slight hurts and divers bullets had passed through hats and jackets mr sharp alone had two through the former besides one through his coat paul had blood drawn on an arm and captain truck to use his own language resembled a horse in flytime his skin having been rased in no less than five places but all these trifling hurts and hairbreadth escapes counted for nothing as no one was seriously injured by them or felt sufficient inconvenience even to report himself wounded  the felicitations were warm and general even the seamen asking leave to shake their sturdy old commander by the hand paul and mr sharp fairly embraced each expressing his sincere pleasure that the other had escaped unharmed the latter even shook hands cordially with his counterfeit who had acted with spirit from the first to the last john effingham alone maintained the same cool indifference after the affair that he had shown in it when it was seen that he had played his part with singular coolness and discretion dropping two arabs with his fowlingpiece on landing with a sort of sportsmanlike coolness with which he was in the habit of dropping woodcocks at home  i fear mr monday is seriously hurt this gentleman said to the captain in the midst of his congratulations he sits aloof on the box yonder and looks exhausted  mr monday i hope not with all my heart and soul he is a capital diplomate and a stout boarder and mr dodge too i miss mr dodge  mr dodge must have remained behind to console the ladies returned paul finding that your second mate had abandoned them like a recreant that he is  the captain shook his disobedient mate by the hand a second time and swore he was a mutineer for violating his orders and ended by declaring that the day was not distant when he and mr leach should command two as good liners as ever sailed out of america  ill have nothing to do with either of you as soon as we reach home he concluded there was leach a foot or two ahead of me the whole time and as for the second officer i should be justified in logging him as having run well well young men will be young men and so would old men too mr john effingham if they knew how but mr monday does look doleful and i am afraid we shall be obliged to overhaul the medicinechest for him  mr monday however was beyond the aid of medicine a ball had passed through his shoulderblade in landing notwithstanding which he had pressed into the mêlée where unable to parry it a spear had been thrust into his chest the last wound appeared grave and captain truck immediately ordered the sufferer to be carried into the ship john effingham with a tenderness and humanity that were singularly in contrast to his ordinary sarcastic manner volunteering to take charge of him  we have need of all our forces said captain truck as mr monday was borne away and yet it is due to our friends in the launch to let them know the result set the ensign leach that will tell them our success though a verbal communication can alone acquaint them with the particulars  if interrupted paul eagerly you will lend me the launch of the dane mr sharp and myself will beat her up to the raft let our friends know the result and bring the spars down to the inlet this will save the necessity of any of the mens being absent we claim the privilege too as belonging properly to the party that is now absent  gentlemen take any privilege you please you have stood by me like heroes and i owe you all more than the heel of a worthless old life will ever permit me to pay  the two young men did not wait for a second invitation but in five minutes the boat was stretching through one of the channels that led landward and in five more it was laying out of the inlet with a steady breeze  the instant captain truck retrod the deck of his ship was one of uncontrollable feeling with the weatherbeaten old seaman the ship had sewed too much to admit of walking with ease and he sat down on the coaming of the main hatch and fairly wept like an infant so high had his feelings been wrought that this outbreaking was violent and the men wondered to see their greyheaded stern old commander so completely unmanned he seemed at length ashamed of the weakness himself for rising like a worried tiger he began to issue his orders as sternly and promptly as was his wont  what the devil are you gaping at men he growled did you never see a ship on her bilge before god knows and for that matter you all know there is enough to do that you stand like so many marines with their eyes right and pipeclay  take it more kindly captain truck returned an old seadog thrusting out a hand that was all knobs a fellow whose tobacco had not been displaced even by the fray take it kindly and look upon all these boxes and bales as so much cargo that is to be struck in in dock well soon stow it and barring a few slugs and one fourpounder that has cut up a crate of crockery as if it had been a cat in a cupboard no great harm is done i look upon this matter as no more than a sudden squall that has compelled us to bear up for a little while but which will answer for a winch to spin yarns on all the rest of our days i have fit the french and the english and the turks in my time and now i can say i have had a brush with the niggers  dn me but you are right old tom and ill make no more account of the matter mr leach give the people a little encouragement there is enough left in the jug that youll find in the sternsheets of the pinnace and then turnto and strike in all this dunnage that the arabs have been scattering on the sands well stow it when we get the ship into an easier bed than the one in which she is now lying  this was the signal for commencing work and these straightforward tars who had just been in the confusion and hazards of a fight first took their grog and then commenced their labour in earnest as they had only with their knowedge and readiness to repair the damage done by the ignorant and hurried arabs in a short time every thing was on board the ship again when their attention was directed to the situation of the vessel itself not to anticipate events however we will now return to the party in the launch  the reader will readily imagine the feelings with which mr effingham and his party listened to the report of the first gun as they all remained below they were ignorant who the individual really was that kept pacing the roof over their heads though it was believed to be the second mate agreeably to the arrangement made by captain truck  my eyes grow dim said mr effingham who was looking through a glass will you try to see what is passing eve  father i cannot look returned the pallid girl it is misery enough to hear these frightful guns  it is awful said nanny folding her arms about her child and i wonder that such gentlemen as mr john and mr powis should go on an enterprise so wicked  voulezvous avoir la complaisance monsieur said mademoiselle viefville taking the glass from the unresisting hand of mr effingham ha le combat commence en effet  is it the arabs who now fire demanded eve unable in spite of terror to repress her interest  non cest cet admirable jeune homme monsieur blunt qui dévance tous les autres  and now mademoiselle that must surely be the barbarians  du tout les sauvages fuient cest encore du ba teau de monsieur blunt quon tire quel beau courage son bateau est toujours des premiers  that shout is frightful do they close  on crie des deux parts je crois le vieux capitaine est en avant à present et monsieur blunt sarrête  may heaven avert the danger do you see the gentlemen at all mademoiselle  la fumée est trop épaisse ah les viola on tire encore de son bateau  eh bien mademoiselle said eve tremulously after a long pause  cest déjà fini les arabes se retirent et nos amis se sont emparés du bâtiment cela a été laffaire dun moment et que le combat a été glorieux ces jeunes gens sont vraiment dignes dêtre français et le vieux capitaine aussi  are there no tidings for us mademoiselle asked eve after another long pause during which she had poured out her gratitude in trembling but secret thanksgivings  non pas encore ils se félicitent je crois  its time im sure maam said the meekminded ann to send forth the dove that it may find the olive branch war and strife are too sinful to be long indulged in  there is a boat making sail in this direction said mr effingham who had left the glass with the governess in complaisance to her wish  oui cest le bateau de monsieur blunt  and who is in it demanded the father for the meed of a world could not have enabled eve to speak  je vois monsieur sharpoui cest bien lui  is he alone  non il y en a deuxmaisouicest monsieur bluntnotre jeune heros  eve bowed her face and even while her soul melted in gratitude to god the feelings of her sex caused the telltale blood to suffuse her features to the brightness of crimson  mr effingham now took the glass from the spirited frenchwoman whose admiration of brilliant qualities had overcome her fears and he gave a more detailed and connected account of the situation of things near the ship as they presented themselves to a spectator at that distance  notwithstanding they already knew so much it was a painful and feverish half hour to those in the launch the time that intervened between this dialogue and the moment when the boat of the dane came alongside of their own every face was at the windows and the young men were received like deliverers in whose safety all felt a deep concern  but cousin jack said eve across whose speaking countenance apprehension and joy cast their shadows and gleams like april clouds driving athwart a brilliant sky my father has not been able to discover his form among those who move about on the bank  the gentlemen explained the misfortune of mr monday and related the manner in which john effingham had assumed the office of nurse a few delicious minutes passed for nothing is more grateful than the happiness that first succeeds a victory and the young men proceeded to lift the kedge assisted by the servant of mr effingham the sails were set and in fifteen minutes the raftthe longdesired and muchcoveted raftapproached the inlet  paul steered the larger boat and gave to mr sharp directions how to steer the other the tide was flowing into the passage and by keeping his weatherly position the young man carried his long train of spars with so much precision into its opening that favoured by the current it was drawn through without touching a rock and brought in triumph to the very margin of the bank here it was secured the sails and cordage were brought ashore and the whole party landed  the last twenty hours seemed like a dream to all the females as they again walked the solid sand in security and hope they had now assembled every material of safety and all that remained was to get the ship off the shore and to rig her mr leach having already reported that she was as tight as the day she left london     chapter xxvii      would i were in an alehouse in london   i would give all my fame for a pot of ale and safety    henry vth   mademoiselle viefville with a decision and intelligence that rendered her of great use in moments of need hastened to offer her services to the wounded man while eve attended by ann sidley ascended the ship and made her way into the cabins in the best manner the leaning position of the vessel allowed here they found less confusion than might have been expected the scene being ludicrous rather than painful for mr monday was in his stateroom excluded from sight  in the first place the soidisant sir george templemore was counting over his effects among which he had discovered a sad deficiency in coats and pantaloons the arabs had respected the plunder by compact with the intention of making a fair distribution on the reef but with a view to throw a sop to the more rapacious of their associates one room had been sacked by the permission of the sheiks this unfortunate room happened to be that of sir george templemore and the patent razors the east indian dressing case the divers toys to say nothing of innumerable vestments which the young man had left paraded in his room for the mere pleasure of feasting his eyes on them had disappeared  do me the favour miss effingham he said appealing to eve of whom he stood habitually in awe from the pure necessity of addressing her in his distress or of addressing no one do me the favour to look into my room and see the unprincipled manner in which i have been treated not a comb nor a razor left not a garment to make myself decent in im sure such conduct is quite a disgrace to the civilization of barbarians even and i shall make it a point to have the affair duly represented to his majestys minister the moment i arrive in new york i sincerely hope you have been better treated though i think after this specimen of their principles there is little hope for any one im sure we ought to be grateful they did not strip the ship i trust we shall all make common cause against them the moment we arrive  we ought indeed sir returned eve who while she had known from the beginning of his being an impostor was willing to ascribe his fraud to vanity and who now felt charitable towards him on account of the spirit he had shown in the combat though i trust we shall have escaped better our effects were principally in the baggageroom and that i understand from captain truck has not been touched  indeed you are very fortunate and i can only wish that the same good luck had happened to myself but then you know miss effingham that one has need of his little comforts and as for myself i confess to rather a weakness in that way  monstrous prodigality and wastefulness cried saunders as eve passed on towards her own cabin willing to escape any more of sir georges complaints just be so kind miss effingham maam to look into this here pantry once them niggers i do believe have had their fingers in every thing and it will take toast and me a week to get things decorous and orderly again some of the shrieks for so the steward styled the chiefs have been yelling well in this place ill engage as you may see by the manner in which they have spilt the mustard and mangled that cold duck ive a most mortal awersion to a man that cuts up poultry against the fibers and would you think it miss effingham maam that the last gun mr blunt fired dislocated or otherwise diwerted about half a dozen of the fowls that happened to be in the way for i let all the poor wretches out of the coops that they might make their own livings should we never come back i should think that as polite and experienced a gentleman as mr blunt might have shot the arabs instead of my poultry  so it is thought eve as she glanced into the pantry and proceeded what is considered happiness today gets to be misery tomorrow and the rebukes of adversity are forgotten the instant prosperity resumes its influence either of these men a few hours since would have been most happy to have been in this vessel as a home or a covering for their heads and now they quarrel with their good fortune because it is wanting in some accustomed superfluity or pampered indulgence  we shall leave her with this wholesome reflection uppermost to examine into the condition of her own room and return to the deck  as the hour was still early captain truck having once quieted his feelings went to work with zeal to turn the late success to the best account the cargo that had been discharged was soon stowed again and the next great object was to get the ship afloat previously to hoisting in the new spars as the kedges still lay on the reef and all the anchors remained in the places where they had originally been placed there was little to do but to get ready to heave upon the chains as soon as the tide rose previously to commencing this task however the intervening time was well employed in sending down the imperfect hamper that was aloft and in getting up shears to hoist out the remains of the foremast as well as the jury mainmast the latter of which it will be remembered was only fitted two days before all the appliances used on that occasion being still on deck and every body lending a willing hand this task was completed by noon the jurymast gave little trouble but was soon lying on the bank and then captain truck the shears having been previously shifted commenced lifting the broken foremast and just as the cooks announced that the dinner was ready for the people the latter safely deposited the spar on the sands  here a sheer hulk lies poor tom bowline said captain truck to mr blunt as the crew came up the staging in their way to the galley in quest of their meal i have not beheld the montauk without a mast since the day she lay a newborn child at the shipyards i see some half a dozen of these mummified scoundrels dodging about on the shore yet though the great majority as mr dodge would say have manifested a decided disposition to amuse them selves with a further acquaintance with the dane in my humble opinion sir that poor deserted ship will have no more inside of her by night than one of saunders ducks that have been dead an hour that hearty fellow mr monday is hit i fear between wind and water leach  he is in a bad way indeed as i understand from mr john effingham who very properly allows no one to disturb him keeping the stateroom door closed on all but himself and his own man  ay ay that is merciful a man likes a little quiet when he is killed as soon as the ship is more fit to be seen however it will become my duty to wait on him in order to see that nothing is wanting we must offer the poor man the consolations of religion mr blunt  they would certainly be desirable had we one qualified for the task  i cant say as much in that way for myself perhaps as i might seeing that my father was a priest but then we masters of packets have occasion to turn our hands to a good many odd jobs as soon as the ship is snug i shall certainly take a look at the honest fellow pray sir what became of mr dodge in the skirmish  paul smiled but he prudently answered i believe he occupied himself in taking notes of the combat and i make no doubt will do you full justice in the active inquirer as soon as he gets its columns again at his command  too much learning as my good father used to say has made him a little mad but i have a grateful heart today mr blunt and will not be critical i did not perceive mr dodge in the conflict as saunders calls it but there were so many of those rascally arabs that one had not an opportunity of seeing much else we must get the ship outside of this reef with as little delay as possible for to tell you a secrethere the captain dropped his voice to a whisperthere are but two rounds apiece left for the small arms and only one cartridge for the fourpounder i own to you a strong desire to be in the offing  they will hardly attempt to board us after the specimen they have had of what we can do  no one knows sir no one knows they keep pouring down upon the coast like crows on the scent of a carrion and once done with the dane we shall see them in hundreds prowling around us like wolves how much do we want of high water  an hour possibly i do not think there is much time to lose before the people get to work at the windlass  captain truck nodded and proceeded to look into the condition of his groundtackle it was a joyous but an anxious moment when the handspikes were first handled and the slack of one of the chains began to come in the ship had been upright several hours and no one could tell how hard she would hang on the bottom as the chain tightened the gentlemen the officers included got upon the bows and looked anxiously at the effect of each heave for it was a nervous thing to be stranded on such a coast even after all that had occurred  she winks by george cried the captain heave together men and you will stir the sand  the men did heave gaining inch by inch until no effort could cause the ponderous machine to turn the mates and then the captain applied their strength in succession and but half a turn more was gained everybody was now summoned even to the passengers and the enormous strain seemed to threaten to tear the fabric asunder and still the ship was immoveable  she hangs hardest forward sir said mr leach suppose we run up the sternboat  this expedient was adopted and so nearly were the counteracting powers balanced that it prevailed a strong heave caused the ship to start an inch more of tide aided the effort and then the vast hull slowly yielded to the purchase gradually turning towards the anchor until the quick blows of the pall announced that the vessel was fairly afloat again  thank god for that as for all his mercies said captain truck heave the hussy up to her anchor mr leach when we will cast an eye to her moorings  all this was done the ship being effectually secured with due attention to a change in the wind that now promised to be permanent not a moment was lost but the sheers being still standing the foremast of the dane was floated alongside fastened to and hove into its new berth with as much rapidity as comported with care when the mast was fairly stepped captain truck rubbed his hands with delight and immediately commanded his subordinate to rig it although by this time the turn of the day had considerably passed  this is the way with us seamen mr effingham he observed from the fall to the fight and then again from the fight to the fall our work like womens is never done whereas you landsmen knock off with the sun and sleep while the corn grows i have always owed my parents a grudge for bringing me up to a dogs life  i had understood it was a choice of your own captain  ayso far as running away and shipping without their knowledge was concerned perhaps it was but then it was their business to begin at the bottom and to train me up in such a manner that i would not run away the lord forgive me too for thinking amiss of the two dear old people for to be candid with you they were much too good to have such a son and i honestly believe they loved me more than i loved myself well ive the consolation of knowing i comforted the old lady with many a pound of capital tea after i got into the china trade maamselle  she was fond of it observed the governess politely  she relished it very much as a horse takes to oats or a child to custard that and snuff and grace composed her principal consolations  quoi demanded the governess looking towards paul for an explanation  grace mademoiselle la grace de dieu  bien  its a sad misfortune after all to lose a mother maamselle it is like cutting all the headfasts and riding altogether by the stern for it is letting go the hold of what has gone before to grapple with the future it is true that i ran away from my mother when a youngster and thought little of it but when she took her turn and ran away from me i began to feel that i had made a wrong use of my legs what are the tidings from poor mr monday  i understand he does not suffer greatly but that he grows weaker fast returned paul i fear there is little hope of his surviving such a hurt  the captain had got out a cigar and had beckoned to toast for a coal but changing his mind suddenly he broke the tobacco into snuff and scattered it about the deck  why the devil is not that rigging going up mr leach he cried fiercely it is not my intention to pass the winter at these moorings and i solicit a little more expedition  ay ay sir returned the mate one of a class habitually patient and obedient bear a hand my lads and get the strings into their places  leach continued the captain more kindly and still working his fingers unconsciously come this way my good friend i have not expressed to you mr leach all i wish to say of your good conduct in this late affair you have stood by me like a gallant fellow throughout the whole business and i shall not hesitate about saying as much when we get in it is my intention to write a letter to the owners which no doubt theyll publish for whatever they have got to say against america no one will deny it is easy to get any thing published publishing is victuals and drink to the nation you may depend on having justice done you  i never doubted it captain truck  no sir and you never winked the mainmast does not stand up in a gale firmer than you stood up to the niggers  mr effingham sirand mr sharpand particularly mr blunt  let me alone to deal with them even toast acted like a man well leach they tell me poor monday must slip after all  i am very sorry to hear it sir mr monday laid about him like a soldier  he did indeed but bonaparte himself has been obliged to give up the ghost and wellington must follow him some day even old putnam is dead either you or i or both of us leach will have to throw in some of the consolations of religion on this mournful occasion  there is mr effingham sir or mr john effingham elderly gentlemen with more scholarship  that will never do all they can offer no doubt will be acceptable but we owe a duty to the ship the officers of a packet are not gracelesshorsejockeys but sober discreet men and it becomes them to show that they have some education and the right sort of stuff in them on an emergency i expect you will stand by me leach on this melancholy occasion as stoutly as you stood by me this morning  i humbly hope sir not to disgrace the vessel but it is likely mr monday is a churchofenglandman and we both belong to the saybrook platform  ah the devili forgot that but religion is religion old line or new line and i question if a man so near unmooring will be very particular the great thing is consolation and that we must contrive to give him by hook or by crook when the proper moment comes and now mr leach let the people push matters and we shall have every thing up forward and that mainmast stepped yet by sunset or it would be more literal to say sundown captain truck like a true newenglandman invariably using a provincialism that has got to be so general in america  the work proceeded with spirit for every one was anxious to get the ship out of a berth that was so critical as well from the constant vicinity of the arabs as from the dangers of the weather the wind baffled too as it is usual on the margin of the trades and at times it blew from the sea though it continued light and the changes were of short continuance as captain truck hoped when the people ceased work at night the fore and foretopsailyards were in their places the topgallantmast was fitted and with the exception of the sails the ship was what is called atanto forward aft less had been done though by the assistance of the supernumeraries who continued to lend their aid the two lower masts were stepped though no rigging could be got over them the men volunteered to work by watches through the night but to this captain truck would not listen affirming that they had earned their suppers and a good rest both of which they should have  the gentlemen who merely volunteered an occasional drag cheerfully took the lookouts and as there were plenty of firearms though not much powder little apprehension was entertained of the arabs as was expected the night passed away tranquilly and every one arose with the dawn refreshed and strengthened  the return of day however brought the arabs down upon the shore in crowds for the last gale which had been unusually severe and the tidings of the wrecks which had been spread by means of the dromedaries far and wide had collected a force on the coast that began to be formidable through sheer numbers the dane had been effectually emptied and plunder had the same effect on these rapacious barbarians that blood is known to produce on the tiger the taste had begotten an appetite and from the first appearance of the light those in the ship saw sighs of a disposition to renew the attempt on their liberty  happily the heaviest portion of the work was done and captain truck determined rather than risk another conflict with a force that was so much augmented to get the spars on board and to take the ship outside of the reef without waiting to complete her equipment his first orders therefore when all hands were mustered were for the boats to get in the kedges and the stream anchor and otherwise to prepare to move the vessel in the mean time other gangs were busy in getting the rigging over the mastheads and in setting it up as the lifting of the anchors with boats was heavy work by the time they were got on board and stowed it was noon and all the yards were aloft though not a sail was bent in the vessel  captain truck while the people were eating passed through the ship examining every stay and shroud there were some makeshifts it is true but on the whole he was satisfied though he plainly saw that the presence of the arabs had hurried matters a little and that a good many drags would have to be given as soon as they got beyond danger and that some attention must be paid to seizings still what had been done would answer very well for moderate weather and it was too late to stop to change  the trade wind had returned and blew steadily as if finally likely to stand and the water outside of the reef was smooth enough to permit the required alterations now that the heavier spars were in their places  the appearance of the montauk certainly was not as stately and commanding as before the wreck but there was an air of completeness about it that augured well it was that of a ship of seven hundred tons fitted with spars intended for a ship of five hundred the packet a little resembled a man of six feet in the coat of a man of five feet nine and yet the discrepancy would not be apt to be noticed by any but the initiated everything essential was in its place and reasonably well secured and as the dane had been rigged for a stormy sea captain truck fell satisfied he might in his present plight venture on the american coast even in winter without incurring unusual hazard  as soon as the hour of work arrived therefore a boat was sent to drop a kedge as near the inlet as it would be safe to venture and a little to windward of it by making a calculation and inspecting his buoys which still remained where he had placed them captain truck found that he could get a narrow channel of sufficient directness to permit the ship to be warped as far as this point in a straight line every thing but the boats was now got on board the anchor by which they rode was hove up and the warp was brought to the capstan when the vessel slowly began to advance towards the inlet  this movement was a signal to the arabs who poured down on both reefs in hundreds screaming and gesticulating like maniacs it required good nerves and some selfreliance to advance in the face of such a danger and this so much the more as the barbarians showed themselves in the greatest force on the northern range of rocks which offered a good shelter for their persons completely raked the channel and moreover lay so near the spot where the kedge had been dropped that one might have jerked a stone from the one to the other to add to the awkwardness of the affair the arabs began to fire with those muskets that are of so little service in close encounters but which are notorious for sending their shot with great precision from a distance the bullets came thick upon the ship though the stoutness of the bulwarks forward and their height as yet protected the men  in this dilemma captain truck hesitated about continuing to haul ahead and he sent for mr blunt and mr leach for a consultation both these gentlemen advised perseverance and as the counsel of the former will succinctly show the state of things it shall be given in his own words  indecision is always discouraging to ones friends and encouraging to ones enemies he said and i recommend perseverance the nearer we haul to the rocks the greater will be our command of them while the more the chances of the arabs throwing their bullets on our decks will be diminished indeed so long as we ride head to wind they cannot fire low enough to effect their object from the northern reef and on the southern they will not venture very near for want of cover it is true it will be impossible for us to bend our sails or to send out a boat in the face of so heavy a fire while our assailants are so effectually covered but we may possibly dislodge them with the gun or with our smallarms from the decks if not i will head a party into the tops from which i will undertake to drive them out of the reach of our muskets in five minutes  such a step would be very hazardous to those who ventured aloft  it would not be without danger and some loss must be expected but they who fight must expect risks  in which case it will be the business of mr leach and myself to head the parties aloft if we are obliged to console the dying damn me but we are entitled to the privilege of fighting the living  ay ay sir put in the mate that stands to reason  there are three tops gentlemen returned paul mildly and i respect your rights too much to wish to interfere with them we can each take one and the effect will be in proportion to the greater means we employone vigorous assault being worth a dozen feints  captain truck shook paul heartily by the hand and adopted his advice when the young man had retired he turned to the mate and said  after all these menofwars men are a little beyond us in the science of attack and defence though i think i could give him a hint in the science of signs i have had two or three touches at privateering in my time but no regular occupation in your broadside work did you see how mr blunt handled his boat yesterday as much like two double blocks and a steady drag as one belayingpin is like another and as coolly as a great lady in london looks at one of us in a state of nature for my part leach i was as hot as mustard and ready to cut the throat of the best friend i had on earth whereas he was smiling as i rowed past him though i could hardly see his face for the smoke of his own gun  yes sir thats the way with your regular builts ill warrant you he began young and had kicked all the passion out of himself on old salts by the time he was eighteen he doesnt seem neither like one of the true dnmyeye breed but its a great privilege to a man in a passion to be allowed to kick when and whom he likes  not he i say leach perhaps he might lend us a hand when it comes to the pinch with poor monday i have a great desire that the worthy fellow should take his departure decently  well sir i think you had better propose it for my part im quite willing to go into all three of the tops alone rather than disappoint a dying man  the captain promised to look to the matter and then they turned their attention to the ship which in a few more minutes was up as near the kedge as it was prudent to haul her     chapter xxviii      speed gallant bark the tornado is past   staunch and secure thou hast weatherd the blast   now spread thy full sails to the wings of the morn   and soon the glad haven shall greet thy return    park   the montauk now lay close to the inlet and even a little to windward of its entrance but the channel was crooked not a sail was bent nor was it possible to bend one properly without exposing the men to the muskets of the arabs who from firing loosely had got to be more wary and deliberate aiming at the places where a head or an arm was occasionally seen to prolong this state of things was merely to increase the evil and captain truck determined to make an effort at once to dislodge his enemies  with this view the gun was loaded inboard filled nearly to the muzzle with slugs and then it was raised with care to the topgallantforecastle and cautiously pushed forward near the gunwale had the barbarians understood the construction of a vessel they might have destroyed half the packets crew while they were thus engaged about the forecastle by firing through the planks but ignorant of the weakness of the defences they aimed altogether at the openings or over the rails  by lowering the gaff the spanker was imperfectly bent that is to say it was bent on the upper leach the boom was got in under cover of the hurricanehouse and of the bundle of the sail the outhauler was bent the boom replaced the sail being hoisted with a little and a hurried lacing to the luff this was not effected without a good deal of hazard though the nearness of the bows of the vessel to the rocks prevented most of the arabs from perceiving what passed so far aft still others nearer to the shore caught glimpses of the actors and several narrow escapes were the consequence the second mate in particular had a shot through his hat within an inch of his head by a little management notwithstanding the luff of the spanker was made to stand tolerably well and the ship had at least the benefit of this one sail  the dane had been a seaman of the old school and instead of the more modern spenser his ship had been fitted with oldfashioned staysails of these it was possible to bend the main and mizzen staysails in tolerable security provided the ends of the halyards could be got down as this however would be nearly all aftersail the captain determined to make an effort to overhaul the buntlines and leachlines of the foresail at the same time that men were sent aloft after the ends of the halyards he also thought it possible to set a foretopmast staysail flying  no one was deceived in this matter the danger and the mode of operating were explained clearly and then captain truck asked for volunteers these were instantly found mr leach and the second mate setting the example by stepping forward as the first two in order that the whole procedure may be understood however it shall be explained more fully  two men were prepared to run up on the foreyard at the word both of these one of whom was mr leach carried three small balls of marline to the end of each of which was attached a codhook the barb being filed off in order to prevent its being caught by means of these hooks the balls were fastened to the jackets of the adventurers two others stood ready at the foot of the main and mizzen riggings by the gun lay paul and three men while several of the passengers and a few of the best shots among the crew were stationed on the forecastle armed with muskets and fowlingpieces  is everybody ready called out the captain from the quarterdeck  all ready and ay ay sir were answered from the different points of the ship  haul out the spanker  as soon as this sail was set the stern of the ship swung round towards the inlet so as to turn the bow on which the gun was placed towards the part of the reef where the arabs were in greatest numbers  be steady men and do not hurry yourselves though active as wildcats up and away  the two foreyard men and the two by the aftermasts sprang into the rigging like squirrels and were running aloft before the captain had done speakingat the same instant one of the three by the gun leaped on the bowsprit and ran out towards the stay paul and the other two rose and shoved the gun to its berth and the smallarms men showed themselves at the rails  so many all in swift motion appearing at the same moment in the rigging distracted the attention of the arabs for an instant though scattering shots were fired paul knew that the danger would be greatest when the men aloft were stationary and he was in no haste perhaps for half a minute he was busy in choosing his object and in levelling the gun and then it was fired he had chosen the moment well for mr leach and his fellow adventurers were already on the foreyard and the arabs had arisen from their covers in the eagerness of taking aim the smallarms men poured in their volley and then little more could be done in the way of the offensive nearly all the powder in the ship having been expended  it remains to tell the result of this experimentamong the arabs a few fell and those most exposed to the fire from the ship were staggered losing near a minute in their confusion but those more remote maintained hot discharges after the first surprise the whole time occupied in what we are going to relate was about three minutes the action of the several parts going on simultaneously  the adventurer forward though nearest to the enemy was least exposed partly covered by the bowsprit he ran nimbly out on that spar till he reached the stay here he cut the stop of the foretopmast halyards overhauled the running part and let the block swing in he then hooked a block that he had carried out with him and in which the bight of a rope had been rove through the thimble and ran in as fast as possible this duty which had appeared the most hazardous of all the different adventures on account of the proximity of the bowsprit to the reef was the first done and with the least real risk the man being partly concealed by the smoke of the gun as well as by the bowsprit he escaped uninjured  as the two men aft pursued exactly the same course the movements of one will explain those of the other on reaching the yard the adventurer sprang on it caught the hook of the halyardblock and threw himself off without an instants hesitation overhauling the halyards by his weight men stood in readiness below to check the fall by easing off the other end of the rope and the hardy fellow reached the deck in safety this seemed a nervous undertaking to the landsmen but the seamen who so well understood the machinery of their vessel made light of it  on the foreyard mr leach passed out on one yardarm and his coadventurer a common seaman on the other each left a hook in the knot of the inner buntline as he went out and dropped the ball of marline on deck the same was done at the outer buntlines and at the leachlines here the mate returned according to his orders leaped upon the rigging and thence upon a backstay when he slid on deck with a velocity that set aim at defiance notwithstanding the quickness of his motions mr leach received a trifling hit on the shoulder and several bullets whizzed near him  the seaman on the other yardarm succeeded equally well escaping the smallest injury until he had secured the leachline when knowing the usefulness of obtaining it for he was on the weather side of the ship he determined to bring in the end of the reeftackle with him calling out to let go the rope on the deck he ran out to the lift bent over and secured the desired end and raised himself erect with the intention to make a run in on the top of the yard captain truck and the second mate had both commanded him to desist in vain for impunity from harm had rendered him foolhardy in this perilous position he even paused to give a cheer the cry was scarcely ended when he sprang off the yard several feet upwards and fell perpendicularly towards the sea carrying the rope in his hand at first most on board believed the man had jumped into the water as the least hazardous means of getting down depending on the rope and on swimming for his security but paul pointed out the spot of blood that stained the surface of the sea at the point where he had fallen the reeftackle was rounded cautiously in and its end rose to the surface without the hand that had so lately grasped it the man himself never reappeared  captain truck had now the means of setting three staysails the spanker and the forecourse sails sufficient he thought to answer his present purposesthe end of the reeftackle that had been so dearly bought was got in by means of a light line which was thrown around it  the order was now given to brail the spanker and to clap on and weigh the kedge which was done by the run as soon as the ship was free of the bottom the foretopmaststaysail was set flying like a jibtopsail by hauling out the tack and swaying upon the halyards the sheet was hauled to windward and the helm put down of course the bows of the ship began to fall off and as soon as her head was sufficiently near her course the sheet was drawn and the wheel shifted  captain truck now ordered the foresail which by this time was ready to be set this important sail was got on the vessel by bending the buntlines and leachlines to its head and by hauling out the weatherheadcringle by means of the reef tackle as soon as this broad spread of canvas was on the ship her motion was accelerated and she began to move away from the spot followed by the furious cries and menaces of the arabs to the latter no one paid any heed but they were audible until drowned in distance although aided by all her spars and the force of the wind on her hull a body as large as the montauk required some little time to overcome the vis inertiæ and several anxious minutes passed before she was so far from the cover of the arabs as to prevent their clamour from seeming to be in the very ears of those on board when this did occur it brought inexpressible relief though it perhaps increased the danger by increasing the chances of the bullets hitting objects on deck  the course at first was nearly before the wind when the flat rock so often named being reached the ship was compelled to haul up on an easy bowline in order to pass to windward of it here the staysails aft and the spanker were set which aided in bringing the vessel to the wind and the foretack was brought down by laying straight out of the pass a distance of only a hundred yards the vessel would be again clear of every thing and beyond all the dangers of the coast so long as the present breeze stood but the tide set the vessel bodily towards the rock and her condition did not admit of pressing hard upon a bowline captain truck was getting to be uneasy for he soon perceived that they were nearing the danger though very gradually and he began to tremble for his copper still the vessel drew steadily ahead and he had hopes of passing the outer edge of the rocks in safety this outer edge was a broken ragged and pointed fragment that would break in the planks should the vessel rest upon it an instant while falling in that constant heaving and setting of the ocean which now began to be very sensibly felt after all his jeopardy the old mariner saw that his safety was at a serious hazard by one of those unforeseen but common risks that environ the seamans life  luff luff you can cried captain truck glancing his eye from the rock to the sails and from the sails to the rock luff siryou are at the pinch  luff it is sir answered the man at the wheel who stood abaft the hurricanehouse covered by its roof over which he was compelled to look to get a view of the sails luff i may and luff it is sir  paul stood at the captains side the crew being ordered to keep themselves as much covered as possible on account of the bullets of the arabs which were at this time pattering against the vessel like hail at the close of a storm  we shall not weather that point of ragged rock exclaimed the young man quickly and if we touch it the ship will be lost  let her claw off returned the old man sternly her cutwater is up with it already let her claw off  the bows of the ship were certainly up with the danger and the vessel was slowly drawing ahead but every moment its broadside was set nearer to the rock which was now within fifty feet of them the forechains were past the point though little hope remained of clearing it abaft a ship turns on her centre of gravity as on a pivot the two ends inclining in opposite directions and captain truck hoped that as the bows were past the danger it might be possible to throw the afterpart of the vessel up to the wind by keeping away and thus clear the spot entirely  hard up with your helm he shouted hard uphaul down the mizzenstaysail and give her sheet  the sails were attended to but no answer came from the wheel nor did the vessel change her course  hard up i tell you sirhard uphard up and be dd to you  the usual reply was not made paul sprang through the narrow gangway that led to the wheel all that passed took but a minute and yet it was the most critical minute that had yet befallen the montauk for had she touched that rock but for an instant human art could hardly have kept her above water an hour  hard up and be dd to you repeated captain truck in a voice of thunder as paul darted round the corner of the hurricanehouse  the seaman stood at the wheel grasping its spokes firmly his eyes aloft as usual but the turns of the tiller rope showed that the order was not obeyed  hard up man hard up are you mad paul uttered these words as he sprang to the wheel which he made whirl with his own hands in the required direction as for the seaman he yielded his hold without resistance and fell like a log as the wheel flew round a ball had entered his back and passed through his heart and yet he had stood steadily to the spokes as the true mariner always clings to the helm while life lasts  the bows of the ship fell heavily off and her stern pressed up towards the wind but the trifling delay so much augmented the risk that nothing saved the vessel but the formation of the run and counter which by receding as usual allowed room to escape the dangerous point as the montauk hove by on a swell  paul could not see the nearness of the escape but the purity of the water permitted captain truck and his mates to observe it with a distinctness that almost rendered them breathless indeed there was an instant when the sharp rock was hid beneath the counter and each momentarily expected to hear the grating of the fragment as it penetrated the vessels bottom  relieve that man at the wheel and send him hither this moment said captain truck in a calm stern voice that was more ominous than an oath  the mate called a seaman and passed aft himself to execute the order in a minute he and paul returned bearing the body of the dead mariner when all was explained  lord thy ways are unsearchable muttered the old master uncovering himself as the corpse was carried past and we are but as grains of seed and as the vain butterflies in thy hand  the rock once cleared an open ocean lay to leeward of the packet and bringing the wind a little abaft the beam she moved steadily away from those rocks that had been the witnesses of all her recent dangers it was not long before she was so distant that all danger from the arabs ceased the barbarians notwithstanding continued a dropping fire and furious gesticulations long after their bullets and menaces became matters of indifference to those on board  the body of the dead man was laid between the masts and the order was passed to bend the sails as all was ready in half an hour the montauk was standing off the land under her three topsails the reef now distant nearly a league the courses came next when the topgallant yards were crossed and the sails set the lighter canvas followed and some time before the sun disappeared the ship was under studdingsails standing to the westward before the trades  for the first time since he received the intelligence that the arabs were the masters of the ship captain truck now felt real relief he was momentarily happy after the combat but new cares had pressed upon him so soon that he could scarcely be said to be tranquil matters were now changed his vessel was in good order if not equipped for racing and as he was in a low latitude had the trade winds to befriend him and no longer entertained any apprehension of his old enemy the foam he felt as if a mountain had been removed from his breast  thank god he observed to paul i shall sleep tonight without dreaming of arabs or rocks or scowling faces at new york they may say that another man might have shown more skill in keeping clear of such a scrape but they will hardly say that another man could have got out of it better all this handsome outfit too will cost the owners nothingliterally nothing and i question if the poor dane will ever appear to claim the sails and spars i do not know that we are in possession of them exactly according to the law of africa for of that code i know little or according to the law of nations for vattel i believe has nothing on the subject but we are in possession so effectually that barring the norwesters on the american coast i feel pretty certain of keeping them until we make the east river  it might be better to bury the dead said paul for he knew eve would scarcely appear on deck as long as the body remained in sight seamen you know are superstitious on the subject of corpses  i have thought of this but hoped to cheat those two rascals of sharks that are following in our wake as if they scented their food it is an extraordinary thing mr blunt that these fish should know when there is a body in a ship and that they will follow it a hundred leagues to make sure of their prey  it would be extraordinary if true but in what manner has the fact been ascertained  you see the two rascally pirates astern observed mr leach  very true but we might also see them were there no dead body about the ship sharks abound in this latitude and i have seen several about the reef since we went in  theyll be disappointed as to poor tom smith said the mate unless they dive deep for him i have lashed one of napoleons busts to the fine fellows feet and hell not fetch up until hes snugly anchored on the bottom  this is a fitting hour for solemn feelings said the captain gazing about him at the heavens and the gathering gloom of twilight call all hands to bury the dead mr leach i confess i should feel easier myself as to the weather were the body fairly out of the ship  while the mate went forward to muster the people the captain took paul aside with a request that he would perform the last offices for the deceased  i will read a chapter in the bible myself he said for i should not like the people to see one of the crew go overboard and the officers have no word to say in the ceremonies it might beget disrespect and throw a slur on our knowledge but you manofwarsmen are generally more regularly brought up to prayers than us liners and if you have a proper book by you i should feel infinitely obliged if you would give us a lift on this melancholy occasion  paul proposed that mr effingham should be asked to officiate as he knew that gentleman read prayers in his cabin to his own party night and morning  does he said the captain then he is my man for he must have his hand in and there will be no stammering or boggling ay ay he will fetch through on one tack toast go below and present my compliments to mr effingham and say i should like to speak to him and harkee toast desire him to put a prayerbook in his pocket and then step into my stateroom and bring up the bible you will find under the pillow the arabs had a full chance at the plunder but there is something about the book that always takes care of it few rogues ive often remarked care about a bible they would sooner steal ten novels than one copy of the sacred writ this of mine was my mothers mr blunt and i should have been a better man had i overhauled it oftener  we pass over most of the arrangements and come at once to the service and to the state of the ship just as her inmate were assembled on an occasion which no want of formality can render any thing but solemn and admonitory the courses were hauled up and the maintopsail had been laid to the mast a position in which a ship has always an air of stately repose the body was stretched on a plank that lay across a rail the leaden bust being enclosed in the hammock that enveloped it a spot of blood on the cloth alone betrayed the nature of the death around the body were grouped the crew while captain truck and his mates stood at the gangway the passengers were collected on the quarterdeck with mr effingham holding a prayerbook a little in advance  the sun had just dipped into the ocean and the whole western horizon was glorious with those soft pearly rainbow hues that adorn the evening and the morning of a low latitude during the soft weather of the autumnal months to the eastward the low line of coast was just discernible by the hillocks of sand leaving the imagination to portray its solitude and wastes the sea in all other directions was dark and gloomy and the entire character of the sunset was that of a grand picture of ocean magnificence and extent relieved by a sky in which the tints came and went like the wellknown colours of the dolphin to this must be added the gathering gloom of twilight  eve pressed the arm of john effingham and gazed with admiration and awe at the imposing scene  this is the seamans grave she whispered  and worthy it is to be the tomb of so gallant a fellow the man died clinging to his post and powis tells me that his hand was loosened from the wheel with difficulty  they were silent for captain truck uncovered himself as did all around him placed his spectacles and opened the sacred volume the old mariner was far from critical in his selections of readings and he usually chose some subject that he thought would most interest his hearers which were ordinarily those that most interested himself to him bible was bible and he now turned to the passage in the acts of the apostles in which the voyage of st paul from judea to rome is related this he read with steadiness some quaintness of pronunciation and with a sort of breathing elasticity whenever he came to those verses that touched particularly on the navigation  paul maintained his perfect selfcommand during this extraordinary exhibition but an unbidden smile lingered around the handsome and chiseled mouth of mr sharp john effinghams curved face was sedate and composed while the females were too much impressed to exhibit any levity as to the crew they listened in profound attention occasionally exchanging glances whenever any of the nautical expedients struck them as being out of role  as soon as this edifying chapter was ended mr effingham commenced the solemn rites for the dead at the first sound of his voice a calm fell on the vessel as if the spirit of god had alighted from the clouds and a thrill passed through the frames of the listeners those solemn words of the apostle commencing with i am the resurrection and the life saith the lord he that believeth in me though he were dead yet he shall live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me he shall never die could not have been better delivered the voice intonation utterance and manner of mr effingham were eminently those of a gentleman without pretension quiet simple and mellow while on the other hand they were feeling dignified distinct and measured  when he pronounced the words i know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth and though after my skin worms destroy my body yet in my flesh shall i see god c c the men stared about them as if a real voice from heaven had made the declaration and captain truck looked aloft like one expecting a trumpetblast the tears of eve began to flow as she listened to the muchloved tones and the stoutest heart in that much tried ship quailed john effingham made the responses of the psalm steadily and mr sharp and paul soon joined him but the profoundest effect was produced when the office reached those consoling but startling words from the revelations commencing with i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me write from henceforth blessed are the dead who die in the lord c captain truck afterwards confessed that he thought he heard the very voice and the men actually pressed together in their alarm the plunge of the body was also a solemn instant it went off the end of the plank feet foremost and carried rapidly down by the great weight of the lead the water closed above it obliterating every trace of the seamans grave eve thought that its exit resembled the few brief hours that draw the veil of oblivion around the mass of mortals when they disappear from earth  instead of asking for the benediction at the close of the ceremony mr effingham devoutly and calmly commenced the psalm of thanksgiving for victory if the lord had not been on our side now may we say if the lord himself had not been on our side when men rose up against us they would have swallowed us up quick when they were so wrathfully displeased with us most of the gentlemen joined in the responses and the silvery voice of eve sounded sweet and holy amid the breathings of the ocean te deum laudamus we praise thee o god we acknowledge thee to be the lord all the earth doth worship thee the father everlasting closed the offices when mr effingham dismissed his congregation with the usual laymans request for the benediction  captain truck had never before been so deeply impressed with any religious ceremony and when it ceased he looked wistfully over the side at the spot where the body had fallen or where it might be supposed to have fallen for the ship had drifted some distanceas one takes a last look at the grave of a friend  shall we fill the maintopsail sir demanded mr leach after waiting a minute or two in deference to his commanders feelings or shall we hook on the yardtackles and stow the launch  not yet leach not yet it will be unkind to poor jack to hurry away from his grave so indecently i have observed that the people about the river always keep in sight till the last sod is stowed and the rubbish is cleared away the fine fellow stood to those spokes as a closereefed topsail in a gale stands the surges of the wind and we owe him this little respect  the boats sir  let them tow awhile longer it will seem like deserting him to be rattling the yardtackles and stowing boats directly over his head your granther was a priest leach and i wonder you dont see the impropriety of hurrying away from a grave a little reflection will hurt none of us  the mate admired at a mood so novel for his commander but he was fain to submit the day was fast closing notwithstanding and the skies were losing their brilliancy in hues that were still softer and more melancholy as if nature delighted too in sympathizing with the feelings of these lone mariners     chapter xxix      sir tis my occupation to be plain    lear   the barbarians had done much less injury to the ship and her contents than under the circumstances could have been reasonably hoped the fact that nothing could be effectually landed where she lay was probably the cause the bales that had actually been got out of the ship having been put upon the bank with a view to lighten her more than for any other reason the compact too between the chiefs had its influence probably though it could not have lasted long with so strong temptations to violate it constantly before the eyes of men habitually rapacious  of course one of the first things after each individual had ascertained his own losses was to inquire into those of his neighbours and the usual party in the ladies cabin was seated around the sofa of eve about nine in the evening conversing on this topic after having held a short but serious discourse on their recent escape  you tell me john that mr monday has a desire to sleep observed mr effingham in the manner in which one puts an interrogation  he is easier and dozes i have left my man with him with orders to summon me the instant he awakes  a melancholy pause succeeded and then the discourse took the channel from which it had been diverted  is the extent of our losses in effects known asked mr sharp my man reports some trifling deficit but nothing of any value  your counterfeit returned eve smiling has been the principal sufferer one would think by his plaints that not a toy is left in christendom  so long as they have not stolen from him his good name i shall not complain as i may have some use for it when we reach america of which now god be praised there are some flattering prospects  i understand from my connexions that the person who is known in the main cabin as sir george templemore is not the person who is known as such in this observed john effingham bowing to mr sharp who returned his salute as one acknowledges an informal introduction there are certainly weak men to be found in high stations all over the world but you will probably think i am doing honour to my own sagacity when i say that i suspected from the first that he was not the true amphitryon i had heard of sir george templemore and had been taught to expect more in him than even a man of fashiona man of the worldwhile this poor substitute can scarcely claim to be either  john effingham so seldom complimented that his kind words usually told and mr sharp acknowledged the politeness more gratified than he was probably willing to acknowledge to himself the other could have heard of him only from eve and her father and it was doubly grateful to be spoken of favourably in such a quarter he thought there was a consciousness in the slight suffusion that appeared on the face of the daughter which led him to hope that even the latter had not considered him unworthy of recollection for he cared but little for the remembrances of mr effingham if they could all be transferred to his child  this person who does me the honour to relieve me from the trouble of bearing my own name he resumed cannot be of very lofty pretensions or he would have aspired higher i suspect him of being merely one of those silly young countrymen of mine of whom so many crowd stagecoaches and packets to swagger over their less ambitious fellowmortals with the strut and exactions of the hour  and yet apart from his folly in sailing under false colours as our worthy captain would call it the man seems well enough  a folly cousin jack said eve with laughing eyes though she maintained a perfect demureness with her beautiful featuresthat he shares in common with so many others  very true though i suspect he has climbed to commit it while others have been content to descend the man himself behaved well yesterday showing steadiness as well as spirit in the fray  i forgive him his usurpation for his conduct on that occasion returned mr sharp and wish with all my heart the arabs had discovered less affection for his curiosities i should think that they must find themselves embarrassed to ascertain the uses of some of their prizes such for instance as the buttonhooks the shoehorn knives with twenty blades and other objects that denote a profound civilization  you have not spoken of your luck mr powis added mr effingham i trust you have fared as well as most of us though had they visited their enemies according to the injury received from them you would be among the heaviest of the sufferers  my loss replied paul mournfully is not much in pecuniary value though irreparable to me  a look of concern betrayed the general interest for as he really seemed sad there was a secret apprehension that his loss even exceeded that which his words would give them reason to suppose perceiving the curiosity that was awakened and which was only suppressed by politeness the young man added  i miss a miniature that to me is of inestimable value  eves heart throbbed while her eyes sunk to the carpet the others seemed amazed and after a brief pause mr sharp observed  a painting on its own account would hardly possess much value with such barbarians was the setting valuable  it was of gold of course and had some merit in the way of workmanship it has probably been taken as curious rather than for its specific value though to me as i have just said the ship itself could scarcely be of more accountcertainly not as much prized  many light articles have been merely mislaid taken away through curiosity or idleness and left where the individual happened to be at the moment of changing his mind said john effingham several things of mine have been scattered through the cabins in this manner and i understand that divers vestments of the ladies have found their way into the staterooms of the other cabin particularly a nightcap of mademoiselle viefvilles that has been discovered in captain trucks room and which that gallant seaman has forthwith condemned as a lawful waif as he never uses such a device on his head he will be compelled to wear it next his heart he will be compelled to convert it into a libertycap  ciel if the excellent captain will carry us safe to new york coolly returned the governess he shall have the prize de tout mon coeur cest un homme brave et cest aussi un brave homme à sa façon  here are two hearts concerned in the affair already and no one can foresee the consequences but turning to paul describe this miniature if you please for there are many in the vessel and yours is not the only one that has been mislaid  it was a miniature of a female and one too i think that would be remarked for her beauty  eve felt a chill at her heart  if sir it is the miniature of an elderly lady said ann sidley perhaps it is this which i found in miss eves room and which i intended to give to captain truck in order that it might reach the hands of its right owner  paul took the miniature which he regarded coldly for a moment and then returned to the nurse  mine is the miniature of a female under twenty he said colouring as he spoke and is every way different from this  this was the painful and humiliating moment when eve effingham was made to feel the extent and the nature of the interest she took in paul powis on all the previous occasions in which her feelings had been strongly awakened on his account she had succeeded in deceiving herself as to the motive but now the truth was felt in that overwhelming form that no sensitive heart can distrust  no one had seen the miniature though all observed the emotion with which paul spoke of it and all secretly wondered of whom it could be  the arabs appear to have some such taste for the fine arts as distinguishes the population of a mushroom american city said john effingham or one that runs to portraits which are admired while the novelty lasts and then are consigned to the first spot that offers to receive them  are your miniatures all safe eve mr effingham inquired with interest for among them was one of her mother that he had yielded to her only through strong parental affection but which it would have given him deep pain to discover was lost though john effingham unknown to him possessed a copy  it is with the jewellery in the baggageroom dearest father and untouched of course we are fortunate that our passing wants did not extend beyond our comfort and luckily they are not of a nature to be much prized by barbarians coquetry and a ship have little in common and mademoiselle viefville and myself had not much out to tempt the marauders  as eve uttered this both the young men involuntarily turned their eyes towards her each thinking that a being so fair stood less in need than common of the factitious aid of ornaments she was dressed in a dark french chintz that her maid had fitted to her person in a manner that it would seem none but a french assistant can accomplish setting off her falling shoulders finely moulded bust and slenderrounded waist in a way to present a modest outline of their perfection the dress had that polished medium between fashion and its exaggeration that always denotes a high association and perhaps a cultivated mindcertainly a cultivated tasteoffending neither usage on the one hand nor selfrespect and a chaste appreciation of beauty on the other indeed eve was distinguished for that important acquisition to a gentlewoman an intellectual or refined toilette not intellect and refinement in extravagance and caricature but as they are displayed in fitness simplicity elegance and the proportions this much perhaps she owed to native taste as the slight air of fashion and the high air of a gentlewoman that were thrown about her person and attire were the fruits of an intimate connexion with the best society of half the capitals of the european continent as an unmarried female modesty the habits of the part of the world in which she had so long dwelt and her own sense of propriety caused her to respect simplicity of appearance but through this as it might be in spite of herself shone qualities of a superior order the little hand and foot so beautiful and delicate the latter just peeping from the dress under which it was usually concealed appeared as if formed expressly to adorn a taste that was every way feminine and alluring  it is one of the mysteries of the grand designs of providence that men should exist in conditions so widely distant from each other said john effingham abruptly with a common nature that can be so much varied by circumstances it is almost humiliating to find onesself a man vhen beings like these arabs are to be classed as fellows  the most instructed and refined cousin jack may get a useful lesson notwithstanding your disrelish for the consanguinity from this very identity of nature said eve who made a rally to overcome feelings that she deemed girlish and weak by showing us what we might be ourselves we get an admonition of humility or by reflecting on the difference that is made by education does it not strike you that there is an encouragement to persevere until better things are attained  this globe is but a ball and a ball too insignificant even when compared with the powers of man continued the other how many navigators now circle it even you sir may have done this young as you still are turning to paul who made a bow of assent and yet within these narrow limits what wonderful varieties of physical appearance civilization laws and even of colour do we find all mixed up with points of startling affinity  so far as a limited experience has enabled me to judge observed paul i have every where found not only the same nature but a common innate sentiment of justice that seems universal for even amidst the wildest scenes of violence or of the most ungovernable outrages this sentiment glimmers through the more brutal features of the being the rights of property for instance are every where acknowledged the very wretch who steals whenever he can appearing conscious of his crime by doing it clandestinely and as a deed that shuns observation all seem to have the same general notions of natural justice and they are forgotten only through the policy of systems irresistible temptation the pressure of want or the result of contention  yet as a rule man every where oppresses his weaker fellow  true but he betrays consciousness of his error directly or indirectly one can show his sense of the magnitude of his crime even by the manner of defending it as respects our late enemies i cannot say i felt any emotion of animosity while the hottest engaged against them for their usages have rendered their proceedings lawful  they tell me interrupted mr effingham that it is owing to your presence of mind and steadiness that more blood was not shed unnecessarily  it may be questioned continued paul noticing this compliment merely by an inclination of the head if civilized people have not reasoned themselves under the influence of interest into the commission of deeds quite as much opposed to natural justice as anything done by these barbarians perhaps no nation is perfectly free from the just imputation of having adopted some policy quite as unjustifiable in itself as the system of plunder maintained among the arabs  do you count the rights of hospitality as nothing  look at france a nation distinguished for refinement among its rulers at least it was but the other day that the effects of the stranger who died in her territory were appropriated to the use of a monarch wallowing in luxury compare this law with the treaties that invited strangers to repair to the country and the wants of the monarch who exhibited the rapacity to the situation of the barbarians from whom we have escaped and the magnitude of the temptation we offered and it does not appear that the advantage is much with christians but the fate of shipwrecked mariners all over the world is notorious in countries the most advanced in civilization they are plundered if there is an opportunity and at need frequently murdered  this is a frightful picture of humanity said eve shuddering i do not think that this charge can be justly brought against america  that is far from certain america has many advantages to weaken the temptation to crime but she is very far from perfect the people on some of her coasts have been accused of resorting to the old english practice of showing false lights with a view to mislead vessels and of committing cruel depredations on the wrecked in all things i believe there is a disposition in man to make misfortune weigh heaviest on the unfortunate even the coffin in which we inter a friend costs more than any other piece of work of the same amount of labour and materials  this is a gloomy picture of humanity to be drawn by one so young mr effingham mildly rejoined  i think it true all men do not exhibit their selfishness and ferocity in the same way but there are few who do not exhibit both as for america miss effingham she is fast getting vices peculiar to herself and her system and i think vices which bid fair to bring her down ere long to the common level although i do not go quite so far in describing her demerits as some of the countrymen of mademoiselle viefville have gone  and what may that have been asked the governess eagerly in english  pourrie avant dêtre mûre mûre america is certainly far from being but i am not disposed to accuse her yet of being quitepourrie  we had flattered ourselves said eve a little reproachfully with having at last found a countryman in mr powis  and how would that change the question or do you admit that an american can be no american unless blind to the faults of the country however great  would it be generous for a child to turn upon a parent that all others assail  you put the case ingeniously but scarcely with fairness it is the duty of the parent to educate and correct the child but it is the duty of the citizen to reform and improve the character of his country how can the latter be done if nothing but eulogies are dealt in with foreigners one should not deal too freely with the faults of his country though even with the liberal among them one would wish to be liberal for foreigners cannot repair the evil but with ones countrymen i see little use and much danger in observing a silence as to faults the american of all others it appears to me should be the boldest in denouncing the common and national vices since he is one of those who by the institutions themselves has the power to apply the remedy  but america is an exception i think or perhaps it would be better to say i feel since all other people deride at mock her and dislike her you will admit this yourself sir george templemore  by no means in england now i consider america to be particularly well esteemed  eve held up her pretty hands and even mademoiselle viefville usually so welltoned and selfrestrained gave a visible shrug  sir george means in his country dryly observed john effingham  perhaps the parties would better understand each other said paul coolly were sir george templemore to descend to particulars he belongs himself to the liberal school and may be considered a safe witness  i shall be compelled to protest against a crossexamination on such a subject returned the baronet laughing you will be satisfied i am certain with my simple declaration perhaps we still regard the americans as tant soit peu rebels but that is a feeling that will soon cease  that is precisely the point on which i think liberal englishman usually do great justice to america while it is on other points that they betray a national dislike  england believes america hostile to herself and if love creates love dislike creates dislike  this is at least something like admitting the truth of the charge miss effingham said john effingham smiling and we may dismiss the accused it is odd enough that england should consider america as rebellious as is the case with many englishmen i acknowledge while in truth england herself was the rebel and this too in connexion with the very questions that produced the american revolution  this is quite new said sir george and i confess some curiosity to see how it can be made out  john effingham did not hesitate about stating his case  in the first place you are to forget professions and names he said and to look only at facts and things when america was settled a compact was made either in the way of charters or of organic laws by which all the colonies had distinct rights while on the other hand they confessed allegiance to the king but in that age the english monarch was a king he used his veto on the laws for instance and otherwise exercised his prerogatives of the two he influenced parliament more than parliament influenced him in such a state of things countries separated by an ocean might be supposed to be governed equitably the common monarch feeling a common parental regard for all his subjects perhaps distance might render him even more tender of the interest of those who were not present to protect themselves  this is putting the case loyally at least said sir george as the other paused for a moment  it is precisely in that light that i wish to present it the degree of power that parliament possessed over the colonies was a disputed point but i am willing to allow that parliament had all power  in doing which i fear you will concede all the merits said mr effingham  i think not parliament then ruled the colonies absolutely and legally if you please under the stuarts but the english rebelled against these stuarts dethroned them and gave the crown to an entirely new familyone with only a remote alliance with the reigning branch not satisfied with this the king was curtailed in his authority the prince who might with justice be supposed to feel a common interest in all his subjects became a mere machine in the hands of a body who represented little more than themselves in fact or a mere fragment of the empire even in theory transferring the control of the colonial interest from the sovereign himself to a portion of his people and that too a small portion this was no longer a government of a prince who felt a parental concern for all his subjects but a government of a clique of his subjects who felt a selfish concern only for their own interests  and did the americans urge this reason for the revolt asked sir george it sounds new to me  they quarreled with the results rather than with the cause when they found that legislation was to be chiefly in the interests of england they took the alarm and seized their arms without stopping to analyse causes they probably were mystified too much with names and professions to see the real truth though they got some noble glimpses of it  i have never before heard this case put so strongly cried paul powis and yet i think it contains the whole merit of the controversy as a principle  it is extraordinary how nationality blinds us observed sir george laughing i confess powisthe late events had produced a close intimacy and a sincere regard between these two fine young menthat i stand in need of an explanation  you can conceive of a monarch continued john effingham who possesses an extensive and efficient power  beyond doubt nothing can be plainer than that  fancy this monarch to fall into the hands of a fragment of his subjects who reduce his authority to a mere profession and begin to wield it for their own especial benefit no longer leaving him a free agent though always using the authority in his name  even that is easily imagined  history is full of such instances a part of the subjects unwilling to be the dupes of such a fraud revolt against the monarch in name against the cabal in fact now who are the real rebels profession is nothing hyder ally never seated himself in the presence of the prince he had deposed though he held him captive during life  but did not america acquiesce in the dethronement of the stuarts asked eve in whom the love of the right was stronger even than the love of country  beyond a doubt though america neither foresaw nor acquiesced in all the results the english themselves probably did not foresee the consequences of their own revolution for we now find england almost in arms against the consequences of the very subversion of the kingly power of which i have spoken in england it placed a portion of the higher classes in possession of authority at the expense of all the rest of the nation whereas as respects america it set a remote people to rule over her instead of a prince who had the same connexion with his colonies as with all the rest of his subjects the late english reform is a peaceable revolution and america would very gladly have done the same thing could she have extricated herself from the consequences by mere acts of congress the whole difference is that america pressed upon by peculiar circumstances preceded england in the revolt about sixty years and that this revolt was against an usurper and not against the legitimate monarch or against the sovereign himself  i confess all this is novel to me exclaimed sir george  i have told you sir george templemore that if you stay long enough in america many novel ideas will suggest themselves you have too much sense to travel through the country seeking for petty exceptions that may sustain your aristocratical prejudices or opinions if you like that better but will be disposed to judge a nation not according to preconceived notions but according to visible facts  they tell me there is a strong bias to aristocracy in america at least such is the report of most european travellers  the report of men who do not reflect closely on the meaning of words that there are real aristocrats in opinion in america is very true there are also a few monarchists or those who fancy themselves monarchists  can a man be deceived on such a point  nothing is more easy he who would set up a king merely in name for instance is not a monarchist but a visionary who confounds names with things  i see you will not admit of a balance in the state  i shall contend that there must be a preponderating authority in every government from which it derives its character and if this be not the king that government is not a real monarchy let the laws be administered in whose name they may calling an idol jupiter does not convert it into a god i question if there be a real monarchist left in the english empire at this very moment they who make the loudest professions that way strike me as being the rankest aristocrats and a real political aristocrat is and always has been the most efficient enemy of kings  but we consider loyalty to the prince as attachment to the system  that is another matter for in that you may be right enough though it is ambiguous as to terms  sirgentlemenmr john effingham sir interrupted saunders mr monday is awake and so werry conwalescenti fear he will not live long the ship herself is not so much conwerted by these new spars as poor mr monday is conwerted since he went to sleep  i feared this observed john effingham rising acquaint captain truck with the fact steward he desired to be sent for at any crisis  he then quitted the cabin leaving the rest of the party wondering that they could have been already so lost to the situation of one of their late companions however different from themselves he might be in opinions and character but in this they merely showed their common connexion with all the rest of the great family of man who uniformly forget sorrows that do not press too hard on self in the reaction of their feelings     chapter xxx      watchman what of the night watchman what of the night    isaiah   the principal hurt of mr monday was one of those wounds that usually produce death within eightandforty hours he had borne the pain with resolution and as yet had discovered no consciousness of the imminent danger that was so apparent to all around him but a film had suddenly past from before his senses and a man of mere habits prejudices and animal enjoyments he had awakened at the very termination of his brief existence to something like a consciousness of his true position in the moral world as well as of his real physical condition under the first impulse of such an alarm john effingham had been sent for and he as has been seen ordered captain truck to be summoned in consequence of the previous understanding these two gentlemen and mr leach appeared at the stateroom door at the same instant the apartment being small it was arranged between them that the former should enter first having been expressly sent for and that the others should be introduced at the pleasure of the wounded man  i have brought my bible mr leach said the captain when he and the mate were left alone for a chapter is the very least we can give a cabinpassenger though i am a little at a loss to know what particular passage will be the most suitable for the occasion something from the book of kings would be likely to suit mr monday as he is a thoroughgoing kings man  it is so long since i read that particular book sir returned the mate diligently thumbing his watchkey that i should be diffident about expressing an opinion i think however a little bible might do him good  it is not an easy matter to hit a conscience exactly between wind and water i once thought of producing an impression on the ships company by reading the account of jonah and the whale as a subject likely to attract their attention and to show them the hazards we seamen run but in the end i discovered that the narration struck them all aback as a thing not likely to be true jack can stand any thing but a fish story you know leach  it is always better to keep clear of miracles at sea i believe sir when the people are to be spoken to i saw some of the men this evening wince about that ship of st pauls carrying out anchors in a gale  the graceless rascals ought to be thankful they are not at this very moment trotting through the great desert lashed to dromedaries tails had i known that leach i would have read the verse twice but mr monday is altogether a different man and will listen to reason there is the story of absalom which is quite interesting and perhaps the account of the battle might be suitable for one who dies in consequence of a battle but on the whole i remember my worthy old father used to say that a sinner ought to be well shaken up at such a moment  i fancy sir mr monday has been a reasonably steady man as the world goes seeing that he is a passenger i should try and ease him off handsomely and without any of these methodist surges  you may be right leach you may be right do as foil would be done by is the golden rule after all but here comes mr john effingham so i fancy we may enter  the captain was not mistaken for mr monday had just taken a restorative and had expressed a desire to see the two officers the stateroom was a small neat and even beautifully finished apartment about seven feet square it had originally been fitted with two berths but previously to taking possession of the place john effingham had caused the carpenter to remove the upper and mr monday now lay in what had been the lower bed this situation placed him below his attendant and in a position where he might be the more easily assisted a shaded lamp lighted the room by means of which the captain caught the anxious expression of the dying mans eye as he took a seat himself  i am grieved to see you in this state mr monday said the master and this all the more since it has happened in consequence of your bravery in fighting to regain my ship by rights this accident ought to have befallen one of the montauks people or mr leach here or even myself before it befel you  mr monday looked at the speaker as if the intended consolation had failed of its effect and the captain began to suspect that he should find a difficult subject for his new ministrations by way of gaining time he thrust an elbow into the mates side as a hint that it was now his turn to offer something  it might have been worse mr monday observed leach shifting his attitude like a man whose moral and physical action moved pari passu it might have been much worse i once saw a man shot in the under jaw and he lived a fortnight without any sort of nourishment  still mr monday gazed at the mate as if he thought matters could not be much worse  that was a hard case put in the captain why the poor fellow had no opportunity to recover without victuals  no sir nor any drink he never swallowed a mouthful of liquor of any sort from the time he was hit until he took the plunge when we threw him overboard  perhaps there is truth in the saying that misery loves company for the eye of mr monday turned towards the table on which the bottle of cordial still stood and from john effingham had just before helped him to swallow under the impression that it was of no moment what he took the captain understood the appeal and influenced by the same opinion concerning the hopelessness of the patients condition besides being kindly anxious to console him he poured out a small glass all of which he permitted the other to drink the effect was instantaneous for it would seem this treacherous friend is ever to produce a momentary pleasure as a poor compensation for its lasting pains  i dont feel so bad gentleman returned the wounded man with a force of voice that startled his visitors i feel bettermuch better and am very glad to see you captain truck i have the honor to drink your health  the captain looked at the mate as if he thought their visit was twentyfour hours too soon for live all felt sure mr monday could not but leach better placed to observe the countenance of the patient whispered his commander that it was merely a catspaw and will not stand  i am very glad to see you both gentlemen continued mr monday and beg you to help yourselves  the captain changed his tactics finding his patient so strong and cheerful he thought consolation would be more easily received just at that moment than it might be even half an hour later  we are all mortal mr monday  yes sir all very mortal  and even the strongest and boldest ought occasionally to think of their end  quite true sir quite true the strongest and boldest when do you think we shall get in gentlemen  captain truck afterwards affirmed that he was never before taken so flat aback by a question as by this still he extricated himself from the dilemma with dexterity the spirit of proselytism apparently arising within him in proportion as the other manifested indifference to his offices  there is a port to which we are all steering my dear sir he said and of which we ought always to bear in mind the landmarks and beacons and that port is heaven  yes answered mr leach a port that sooner or later will fetch us all up  mr monday gazed from one to the other and something like the state of feeling from which he had been aroused by the cordial began to return  do you think me so bad gentlemen he inquired with a little of the eagerness of a startled man  as bad as one bound direct to so good a place as i hope and trust is the case with you can be returned the captain determined to follow up the advantage he had gained your wound we fear is mortal and people seldom remain long in this wicked world with such sort of hurts  if he stands that thought the captain i shall turn him over at once to mr effingham  mr monday did not stand it the illusion produced by the liquor although the latter still sustained his pulses had begun to evaporate and the melancholy truth resumed its power  i believe indeed that i am near my end gentlemen he said faintly and am thankfulforfor this consolation  now will be a good time to throw in the chapter whispered leach he seems quite conscious and very contrite  captain truck in pure despair and conscious of his own want of judgment had determined to leave the question of the selection of this chapter to be decided by chance perhaps a little of that mysterious dependence on providence which renders all men more or less superstitions influenced him and that he hoped a wisdom surpassing his own might direct him to a choice fortunately the book of psalms is near the middle of the sacred volume and a better disposition of this sublime repository of pious praise and spiritual wisdom could not have been made for the chancedirected peruser of the bible will perhaps oftener open among its pages than at any other place  if we should say that mr monday felt any very profound spiritual relief from the reading of captain truck we should both overrate the manner of the honest sailor and the intelligence of the dying man still the solemn language of praise and admiration had an effect and for the first time since childhood the soul of the latter was moved god and judgment passed before his imagination and he gasped for breath in a way that induced the two seamen to suppose the fatal moment had come even sooner than they expected the cold sweat stood upon the forehead of the patient and his eyes glared wildly from one to the other the paroxysm however was transient and he soon settled down into a state of comparative calmness pushing away the glass that captain truck offered in mistaken kindness with a manner of loathing  we must comfort him leach whispered the captain for i see he is fetching up in the old way as was duly laid down by our ancestors in the platform first groanings and views of the devil and then consolation and hope we have got him into the first category and we ought now in justice to bring to and heave a strain to help him through it  they generally give em prayer in the river in this stage of the attack said leach if you can remember a short prayer sir it might ease him off  captain truck and his mate notwithstanding the quaintness of their thoughts and language were themselves solemnly impressed with the scene and actuated by the kindest motives nothing of levity mingled with their notions but they felt the responsibility of officers of a packet besides entertaining a generous interest in the fate of a stranger who had fallen fighting manfully at their side the old man looked awkwardly about him turned the key of the door wiped his eyes gazed wistfully at the patient gave his mate a nudge with his elbow to follow his example and knelt down with a heart momentarily as devout as is often the case with those who minister at the altar he retained the words of the lords prayer and these he repeated aloud distinctly and with fervour though not with a literal conformity to the text once mr leach had to help him to the word when he rose the perspiration stood on his forehead as if he had been engaged in severe toil  perhaps nothing could have occurred more likely to strike the imagination of mr monday than to see one of the known character and habits of captain truck thus wrestling with the lord in his own behalf always obtuse and dull of thought the first impression was that of wonder awe and contrition followed even the mate was touched and he afterwards told his companion on deck that the hardest days work he had ever done was lending a hand to rouse the captain through that prayer  i thank you sir gasped mr monday i thank youmr john effinghamnow let me see mr john effingham i have no time to lose and wish to see him  the captain rose to comply with the feelings of a man who had done his duty and from that moment he had a secret satisfaction at having so manfully acquitted himself indeed it has been remarked by those who have listened to his whole narrative of the passage that he invariably lays more stress on the scene in the stateroom than on the readiness and skill with which he repaired the damages sustained by his own ship through the means obtained from the dane or the spirit with which he retook her from the arabs  john effingham appeared in the stateroom where the captain and mr leach left him alone with the patient like all strongminded men who are conscious of their superiority over the rest of their fellow creatures this gentleman felt disposed to concede most to those who were the least able to contend with him habitually sarcastic and stern and sometimes forbidding he was now mild and discreet he saw at a glance that mr mondays mind was alive to novel feelings and aware that the approach of death frequently removes moral clouds that have concealed the powers of the spirit while the animal part of the being was in full vigour he was surprised at observing the sudden change that was so apparent in the countenance of the dying man  i believe sir i have been a great sinner commenced mr monday who spoke more feebly as the influence of the cordial evaporated and in short and broken sentences  in that you share the lot of all returned john effingham we are taught that no man of himself no unaided soul is competent to its own salvation christians look to the redeemer for succour  i believe i understand you but i am a business man sir and have been taught that reparation is the best atonement for a wrong  it certainly should be the first  yes indeed it should sir i am but the son of poor parents and may have been tempted to some things that are improper my mother too i was her only support well the lord will pardon it if it were wrong as i dare say it might have been i think i should have drunk less and thought more but for this affairperhaps it is not yet too late  john effingham listened with surprise but with the coolness and sagacity that marked his character he saw the necessity or at least the prudence of there being another witness present taking advantage of the exhaustion of the speaker he stepped to the door of eves cabin and signed paul to follow him they entered the stateroom together when john effingham took mr monday soothingly by the hand offering him a nourishment less exciting than the cordial but which had the effect to revive him  i understand you sir continued mr monday looking at paul it is all very proper but i have little to saythe papers will explain it all those keys sirthe upper drawer of the bureau and the red morocco casetake it allthis is the key i have kept everything together from a misgiving that an hour would come in new york you will have timeit is not yet too late  as the wounded man spoke at intervals and with difficulty john effingham had complied with his directions before he ceased he found the red morocco case took the key from the ring and showed both to mr monday who smiled and nodded approbation the bureau contained paper wax and all the other appliances of writing john effingham inclosed the case in a strong envelope and affixed to it three seals which he impressed with his own arms the then asked paul for his watch that the same might be done with the seal of his companion after this precaution he wrote a brief declaration that the contents had been delivered to the two for the purpose of examination and for the benefit of the parties concerned whoever they might be and signed it paul did the same and the paper was handed to mr monday who had still strength to add his own signature  men do not usually trifle at such moments said john effingham and this case may contain matter of moment to wronged and innocent persons the world little knows the extent of the enormities that are thus committed take the case mr powis and lock it up with your effects until the moment for the examination shall come  mr monday was certainly much relieved after this consignment of the case into safe hands trifles satisfying the compunctions of the obtuse for more than an hour he slumbered during this interval of rest captain truck appeared at the door of the stateroom to inquire into the condition of the patient and hearing a report so favourable in common with all whose duty did not require them to watch he retired to rest paul had also returned and offered his services as indeed did most of the gentlemen but john effingham dismissed his own servant even and declared it was his intention not to quit the place that night mr monday had reposed confidence in him appeared to be gratified by his attentions and presence and he felt it to be a sort of duty under such circumstances not to desert a fellowcreature in his extremity any thing beyond some slight alleviation of the sufferers pains was hopeless but this he rightly believed he was as capable of administering as another  death is appalling to those of the most iron nerves when it comes quietly and in the stillness and solitude of night john effingham was such a man but he felt all the peculiarity of his situation as he sat alone in the stateroom by the side of mr monday listening to the washing of the waters that the ship shoved aside and to the unquiet breathing of his patient several times he felt a disposition to steal away for a few minutes and to refresh himself by exercise in the pure air of the ocean but as often was the inclination checked by jealous glances from the glazed eye of the dying man who appeared to cherish his presence as his own last hope of life when john effingham wetted the feverish lips the look he received spoke of gratitude and thanks and once or twice these feelings were audible in whispers he could not desert a being so helpless so dependent and although conscious that he was of no material service beyond sustaining his patient by his presence he felt that this was sufficient to exact much heavier sacrifices  during one of the troubled slumbers of the dying man his attendant sat watching the struggles of his countenance which seemed to betray the workings of the soul that was about to quit its tenement and he mused on the character and fate of the being whose departure for the world of spirits he himself was so singularly called on to witness  of his origin i know nothing thought john effingham except by his own passing declarations and the evident fact that as regards station it can scarcely have reached mediocrity he is one of those who appear to live for the most vulgar motives that are admissible among men of any culture and whose refinement such as it is is purely of the conventional class of habits ignorant beyond the current opinions of a set prejudiced in all that relates to nations religions and characters wily with an air of blustering honesty credulous and intolerant bold in denunciations and critical remarks without a spark of discrimination or any knowledge but that which has been acquired under a designing dictation as incapable of generalizing as he is obstinate in trifles goodhumoured by nature and yet querulous from imitationfor what purposes was such a creature brought into existence to be hurried out of it in this eventful manner the conversation of the evening recurred to john effingham and he inwardly said if there exist such varieties of the human race among nations there are certainly as many species in a moral sense in civilized life itself this man has his counterpart in a particular feature in the everyday american absorbed in the pursuit of gain and yet how widely different are the two in the minor points of character while the other allows himself no rest no relaxation no mitigation of the eternal gnawing of the vulture rapacity this man has made selfindulgence the constant companion of his toil while the other has centered all his pleasures in gain this englishman with the same object in view but obedient to national usages has fancied he has been alleviating his labours by sensual enjoyments in what will their ends differ from the eyes of the american the veil will be torn aside when it is too late perhaps and the object of his earthly pursuit will be made the instrument of his punishment as he sees himself compelled to quit it all for the dark uncertainty of the grave while the blusterer and the bottlecompanion sinks into a forced and appalled repentance as the animal that has hitherto upheld him loses its ascendency  a groan from mr monday who now opened his glassy eyes interrupted these musings the patient signed for the nourishment and he revived a little  what is the day of the week he asked with an anxiety that surprised his kind attendant  it is or rather it was monday for we are now past midnight  i am glad of it sirvery glad of it  why should the day of the week be of consequence to you now  there is a saying siri have faith in sayingsthey told me i was born of a monday and should die of a monday  the other was shocked at this evidence of a lingering and abject superstition in one who could not probably survive many hours and he spoke to him of the saviour and of his mediation for man all this could john effingham do at need and he could do it well too for few had clearer perceptions of this state of probation than himself his weak point was in the pride and strength of his character qualities that indisposed him in his own practice to rely on any but himself under the very circumstances which would impress on others the necessity of relying solely on god the dying man heard him attentively and the words made a momentary impression  i do not wish to die sir mr monday said suddenly after a long pause  it is the general fate when the moment arrives we ought to prepare ourselves to meet it  i am no coward mr effingham  in one sense i know you are not for i have seen you proved i hope you will not be one in any sense you are now in a situation in which manhood will avail you nothing your dependence should be placed altogether on god  i know it siri try to feel thus but i do not wish to die  the love of christ is illimitable said john effingham powerfully affected by the others hopeless misery  i know iti hope iti wish to believe it have you a mother mr effingham  she has been dead many years  a wife  john effingham gasped for breath and one might have mistaken him at the moment for the sufferer  none i am without parent brother sister wife or child my nearest relatives are in this ship  i am of little value but such as i am my mother will miss me we can have but one mother sir  this is very true if you have any commission or message for your mother mr monday i shall have great satisfaction in attending to your wishes  i thank you sir i know of none she has her notions on religion andi think it would lessen her sorrow to hear that i had a christian burial  set your heart at rest on that subject all that our situation will allow shall be done  of what account will it all be mr effingham i wish i had drunk less and thought more  john effingham could say nothing to a compunction that was so necessary though so tardy  i fear we think too little of this moment in our health and strength sir  the greater the necessity mr monday of turning our thoughts towards that divine mediation which alone can avail us while there is yet opportunity  but mr monday was startled by the near approach of death rather than repentant he had indurated his feelings by the long and continued practice of a deadening selfindulgence and he was now like a man who unexpectedly finds himself in the presence of an imminent and overwhelming danger without any visible means of mitigation or escape he groaned and looked around him as if he sought something to cling to the spirit he had shown in the pride of his strength availing nothing all these however were but passing emotions and the natural obtusity of the man returned  i do not think sir he said gazing intently at john effingham that i have been a very great sinner  i hope not my good friend yet none of us are so free from spot as not to require the aid of god to fit us for his holy presence  very true sirvery true sir i was duly baptized and properly confirmed  offices which are but pledges that we are expected to redeem  by a regular priest and bishop sirorthodox and dignified clergymen  no doubt england wants none of the forms of religion but the contrite heart mr monday will be sure to meet with mercy  i feel contrite sir very contrite  a pause of half an hour succeeded and john effingham thought at first that his patient had again slumbered but looking more closely at his situation he perceived that his eyes often opened and wandered over objects near him unwilling to disturb this apparent tranquillity the minutes were permitted to pass away uninterrupted until mr monday spoke again of his own accord  mr effinghamsirmr effingham said the dying man  i am near you mr monday and will not leave the room  bless you bless you do not you desert me  i shall remain set your heart at rest and let me know your wants  i want life sir  that is the gift of god and its possession depends solely on his pleasure ask pardon for your sins and remember the mercy and love of the blessed redeemer  i try sir i do not think i have been a very great sinner  i hope not but god can pardon the penitent however great their offences  yes sir i know iti know it this affair has been so unexpected i have even been at the communiontable sir yes my mother made me commune nothing was neglected sir  john effingham was often proud and selfwilled in his communications with men the inferiority of most of his fellowcreatures to himself in principles as well as mind being too plainly apparent not to influence the opinions of one who did not too closely study his own failings but as respects god he was habitually reverent and meek spiritual pride formed no part of his character for he felt his own deficiency in the christian qualities the main defect arising more from a habit of regarding the infirmities of others than from dwelling too much on his own merits in comparing himself with perfection no one could be more humble but in limiting the comparison to those around him few were prouder or few more justly so were it permitted to make such a comparison at all prayer with him was not habitual or always well ordered but he was not ashamed to pray and when he did bow down his spirit in this manner it was with the force comprehensiveness and energy of his character he was now moved by the feeble and commonplace consolations that mr monday endeavoured to extract from his situation he saw the peculiarly deluding and cruel substitution of forms for the substance of piety that distinguishes the policy of all established churches though unlike many of his own countrymen his mind was superior to those narrow exaggerations that on the other hand too often convert innocence into sin and puff up the votary with the conceit of a sectarian and his selfrighteousness  i will pray with you mr monday he said kneeling at the side of the dying mans bed we will ask mercy of god together and he may lessen these doubts  mr monday made a sign of eager assent and john effingham prayed in a voice that was distinctly audible to the other the petition was short beautiful and even lofty in language without a particle of scripture jargon or of the cant of professed devotees but it was a fervent direct comprehensive and humble appeal to the deity for mercy on the being who now found himself in extremity a child might have understood it while the heart of a man would have melted with its affecting and meek sincerity it is to be hoped that the great being whose spirit pervades the universe and whose clemency is commensurate with his power also admitted the force of the petition for mr monday smiled with pleasure when john effingham arose  thank you sira thousand thanks muttered the dying man pressing the hand of the other this is better than all  after this mr monday was easier and hours passed away in nearly a continued silence john effingham was now convinced that his patient slumbered and he allowed himself to fall into a doze it was after the morning watch was called that he was aroused by a movement in the berth relieving his patient required nourishment or some fluid to moisten his lips john effingham offered both but they were declined mr monday had clasped his hands on his breast with the fingers uppermost as painters and sculptors are apt to delineate them when they represent saints in the act of addressing the deity and his lips moved though the words were whispered john effingham kneeled and placed his ear so close as to catch the sounds his patient was uttering the simple but beautiful petition transmitted by christ himself to man as the model of all prayer  as soon as the other had done john effingham repeated the same prayer fervently and aloud himself and when he opened his eyes after this solemn homage to god mr monday was dead     chapter xxxi      let me alonedost thou use to write   thy name or hast thou a mark to thyself like an   honest plaindealing man    jack cade   at a later hour the body of the deceased was consigned to the ocean with the forms that had been observed the previous night at the burial of the seaman these two ceremonies were sad remembrancers of the scene the travellers had passed through and for many days the melancholy that they naturally excited pervaded the ship but as no one connected by blood with any of the living had fallen and it is not the disposition of men to mourn always this feeling gradually subsided and at the end of three weeks the deaths had lost most of their influence or were recalled only at moments by those who thought it wise to dwell on such solemn subjects  captain truck had regained his spirits for if he felt mortified at the extraordinary difficulties and dangers that had befallen his ship he also felt proud of the manner in which he had extricated himself from them as for the mates and crew they had already returned to their ordinary habits of toil and fun the accidents of life making but brief and superficial impressions on natures accustomed to vicissitudes and losses  mr dodge appeared to be nearly forgotten during the first week after the ship succeeded in effecting her escape for he had the sagacity to keep himself in the background in the hope that all connected with himself might be overlooked in the hurry and excitement of events at the end of that period however he resumed his intrigues and was soon actively engaged in endeavouring to get up a public opinion by means of which he proposed to himself to obtain some reputation for spirit and courage with what success this deeplylaid scheme was likely to meet as well as the more familiar condition of the cabins may be gathered by a conversation that took place in the pantry where saunders and toast were preparing the hot punch for the last of the saturday nights that captain truck expected to be at sea this discourse was held while the few who chose to join in jollification that peculiarly recalled the recollection of mr monday were slowly assembling round the great table at the urgent request of the master  well i must say mr toast the steward commenced as he kept stirring the punch that i am werry much rejoiced captain truck has resuscertated his old nature and remembers the festivals and fasts as is becoming the master of a liner i can see no good reason because a ship is under jurymasts that the passengers should forego their natural rest and diet mr monday made a good end they say and he had as handsome a burial as i ever laid eyes on at sea i dont think his own friends could have interred him more efficaciously or more piously had he been on shore  it is something mr saunders to be able to reflect beforehand on the respectable funeral that your friends have just given you there is a great gratification to contemplate on such an ewent  you improve in language toast that i will allow but you sometimes get the words a little wrong we suspect before a thing recurs and reflect on it after it has ewentuated you might have suspected the death of poor mr monday after he was wounded and reflected on it after he was interred in the water i agree with you that it is consoling to know we have our funeral rights properly delineated talking of the battle mr toast i shall take this occasion to express to you the high opinion i entertain of your own good conduct i was a little afraid you might injure captain truck in the conflict but so far as i have ascertained on close inwestigation you hurt nobody we coloured people have some prejudices against us and i always rejoice when i meet with one who assists to put them down by his conduck  they say mr dodge didnt do much harm either returned toast for my part i saw nothing of him after i opened my eyes though i dont think i ever stared about me so much in my life  saunders laid a finger on his nose and shook his head significantly  you may speak to me with confidence and mistrust toast he said for we are friends of the same colour besides being officers in the same pantry has mr dodge conwersed with you concerning the ewents of those two or three werry ewentful days  he has insinevated considerable mr saunders though i do not think mr dodge is ever a werry free talker  has he surgested the propriety of having an account of he whole affair made out by the people and sustained by affidavits  well sir i imagine he has at all ewents he has been much on the forecastle lately endeavouring to persuade the people that they retook the ship and that the passengers were so many encumbrancers in the affair  and are the people such non composses as to believe him toast  why sir it is agreeable to humanity to think well of ourselves i do not say that anybody actually believes this but in my poor judgment mr saunders there are men in the ship that would find it pleasant to believe it if they could  werry true for that is natural your hint toast has enlightened my mind on a little obscurity that has lately prewailed over my conceptions there are johnson and briggs and hewson three of the greatest skulks in the ship the only men who prewaricated in the least so much as by a cold look in the fight and these three men have told me that mr dodge was the person who had the gun put on the box and that he druv the arabs upon the raft now i say no men with their eyes open could have made such a mistake except they made it on purpose do you corroborate or contrawerse this statement toast  i contrawerse it sir for in my poor judgment it was mr blunt  i am glad we are of the same opinion i shall say nothing till the proper moment arrives and then i shall exhibit my sentiments mr toast without recrimination or anxiety for truth is truth  i am happy to observe that the ladies are quite relaxed from their melancholy and that they now seem to enjoy themselves ostensibly  saunders threw a look of envy at his subordinate whose progress in refinement really alarmed his own sense of superiority but suppressing the jealous feeling he replied with dignity  the remark is quite just mr toast and denotes penetration i am always rejoiced when i perceive you elewating your thoughts to superior objects for the honour of the colour  mister saunders called out the captain from his seal in the armchair at the head of the table  captain truck sir  let us taste your liquors  this was the signal that the saturdaynight was about to commence and the officers of the pantry presented their compounds in good earnest on this occasion the ladies had quietly but firmly declined being present but the earnest appeals of the wellmeaning captain had overcome the scruples of the gentlemen all of whom to avoid the appearance of disrespect to his wishes had consented to appear  this is the last saturday night gentlemen that i shall probably ever have the honour of passing in your good company said captain truck as he disposed of the pitchers and glasses before him so that he had a perfect command of the appliances of the occasion and i feel it to be a gratification with which i would not willingly dispense we are now to the westward of the gulf and according to my observations and calculations within a hundred miles of sandy hook which with this mild southwest wind and our weatherly position i hope to be able to show you some time about eight oclock tomorrow morning quicker passages have been made certainly but forty days after all is no great matter for the westerly run considering that we have had a look at africa and are walking on crutches  we owe a great deal to the trades observed mr effingham which have treated us as kindly towards the end of the passage as they seemed reluctant to join us in the commencement it has been a momentous month and i hope we shall all retain healthful recollections of it as long as we live  no one will retain as grateful recollections of it as myself gentlemen resumed the captain you had no agency in getting us into the scrape but the greatest possible agency in getting us out of it without the knowledge prudence and courage that you have all displayed god knows what would have become of the poor montauk and from the bottom of my heart i thank you each and all while i have the heartfelt satisfaction of seeing you around me and of drinking to your future health happiness and prosperity  the passengers acknowledged their thanks in return by bows among which that of mr dodge was the most elaborate and conspicuous the honest captain was too much touched to observe this little piece of audacity but at that moment he could have taken even mr dodge in his arms and pressed him to his heart  come gentlemen he continued let us fill and do honour to the night god has us all in his holy keeping and we drift about in the squalls of life pretty much as he orders the wind to blow sweethearts and wives and mr effingham we will not forget beautiful spirited sensible and charming daughters  after this piece of nautical gallantry the glass began to circulate the captain sir george templemoreas the false baronet was still called in the cabin and believed to be by all but those who belonged to the coterie of eveand mr dodge indulged freely though the first was too careful of the reputation of his ship to forget that he was on the american coast in november the others partook more sparingly though even they submitted in a slight degree to the influence of good cheer and for the first time since their escape the laugh was heard in the cabin as was wont before to be the case an hour of such indulgence produced again some of the freedom and ease which mark the associations of a ship after the ice is fairly broken and even mr dodge began to be tolerated this person notwithstanding his conduct on the occasion of the battle had contrived to maintain his ground with the spurious baronet by dint of assiduity and flattery while the others had rather felt pity than aversion on account of his abject cowardice the gentlemen did not mention his desertion at the critical moment though mr dodge never forgave those who witnessed it for they looked upon his conduct as the result of a natural and unconquerable infirmity that rendered him as much the subject of compassion as of reproach encouraged by this forbearance and mistaking its motives he had begun to hope his absence had not been detected in the confusion of the fight and he had even carried his audacity so far as to make an attempt to persuade mr sharp that he had actually been one of those who went in the launch of the dane to bring down the other boat and raft to the reef after the ship had been recaptured it is true in this attempt he had met with a cold repulse but it was so gentlemanlike and distant that he had still hopes of succeeding in persuading the other to believe what he affirmed by way of doing which he endeavoured all he could to believe it himself so much confusion existed in his own faculties during the fray that mr dodge was fain to fancy others also might not have been able to distinguish things very accurately  under the influence of these feelings captain truck when the glass had circulated a little freely called on the editor of the active inquirer to favour the company with some more extracts from his journal little persuasion was necessary and mr dodge went into his stateroom to bring forth the valuable records of his observations and opinions with a conviction that all was forgotten and that he was once more about to resume his proper place in the social relations of the ship as for the four gentlemen who had been over the ground the other pretended to describe they prepared to listen as men of the world would be apt to listen to the superficial and valueless comments of a tyro though not without some expectations of amusement  i propose that we shift the scene to london said captain truck in order that a plain seaman like myself may judge of the merits of the writerwhich i make no doubt are very great though i cannot now swear to it with as free a conscience as i could wish  if i knew the pleasure of the majority returned mr dodge dropping the journal and looking about him inquiringly i would cheerfully comply with it for i think the majority should always rule paris or london or the rhine are the same to me i have seen them all and am just as well qualified to describe the one as to describe the other  no one doubts it my dear sir but i am not as well qualified to understand one of your descriptions as i am to understand another perhaps evon you sir may express yourself more readily and have better understood what was said to you in english than in a foreign tongue  as for that i do not think the value of my remarks is lessened by the one circumstance or enhanced by the other sir i make it a rule always to be right if possible and that i fancy is as much as the natives of the countries themselves can very well effect you have only to decide gentlemen whether it shall be england or france or the continent  i confess an inclination to the continent said john effingham for one could scarcely wish to limit a comprehensiveness like that of mr dodges to an island or even to france  i see how it is exclaimed the captain we must put the traveller through all his paces and have a little of both so mr dodge will have the kindness to touch on all things in heaven and earth london and paris inclusive  on this hint the journalist turned over a few pages carelessly and then commenced  reached bruxelles mr dodge pronounced this word brucksills at seven in the evening and put up at the best house in the place called the silver lamb which is quite near the celebrated townhouse and of course in the very centre of the beau quarter as we did not leave until after breakfast next morning the reader may expect a description of this ancient capital it lies altogether on a bit of low level land  nay mr dodge interrupted the soidisant sir george i think that most be an error i have been at brussels and i declare now it struck me as lying a good deal on the side of a very steep hill  all a mistake sir i do assure you there is no more hill at brucksills than on the deck of this ship you have been in too great a hurry my dear sir george that is the way with most travellers they do not give themselves time to note particulars you english especially my dear sir george are a little apt to be precipitate and i dare say you travelled post with four horses a mode of getting on by which a man may very well transfer a hill in his imagination from one town to another i travelled chiefly in a voitury which afforded leisure for remarks  here mr dodge laughed for he felt that he had got the best of it  i think you are bound to submit sir george templemore said john effingham with an emphasis on the name that raised a smile among his friends brussels certainly lies on a flat and the hill you saw has doubtless been brought up with you from holland in your haste mr dodge enjoyed a great advantage in his mode of travelling for by entering a town in the evening and quitting it only in the morning he had the whole night to look about him  that was just my mode of proceeding mr john effingham i made it a rule to pass an entire night in every large town i came to  a circumstance that will give a double value to your opinions with our countrymen mr dodge since they very seldom give themselves half that leisure when once in motion i trust you have not passed over the institutions of belgium sir and most particularly the state of society in the capital of which you saw so much  by no means here are my remarks on these subjects  belgium or the belges as the country is now called is one of the upstart kingdoms that have arisen in our times and which from signs that cannot be mistaken is fated soon to be overturned by the glorious principles of freedom the people are ground down as usual by the oppression of hard taskmasters and bloodyminded priests the monarch who is a bigoted catholic of the house of saxony being the son of the king of that country and a presumptive heir to the throne of great britain in right of his first wife devoting all his thoughts to miracles and saints the nobles form a class by themselves indulging in all sorts of vicesi beg pardon sir george but the truth must be told in our country or one had better never speakall sorts of vices and otherwise betraying the monstrous tendencies of the system  pray mr dodge interrupted john effingham have you said nothing as to the manner in which the inhabitants relieve the eternal ennui of always walking on a level surface  i am afraid not sir my attention was chiefly given to the institutions and to the state of society although i can readily imagine they must get to be heartily tired of a dead flat  why sir they have contrived to run a street up and down the roof of the cathedral and up and down this street they trot all hours of the day  mr dodge looked distrustful but john effingham maintained his gravity after a pause the former continued  the usages of brucksills are a mixture of low dutch and high dutch habits as is the language the king being a polander and a grandson of augustus king of poland is anxious to introduce the customs of the russians into his court while his amiable young queen who was born in new jersey when her illustrious father kept the school at haddonfield early imbibed those notions of republicanism which so eminently distinguish his grace the honourable louis philippe orleans the present king of the french  nay mr dodge said mr sharp you will have all the historians ready to cut your throat with envy  why sir i feel it a duty not to throw away the great opportunities i have enjoyed and america is a country in which an editor may never hope to mystify his readers we deal with them in facts mr sharp and although this may not be your english practice we think that truth is powerful and will prevail to continuethe kingdom of the belges is about as large as the northeast corner of connecticut including one town in rhode island and the whole population may be about equal to that of our tribe of creek indians who dwell in the wilder parts of our state of georgia  this particularity is very convincing observed paul and then it has the merit too of coming from an eyewitness  i will now gentlemen return with you to paris where i stayed all of three weeks and of the society of which my knowledge of the language will of course enable me to give a still more valuable account  you mean to publish these hints i trust sir inquired the captain  i shall probably collect them and enlarge them in the way of a book but they have already been laid before the american public in the columns of the active inquirer i can assure you gentlemen that my colleagues of the press have spoken quite favourably of the letters as they appeared perhaps you would like to hear some of their opinions  hereupon mr dodge opened a pocketbook out of which he took six or eight slips of printed paper that had been preserved with care though obviously well thumbed opening one he read as follows  our friend dodge of the active inquirer is instructing his readers and edifying mankind in general with some very excellent and pungent remarks on the state of europe which part of the world he is now exploring with some such enterprise and perseverance as columbus discovered when he entered on the unknown waste of the atlantic his opinions meet with our unqualified approbation being sound american and discriminating we fancy these europeans will begin to think in time that jonathan has some pretty shrewd notions concerning themselves the critturs this was extracted from the peoples advocate a journal edited with great ability by peleg pond esquire a thoroughgoing republican and a profound observer of mankind  in his own parish in particular quaintly added john effingham pray sir have you any more of these critical morceaux  at least a dozen beginning to read againsteadfast dodge esquire the editor of the active inquirer is now travelling in europe and is illuminating the public mind at home by letters that are johnsonian in style chesterfieldian in taste and in knowledge of the world with the redeeming qualities of nationality and republicanism and truth we rejoice to perceive by these valuable contributions to american literature that steadfast dodge esquire finds no reason to envy the inhabitants of the old world any of their boasted civilization but that on the contrary he is impressed with the superiority of our condition over all countries every post that he progresses america has produced but few men like dodge and even walter scott might not be ashamed to own some of his descriptions we hope he may long continue to travel  voitury added john effingham gravely you perceive gentlemen how modestly these editors set forth their intimacy with the travellerour friend dodge of the active inquirer and steadfast dodge esquirea mode of expression that speaks volumes for their own taste and their profound deference for their readers  we always speak of each other in this manner mr john effinghamthat is our esprit du corps  and i should think that there would be an esprit de corps in the public to resist it observed paul blunt  the distinction was lost on mr dodge who turned over to one of his most elaborate strictures on the state of society in france with all the selfcomplacency of besotted ignorance and provincial superciliousness searching out a place to his mind this profound observer of men and manners who had studied a foreign people whose language when spoken was gibberish to him by travelling five days in a public coach and living four weeks in taverns and eatinghouses besides visiting three theatres in which he did not understand a single word that was uttered proceeded to lay before his auditors the results of his observations  the state of female society in france is truly awful he resumed the french revolution as is universally known having left neither decorum modesty nor beauty in the nation i walk nightly in the galleries of the palais royal where i locate myself and get every opportunity of observing the peculiarities of ladies of the first taste and fashion in the metropolis of europe there is one duchess in particular whose grace and embonpoint have i confess attracted my admiration this lady as my lacquais de place informs me is sometimes termed la mère du peuple from her popularity and affability the young ladies of france judging from the specimens i have seen herewhich must be of the highest class in the capital as the spot is under the windows of one of the royal palacesare by no means observable for that quiet reserve and modest diffidence that distinguish the fair among our own young countrywomen but it must be admitted they are remarkable for the manner in which they walk alone in my judgment a most masculine and unbecoming practice woman was not made to live alone and i shall contend that she was not made to walk alone at the same time i confess here is a certain charm in the manner in which these ladies place a hand in each pocket of their aprons and balance their bodies as they move like duchesses through the galleries if i might humbly suggest the american fair might do worse than imitate this parisian step for as a traveller i feel it a duty to exhibit any superior quality that other nations possess i would also remark on the general suavity of manners that the ladies of quality this word mr dodge pronounced quaality observe in their promenades in and about this genteel quarter of paris  the french ladies ought to be much flattered with this notice of them cried the captain filling mr dodges glass in the name of truth and penetration sir proceed  i have lately been invited to attend a ball in one of the first families of france which resides in the rue st jaques or the st james of paris the company was select and composed of many of the first persons in the kingdom of des français the best possible manners were to be seen here and the dancing was remarkable for its grace and beauty the air with which the ladies turned their heads on one side and inclined their bodies in advancing and retiring was in the first style of the court of terpsichore they were all of the very first families of france i heard one excuse herself for going away so early as madame la duchesse expected her and another observed that she was to leave town in the morning with madame la vicomtesse the gentlemen with few exceptions were in fancy dresses appearing in coats some of skyblue some green some scarlet and some navyblue as fancy dictated and all more or less laced on the seams much in the manner as was the case with the honourable the king the morning i saw him leave for nully this entertainment was altogether the best conducted of any i ever attended the gentlemen being condescending and without the least pride and the ladies all grace  graces would be more expressive if you will excuse my suggesting a word sir observed john effingham as the other paused to take breath  i have observed that the people in most monarchies are abject and lowminded in their deportment thus the men take off their hats when they enter churches although the minister be not present and even the boys take off their hats when they enter private houses this is commencing servility young i have even seen men kneeling on the cold pavements of the churches in the most abject manner and otherwise betraying the feeling naturally created by slavish institutions  lord help em exclaimed the captain if they begin so young what a bowing and kneeling set of blackguards they will get to be in time  it is to be presumed that mr dodge has pointed out the consequences in the instance of the abject old men mentioned who probably commenced their servility by entering houses with their hats off said john effingham  just so sir rejoined the editor i throw in these little popular traits because i think they show the differences between nations  from which i infer said mr sharp that in your part of america boys do not take off their hats when they enter houses nor men kneel in churches  certainly not sir our people get their ideas of manliness early and as for kneeling in churches we have some superstitioussectsi do not mention them but on the whole no nation can treat the house of god more rationally than we do in america  that i will vouch for rejoined john effingham for the last time i was at home i attended a concert in one of them where an artiste of singular nasal merit favoured the company with that admirable piece of conjoined sentiment and music entitled fourandtwenty fiddlers all in a row  ill engage for it cried mr dodge swelling with national pride and felt all the time as independent and easy as if he was in a tavern oh superstition is quite extinct in ameriky but i have a few remarks on the church in my notes upon england perhaps you would like to hear them  let me entreat you to read them said the true sir george templemore a little eagerly  now i protest against any liberality added the false sir george shaking his finger  mr dodge disregarded both but turning to the place he read aloud with his usual selfcomplacency and unction  today i attended public worship in stchurch minories the congregation was composed of many of the first people of england among whom were present sir solomon snore formerly high sheriff of london a gentleman of the first consideration in the empire and the celebrated mr shilling of the firm of pound shilling and pence there was certainly a fine air of polite life in the congregation but a little too much idolatry sir solomon and mr shilling were both received with distinction which was very proper when we remember their elevated rank but the genuflexions and chaunting met with my very unqualified disapprobation  sir solomon and the other personage you mention were a little pursy perhaps observed mr sharp which destroyed their grace  i disapprove of all kneeling on general principles sir if we kneel to one we shall get to kneel to another and no one can tell where it will end the exclusive manner in which the congregation were seated in pews with sides so high that it was difficult to see your nearest neighbour and these pews mr dodge pronounced this word poohs have often curtains that completely enclose their owners a system of selfishness that would not be long tolerated in ameriky  do individuals own their pews in america inquired mr sharp  often returned john effingham always except in those particular portions of the country where it is deemed invidious and contrary to the public rights to be better off than ones neighbour by owning any thing that all the community has not a better claim to than its proprietor  and canot the owner of a pew curtain it with a view to withdrawn into it himself at public worship  america and england are the antipodes of each other in all these things i dare say now that you have come among us with an idea that our liberty is so very licentious that a man may read a newspaper by himself  i confess certainly to that much returned mr sharp smiling  we shall teach him better than this mr dodge before we let him depart no sir you have very contracted ideas of liberty i perceive with us every thing is settled by majorities we eat when the majority eats drink when the majority drinks sleep when the majority sleeps pray when the majority prays so far from burying ourselves in deep wells of pews with curtains round their edges we have raised the floors amphitheatre fashion so that every body can see every body have taken away the sides of the pews which we have converted into free and equal seats and have cut down the side of the pulpit so that we can look at the clergyman but i understand there is actually a project on foot to put the congregation into the pulpit and the parson into the aisle by way of letting the latter see that he is no better than he should be this would be a capital arrangement mr dodge for the fourandtwenty fiddlers all in a row  the editor of the active inquirer was a little distrustful of john effingham and he was not sorry to continue his extracts although he was obliged to bring himself still further under the fire of his assailant  this morning mr dodge resumed i stepped into the coffeeroom of the shovel and tongs publichouse to read the morning paper and taking a seat by the side of a gentleman who was reading the times and drawing to me the leaves of the journal so that it would be more convenient to peruse the man insolently and arrogantly demanded of me what the devil i meant this intolerance in the english character is owing to the narrowness of the institutions under which men come to fancy liberty applies to persons instead of majorities  you perceive mr sharp said john effingham how much more able a stranger is to point out the defects of national character than a native i dare say that in indulging your individuality hitherto you have imagined you were enjoying liberty  i fear i have committed some such weaknessbut mr dodge will have the goodness to proceed  the editor complied as followsnothing has surprised me more than the grovelling propensities of the english on the subject of names thus this very inn which in america would be styled the eagle tavern or the oriental or occidental hotel or the anglosaxon democratical coffeehouse or some other equally noble or dignified appellation is called the shovel and tongs one tavern which might very appropriately be termed the saloon of peace is very vulgarly called dollys chophouse  all the gentlemen not excepting mr sharp murmured their disgust at so coarse a taste but most of the party began now to tire of this pretending ignorance and provincial vulgarity and one by one most of them soon after left the table captain truck however sent for mr leach and these two worthies with mr dodge and the spurious baronet sat an hour longer when all retired to their berths     chapter xxxii      ill meet thee at philippi    shakespeare   happy is the man who arrives on the coast of new york with the wind at the southward in the month of november there are two particular conditions of the weather in which the stranger receives the most unfavourable impressions of the climate that has been much and unjustly abused but which two particular conditions warrant all the evil that has been said of it one is a sweltering day in summer and the other an autumnal day in which the dry north wind scarce seems to leave any marrow in the bones  the passengers of the montauk escaped both these evils and now approached the coast with a bland southwest breeze and a soft sky the ship had been busy in the night and when the party assembled on deck in the morning captain truck told them that in an hour they should have a sight of the longdesired western continent as the packet was inning in at the rate of nine knots under topmast and topgallant studdingsails being to windward of her port this was a promise that the gallant vessel seemed likely enough to redeem  toast called out the captain who had dropped into his old habits as naturally as if nothing had occurred bring me a coal and you master steward look well to the breakfast this morning if the wind stands six hours longer i shall have the grief of parting with this good company and you the grief of knowing you will never set another meal before them these are moments to awaken sentiment and yet i never knew an officer of the pantry that did not begin to grin as he drew near his port  it is usually a cheerful moment with every one i believe captain truck said eve and most of all should it be one of heartfelt gratitude with us  ay ay my dear young lady and yet i fancy mr saunders will explain it rather differently has no one sung out land yet from aloft mr leach the sands of new jersey ought to be visible before this  we have seen the haze of the land since daylight but not land itself  then like old columbus the flowered doublet is mineland ho  the mates and the people laughed and looking ahead they nodded to each other and the word land passed from mouth to mouth with the indifference with which mariners first see it in short passages not so with the rest they crowded together and endeavoured to catch a glimpse of the coveted shore though with the exception of paul neither could perceive it  we must call on you for assistance said eve who now seldom addressed the handsome young seaman without a flush on her own beautiful face for we are all so luberly that none of us can see that which we so earnestly desire  have the kindness to look over the stock of that anchor said paul glad of an excuse to place himself nearer to eve and you will discover an object on the water  i do said eve but is it not a vessel  it is but a little to the right of that vessel do you not perceive a hazy object at some elevation above the sea  the cloud you meana dim illdefined dark body of vapour  so it may seem to you but to me it appears to be the land that is the blufflike termination of the celebrated high lands of navesink by watching it for half an hour you will perceive its form and surface grow gradually more distinct  eve eagerly pointed out the place to mademoiselle vielville and her father and from that moment for near an hour most of the passengers kept it steadily in view as paul had said the blue of this hazy object deepened then its base became connected with the water and it ceased to resemble a cloud at all in twenty more minutes the faces and angles of the hills became visible and trees started out of their sides in the end a pair of twin lights were seen perched on the summit  but the montauk edged away from these highlands and shaped her course towards a long low spit of sand that lay several miles to the northward of them in this direction fifty small sail were gathering into or diverging from the pass their high gauntlooking canvas resembling so many church towers on the plains of lombardy these were coasters steering towards their several havens two or three outwardbound ships were among them holding their way in the direction of china the pacific ocean or europe  about nine the montauk met a large ship standing on bowline with every thing set that would draw and heaping the water under her bows a few minutes after captain truck whose attention had been much diverted from the surrounding objects by the care of his ship came near the group of passengers and once more entered into conversation  here we are my dear young lady he cried within five leagues of sandy hook which lies hereaway under our lee bow as pretty a position as heart could wish the lank hungrylooking schooner inshore of us is a new vessel and as soon as she is done with the brig near her we shall have her in chase when there will be a good opportunity to get rid of all our spare lies this little fellow to leeward who is clawing up towards us is the pilot after whose arrival my functions cease and i shall have little to do but to rattle off saunders and toast and to feed the pigs  and who is this gentleman ahead of us with his maintopsail to the mast his courses in the brails and his helm alee asked paul  some chap who has forgotten his kneebuckles and has been obliged to send a boat up to town to hunt for them coolly rejoined the captain while he sought the focus of the glass and levelled it at the vessel in question the look was long and steady and twice captain truck lowered the instrument to wipe the moisture from his own eye at length he called out to the amazement of every body  stand by to in all studdingsails and to ware to the eastward be lively men be lively the eternal foam as i am a miserable sinner  paul laid a hand on the arm of captain truck and stopped him as the other was about to spring towards the forecastle with a view to aid and encourage his people  you forget that we have neither spars nor sails suited to a chase said the young man if we haul off to seaward on any tack we can try the corvette will be too much for us now and excuse me if i say that a different course will be advisable  the captain had learned to respect the opinion of paul and he took the interference kindly  what choice remains but to run down into the very jaws of the lion he asked or to wear round and stand to the eastward  we have two alternatives we may pass unnoticed the ship being so much altered or we may haul up on the tack we are on and get into shallow water  he draws as little as this ship sir and would follow there is no port short of egg harbour and into that i should be bashful about entering with a vessel of this size whereas by running to the eastward and doubling montauk which would owe us shelter on account of our name i might get into the sound or new london at need and then claim the sweepstakes as having won the race  this would be impossible captain truck allow me to say dead before the wind we cannot escape for the land would fetch us up in a couple of hours to enter by sandy hook if known is impossible on account of the corvette and in a chase of a hundred and twenty miles we should be certain to be overtaken  i fear you are right my dear sir i fear you are right the studdingsails are now in and i will haul up for the highlands and anchor under them should it be necessary we can then give this fellow vattel in large quantities for i hardly think he will venture to seize us while we have an anchor fast to good american ground  how near dare you stand to the shore  within a mile ahead of us but to enter the hook the bar must be crossed a league or two off  the latter is unlucky but by all means get the vessel in with the land so near as to leave no doubt as to our being in american waters  well try him sir well try him after having escaped the arabs the deuce is in it if we cannot weather upon john bull i beg your pardon mr sharp but this is a question that must be settled by some of the niceties of the great authorities  the yards were now braced forward and the ship was brought to the wind so as to head in a little to the northward of the bathinghouses at long branch but for this sudden change of course the montauk would have run down dead upon the corvette and possibly might have passed her undetected owing to the change made in her appearance by the spars of the dane so long as she continued bows on standing towards them not a soul on board the foam suspected her real character though now that she acted so strangely and offered her broadside to view the truth became known in an instant the mainyard of the corvette was swung and her sails were filled on the same course as that on which the packet was steering the two vessels were about ten miles from the land the foam a little ahead but fully a league to leeward the latter however soon tacked and stood inshore this brought the vessels nearly abreast of each other the corvette a mile or more dead to leeward and distant now some six miles from the coast the great superiority of the corvettes sailing was soon apparent to all on board both vessels for she apparently went two feet to the packets one  the history of this meeting so unexpected to captain truck was very simple when the gale had abated the corvette which had received no damage hauled up along the african coast keeping as near as possible to the supposed track of the packet and failing to fall in with her chase she had filled away for new york on making the hook she took a pilot and inquired if the montauk had arrived from the pilot she learned that the vessel of which she was in quest had not yet made its appearance and she sent an officer up to the town to communicate with the british consul on the return of this officer the corvette stood away from the land and commenced cruising in the offing for a week she had now been thus occupied it being her practice to run close in in the morning and to remain hovering about the bar until near night when she made sail for an offing when first seen from the montauk she had been lyingto to take in stores sent from the town and to communicate with a newsboat  the passengers of the montauk had just finished their breakfast when the mate reported that the ship was fast shoaling her water and that it would be necessary to alter the course in a few minutes or to anchor on repairing to the deck captain truck and his companions perceived the land less than a mile ahead of them and the corvette about half that distance to the leeward and nearly abeam  that is a bold fellow exclaimed the captain or he has got a sandy hook pilot on board him  most probably the latter said paul he would scarcely be here on this duty and neglect so simple a precaution  i think this would satisfy mr vattel sir returned captain truck as the man in the chains sung out and a half hree hard up with the helm and lay the yards square mr leach  now we shall soon know the virtue of vattel said john effingham as ten minutes will suffice to raise the question very fairly  the foam put her helm down and tacked beautifully to the southeast as soon as the montauk which vessel was now running along shore keeping in about four fathoms water the sea being as smooth as a pond was abeam the corvette wore round and began to close with her chase keeping on her eastern or outer board  were we an enemy and a match for that sloop said paul this smooth water and yardarm attitude would make quick work  her captain is in the gangway taking our measure observed mr truck here is the glass i wish you to examine his face and tell me if you think him a man with whom the law of nations will avail anything see the anchor clear mr leach for im determined to bring up all standing if the gentleman intends to renew the old tricks of john bull on our coast what do you make of him mr blunt  paul did not answer but laying down the glass he paced the deck rapidly with the manner of one much disturbed all observed this sudden change though no one presumed to comment on it in the mean time the sloopofwar came up fast and in a few minutes her larboard foreyardarm was within twenty feet of the starboard mainyardarm of the montauk the two vessels running on parallel lines the corvette now hauled up her forecourse and let her topgallant sails settle on the caps though a dead silence reigned in her  give me the trumpet said captain truck stepping to the rail the gentleman is about to give us a piece of his mind  the english captain who was easily known by his two epaulettes also held a trumpet but neither of the two commanders used his instrument the distance being sufficiently near for the natural voice  i believe sir commenced the manofwarsman that i have the pleasure to see captain truck of the montauk london packet  ay ay ill warrant you he has my name alongside of john doe and richard roe muttered mr truck spell as carefully as it could be in a primeri am captain truck and this is the montauk may i ask the name of your vessel and your own sir  this is his britannic majestys ship the foam captain ducie  the honourable captain ducie exclaimed mr sharp i thought i recognised the voice i know him intimately well  will he stand vattel anxiously demanded mr truck  nay as for that i must refer you to himself  you appear to have suffered in the gale resumed captain ducie whose smile was very visible as he thus addressed them like an old acquaintance we fared better ourselves for i believe we did not part a ropeyarn  the ship pitched every stick out of her returned captain truck and has given us the trouble of a new outfit  in which you appear to have succeeded admirably your spars and sails are a size or two too small but every thing stands like a church  ay ay now we have got on our new clothes we are not ashamed to be seen  may i ask if you have been in port to do all this  no sir picked them up alongshore  the honourable captain ducie thought he was quizzed and his manner became a little more cold though it still retained its gentlemanlike tone  i wish much to see you in private sir on an affair of some magnitude and i greatly regret it was not in my power to speak you the night you left portsmouth i am quite aware you are in your own waters and i feel a strong reluctance to retain your passengers when so near their port but i shall feel it as a particular favour if you will permit me to repair on board for a few minutes  with all my heart cried captain truck if you will give me room i will back my maintopsail but i wish to lay my head off shore this gentleman understands vattel and we shall have no trouble with him keep the anchor clear mr leach for fair words butter no parsnips still he is a gentlemanand saunders put a bottle of the old madeira on the cabin table  captain ducie now left the rigging in which he had stood and the corvette luffed off to the eastward to give room to the packet where she hoveto with her foretopsail aback the montauk followed taking a position under her lee a quarterboat was lowered and in five minutes its oars were tossed at the packets leegangway when the commander of the corvette ascended the ships side followed by a middleaged man in the dress of a civilian and a chubbyfaced midshipman  no one could mistake captain ducie for anything but a gentleman he was handsome wellformed and about fiveandtwenty the bow he made to eve with whose beauty and air he seemed instantly struck would have become a drawingroom but he was too much of an officer to permit any further attention to escape him until he had paid his respects to and received the compliments of captain truck he then turned to the ladies and mr effingham and repeated his salutations  i fear he said my duty has made me the unwilling instrument of prolonging your passage for i believe few ladies love the ocean sufficiently easily to forgive those who lengthen its disagreeables  we are old travellers and know how to allow for the obligations of duty mr effingham civilly answered  that they do sir put in captain truck and it was never my good fortune to have a more agreeable set of passengers mr effingham the honourable captain duciethe honourable captain ducie mr effinghammr john effingham mamselle vav endeavouring always to imitate eves pronunciation of the namemr dodge the honourable captain ducie the honourable captain ducie mr dodge  the honourable captain ducie and all the others the editor of the active inquirer excepted smiled slightly though they respectively bowed and curtseyed but mr dodge who conceived himself entitled to be formally introduced to every one he met and to know all he saw whether introduced or not stepped forward promptly and shook mr ducie very cordially by the hand  captain truck now turned in quest of some one else to introduce mr sharp stood near the capstan and paul had retired as far aft as the hurricanehouse  i am happy to see you in the montauk added captain truck insensibly leading the other towards the capstan and am sorry i had not the satisfaction of meeting you in england the honourable captain ducie mr sharp mr sharp the honourable captain  george templemore exclaimed the commander of the corvette looking from one to the other  charles ducie exclaimed the soidisant mr sharp  here then is an end of part of my hopes and we have been on a wrong scent the whole time  perhaps not ducie explain yourself  you must have perceived my endeavours to speak you from the moment you sailed  to speak us cried captain truck yes sir we did observe your endeavours to speak us  it was because i was given to understand that one calling himself sir george templemore an impostor however had taken passage in this ship and here i find that we have been misled by the real sir george templemores having chosen to come this way instead of coming by the liverpool ship so much for your confounded fashionable caprices templemore which never lets you know in the morning whether you are to shoot yourself or to get married before night  and is this gentleman sir george templemore pithily demanded captain truck  for that i can vouch on the knowledge of my whole life  and we know this to be true and have known it since the day we sailed observed mr effingham  captain truck was accustomed to passengers under false names but never before had he been so completely mystified  and pray sir he inquired of the baronet are you a member of parliament  i have that honour  and templemore hall is your residence and you have come out to look at the canadas  i am the owner of templemore hall and hope to look at the canadas before i return  and turning to captain ducie you sailed in quest of another sir george templemorea false one  that is a part of my errand returned captain ducie smiling  nothing elseyou are certain sir that this is the whole of your errand  i confess to another motive rejoined the other scarce knowing how to take captain trucks question but this one will suffice for the present i hope  this business requires frankness i mean nothing disrespectful but i am in american waters and should be sorry after all to be obliged to throw myself on vattel  let me act as mediator interrupted sir george templemore some one has been a defaulter ducie is it not so  this is the simple truth an unfortunate but silly young man of the name of sandon he was intrusted with a large sum of the public money and has absconded with quite forty thousand pounds  and this person you fancy did me the honour to travel under my name  of that we are certain mr green here motioning to the civilian comes from the same office and traced the delinquent under your name some distance on the portsmouth road when we heard that a sir george templemore had actually embarked in the montauk the admiral made no scruple in sending me after the packet this has been an unlucky mistake for me as it would have been a feather in the cap of so young a commander to catch the rogue  you may choose your feather sir returned captain truck for you will have a right to wear it the unfortunate young man you seek is out of question in this ship  captain truck now explained that there was a person below who had been known to him as sir george templemore and who doubtless was the unhappy delinquent sought but captain ducie did not betray the attention or satisfaction that one would have expected from this information his eye being riveted on paul who stood beneath the hurricanehouse when the latter saw that he attracted attention he advanced slowly even reluctantly upon the quarterdeck the meeting between these two gentlemen was embarrassed though each maintained his selfpossession  mr powis i believe said the officer bowing haughtily  captain ducie if i am not mistaken returned the other lifting his hat steadily though his face became flushed  the manner of the two however was but little noticed at the moment though all heard the words captain truck drew a long wheeew for this was rather more than even he was accustomed to in the way of masquerades his eye was on the two gentlemen as they walked aft together and alone when he felt a touch upon his arm it was the little hand of eve between whom and the old seaman there existed a good deal of trifling blended with the most entire goodwill the young lady laughed with her sweet eyes shook her fair curls and said mockingly  mr sharp mr blunt mr blunt mr sharp  and were you in the secret all this time my dear young lady  every minute of it from the buoys of portsmouth to this very spot  i shall be obliged to introduce my passengers all over again  certainly and i would recommend that each should show a certificate of baptism or a passport before you announce his or her name  you are at least the beautiful miss effingham my dear young lady  ill not vouch for that even said eve blushing and laughing  that is mr john effingham i hope  for that i can vouch there are not two cousin jacks on earth  i wish i knew what the other business of this gentleman is he seems amicably disposed except as regards mr blunt they looked coldly and suspiciously at each other  eve thought so too and she lost all her desire for pleasantry just at this moment captain ducie quitted his companion both touching their hats distantly and returned to the group he had so unceremoniously left a few minutes before  i believe captain truck you now know my errand he said and can say whether you will consent to my examining the person whom you have mentioned  i know one of your errands sir you spoke of having two  both will find their completion in this ship with your permission  permission that sounds well at least my dear young lady permit me to inquire captain ducie has either of your errands the flavour of tobacco about it  the young man looked surprised and he began to suspect another mystification  the question is so singular that it is not very intelligible  i wish to know captain ducie if you have anything to say to this ship in the way of smuggling  certainly not i am not a customhouse officer sir nor on the revenue duty and i had supposed this vessel a regular packet whose interest is too plain to enter into such a pursuit  you have supposed nothing but the truth sir though we cannot always answer for the honesty or discretion of our people a single pound of tobacco might forfeit this noble ship and observing the perseverance with which you have chased me i was afraid all was not right with the excise  you have had a needless alarm then for my two objects in coming to america are completely answered by meeting with mr powis and the mr sandon who i have been given to understand is in his stateroom below  the party looked at each other but nothing was said  such being the facts captain ducie i beg to offer you every facility so far as the hospitality of my ship is concerned  you will permit us to have an interview with mr sandon  beyond a doubt i see sir you have read vattel and understand the rights of neutrals or of independent nations as this interview most probably will be interesting you may desire to have it held in private and a stateroom will be too small for the purpose my dear young lady will you have the complaisance to lend us your cabin for half an hour  eve bowed assent and captain truck then invited the two englishmen below  my presence at this interview is of little moment observed captain ducie mr green is master of the whole affair and i have a matter of importance to arrange with mr powis if one or two of you gentlemen will have the kindess to be present and witnesses of what passes between mr sandon and mr green it would be a great favour templemore i may claim this of you  with all my heart though it is an unpleasant office to see guilt exposed should i presume too much by asking mr john effingham to be of our party  i was about to make the same request put in the captain we shall then be two englishmen and two yankeesif mr john effingham will allow me so to style him  until we get within the hook captain truck i am a yankee once in the country i belong to the middle states if you will allow me the favour to choose  the last speaker was stopped by a nudge from captain truck who seized an opportunity to whisper  make no such distinction between outside and inside i beg of you my dear sir i hold that the ship is at this identical moment in the united states of america in a positive sense as well as by a legal fiction and i think vattel will bear me out in it  let it pass for that then i will be present at your interview with the fugitive if the case is not clear against him he shall be protected  things were now soon arranged it being decided that mr green who belonged to one of the english offices accompanied by the gentlemen just named should descend to the cabin of miss effingham in order to receive the delinquent while captain ducie should have his interview with paul powis in the stateroom of the latter  the first party went below immediately but captain ducie remained on deck a minute or two to give an order to the midshipman of his boat who immediately quitted the montauk and pulled to the corvette during this brief delay paul approached the ladies to whom he spoke with a forced indifference though it was not possible to avoid seeing his concern  his servant too was observed watching his movements with great interest and when the two gentlemen went below in company the man shrugged his shoulders and actually held up his hands as one is wont to do at the occurrence of any surprising or distressing circumstance     chapter xxxiii      norfolk for thee remains a heavy doom   which i with some unwillingness pronounce    shakspeare   the history of the unfortunate young man who after escaping all the hazards and adventures of the passage was now so unexpectedly overtaken as he was about to reach what he fancied an asylum was no more than one of those commonplace tissue of events that lead through vanity and weakness to crime his father had held an office under the british government marrying late and leaving a son and daughter just issuing into life at the time of his decease the situation he had himself filled had been given to the first out of respect to the unwearied toil of a faithful servant  the young man was one of those who without principles or high motives live only for vanity of prominent vices he had none for there were no salient points in his character on which to hang any quality of sufficient boldness to encourage crime of that nature perhaps he owed his ruin to the circumstance that he had a tolerable person and was six feet high as much as to any one other thing his father had been a short solid squarebuilt little man whose ambition never towered above his stature and who having entered fairly on the path of industry and integrity early in life had sedulously persevered in it to the end not so with the son he read so much about aristocratic stature aristocratic ears aristocratic hands aristocratic feet and aristocratic air that he was delighted to find that in all these high qualities he was not easily to be distinguished from most of the young men of rank he occasionally saw riding in the parks or met in the streets and though he very well knew he was not a lord he began to fancy it a happiness to be thought one by strangers for an hour or two in a week  his passion for trifles and toys was inherent and it had been increased by reading two or three caricatures of fashionable men in the novels of the day until his happiness was chiefly centered in its indulgence this was an expensive foible and its gratification ere long exhausted his legitimate means one or two trifling and undetected peculations favoured his folly until a large sum happening to lie at his sole mercy for a week or two he made such an inroad on it as compelled a flight having made up his mind to quit england he thought it would be as easy to escape with forty thousand pounds as with the few hundreds he had already appropriated to himself this capital mistake was the cause of his destruction for the magnitude of the sum induced the government to take unusual steps to recover it and was the true cause of its having despatched the cruiser in chase of the montauk  the mr green who had been sent to identify the fugitive was a cold methodical man every way resembling the delinquents father whose officecompanion he had been and in whose track of undeviating attention to business and negative honesty he had faithfully followed he felt the peculation or robbery for it scarce deserved a milder term to be a reproach on the corps to which he belonged besides leaving a stigma on the name of one to whom he had himself looked up as to a model for his own imitation and government it will readily be supposed therefore that this person was not prepared to meet the delinquent in a very forgiving mood  saunders said captain truck in the stern tone with which he often hailed atop and which implied that instant obedience was a condition of his forbearance go to the stateroom of the person who has called himself sir george templemoregive him my complimentsbe very particular mr saundersand say captain trucks compliments and then tell him i expect the honour of his company in this cabinthe honour of his company remember in this cabin if that dont bring him out of his stateroom ill contrive something that shall  the steward turned up the white of his eyes shrugged his shoulders and proceeded forthwith on the errand he found time however to stop in the pantry and to inform toast that their suspicions were at least in part true  this elucidates the circumstance of his having no attendant with him like other gentlemen on board and a wariety of other incidents that much needed dewelopement mr blunt i do collect from a few hints on deck turns out to be a mr powis a much genteeler name and as they spoke to some one in the ladies cabin as sir george i should not be overcome with astonishment should mr sharp actually eventuate as the real baronite  there was time for no more and saunders proceeded to summon the delinquent  this is the most unpleasant part of the duty of a packetmaster between england and america continued captain truck as soon as saunders was out of sight scarce a ship sails that it has not some runaway or other either in the steerage or in the cabins and we are often called on to aid the civil authorities on both sides of the water  america seems to be a favourite country with our english rogues observed the officeman drily this is the third that has gone from our own department within as many years  your department appears to be fruitful of such characters sir returned captain truck pretty much in the spirit in which the first remark had been given  mr green was as thoroughgoing an englishman as any of his class in the island methodical plodding industrious and regular in all his habits he was honest by rule and had no leisure or inclination for any other opinions than those which were obtained with the smallest effort in consequence of the limited sphere in which he dwelt in a moral sense at least he was a mass of the prejudices that were most prevalent at the period when he first obtained his notions his hatred of france was unconquerable for he had early learned to consider her as the fast enemy of england and as to america he deemed her to be the general asylum of all the rogues of his own countrythe possession of a people who had rebelled against their king because the restraints of law were inherently disagreeable to them this opinion he had no more wish to proclaim than he felt a desire to go up and down declaring that satan was the father of sin but the fact in the one case was just as well established in his mind as in the other if he occasionally betrayed the existence of these sentiments it was as a man coughs not because he particularly wishes to cough but because he cannot help it finding the subject so naturally introduced therefore it is no wonder if some of his peculiar notions escaped him in the short dialogue that followed  we have our share of bad men i presume sir he rejoined to the thrust of captain truck but the thing that has most attracted comment with us is the fact that they all go to america  and we receive our share of rogues i presume sir and it is the subject of animadversion with us that they all come from england  mr green did not feel the force of this retort but he wiped his spectacles as he quietly composed his features into look of dignified gravity  some of your most considerable men in america i believe sir he continued have been englishmen who preferred a residence in the colonies to a residence at home  i never heard of them returned the captain will you have the goodness to name just one  why to begin there was your washington i have often heard my father say that he went to school with him in warwickshire and that he was thought anything but very clever too while he lived in england  you perceive then that we made something of him when we got him over on this side for he turned out in the end to be a very decent and respectable sort of person judging from the language of some of your prints sir i should suppose that king william enjoyed the reputation of being a respectable man in your country  although startled to hear his sovereign spoken of in this irreverent manner mr green answered promptly  he is a king sir and comports himself as a king  and all the better i dare say for the thrashing he got when a youngster from the vermont tailor  now captain truck quite as religiously believed in this vulgar tale concerning the prince in question as mr green believed that washington had commenced his career as one no better than he should be or as implicitly as mr steadfast dodge gave credit to the ridiculous history of the schoolmaster of haddonfield all three of the legends belonging to the same high class of historical truths  sir george templemore looked with surprise at john effingham who gravely remarked  elegant extracts sir from the vulgar rumours of two great nations we deal largely in these legends and you are not quite guiltless of them i dare say now if you would be frank that you yourself have not always been deaf to the reports against america  you surely do not imagine that i am so ignorant of the career of washington  of that i fully acquit you nor do i exactly suppose that your present monarch was flogged by a tailor in vermont or that louis phillipe kept school in new jersey our position in the world raises us beyond these elegancies but do you not fancy some hard things of america more especially concerning her disposition to harbour rogues if they come with full pockets  the baronet laughed but he coloured he wished to be liberal for he well knew that liberality distinguishes the man of the world and was an indispensable requisite for a gentleman but it is very hard for an englishman to manifest true liberality towards the cidevant colonies and this he felt in the whole of his moral system notwithstanding every effort to the contrary  i will confess that case of stephenson made an unfavourable impression in england he said with some reluctance  you mean the absconding member of parliament returned john effingham with emphasis on the four last words you cannot mean to reproach us with his selection of a place of refuge for he was picked up at sea by a foreign ship that was accidentally bound to america  certainly not with that circumstance which as you say was purely an accident but was there not something extraordinary in his liberation from arrest  sir george templemore there are few englishmen with whom i would dwell an instant on this subject said john effingham gravely but you are one of those who have taught me to respect you and i feel a strong regret whenever i trace any of these mistaken notions in a man of your really generous disposition a moments reflection will show you that no civilized society could exist with the disposition you hint at and as for the particular case you have mentioned the man did not bring money of any moment with him and was liberated from arrest on a principle common to all law where law is stronger than political power and which principle we derive directly from great britain depend on it so far from there being a desire to receive rich rogues in america from other countries there is a growing indisposition to receive emigrants at all for their number is getting to be inconvenient to the native population  why does not america pass reciprocal laws with us then for the mutual delivery of criminals  one insuperable objection to such a reciprocity arises from the nature of our government as a confederation since there is no identity in our own criminal jurisprudence but a chief reason is the exceedingly artificial condition of your society which is the very opposite of our own and indisposes the american to visit trifling crimes with so heavy punishments the american who has a voice in this matter you will remember is not prepared to hang a halfstarved wretch for a theft or to send a man to botany bay for poaching the facility with which men obtain a livelihood in america has hitherto converted most rogues into comparatively honest men when they get there though i think the day is near now your own police is so much improved when we shall find it necessary in selfdefence to change our policy the common language as i am told induces many knaves who now find england too hot to hold them to migrate to america  captain ducie is anxious to know whether mr truck will quietly permit this criminal to be transferred to the foam  i do not think he will permit it at all without being overpowered if the request be urged in any manner as a right in that case he will very properly think that the maintenance of his national character is of more importance than the escape of a dozen rogues you may put a harsh construction on his course but i shall think him right in resisting an unjust and an illegal invasion of his rights i had thought captain ducie however more peaceably disposed from what has passed  perhaps i have expressed myself too strongly i know he would wish to take back the criminal but i scarce think that he meditates more than persuasion ducie is a fine fellow and every way a gentleman  he appears to have found an acquaintance in our young friend powis  the meeting between these two gentlemen has surprised me for it can scarcely be termed amicable and yet it seems to occupy more of ducies thoughts just now than the affair of the runaway  both now became silent and thoughtful for john effingham had too many unpleasant suspicions to wish to speak and the baronet was too generous to suggest a doubt concerning one whom he felt to be his rival and whom in truth he had begun sincerely to respect as well as to like in the mean time a discussion which had gradually been growing more dogged and sullen on the part of mr green and more biting and caustic on that of captain truck was suddenly terminated by the reluctant and tardy appearance of mr sandon  guilt that powerful vindicator of the justice of providence as it proves the existence of the inward monitor conscience was painfully impressed on a countenance that in general expressed little beyond a vacant vanity although of a tall and athletic person his limbs trembled in a way to refuse to support him and when he saw the wellknown face of mr green the unhappy young man sank into a seat from a real inability to stand the other regarded him sternly through his spectacles for more than a minute  this is a melancholy picture henry sandon he at length said i am at least glad that you do not affect to brazen out your crime but that you show a proper sense of its enormity what would your upright and painstaking father have said had he lived to see his only son in this situation  he is dead returned the young man hoarsely he is dead and never can know any thing about it  the unhappy delinquent experienced a sense of frightful pleasure as he uttered these words  it is true he is dead but there are others to suffer by your misconduct your innocent sister is living and feels all your disgrace  she will marry jones and forget it all i gave her a thousand pounds and she is married before this  in that you are mistaken she has returned the money for she is indeed john sandons daughter and mr jones refuses to marry the sister of a thief  the delinquent was vain and unreflecting rather than selfish and he had a natural attachment to his sister the only other child of his parents the blow therefore fell on his conscience with double force coming from this quarter  julia can compel him to marry her said the startled brother he is bound by a solemn engagement and the law will protect her  no law can make a man marry against his will and your poor unfortunate sister is too tender of your feelings whatever you may havee been of hers to wish to give mr jones an opportunity of defending himself by exposing your crime but this is wasting words mr sandon for i am wanted in the office where i have left things in the hands of an inexperienced substitute of course you are not prepared to defend an act that your conscience must tell you is inexcusable  i am afraid mr green i have been a little thoughtless or perhaps it would be better to say unlucky  mr sandon had fallen into the general and delusive mistake of those who err in supposing himself unfortunate rather than criminal with an ingenuity that exercised in a better cause would have made him a respectable man he had been endeavouring to excuse his crime to himself on various pleas of necessity and he had even got at last to justify his act by fancying that some trifling wrong he had received or which he fancied he had received in the settlement of his own private account in some measure excused his fraud although his own denied claim amounted merely to the sum of twenty pounds and that which he had taken was so large it was under the influence of such feelings that he made the answer just given  a little thoughtless unlucky and is this the way henry sandon that you name a crime that might almost raise your upright father from his grave but i wilt speak no more of feelings that you do not seem to understand you confess to have taken forty thousand pounds of the public money to which you have no right or claim  i certainly have in my hands some money which i do not deny belongs to government  it is well and here is my authority to receive it from you gentlemen will you have the kindness to see that my powers are regular and authentic  john effingham and others cast their eyes over the papers which seemed to be in rule and they said as much  now sir resumed mr green in the first place i demand the bills you received in london for this money and your regular endorsement in my favour  the culprit appeared to have made up his mind to this demand and with the same recklessness with which he had appropriated the money to his own use he was now ready to restore it without proposing a condition for his own safety the bills were in his pocket and seating himself at a table he made the required endorsement and handed them to mr green  here are bills for thirtyeight thousand pounds said that methodical person after he had examined the drafts one by one and counted their amount and you are known to have taken forty thousand i demand the remainder  would you leave me in a strange country penniless exclaimed the culprit in a tone of reproach  strange country penniless repeated mr green looking over his spectacles first at mr truck and then at mr sandon that to which you have no claim must be restored though it strip you to the skin every pound you have belongs to the public and to no one else  your pardon mr green and green enough you are if you lay down that doctrine interrupted captain truck in which neither vattel nor the revised statutes will bear you out a passenger cannot remove his effects from a ship until his passage be first paid  that sir i dispute in a question affecting the kings revenues the claims of government precede all others and the money that has once belonged to the crown and which has not been regularly paid away by the crown is the crowns still  crowns and coronations perhaps master green you think you are in somerset house at this present speaking  now mr green was so completely a star of a confined orbit that his ideas seldom described a tangent to their ordinary revolutions he was so much accustomed to hear of england ruling colonies the east and the west canada the cape and new south wales that it was not an easy matter for him to conceive himself to be without the influence of the british laws had he quitted home with the intention to emigrate or even to travel it is probable that his mind would have kept a more equal pace with his body but summoned in haste from his desk and with the office spectacles on his nose it is not so much a matter of wonder that he hardly realized the truths of his present situation the manofwar in which everything was his majestys sustained this feeling and it was too sudden a change to expect such a man to abandon all his most cherished notions at a moments warning the irreverent exclamation of captain truck shocked him and he did not fail to show as much by the disgust pictured in his countenance  i am in one of his majestys packets sir i presume where you will permit me to say a greater deference for the high ceremonies of the kingdom ought to be found  this would make even old joe bunk laugh you are in a new york liner sir over which no majesty has any control but their majesties john griswold and co why my good sir the sea has unsettled your brain  now mr green did know that the united states of america had obtained their independence but the whole proceeding was so mixed up with rebellion and a french alliance in his mind that he always doubted whether the new republic had a legal existence at all and he had been heard to express his surprise that the twelve judges had not long since decided this state of things to be unconstitutional and overturned the american government by mandamus his disgust increased accordingly as captain trucks irreverence manifested itself in stronger terms and there was great danger that the harmony which had hitherto prevailed between the parties would be brought to a violent termination  the respect for the crown in a truly loyal subject sir mr green returned sharply is not to be unsettled by the sea not in my case at least whatever it might have been in your own  my own why the devil sir do you take me for a subject  a truant one i fear though you may have been born in london itself  why my dear sir said captain truck taking the other by a button as if he pitied his hallucination you dont breed such men in london i came from the river which never had a subject in it or any other majesty than that of the saybrook platform i begin to understand you at last you are one of those wellmeaning men who fancy the earth but a casing to the island of great britain well i suppose it is more the fault of your education than of your nature and one must overlook the mistake may i ask what is your farther wish in reference to this unhappy young man  he must refund every pound of the public money that remains in his possession  that is just and i say yea  and all who have received from him any portion of this money under whatever pretences must restore it to the crown  my good sir you can have no notion of the quantity of champaigne and other good things this unfortunate young man has consumed in this ship although but a sham baronet he has fared like a real lord and you cannot have the heart to exact from the owners the keeping of your rogues  government makes no distinction sir and always claims its own  nay mr green interrupted sir george templemore i much question if government would assert a right to money that a peculator or a defaulter fairly spends even in england much less does it seem to me it can pretend to the few pounds that captain truck has lawfully earned  the money has not been lawfully earned sir it is contrary to law to assist a felon to quit the kingdom and i am not certain there are no penalties for that act alone and as for the public money it can never legally quit the treasury without the proper office forms  my dear sir george put in the captain leave me to settle this with mr green who no doubt is authorized to give a receipt in full what is to be done with the delinquent sir now that you are in possession of his money  of course he will be carried back in the foam and i mourn to be compelled to say that he must be left in the hands of the law  what with or without my permission  mr green stared for his mind was precisely one of those which would conceive it to be a high act of audacity in a cidevant colonist to claim the rights of an old country even did he really understand the legality and completeness of the separation  he has committed forgery sir to conceal his peculation it is an awful crime but they that commit it cannot hope to escape the consequences  miserable impostor is this true captain truck sternly demanded of the trembling culprit  he calls an oversight forgery sir returned the latter huskily i have done nothing to affect my life or liberty  at this moment captain ducie accompanied by paul powis entered the cabin their faces flushed and their manner to each other a little disturbed though it was formally courteous at the same instant mr dodge who had been dying to be present at the secret conference watched his opportunity to slip in also  i am glad you have come sir said mr green for here may be occasion for the services of his majestys officers mr sandon has given up these bills but two thousand pounds remain unaccounted for and i have traced thirtyfive quite clearly to the master of this ship who has received it in the way of passagemoney  yes sir the fact is as plain as the highlands of navesink from the deck drily added captain truck  one thousand of this money has been returned by the defaulters sister observed captain ducie  very true sir i had forgotten to give him credit for that  the remainder has probably been wasted in those silly trifles of which you have told me the unhappy man was so fond and for which he has bartered respectability and peace of mind as for the money paid this ship for the passage it has been fairly earned nor do i know that government has any power to reclaim it  mr green heard this opinion with still greater disgust than he had felt towards the language of captain truck nor could he very well prevent his feelings escaping him in words  we truly live in perilous times he muttered speaking more particularly to john effingham out of respect to his appearance when the scions of the nobility entertain notions so loose we have vainly fancied in england that the enormities of the french revolution were neutralized by billy pitt but sir we still live in perilous times for the disease has fairly reached the higher classes i hear that designs are seriously entertained against the wigs of the judges and bishops and the next thing will be the throne all our venerable institutions are in danger  i should think the throne might indeed be in danger sir returned john effingham gravely if it reposes on wigs  it is my duty captain truck continued captain ducie who was a man so very different from his associate that he scarcely seemed to belong to the same species to request you will deliver to us the person of the culprit with his effects when we can relieve you and your passengers from the pain of witnessing any more of this unpleasant scene  at the sound of the delivery of his person all the danger of his situation rushed forcibly before the imagination of the culprit his face flushed and became pale and his legs refused to support him though he made a desperate effort to rise  after an instant of silence he turned to the commander of the corvette and in piteous accents appealed to him for mercy  i have been punished severely already he continued as his voice returned for the savage arabs robbed me of everything i had of any value these gentlemen know that they took my dressingcase several other curious and valuable articles for the toilet and nearly all my clothes  this man is scarcely a responsible being said john effingham for a childish vanity supplies the place of principles selfrespect and duty with a sister scorned on account of his crimes conviction beyond denial and a dread punishment staring him in the face his thoughts still run on trifles  captain ducie gave a look of pity at the miserable young man and by his countenance it was plain to see that he felt no relish for his duty still he felt himself bound to urge on captain truck a compliance with his request the master of the packet was a good deal divided by an inherent dislike of seeming to yield anything to a british naval officer a class of men whom he learned in early life most heartily to dislike his kind feelings towards this particular specimen of the class a reluctance to give a man up to a probable death or some other severe punishment and a distaste to being thought desirous of harbouring a rogue in this dilemma therefore he addressed himself to john effingham for counsel  i should be pleased to hear your opinion sir on this matter he said looking at the gentleman just named for i own myself to be in a category ought we or not to deliver up the culprit  fiat justitia ruat coelum answered john effingham who never fancied any one could be ignorant of the meaning of these familiar words  that i believe indeed to be vattel said captain truck but exceptions alter rules this young man has some claims on us on account of his conduct when in front of the arabs  he fought for himself sir and has the merit of preferring liberty in a ship to slavery in the desert  i think with mr john effingham observed mr dodge and can see no redeeming quality in his conduct on that occasion he did what we all did or as mr john effingham has so pithily expressed it he preferred liberty in our company to being an arabs slave  you will not deliver me up captain truck exclaimed the delinquent they will hang me if once in their power oh i you will not have the heart to let them hang me  captain truck was startled at this appeal but he sternly reminded the culprit that it was too late to remember the punishment when the crime was committed  never fear mr sandon said the officeman with a sneer these gentlemen will take you to new york for the sake of the thousand pounds if they can a rogue is pretty certain of a kind reception in america i hear  then sir exclaimed captain truck you had better go in with us  mr green mr green this is indiscreet to call it by no worse a term interposed captain ducie who while he was not free from a good deal of the prejudices of his companion was infinitely better bred and more in the habit of commanding himself  mr john effingham you have heard this wanton insult continued captain truck suppressing his wrath as well as he could in what mariner ought it to be resented  command the offender to quit your ship instantly said john effingham firmly  captain ducie started and his face flushed but disregarding him altogether captain truck walked deliberately up to mr green and ordered him to go into the corvettes boat  i shall allow of neither parley nor delay added the exasperated old seaman struggling to appear cool and dignified though his vocation was little for the latter do me the favour sir to permit me to see you into your boat sir saunders go on deck and tell mr leach to have the side mannedwith three side boys saundersand now i ask it as the greatest possible favour that you will walk on deck with me orordamn me but ill drag you there neck and heels  it was too much for captain truck to seem calm when he was in a towering passion and the outbreak at the close of this speech was accompanied by a gesture with a hand which was open it is true but from which none of the arts of his more polite days could erase the knobs and hue that had been acquired in early life  this is strong language sir to use to a british officer under the guns of a british cruiser exclaimed the commander of the corvette  and his was strong language to use to a man in his own country and in his own ship to you captain ducie i have nothing to say unless it be to say you are welcome but your companion has indulged in a coarse insult on my country and damn me if i submit to it if i never see st catherines docks again i had too much of this when a young man to wish to find it repeated while an old one  captain ducie bit his lip and he looked exceedingly vexed although he had himself blindly imbibed the notion that america would gladly receive the devil himself if he came with a full pocket he was shocked with the coarseness that would throw such an innuendo into the very faces of the people of the country on the other hand his pride as an officer was hurt at the menace of captain truck and all the former harmony of the scene was threatened with a sudden termination captain ducie had been struck with the gentlemanlike appearance of both the effinghams to say nothing of eve the instant his foot touched the deck of the montauk and he now turned with a manner of reproach to john effingham and said  surely sir you cannot sustain mr truck in his extraordinary conduct  you will pardon me if i say i do the man has been permitted to remain longer in the ship than i would have suffered  and mr powis what is your opinion  i fear said paul smiling coldly that i should have knocked him down on the spot  templemore are you too of this way of thinking  i fear the speech of mr green has been without sufficient thought on reflection he will recall it  but mr green would sooner part with life than part with a prejudice and he shook his head in the negative in a way to show that his mind was made up  this is trifling added captain truck saunders go on deck and tell mr leach to send down through the skylight a single whip that we may whip this polite personage on deck and harkee saunders let there be another on the yard that we may send him into his boat like an anker of gin  this is proceeding too far said captain ducie mr green you will oblige me by retiring there can be no suspicion cast on a vessel of war for conceding a little to an unarmed ship  a vessel of war should not insult an unarmed ship sir rejoined captain truck pithily  captain ducie again coloured but as he had decided on his course he had the prudence to remain silent in the mean time mr green sullenly took his hat and papers and withdrew into the boat though on his return to london he did not fail to give such a version of the affair as went altogether to corroborate all his own and his friends previous notions of america and what is equally singular he religiously believed all he had said on the occasion  what is now to be done with this unhappy man inquired captain ducie when order was a little restored  the misunderstanding was an unfortunate affair for the culprit captain truck felt a strong reluctance to deliver him up to justice after all they had gone through together but the gentlemanlike conduct of the english commander the consciousness of having triumphed in the late conflict and a deep regard for the law united on the other hand to urge him to yield the unfortunate and weakminded offender to his own authorities  you do not claim a right to take him out of an american ship by violence if i understand you captain ducie  i do not my instructions are merely to demand him  that is according to vattel by demand you mean to request to ask for him  i mean to request to ask for him returned the englishman smiling  then take him of gods name and may your laws be more merciful to the wretch than he has been to himself or to his kin  mr sandon shrieked and he threw himself abjectly on his knees between the two captains grasping the legs of both  oh hear me hear me he exclaimed in a tone of anguish i have given up the money i will give it all up all to the last shilling if you will let me go you captain truck by whose side i have fought and toiled you will not have the heart to abandon me to these murderers  its dd hard muttered the captain actually wiping his eyes but it is what you have drawn upon yourself i fear get a good lawyer my poor fellow as soon as you arrive and its an even chance after all that you go free  miserable wretch said mr dodge confronting the still kneeling and agonized delinquent wretch these are the penalties of guilt you have forged and stolen acts that meet with my most unqualified disapprobation and you are unfit for respectable societyi saw from the very first what you truly were and permitted myself to associate with you merely to detect and expose you in order that you might not bring disgrace on our beloved country an impostor has no chance in america and you are fortunate in being taken back to your own hemisphere  mr dodge belonged to a tolerably numerous class that is quaintly described as being law honest that is to say he neither committed murder nor petty larceny when he was guilty of moral slander he took great care that it should not be legal slander and although his whole life was a tissue of mean and baneful vices he was quite innocent of all those enormities that usually occupy the attention of a panel of twelve men this in his eyes raised him so far above less prudent sinners as to give him a right to address his quondam associate as has been just related but the agony of the culprit was past receiving an increase from this brutal attack he merely motioned the coarseminded sycophant and demagogue away and continued his appeals to the two captains for mercy at this moment paul powis stepped up to the editor and in a low but firm voice ordered him to quit the cabin  i will pray for yoube your slavedo all you ask if you will not give me up continued the culprit fairly writhing in his agony oh captain ducie as an english nobleman have mercy on me  i must transfer the duty to subordinates said the english commander a tear actually standing in his eye will you permit a party of armed marines to take this unhappy being from your ship sir  perhaps this will be the best course as he will yield only to a show of force i see no objection to this mr john effingham  none in the world sir it is your object to clear your ship of a delinquent and let those among whom he committed the fault be the agents  ayay this is what vattel calls the comity of nations captain ducie i beg you will issue your orders  the english commander had foreseen some difficulty and in sending away his boat when he came below he had sent for a corporals guard these men were now in a cutter near the ship lying off on their oars in a rigid respect to the rights of a stranger howeveras captain truck was glad to see the whole party having gone on deck as soon as the arrangement was settled at an order from their commander the marines boarded the montauk and proceeded below in quest of their prisoner  mr sandon had been left alone in eves cabin but as soon as he found himself at liberty he hurried into his own stateroom captain truck went below while the marines were entering the ship and having passed a minute in his own room he stepped across the cabin to that of the culprit opening the door without knocking he found the unhappy man in the very act of applying a pistol to his head his own hand being just in time to prevent the catastrophe the despair portrayed in the face of the criminal prevented reproach or remonstrance for captain truck was a man of few words when it was necessary to act disarming the intended suicide he coolly counted out to him thirtyfive pounds the money paid for his passage and told him to pocket it  i received this on condition of delivering you safe in new york he said and as i shall fail in the bargain i think it no more than just to return you the money it may help you on the trial  will they hang me asked mr sandon hoarsely and with an imbecility like that of an infant  the appearance of the marines prevented reply the prisoner was secured his effects were pointed out and his person was transferred to the boat with the usual military promptitude as soon as this was done the cutter pulled away from the packet and was soon hoisted in again on the corvettes deck that day month the unfortunate victim of a passion for trifles committed suicide in london just as they were about to transfer him to newgate and six months later his unhappy sister died of a broken heart     chapter xxxiv                         well attend you there   where if you bring not marcius well proceed   in our first way    coriolanus   eve and mademoiselle viefville had been unwilling spectators of a portion of the foregoing scene and captain ducie felt a desire to apologise for the part he had been obliged to act in it for this purpose he had begged his friend the baronet to solicit a more regular introduction than that received through captain truck  my friend ducie is solicitous to be introduced miss effingham that he may urge something in his own behalf concerning the commotion he has raised among us  a graceful assent brought the young commander forward and as soon as he was named he made a very suitable expression of his regret to the ladies who received it as a matter of course favourably  this is a new duty to me the arrest of criminals added captain ducie  the word criminals sounded harsh to the ear of eve and she felt her cheek becoming pale  much as we regret the cause observed the father we can spare the person you are about to take from us without much pain for we have known him for an impostor from the moment he appearedis there not some mistake that is the third trunk that i have seen passed into the boat marked p p  captain ducie smiled and answered  you will call it a bad pun if i say p p see pointing to paul who was coming from the cabin attended by captain truck the latter was conversing warmly gesticulating towards the corvette and squeezing his companions hand  am i to understand said mr effingham earnestly that mr powis too is to quit us  he does me the favour alsocaptain ducies lip curled a little at the word favourto accompany me to england  good breeding and intense feeling caused a profound suspense until the young man himself approached the party paul endeavoured to be calm and he even forced a smile as he addressed his friends  although i escape the honours of a marine guard he saidand eve thought he said it bitterly i am also to be taken out of the ship chance has several times thrown me into your society mr effingham miss effinghamand should the same good fortune ever again occur i hope i may be permitted to address you at once as an old acquaintance  we shall always entertain a most grateful recollection of your important services mr powis returned the father and i shall not cease to wish that the day may soon arrive when i can have the pleasure of receiving you under my own roof  paul now offered to take the hand of mademoiselle viefville which he kissed gallantly he did the same with eves though she felt him tremble in the attempt as these ladies had lived much in countries in which this graceful mode of salutation prevails among intimates the act passed as a matter of course  with sir george templemore paul parted with every sign of goodwill the people to whom he had caused a liberal donation to be made gave him three cheers for they understood his professional merits at least and saunders who had not been forgotten attended him assiduously to the side of the ship here mr leach called the foams away and captain ducies gig was manned at the gangway captain truck again shook paul cordially by the hand and whispered something in his ear  every thing being now ready the two gentlemen prepared to go into the boat as eve watched all that passed with an almost breathless anxiety a little ceremonial that now took place caused her much pain hitherto the manner of captain ducie as respected his companion had struck her as equivocal at times it was haughty and distant while at others it had appeared more conciliatory and kind all these little changes she had noted with a jealous interest and the slightest appearance of respect or of disrespect was remarked as if it could furnish a clew to the mystery of the whole procedure  your boat is ready sir said mr leach stepping out of the gangway to give way to paul who stood nearest to the ladder  the latter was about to proceed when he was touched lightly on the shoulder by captain ducie who smiled eve thought haughtily and intimated a desire to precede him paul coloured bowed and falling back permitted the english officer to enter his own boat first  apparemment ce captaine anglais est un pen sans façonvoilà qui est poli whispered mademoiselle viefville  these commanders of vessels of war are little kings quietly observed mr effingham who had unavoidably noticed the whole procedure  the gig was soon clear of the ship and both the gentlemen repeated their adieus to those on deck to reach the corvette to enter her and to have the gig swinging on her quarter occupied but five minutes  both ships now filled away and the corvette began to throw out one sheet of cloth after another until she was under a cloud of canvas again standing to the eastward with studdingsails alow and aloft on the other hand the montauk laid her yards square and ran down to the hook the pilot from the corvette had been sent on board the packet and the wind standing by eleven oclock the latter had crossed the bar at this moment the low dark stern of the foam resembled a small black spot on the sea sustaining a pyramid of cloud  you were not on deck john to take leave of our young friend powis said mr effingham reproachfully  i do not wish to witness a ceremony of this extraordinary nature and yet it might have been better if i had  better cousin jack  better poor monday committed to my care certain papers that i fancy are of moment to some one and these i intrusted to mr powis with a view to examine them together when we should get in in the hurry of parting he has carried them off  they may be reclaimed by writing to london said mr effingham quietly have you his address  i asked him for it but the question appeared to embarrass him  embarrass cousin jack  embarrass miss effingham  the subject was now dropped by common consent a few moments of awkward silence succeeded when the interest inseparable from a return home after an absence of years began to resume its influence and objects on the land were noticed the sudden departure of paul was not forgotten however for it continued the subject of wonder with all for weeks though little more was said on the subject  the ship was soon abreast of the hook which eve compared to the disadvantage of the celebrated american haven with the rocky promontories and picturesque towers of the mediterranean  this portion of our bay at least is not very admirable she said though there is a promise of something better above  some newyork cockney who has wandered from the crackling heat of his nott stove has taken it into his poetical imagination to liken this bay to that of naples said john effingham and his fellowcitizens greedily swallow the absurdity although there is scarcely a single feature in common to give the foolish opinion value  but the bay above is beautiful  barely pretty when one has seen it alone for many years and has forgotten the features of other bays it does not appear amiss but you fresh from the bolder landscapes of southern europe will be disappointed  eve an ardent admirer of nature heard this with regret for she had as much confidence in the taste of her kinsman as in his love of truth she knew he was superior to the vulgar vanity of giving an undue merit to a thing because he had a right of property in it was a man of the world and knew what he uttered on all such matters had not a particle of provincial admiration or of provincial weakness mi his composition and although as ready as another and far more able than most to defend his country and her institutions from the rude assault of her revilers that he seldom made the capital mistake of attempting to defend a weak point  the scenery greatly improved in fact however as the ship advanced and while she went through the pass called the narrows eve expressed her delight mademoiselle viefville was in ecstasies not so much with the beauties of the place as with the change from the monotony of the ocean to the movement and liveliness of the shore  you think this noble scenery said john effingham  as far from it as possible cousin jack i see much meanness and poverty in the view but at the same time it has fine parts the islands are not italian certainly nor these hills nor yet that line of distant rocks but together they form a pretty bay and a noble one in extent and uses at least  all this is true perhaps the earth does not contain another port with so many advantages for commerce in this respect i think it positively unequalled but i know a hundred bays that surpass it in beauty indeed in the mediterranean it is not easy to find a natural haven that does not  eve was too fresh from the gorgeous coast of italy to be in ecstasies with the meagre villages and villas that more or less lined the bay of newyork but when they reached a point where the view of the two rivers separated by the town came before them with the heights of brooklyn heights comparatively if not positively on one side and the receding wall of the palisadoes on the other eve insisted that the scene was positively fine  you have well chosen your spot said john effingham but even this is barely good there is nothing surpassing about it  but it is home cousin jack  it is home miss effingham he answered gaping and as you have no cargo to sell i fear you will find it an exceedingly dull one  we shall seewe shall see returned eve laughing then looking about her for a few minutes she added with a manner in which real and affected vexation were prettily blended in one thing i do confess myself disappointed  you will be happy my dear if it be in only one  these smaller vessels are less picturesque than those i have been accustomed to see  you have hit upon a very sound criticism and by going a little deeper into the subject you will discover a singular deficiency in this part of an american landscape the greatheight of the spars of all the smaller vessels of these waters when compared with the tame and level coast river banks and the formation of the country in general has the effect to diminish still more the outlines of any particular scene beautiful as it is beyond all competition the hudson would seem still more so were it not for these high and ungainly spars  the pilot now began to shorten sail and the ship drew into that arm of the sea which by a misnomer peculiarly american it is the fashion to call the east river here our heroine candidly expressed her disappointment the town seeming mean and insignificant the battery of which she remembered a little and had heard so much although beautifully placed disappointed her for it had neither the extent and magnificence of a park nor the embellishments and luxurious shades of a garden as she had been told that her countrymen were almost ignorant of the art of landscape gardening she was not so much disappointed with this spot however as with the air of the town and the extreme filth and poverty of the quays unwilling to encourage john effingham in his diposition to censure she concealed her opinions for a time  there is less improvement here than even i expected said mr effingham as they got into a coach on the wharf they had taught me john to expect great improvements and great very great improvements have been made in your absence if you could see this place as you knew it in youth the alterations would seem marvellous  i cannot admit this with eve i think the place mean in appearance rather than imposing and so decidedly provincial as not to possess a single feature of a capital  the two things are not irreconcilable ned if you will take the trouble to tax your memory the place is mean and provincial but thirty years since it was still meaner and more provincial than it is today a century hence it will begin to resemble a large european town  what odious objects these posts are cried eve  they give the streets the air of a village and i do not see their uses  these posts are for awnings and of themselves they prove the peculiar country character of the place if you will reflect however you will see it could net well be otherwise this town today contains near threehundred thousand souls twothirds of whom are in truth emigrants from the interior of our own or of some foreign country and such a collection of people cannot in a day give a town any other character than that which belongs to themselves it is not a crime to be provincial and rustic it is only ridiculous to fancy yourselves otherwise when the fact is apparent  the streets seem deserted i had thought new york a crowded town  and yet this is broadway a street that every american will tell you is so crowded as to render respiration impossible  john effingham excepted said mr effingham smiling  is this broadway cried eve fairly appalled  beyond a question are you not smothered  eve continued silent until the carriage reached the door of her fathers house on the other hand mademoiselle viefville expressed herself delighted with all she saw a circumstance that might have deceived a native of the country who did not know how to explain her raptures in the first place she was a frenchwoman and accustomed to say pleasant things then she was just relieved from an element she detested and the land was pleasant in her eyes but the principal reason is still in reserve mademoiselle viefville like most europeans had regarded america not merely as a provincial country and this without a high standard of civilization for a province as the truth would have shown but as a semibarbarous quarter of the world and the things she saw so much surpassed her expectations that she was delighted as it might be by contrast  as we shall have a future occasion to speak of the dwelling of mr effingham and to accompany the reader much further in the histories of our several characters we shall pass over the feelings of eve when fairly established that night under her own roof the next morning however when she descended to breakfast she was met by john effingham who gravely pointed to the following paragraph in one of the daily journals  the montauk london packet which has been a little out of time arrived yesterday as reported in our marina news this ship has met with various interesting adventures that we are happy to hear will shortly be laid before the world by one of her passengers a gentleman every way qualified for the task among the distinguished persons arrived in this ship is our contemporary steadfast dodge esquire whose amusing and instructing letters from europe are already before the worldwe are glad to hear that mr dodge returns home better satisfied than ever with his own country which he declares to be quite good enough for him it is whispered that our literary friend has played a conspicuous part in some recent events on the coast of africa though his extreme and well known modesty renders him indisposed to speak of the affair but we forbear ourselves out of respect to a sensibility that we know how to esteem  his britannic majestys ship foam whose arrival we noticed a day or two since boarded the montauk off the hook and took out of her two criminals one of whom we are told was a defaulter for one hundred and forty thousand pounds and the other a deserter from the kings service though a scion of a noble house more of this tomorrow  the morrow never came for some new incident took the place of the promised narration a people who do not give themselves time to eat and with whom go ahead has got to be the substitute of even religion little troubling themselves to go back twentyfour hours in search of a fact  this must be a base falsehood cousin jack said eve as she laid down the paper her brow flushed with an indignation that for the moment proved too strong for even apprehension  i hope it may turn out to be so and yet i consider the affair sufficiently singular to render suspicion at least natural  how eve both thought and acted in the matter will appear hereafter  the end
