the church militant meet in the communion of saints  where christ is they are and therefore if christ be there may not they be there likewise  may not they be near us though unseen like us claiming their share in the eternal sacrifice like us partaking of that spiritual body and blood which is as much the life of saints in heaven as it is of penitent sinners on earth  may it not be so  it is a

therefore i should say let her smallest rights be respected her smallest wrongs redressed but let her never be persuaded to forget that she is sent into the world to teach manwhat i believe she has been teaching him all along even in the savage state namely that there is something more necessary than the claiming of rights and that is the performing of duties to teach him specially in these

february 20   it is sometimes said the greater the sinner the greater the saint  i do not believe it  i do not see it  it stands to reasonif a man loses his way and finds it again he is so much the less forward on his way surely by all the time he has spent in getting back into the way  and if any of you fancy you can sin without being punished remember that the prodigal son is punished most severely  he does not get off freely the moment he chooses to repent as false preachers will tell you  even after he does repent and resolves to go back to his fathers house he has a long journey home

village sermons  1849    the higher education  february 26   in teaching women we must try to make our deepest lessons bear on the great purpose of unfolding womans own calling in all agesher especial calling in this one  we must incite them to realise the chivalrous belief of our old forefathers among their saxon forests that something divine dwelt in the counsels of woman but on the other hand we must continually remind them that they will attain that divine instinct not by renouncing their sex but by fulfilling it by becoming true women and not bad imitations of men by educating their heads for the sake of their hearts not their hearts for the sake of their heads by claiming womans divine vocation as the priestess of purity of beauty and of love  introductory lecture queens college 1848

punishments heaven or hell begins to talk to the child like a true english catechism as it is about that glorious old english keyword duty  it calls on the child to confess its own duty and teaches it that its duty is something most human simple everydaycommonplace if you will call it so  and i rejoice in the thought that the church catechism teaches that the childs duty is commonplace  i rejoice that in what it says about our duty to god and our neighbour it says not one word about counsels of perfection or those frames and feelings which depend believe me principally on the state of peoples
