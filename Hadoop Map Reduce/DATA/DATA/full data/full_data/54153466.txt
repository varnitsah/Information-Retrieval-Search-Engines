54153466	christmas eve  robert browning    i  out of the little chapel i burst   into the fresh nightair again five minutes full i waited first   in the doorway to escape the rain that drove in gusts down the commons centre   at the edge of which the chapel stands before i plucked up heart to enter   heaven knows how many sorts of hands reached past me groping for the latch of the inner door that hung on catch more obstinate the more they fumbled   till giving way at last with a scold of the crazy hinge in squeezed or tumbled   one sheep more to the rest in fold and left me irresolute standing sentry in the sheepfolds lathandplaster entry six feet long by three feet wide partitioned off from the vast inside   i blocked up half of it at least no remedy the rain kept driving   they eyed me much as some wild beast that congregation still arriving some of them by the main road white a long way past me into the night skirting the common then diverging not a few suddenly emerging from the commons self thro the palinggaps they house in the gravelpits perhaps where the road stops short with its safeguard border of lamps as tired of such disorder but the most turned in yet more abruptly   from a certain squalid knot of alleys where the towns bad blood once slept corruptly   which now the little chapel rallies and leads into day againits priestliness lending itself to hide their beastliness so cleverly thanks in part to the mason and putting so cheery a whitewashed face on those neophytes too much in lack of it   that where you cross the common as i did   and meet the party thus presided mount zion with lovelane at the back of it they front you as little disconcerted as bound for the hills her fate averted and her wicked people made to mind him lot might have marched with gomorrah behind him   ii  well from the road the lanes or the common in came the flock the fat weary woman panting and bewildered downclapping   her umbrella with a mighty report grounded it by me wry and flapping   a wreck of whalebones then with snort like a startled horse at the interloper who humbly knew himself improper but could not shrink up small enough round to the door and inthe gruff hinges invariable scold making my very blood run cold prompt in the wake of her uppattered on broken clogs the manytattered little oldfaced peaking sisterturnedmother of the sickly babe she tried to smother somehow up with its spotted face from the cold on her breast the one warm place she too must stop wring the poor ends dry of a draggled shawl and add thereby her tribute to the doormat sopping already from my own clothes dropping which yet she seemed to grudge i should stand on   then stooping down to take off her pattens   she bore them defiantly in each hand one planted together before her breast and its babe as good as a lance in rest   close on her heels the dingy satins of a female something past me flitted   with lips as much too white as a streak   lay far too red on each hollow cheek and it seemed the very doorhinge pitied all that was left of a woman once holding at least its tongue for the nonce then a tall yellow man like the penitent thief with his jaw bound up in a handkerchief and eyelids screwed together tight led himself in by some inner light and except from him from each that entered   i got the same interrogation what you the alien you have ventured   to take with us the elect your station a carer for none of it a gallio   thus plain as print i read the glance at a common prey in each countenance   as of huntsman giving his hounds the tallyho and when the doors cry drowned their wonder   the draught it always sent in shutting made the flame of the single tallow candle in the cracked square lantern i stood under   shoot its blue lip at me rebutting as it were the luckless cause of scandal i verily fancied the zealous light in the chapels secret too for spite would shudder itself clean off the wick with the airs of a saint johns candlestick  footnote see rev i 20 there was no standing it much longer good folks thought i as resolve grew stronger this way you perform the grandinquisitor when the weather sends you a chance visitor you are the men and wisdom shall die with you and none of the old seven churches vie with you but still despite the pretty perfection   to which you carry your trick of exclusiveness and taking gods word under wise protection   correct its tendency to diffusiveness and bid one reach it over hot ploughshares   still as i say though youve found salvation if i should choose to cry as now shares   see if the best of you bars me my ration i prefer if you please for my expounder of the laws of the feast the feasts own founder mines the same right with your poorest and sickliest   supposing i don the marriage vestiment   so shut your mouth and open your testament and carve me my portion at your quickliest accordingly as a shoemakers lad   with wizened face in want of soap   and wet apron wound round his waist like a rope after stopping outside for his cough was bad to get the fit over poor gentle creature and so avoid disturbing the preacher passed in i sent my elbow spikewise at the shutting door and entered likewise received the hinges accustomed greeting   and crossed the thresholds magic pentacle   and found myself in full conventicle to wit in zion chapel meeting on the christmaseve of fortynine   which calling its flock to their special clover   found all assembled and one sheep over whose lot as the weather pleased was mine  iii  i very soon had enough of it   the hot smell and the human noises and my neighbours coat the greasy cuff of it   were a pebblestone that a childs hand poises compared with the pigofleadlike pressure   of the preaching mans immense stupidity as he poured his doctrine forth full measure   to meet his audiences avidity you needed not the wit of the sibyl   to guess the cause of it all in a twinkling   no sooner our friend had got an inkling of treasure hid in the holy bible wheneer twas the thought first struck him how death at unawares might duck him deeper than the grave and quench the ginshops light in hells grim drench than he handled it so in fine irreverence   as to hug the book of books to pieces and a patchwork of chapters and texts in severance   not improved by the private dogsears and creases having clothed his own soul with hed fain see equipt yours so tossed you again your holy scriptures and you picked them up in a sense no doubt   nay had but a single face of my neighbours   appeared to suspect that the preachers labours were help which the world could be saved without tis odds but i might have borne in quiet a qualm or two at my spiritual diet or who can tell perchance even mustered   somewhat to urge in behalf of the sermon but the flock sat on divinely flustered   sniffing methought its dew of hermon with such content in every snuffle as the devil inside us loves to ruffle my old fat woman purred with pleasure   and thumb round thumb went twirling faster while she to his periods keeping measure   maternally devoured the pastor the man with the handkerchief untied it showed us a horrible wen inside it gave his eyelids yet another screwing and rocked himself as the woman was doing the shoemakers lad discreetly choking kept down his cough twas too provoking my gorge rose at the nonsense and stuff of it   so saying like eve when she plucked the apple   i wanted a taste and now theres enough of it i flung out of the little chapel  iv  there was a lull in the rain a lull   in the wind too the moon was risen and would have shone out pure and full   but for the ramparted cloudprison block on block built up in the west for what purpose the wind knows best who changes his mind continually and the empty other half of the sky seemed in its silence as if it knew what any moment might look through a chance gap in that fortress massy   through its fissures you got hints   of the flying moon by the shifting tints now a dull lioncolour now brassy burning to yellow and whitest yellow like furnacesmoke just ere flames bellow all asimmer with intense strain to let her throughthen blank again at the hope of her appearance failing just by the chapel a break in the railing shows a narrow path directly across tis ever dry walking there on the moss besides you go gently all the way uphill   i stooped under and soon felt better my head grew lighter my limbs more supple   as i walked on glad to have slipt the fetter my mind was full of the scene i had left   that placid flock that pastor vociferant   how this outside was pure and different the sermon nowwhat a mingled weft of good and ill were either less   its fellow had coloured the whole distinctly but alas for the excellent earnestness   and the truths quite true if stated succinctly but as surely false in their quaint presentment however to pastor and flocks contentment say rather such truths looked false to your eyes   with his provings and parallels twisted and twined till how could you know them grown double their size   in the natural fog of the good mans mind like yonder spots of our roadside lamps haloed about with the commons damps truth remains true the faults in the prover   the zeal was good and the aspiration and yet and yet yet fifty times over   pharaoh received no demonstration by his bakers dream of basket three of the doctrine of the trinity although as our preacher thus embellished it apparently his hearers relished it with so unfeigned a gustwho knows if they did not prefer our friend to joseph but so it is everywhere one way with all of them   these people have really felt no doubt a something the motion they style the call of them   and this is their method of bringing about by a mechanism of words and tones  so many texts in so many groans a sort of reviving and reproducing   more or less perfectly who can tell the mood itself which strengthens by using   and how that happens i understand well a tune was born in my head last week out of the thumpthump and shriekshriek   of the train as i came by it up from manchester and when next week i take it back again my head will sing to the engines clack again   while it only makes my neighbours haunches stir finding no dormant musical sprout in him as in me to be jolted out tis the taught already that profits by teaching he gets no more from the railways preaching   than from this preacher who does the rails office i whom therefore the flock cast a jealous eye on still why paint over their door mount zion to which all flesh shall come saith the prophecy   v  but wherefore be harsh on a single case   after how many modes this christmas eve does the selfsame weary thing take place   the same endeavour to make you believe and with much the same effect no more   each method abundantly convincing as i say to those convinced before   but scarce to be swallowed without wincing by the notasyetconvinced for me i have my own church equally and in this church my faith sprang first   i said as i reached the rising ground and the wind began again with a burst   of rain in my face and a glad rebound from the heart beneath as if god speeding me i entered his churchdoor nature leading me in youth i look to these very skies and probing their immensities i found god there his visible power   yet felt in my heart amid all its sense   of the power an equal evidence that his love there too was the nobler dower for the loving worm within its clod were diviner than a loveless god amid his worlds i will dare to say   you know what i mean gods all mans nought   but also god whose pleasure brought man into being stands away   as it were a handbreadth off to give room for the newlymade to live and look at him from a place apart and use his gifts of brain and heart given indeed but to keep for ever who speaks of man then must not sever mans very elements from man saying but all is godswhose plan was to create man and then leave him able his own word saith to grieve him but able to glorify him too as a mere machine could never do that prayed or praised all unaware of its fitness for aught but praise and prayer made perfect as a thing of course man therefore stands on his own stock of love and power as a pinpoint rock and looking to god who ordained divorce of the rock from his boundless continent sees in his power made evident only excess by a millionfold oer the power god gave man in the mould for note mans hand first formed to carry a few pounds weight when taught to marry its strength with an engines lifts a mountain   advancing in power by one degree   and why count steps through eternity but love is the everspringing fountain man may enlarge or narrow his bed for the waters play but the waterhead how can he multiply or reduce it   as easy create it as cause it to cease he may profit by it or abuse it   but tis not a thing to bear increase as power does be love less or more   in the heart of man he keeps it shut   or opes it wide as he pleases but loves sum remains what it was before so gazing up in my youth at love as seen through power ever above all modes which make it manifest my soul brought all to a single test that he the eternal first and last who in his power had so surpassed all man conceives of what is might whose wisdom too showed infinite would prove as infinitely good would never my soul understood with power to work all love desires bestow een less than man requires that he who endlessly was teaching above my spirits utmost reaching what love can do in the leaf or stone so that to master this alone this done in the stone or leaf for me i must go on learning endlessly would never need that i in turn   should point him out defect unheeded and show that god had yet to learn   what the meanest human creature needed not life to wit for a few short years tracking his way through doubts and fears while the stupid earth on which i stay   suffers no change but passive adds   its myriad years to myriads though i he gave it to decay seeing death come and choose about me and my dearest ones depart without me no love which on earth amid all the shows of it   has ever been seen the sole good of life in it the love ever growing there spite of the strife in it   shall arise made perfect from deaths repose of it and i shall behold thee face to face o god and in thy light retrace how in all i loved here still wast thou whom pressing to then as i fain would now i shall find as able to satiate   the love thy gift as my spirits wonder thou art able to quicken and sublimate   with this sky of thine that i now walk under and glory in thee for as i gaze thus thus oh let men keep their ways of seeking thee in a narrow shrine be this my way and this is mine  vi  for lo what think you suddenly the rain and the wind ceased and the sky received at once the full fruition of the moons consummate apparition the black cloudbarricade was riven ruined beneath her feet and driven deep in the west while bare and breathless   north and south and east lay ready for a glorious thing that dauntless deathless   sprang across them and stood steady twas a moonrainbow vast and perfect from heaven to heaven extending perfect as the mothermoons self full in face it rose distinctly at the base   with its seven proper colours chorded which still in the rising were compressed until at last they coalesced   and supreme the spectral creature lorded in a triumph of whitest white above which intervened the night but above night too like only the next   the second of a wondrous sequence   reaching in rare and rarer frequence till the heaven of heavens were circumflexed another rainbow rose a mightier fainter flushier and flightier rapture dying along its verge oh whose foot shall i see emerge whose from the straining topmost dark on to the keystone of that arc  vii  this sight was shown me there and then me out of a world of men singled forth as the chance might hap to another if in a thunderclap where i heard noise and you saw flame some one man knew god called his name for me i think i said appear good were it to be ever here if thou wilt let me build to thee servicetabernacles three where forever in thy presence in ecstatic acquiescence far alike from thriftless learning and ignorances undiscerning i may worship and remain   thus at the show above me gazing with upturned eyes i felt my brain   glutted with the glory blazing throughout its whole mass over and under until at length it burst asunder and out of it bodily there streamed the toomuch glory as it seemed passing from out me to the ground then palely serpentining round into the dark with mazy error  viii  all at once i looked up with terror he was there he himself with his human air on the narrow pathway just before i saw the back of him no more he had left the chapel then as i i forgot all about the sky no face only the sight of a sweepy garment vast and white with a hem that i could recognize i felt terror no surprise my mind filled with the cataract at one bound of the mighty fact i remember he did say   doubtless that to this worlds end where two or three should meet and pray   he would be in their midst their friend certainly he was there with them   and my pulses leaped for joy   of the golden thought without alloy then i saw his very vestures hem then rushed the blood back cold and clear with a fresh enhancing shiver of fear and i hastened cried out while i pressed to the salvation of the vest but not so lord it cannot be that thou indeed art leaving me me that have despised thy friends did my heart make no amends thou art the love of godabove his power didst hear me place his love and that was leaving the world for thee therefore thou must not turn from me as i had chosen the other part folly and pride oercame my heart our best is bad nor bears thy test still it should be our very best i thought it best that thou the spirit   be worshipped in spirit and in truth and in beauty as even we require it   not in the forms burlesque uncouth i left but now as scarcely fitted for thee i knew not what i pitied but all i felt there right or wrong what is it to thee who curest sinning am i not weak as thou art strong   i have looked to thee from the beginning straight up to thee through all the world which like an idle scroll lay furled to nothingness on either side and since the time thou wast descried spite of the weak heart so have i lived ever and so fain would die living and dying thee before but if thou leavest me  ix                              less or more i suppose that i spoke thus whenhave mercy lord on us the whole face turned upon me full   and i spread myself beneath it   as when the bleacher spreads to seethe it in the cleansing sun his wool steeps in the flood of noontide whiteness   some denied discoloured web so lay i saturate with brightness   and when the flood appeared to ebb lo i was walking light and swift   with my senses settling fast and steadying but my body caught up in the whirl and drift   of the vestures amplitude still eddying on just before me still to be followed   as it carried me after with its motion what shall i sayas a path were hollowed   and a man went weltering through the ocean sucked along in the flying wake of the luminous watersnake darkness and cold were cloven as through i passed upborne yet walking too and i turned to myself at intervals so he said so it befalls god who registers the cup   of mere cold water for his sake to a disciple rendered up   disdains not his own thirst to slake at the poorest love was ever offered and because my heart i proffered with true love trembling at the brim he suffers me to follow him for ever my own waydispensed from seeking to be influenced by all the less immediate ways   that earth in worships manifold adopts to reach by prayer and praise   the garments hem which lo i hold   x  and so we crossed the world and stopped   for where am i in city or plain   since i am ware of the world again and what is this that rises propped with pillars of prodigious girth is it really on the earth this miraculous dome of god has the angels measuringrod which numbered cubits gem from gem twixt the gates of the new jerusalem meted it outand what he meted have the sons of men completed binding ever as he bade columns in the colonnade with arms wide open to embrace the entry of the human race to the breast of what is it yon building ablaze in front all paint and gilding with marble for brick and stones of price for garniture of the edifice now i see it is no dream it stands there and it does not seem for ever in pictures thus it looks and thus i have read of it in books often in england leagues away and wondered how these fountains play growing up eternally each to a musical watertree whose blossoms drop a glittering boon before my eyes in the light of the moon to the granite layers underneath liar and dreamer in your teeth i the sinner that speak to you was in rome this night and stood and knew both this and more for see for see the dark is rent mine eye is free to pierce the crust of the outer wall and i view inside and all there all as the swarming hollow of a hive the whole basilica alive men in the chancel body and nave men on the pillars architrave men on the statues men on the tombs with popes and kings in their porphyry wombs all famishing in expectation of the mainaltars consummation for see for see the rapturous moment approaches and earths best endowment blends with heavens the taperfires pant up the winding brazen spires heave loftier yet the baldachin footnote canopy over the high altar the incensegaspings long kept in suspire in clouds the organ blatant holds his breath and grovels latent as if gods hushing finger grazed him like behemoth when he praised him at the silver bells shrill tinkling quick cold drops of terror sprinkling on the sudden pavement strewed with faces of the multitude earth breaks up time drops away in flows heaven with its new day of endless life when he who trod very man and very god this earth in weakness shame and pain dying the death whose signs remain up yonder on the accursed tree shall come again no more to be of captivity the thrall but the one god all in all king of kings lord of lords as his servant john received the words i died and live for evermore   xi  yet i was left outside the door why sit i here on the thresholdstone left till he return alone save for the garments extreme fold abandoned still to bless my hold my reason to my doubt replied as if a book were opened wide and at a certain page i traced every record undefaced added by successive years the harvestings of truths stray ears singly gleaned and in one sheaf bound together for belief yes i saidthat he will go and sit with these in turn i know their faiths heart beats though her head swims too giddily to guide her limbs disabled by their palsystroke from propping mine though romes gross yoke drops off no more to be endured her teaching is not so obscured by errors and perversities that no truth shines athwart the lies and he whose eye detects a spark even where to mans the whole seems dark may well see flame where each beholder acknowledges the embers smoulder but i a mere man fear to quit the clue god gave me as most fit to guide my footsteps through lifes maze because himself discerns all ways open to reach him i a man able to mark where faith began to swerve aside till from its summit judgment drops her damning plummet pronouncing such a fatal space departed from the founders base he will not bid me enter too but rather sit as now i do awaiting his return outside twas thus my reason straight replied and joyously i turned and pressed the garments skirt upon my breast until afresh its light suffusing me my heart criedwhat has been abusing me that i should wait here lonely and coldly instead of rising entering boldly baring truths face and letting drift her veils of lies as they choose to shift do these men praise him i will raise my voice up to their point of praise i see the error but above the scope of error see the love oh love of those first christian days fanned so soon into a blaze from the spark preserved by the trampled sect that the antique sovereign intellect which then sat ruling in the world like a change in dreams was hurled from the throne he reigned upon you looked up and he was gone gone his glory of the pen love with greece and rome in ken bade her scribes abhor the trick of poetry and rhetoric and exult with hearts set free in blessed imbecility scrawled perchance on some torn sheet leaving sallust incomplete gone his pride of sculptor painter love while able to acquaint her while the thousand statues yet fresh from chisel pictures wet from brush she saw on every side chose rather with an infants pride to frame those portents which impart such unction to true christian art gone music too the air was stirred by happy wings terpanders bird footnote terpander a famous lesbian musician and lyric poet 670 bc that when the cold came fled away would tarry not the wintry day as moreenduring sculpture must till filthy saints rebuked the gust with which they chanced to get a sight of some dear naked aphrodite they glanced a thought above the toes of by breaking zealously her nose off love surely from that musics lingering might have filched her organfingering nor chosen rather to set prayings to hoggrunts praises to horseneighings love was the startling thing the new love was the allsufficient too and seeing that you see the rest as a babe can find its mothers breast as well in darkness as in light love shut our eyes and all seemed right true the worlds eyes are open now less need for me to disallow some few that keep loves zone unbuckled peevish as ever to be suckled lulled by the same old babyprattle with intermixture of the rattle when she would have them creep stand steady upon their feet or walk already not to speak of trying to climb i will be wise another time and not desire a wall between us   when next i see a churchroof cover so many species of one genus   all with foreheads bearing lover written above the earnest eyes of them   all with breasts that beat for beauty whether sublimed to the surprise of them   in noble daring steadfast duty the heroic in passion or in action or lowered for senses satisfaction to the mere outside of human creatures mere perfect form and faultless features what with all rome here whence to levy   such contributions to their appetite with women and men in a gorgeous bevy   they take as it were a padlock clap it tight on their southern eyes restrained from   feeding on the glories of their ancient reading on the beauties of their modern singing on the wonders of the builders bringing on the majesties of art around them   and all these loves late struggling incessant when faith has at last united and bound them   they offer up to god for a present why i will on the whole be rather proud of it   and only taking the act in reference to the other recipients who might have allowed it   i will rejoice that god had the preference  xii  so i summed up my new resolves   too much love there can never be and where the intellect devolves   its function on love exclusively i a man who possesses both will accept the provision nothing loth will feast my love then depart elsewhere that my intellect may find its share and ponder o soul the while thou departest and see them applaud the great heart of the artist who examining the capabilities   of the block of marble he has to fashion   into a type of thought or passion not always using obvious facilities shapes it as any artist can into a perfect symmetrical man complete from head to foot of the lifesize such as old adam stood in his wifes eyes but now and then bravely aspires to consummate a colossus by no means so easy to come at and uses the whole of his block for the bust   leaving the mind of the public to finish it since cut it ruefully short he must on the face alone he expends his devotion   he rather would mar than resolve to diminish it saying applaud me for this grand notion of what a face may be as for completing it   in breast and body and limbs do that you all hail i fancy how happily meeting it   a trunk and legs would perfect the statue could man carve so as to answer volition   and how much nobler than petty cavils   were a hope to find in my spirittravels some artist of another ambition who having a block to carve no bigger has spent his power on the opposite quest   and believed to begin at the feet was best for so may i see ere i die the whole figure  xiii  no sooner said than out in the night my heart lighter and more light and still as before i was walking swift   with my senses settling fast and steadying but my body caught up in the whirl and drift   of the vestures amplitude still eddying on just before me still to be followed   as it carried me after with its motion what shall i sayas a path were hollowed   and a man went weltering through the ocean sucked along in the flying wake of the luminous watersnake  xiv  alone i am left alone once more   save for the garments extreme fold   abandoned still to bless my hold alone beside the entrancedoor of a sort of templeperhaps a college like nothing i ever saw before at home in england to my knowledge the tall old quaint irregular town   it may be though which i cant affirm any   of the famous middleage towns of germany and this flight of stairs where i sit down is it halle weimar cassel frankfort or gottingen i have to thank fort it may be gottingenmost likely through the open door i catch obliquely glimpses of a lecturehall   and not a bad assembly neither ranged decent and symmetrical   on benches waiting whats to see there which holding still by the vestures hem i also resolve to see with them cautious this time how i suffer to slip the chance of joining in fellowship with any that call themselves his friends   as these folk do i have a notion   but hista buzzing and emotion all settle themselves the while ascends by the creaking rail to the lecturedesk   step by step deliberate   because of his craniums overfreight three parts sublime to one grotesque if i have proved an accurate guesser the hawknosed highcheekboned professor i felt at once as if there ran a shoot of love from my heart to the man that sallow virginminded studious   martyr to mild enthusiasm as he uttered a kind of coughpreludious   that woke my sympathetic spasm beside some spitting that made me sorry and stood surveying his auditory with a wan pure look wellnigh celestial   those blue eyes had survived so much   while under the foot they could not smutch lay all the fleshly and the bestial over he bowed and arranged his notes till the auditorys clearing of throats was done with died into a silence   and when each glance was upward sent   each bearded mouth composed intent and a pin might be heard drop half a mile hence he pushed back higher his spectacles let the eyes stream out like lamps from cells and giving his head of haira hake   of undressed tow for colour and quantity one rapid and impatient shake   as our own young england adjusts a jaunty tie when about to impart on mature digestion some thrilling view of the surplicequestion the professors grave voice sweet though hoarse broke into his christmaseve discourse  xv  and he began it by observing   how reason dictated that men should rectify the natural swerving   by a reversion now and then to the wellheads of knowledge few and far away whence rolling grew the lifestream wide whereat we drink commingled as we needs must think with waters alien to the source to do which aimed this eves discourse since where could be a fitter time for tracing backward to its prime this christianity this lake this reservoir whereat we slake from one or other bank our thirst so he proposed inquiring first into the various sources whence   this myth of christ is derivable demanding from the evidence   since plainly no such life was livable how these phenomena should class whether twere best opine christ was or never was at all or whether he was and was not both together it matters little for the name so the idea be left the same only for practical purpose sake twas obviously as well to take the popular storyunderstanding   how the ineptitude of the time and the penmans prejudice expanding   fact into fable fit for the clime had by slow and sure degrees translated it   into this myth this individuum which when reason had strained and abated it of foreign matter left for residuum a mana right true man however whose work was worthy a mans endeavour work that gave warrant almost sufficient   to his disciples for rather believing he was just omnipotent and omniscient   as it gives to us for as frankly receiving his word their traditionwhich though it meant something entirely different from all that those who only heard it in their simplicity thought and averred it had yet a meaning quite as respectable for among other doctrines delectable was he not surely the first to insist on   the natural sovereignty of our race   here the lecturer came to a pausingplace and while his cough like a drouthy piston tried to dislodge the husk that grew to him i seized the occasion of bidding adieu to him the vesture still within my hand   xvi  i could interpret its command this time he would not bid me enter the exhausted airbell of the critic truths atmosphere may grow mephitic when papist struggles with dissenter impregnating its pristine clarity one by his daily fares vulgarity   its gust of broken meat and garlic one by his souls toomuch presuming to turn the frankincenses fuming   and vapours of the candle starlike into the cloud her wings she buoys on   each that thus sets the pure air seething   may poison it for healthy breathing but the critic leaves no air to poison pumps out with ruthless ingenuity atom by atom and leaves youvacuity thus much of christ does he reject and what retain his intellect what is it i must reverence duly poor intellect for worship truly which tells me simply what was told   if mere morality bereft   of the god in christ be all thats left elsewhere by voices manifold with this advantage that the stater   made nowise the important stumble   of adding he the sage and humble was also one with the creator you urge christs followers simplicity   but how does shifting blame evade it have wisdoms words no more felicity   the stumblingblock his speechwho laid it how comes it that for one found able to sift the truth of it from fable millions believe it to the letter christs goodness thendoes that fare better strange goodness which upon the score   of being goodness the mere due of man to fellowman much more   to godshould take another view of its possessors privilege and bid him rule his race you pledge your fealty to such rule what all from heavenly john and attic paul and that brave weatherbattered peter whose stout faith only stood completer for buffets sinning to be pardoned as more his hands hauled nets they hardened all down to you the man of men professing here at

its possessor dare propound his claim to rise oer us an inch   were goodness all some mans invention   who arbitrarily made mention what we should follow and whence flinch what qualities might take

hebrew g means camel for thus inventing thing and title worship were that mans fit requital but if the common conscience must be ultimately judge adjust its apt name to each quality already knowni would decree worship for such mere demonstration   and simple work of nomenclature   only the day i praised not nature but harvey for the circulation i would praise such a christ with pride and joy that he as none beside had taught us how to keep the mind god gave him as god gave his kind freer than they from fleshly taint i would call such a christ our saint as i declare our poet him whose insight makes all others dim a thousand poets pried at life and only one amid the strife rose to be shakespeare each shall take his crown id say for the worlds sake though some objectedhad we seen the heart and head of each what screen was broken there to give them light while in ourselves it shuts the sight we should no more admire perchance that these found truth out at a glance than marvel how the bat discerns some pitchdark caverns fifty turns led by a finer tact a gift he boasts which other birds must shift without and grope as best they can no freely i would praise the man nor one whit more if he contended that gift of his from god descended ah friend what gift of mans does not no nearer something by a jot rise an infinity of nothings   than one take euclid for your teacher distinguish kinds do crownings clothings   make that creator which was creature multiply gifts upon mans head and what when alls done shall be said butthe more gifted he i ween   that ones made christ this other pilate and this might be all that has been   so what is there to frown or smile at what is left for us save in growth of soul to rise up far past both from the gift looking to the giver and from the cistern to the river and from the finite to infinity and from mans dust to gods divinity   xvii  take all in a word the truth in gods breast lies trace for trace upon curs impressed though he is so bright and we so dim we are made in his image to witness him and were no eye in us to tell   instructed by no inner sense the light of heaven from the dark of hell   that light would want its evidence though justice good and truth were still divine if by some demons will hatred and wrong had been proclaimed law through the worlds and right misnamed no mere exposition of morality made or in part or in totality should win you to give it worship therefore and if no better proof you will care for whom do you count the worst man upon earth   be sure he knows in his conscience more of what right is than arrives at birth   in the best mans acts that we bow before this last knows bettertrue but my fact is tis one thing to know and another to practise and thence i conclude that the real godfunction is to furnish a motive and injunction for practising what we know already and such an injunction and such a motive as the god in christ do you waive and heady highminded hang your tabletvotive outside the fane on a fingerpost morality to the uttermost supreme in christ as we all confess why need we prove would avail no jot to make him god if god he were not what is the point where himself lays stress does the precept run believe in good in justice truth now understood for the first timeor believe in me who lived and died yet essentially am lord of life whoever can take the same to his heart and for mere loves sake conceive of the lovethat man obtains a new truth no conviction gains of an old one only made intense by a fresh appeal to his faded sense   xviii  can it be that he stays inside   is the vesture left me to commune with   could my soul find aught to sing in tune with even at this lecture if she tried oh let me at lowest sympathize with the lurking drop of blood that lies in the desiccated brains white roots without throb for christs attributes as the lecturer makes his special boast if loves dead there it has left a ghost admire we how from heart to brain   though to say so strike the doctors dumb one instinct rises and falls again   restoring the equilibrium and how when the critic had done his best and the pearl of price at reasons test lay dust and ashes levigable on the professors lecturetable when we looked for the inference and monition that our faith reduced to such condition be swept forthwith to its natural dusthole   he bids us when we least expect it take back our faithif it be not just whole   yet a pearl indeed as his tests affect it which fact pays damage done rewardingly so prize we our dust and ashes accordingly go home and venerate the myth i thus have experimented with this man continue to adore him rather than all who went before him and all who ever followed after   surely for this i may praise you my brother will you take the praise in tears or laughter   thats one point gained can i compass another unlearned love was safe from spurning cant we respect your loveless learning let us at least give learning honour what laurels had we showered upon her girding her loins up to perturb our theory of the middle verb or turklike brandishing a scimitar oer anapasts in comictrimeter or curing the halt and maimed iketides footnote the suppliants a fragment of a play by aeschylus while we lounged on at our indebted ease instead of which a tricksy demon sets her at titus or philemon when ignorance wags his ears of leather and hates gods word tis altogether nor leaves he his congenial thistles to go and browse on pauls epistles and you the audience who might ravage the world wide enviably savage nor heed the cry of the retriever more than herr heine before his fever i do not tell a lie so arrant   as say my passions wings are furled up and without plainest heavenly warrant   i were ready and glad to give the world up but still when you rub brow meticulous   and ponder the profit of turning holy   if not for gods for your own sake solely god forbid i should find you ridiculous deduce from this lecture all that eases you nay call yourselves if the calling pleases you christiansabhor the deists pravity go on you shall no more move my gravity than when i see boys ride acockhorse i find it in my heart to embarrass them by hinting that their sticks a mock horse and they really carry what they say carries them   xix  so sat i talking with my mind   i did not long to leave the door   and find a new church as before but rather was quiet and inclined to prolong and enjoy the gentle resting from further tracking and trying and testing this tolerance is a genial mood said i and a little pause ensued one trims the bark twixt shoal and shelf   and sees each side the good effects of it a value for religions self   a carelessness about the sects of it let me enjoy my own conviction   not watch my neighbours faith with fretfulness still spying there some dereliction   of truth perversity forgetfulness better a mild indifferentism   teaching that both our faiths though duller his shine through a dull spirits prism   originally had one colour better pursue a pilgrimage   through ancient and through modern times   to many peoples various climes where i may see saint savage sage fuse their respective creeds in one before the general fathers throne   xx  twas the horrible storm began afresh the black night caught me in his mesh whirled me up and flung me prone i was left on the collegestep alone i looked and far there ever fleeting far far away the receding gesture and looming of the lessening vesture swept forward from my stupid hand while i watched my foolish heart expand in the lazy glow of benevolence   oer the various modes of mans belief i sprang up with fears vehemence   needs must there be one way our chief best way of worship let me strive to find it and when found contrive my fellows also take their share this constitutes my earthly care gods is above it and distinct for i a man with men am linked but not a brute with brutes no gain that i experience must remain unshared but should my best endeavour to share it failsubsisteth ever gods care above and i exult that god by gods own ways occult maydoth i will believebring back all wanderers to a single track meantime i can but testify gods care for meno more can i it is but for myself i know   the world rolls witnessing around me   only to leave me as it found me men cry there but my ear is slow there races flourish or decay what boots it while yon lucid way loaded with stars divides the vault but soon my soul repairs its fault when sharpening senses hebetude she turns on my own life so viewed no mere motesbreadth but teems immense with witnessings of providence and woe to me if when i look upon that record the sole book unsealed to me i take no heed of any warning that i read have i been sure this christmaseve gods own hand did the rainbow weave whereby the truth from heaven slid into my souli cannot bid the world admit he stooped to heal my soul as if in a thunderpeal where one heard noise and one saw flame i only knew he named my name but what is the world to me for sorrow or joy in its censure when tomorrow it drops the remark with justturned head then on again that man is dead yes but for memy name calleddrawn as a conscripts lot from the laps black yawn he has dipt into on a battledawn bid out of life by a nod a glance stumbling mutemazed at natures chance with a rapid finger circled round fixed to the first poor inch of ground to fight from where his foot was found whose ear but a minute since lay free to the wide camps buzz and gossipry summoned a solitary man to end his life where his life began from the safe glad rear to the dreadful van soul of mine hadst thou caught and held by the hem of the vesture   xxi                              and i caught at the flying robe and unrepelled   was lapped again in its folds fullfraught with warmth and wonder and delight gods mercy being infinite for scarce had the words escaped my tongue when at a passionate bound i sprung out of the wandering world of rain into the little chapel again   xxii  how else was i found there bolt upright   on my bench as if i had never left it never flung out on the common at night   nor met the storm and wedgelike cleft it seen the rareeshow of peters successor or the laboratory of the professor for the vision that was true i wist true as that heaven and earth exist there sat my friend the yellow and tall with his neck and its wen in the selfsame place yet my nearest neighbours cheek showed gall   she had slid away a contemptuous space and the old fat woman late so placable eyed me with symptoms hardly mistakable of her milk of kindness turning rancid in short a spectator might have fancied that i had nodded betrayed by slumber yet kept my scat a warning ghastly through the heads of the sermon nine in number and woke up now at the tenth and lastly but again could such disgrace have happened   each friend at my elbow had surely nudged it and as for the sermon where did my nap end   unless i heard it could i have judged it could i report as i do at the close first the preacher speaks through his nose second his gesture is too emphatic   thirdly to waive whats pedagogic   the subjectmatter itself lacks logic fourthly the english is ungrammatic great news the preacher is found no pascal whom if i pleased i might to the task call of making square to a finite eye the circle of infinity and find so allbutjustsucceeding great news the sermon proves no reading where beelike in the flowers i bury me like taylors the immortal jeremy and now that i know the very worst of him what was it i thought to obtain at first of him ha is god mocked as he asks shall i take on me to change his tasks and dare despatched to a riverhead   for a simple draught of the element   neglect the thing for which he sent and return with another thing instead saying because the water found welling up from the underground is mingled with the taints of earth while thou i know dost laugh at dearth and couldst at wink or word convulse the world with the leap of a riverpulse therefore i turned from the oozings muddy   and bring thee a chalice i found instead see the brave veins in the breccia ruddy   one would suppose that the marble bled what matters the water a hope i have nursed   the waterless cup will quench my thirst better have knelt at the poorest stream that trickles in pain from the straitest rift for the less or the more is all gods gift who blocks up or breaks wide the graniteseam and here is there water or not to drink i then in ignorance and weakness taking gods help have attained to think my heart does best to receive in meekness that mode of worship as most to his mind where earthly aids being cast behind his all in all appears serene with the thinnest human veil between letting the mystic lamps the seven the many motions of his spirit pass as they list to earth from heaven for the preachers merit or demerit it were to be wished the flaws were fewer in the earthen vessel holding treasure which lies as safe in a golden ewer   but the main thing is does it hold good measure heaven soon sets right all other matters   ask else these ruins of humanity this flesh worn out to rags and tatters   this soul at struggle with insanity who thence take comfortcan i doubt which an empire gained were a loss without may it be mine and let us hope that no worse blessing befall the pope turned sick at last of todays buffoonery   of posturings and petticoatings   beside his bourbon bullys gloatings in the bloody orgies of drunk poltroonery nor may the professor forego its peace   at gottingen presently when in the dusk of his life if his cough as i fear should increase   prophesied of by that horrible husk when thicker and thicker the darkness fills the world through his misty spectacles and he gropes for something more substantial   than a fable myth or personification may christ do for him what no mere man shall   and stand confessed as the god of salvation meantime in the still recurring fear   lest myself at unawares be found   while attacking the choice of my neighbours round with none of my own madei choose here the giving out of the hymn reclaims me i have done and if any blames me thinking that merely to touch in brevity   the topics i dwell on were unlawful or worse that i trench with undue levity   on the bounds of the holy and the awful i praise the heart and pity the head of him and refer myself to thee instead of him who head and heart alike discernest   looking below light speech we utter   when frothy spume and frequent sputter prove that the souls depths boil in earnest may truth shine out stand ever before us i put up pencil and join chorus to hepzibah tune without further apology
