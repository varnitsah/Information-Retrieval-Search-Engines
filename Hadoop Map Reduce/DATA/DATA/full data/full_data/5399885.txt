classes in england it is certain that in no country in the world is the upward path more open to those who brace themselves to climb it than in our own the proportion of those who remain absolutely stationary is comparatively small we are all living on a hillside and we must either go up or down it is easier to descend than to ascend but he who fixes his eyes upwards nerves himself for the climb and determines with all his might and power to win his way towards the top is sure to find himself at the end of his day at a far higher level than when he started upon his journey it may be said and sometimes foolishly is said that luck is everything but in nineteen cases out of twenty what is called luck is simply a combination of opportunity and of the readiness and quickness to turn that opportunity to advantage the voyager must take every advantage of wind tide and current if he would make a favorable journey and for success in life it is necessary not only to be earnest steadfast and true but to have the faculty of turning every opportunity to the best advantage just as a climber utilizes every tuft of grass every little shrub every projecting rock as a hold for his hands or feet george andrews had what may be called luckthat is he had opportunities and took advantage of them and his rise in life was consequently far more rapid than if he had let them pass without grasping them but in any case his steadiness perseverance and determination to get on would assuredly have made their way in the long run if similar qualities and similar determinations are yours you need not despair of similar success in life                                                          g a henty     contents          sturdy and strong           page     i alone

you heard what he said george  oh mother mother  dont sob so my boy he is right i have seen it coming a long time and hard as it seems it will be better there is no disgrace in it i have tried my best and if my health had not broken down we might have managed but you see it was not to be i shall not mind it dear it is really only for your sake that i care about it at all  the boy had ceased sobbing and sat now with a white set face  mother it will break my heart to think that i cannot keep you from this if we could only have managed for a year or two i could have earned more then but to think of youyou in the workhouse  in a workhouse infirmary my boy his mother said gently you see it is not as if it were from any fault of ours we have done our best you and i have managed for two years but what with my health and my eyes breaking down we can do so no longer i hope it will not be for long dear you see i shall have rest and quiet and i hope i shall soon be able to be out again  not soon mother the doctor said you ought not to use your eyes for months  even months pass quickly george when one has hope i have felt this coming so long that i shall be easier and happier now it has come after all what is a workhouse infirmary but a hospital and it would not seem so very dreadful to you my going into a hospital the difference is only in name both are after all charities but the one is kept up out of subscriptions the other from the rates  his mothers words conveyed but little comfort to george andrews he had just come in from his work and had heard what the parish doctor had told his mother  i can do nothing for you here mrs andrews you must have rest and quiet for your eyes and not only that but you must have strengthening food it is no use my blinking the truth it is painful for you i know i can well understand that but i see no other way if you refuse to go i wont answer for your life  i will go doctor she had answered quietly i know that it will be best it will be a blow to my boy but i see no other way  if you dont want your boy to be alone in the world maam you will do as i advise you i will go round in the morning and get you the order of admission and as i shall be driving out that way i will if you like take you myself  thank you doctor you are very good yes i will be ready in the morning and i thank you for your offer  very well then thats settled the doctor said briskly at ten oclock i will be here  although a little rough in manner dr jeffries was a kindhearted and humane man  poor woman he said to himself as he went downstairs it is hard for her it is easy to see that she is a lady and a thorough lady too but what can i do for her i might get her a little temporary help but that would be of no useshe is completely broken down with anxiety and insufficient food and unless her eyes have a long holiday she will lose her sight no theres nothing else for it but it is hard  it was hard mrs andrews was as the doctor said a lady she had lost both her parents while she was at school she had no near relations and as she was sixteen when her mother died she had remained at school finishing her education and teaching the younger children then she had obtained a situation as governess in a gentlemans family and two years afterwards had married a young barrister who was a frequent visitor at the house  mr andrews was looked upon as a rising man and for the first seven or eight years of her marriage his wifes life had been a very happy one then her husband was prostrated by a fever which he caught in one of the midland towns while on circuit and although he partially recovered he was never himself again his power of work seemed to be lost a languor which he could not overcome took possession of him a troublesome cough ere long attacked him and two years later mrs andrews was a widow and her boy then nine years old an orphan  during the last two years of his life mr andrews had earned but little in his profession the comfortable house which he occupied had been given up and they had removed to one much smaller but in spite of this debts mounted up and when after his death the remaining furniture was sold and everything settled there remained only about two hundred pounds mrs andrews tried to get some pupils among her late husbands friends but during the last two years she had lost sight of many of these and now met with but poor success among the others she was a quiet and retiring woman and shrank from continuous solicitations and at the end of three years she found her little store exhausted  hitherto she had kept george at school but could no longer do so and giving up her lodging in brompton went down to croydon where someone had told her that they thought she would have a better chance of obtaining pupils but the cards which some of the tradesmen allowed her to put in the window led to no result and finding this to be the case she applied at one of the milliners for work this she obtained and for a year supported herself and her boy by needlework  from the time when george left school she had gone on teaching him his lessons but on the day when he was thirteen years old he declared that he would no longer submit to his mother working for both of them and setting out called at shop after shop inquiring if they wanted an errandboy he succeeded at last in getting a place at a grocers where he was to receive three shillings a week and his meals going home to sleep at night in the closetlike little attic adjoining the one room which his mother could now afford  for a while they were more comfortable than they had been for some time now that his mother had no longer george to feed her earnings and the three shillings he brought home every saturday night enabled them to live in comparative ease and on sunday something like a feast was always prepared but six months later mrs andrews felt her eyesight failing the lids became inflamed and a dull aching pain settled in the eyeballs soon she could only work for a short time together her earnings became smaller and smaller and her employers presently told her that she kept the work so long in hand that they could no longer employ her there was now only georges three shillings a week to rely upon and this was swallowed up by the rent in despair she had applied to the parish doctor about her eyes for a fortnight he attended her and at the end of that time had peremptorily given the order of which she had told her son  to her it was a relief she had seen that it must come piece by piece every article of clothing she possessed save those she wore had been pawned for food and every resource was now exhausted she was worn out with the struggle and the certainty of rest and food overcame her repugnance to the house for georges sake too much as she knew he would feel her having to accept such a refuge she was glad that the struggle was at an end the lad had for the last six months suffered greatly for her sake every meal to which he sat down at his employers seemed to choke him as he contrasted it with the fare to which she was reduced although as far as possible she had concealed from him how sore was her strait  george cried himself to sleep that night and he could scarce speak when he said goodby to his mother in the morning for he could not tell when he should see her again  you will stop where you are my boy will you not  i cannot promise mother i dont know yet what i shall do but please dont ask me to promise anything you must let me do what i think best i have got to make a home for you when you are cured i am fourteen now and am as strong as most boys of my age i ought to be able to earn a shilling a day somehow and with seven shillings a week mother and you just working a little you know so as not to hurt your eyes we ought to be able to do dont you bother about me mother i want to try anyhow what i can do till you come out when you do then i will do whatever you tell me thats fair isnt it  mrs andrews would have remonstrated but he said  well mother you see at the worst i can get a years character from dutton so that if i cant get anything else to do i can get the same sort of place again and as i am a year older than i was when he took me and can tie up parcels neatly now i ought to get a little more anyhow you see i shall be safe enough and though i have never grumbled you know motherhave ii think i would rather do anything than be a grocers boy i would rather when i grow up be a bricklayers laborer or a plowman or do any what i call mans work than be pottering about behind a counter with a white apron on weighing out sugar and currants  i cant blame you george mrs andrews said with a sigh its natural my boy if i get my eyesight and my health again when you grow up to be a man we will lay by a little money and you and i will go out together to one of the colonies it will be easier to rise again there than here and with hard work both of us might surely hope to get on there must be plenty of villages in australia and canada where i could do well with teaching and you could get work in whatever way you may be inclined to so my boy let us set that before us it will be something to hope for and work for and will cheer us to go through whatever may betide us up to that time  yes mother george said it will be comfort indeed to have something to look forward to nothing can comfort me much today but if anything could it would be some such plan as that  the last words he said to his mother as blinded with tears he kissed her before starting to work were  i shall think of our plan every day and look forward to that more than anything else in the worldnext to your coming to me again  at ten oclock dr jeffries drove up to mrs andrews humble lodging in a brougham instead of his ordinary gig having borrowed the carriage from one of the few of his patients who kept such a vehicle on purpose to take mrs andrews for she was so weak and worn that he was sure she would not be able to sit upright in a gig for the three miles that had to be traversed he managed in the course of his rounds to pass the workhouse again in the afternoon and brought george before he left work a line written in pencil on a leaf torn from his pocketbook       my darling i am very comfortable everything is clean and      nice and the doctor and people kind do not fret about      meyour loving mother  although georges expressed resolution of leaving his present situation and seeking to earn his living in some other way caused mrs andrews much anxiety she had not sought strongly to dissuade him from it no doubt it would be wiser for him to stay in his present situation where he was well treated and well fed and it certainly seemed improbable to her that he would be able to get a better living elsewhere still she could not blame him for wishing at least to try she herself shared to some extent his prejudice against the work in which he was employed there is no disgrace in honest work but she felt that she would rather see him engaged in hard manual labor than as a shop boy at any rate as he said if he failed he could come back again to croydon and with a years character from his present employer would probably be able to obtain a situation similar to that which he now held she was somewhat comforted too by a few words the doctor had said to her during their drive  i think you are fortunate in your son mrs andrews he seems to me a fine steady boy if i can in any way do him a good turn while you are away from him i will  george remained for another month in his situation for he knew that it would never do to start on his undertaking penniless at the end of that time having saved up ten shillings and having given notice to his employer he left the shop for the last time and started to walk to london it was not until he began to enter the crowded streets that he felt the full magnitude of his undertaking to be alone in london a solitary atom in the busy mass of humanity is a trying situation even for a man to a boy of fourteen it is terrible buying a penny roll george sat down to eat it in one of the niches of a bridge over the river and then kneeling up watched the barges and steamers passing below him  had it not been for his mother his first thought like that of most english boys thrown on the world would have been to go to sea but this idea he had from the first steadily set aside as out of the question his plan was to obtain employment as a boy in some manufacturing work for he thought that there by steadiness and perseverance he might make his way  on one thing he was resolved he would make his money last as long as possible three pennyworth of bread a day would he calculated be sufficient for his wants as to sleeping he thought he might manage to sleep anywhere it was summer time and the nights were warm he had no idea what the price of a bed would be or how to set about getting a lodging he did not care how roughly he lived so that he could but make his money last the first few days he determined to look about him something might turn up if it did not he would set about getting a place in earnest he had crossed waterloo bridge and keeping straight on found himself in covent garden where he was astonished and delighted at the quantities of fruit vegetables and flowers  although he twice set out in different directions to explore the streets he each time returned to covent garden there were many lads of his own age playing about there and he thought that from them he might get some hints as to how to set about earning a living they looked ragged and poor enough but they might be able to tell him somethingabout sleeping for instance for although before starting the idea of sleeping anywhere had seemed natural enough it looked more formidable now that he was face to face with it  going to a cookshop in a street off the market he bought two slices of plumpudding he rather grudged the twopence which he paid but he felt that it might be well laid out provided with the pudding he returned to the market sat himself down on an empty basket and began to eat slowly and leisurely  in a short time he noticed a lad of about his own age watching him greedily  he was far from being a respectablelooking boy his clothes were ragged and his toes could be seen through a hole in his boot he wore neither hat nor cap and his hair looked as if it had not been combed since the day of his birth there was a sharp pinched look on his face but had he been washed and combed and decently clad he would not have been a badlooking boy at any rate george liked his face better than most he had seen in the market and he longed for a talk with someone so he held out his other slice of pudding and said  have a bit  oh yes the boy replied walker eh  no i mean it really will you have a bit  no larks asked the boy  no no larks here you are  feeling assured now that no trick was intended the boy approached took without a word the pudding which george held out and seating himself on a basket close to him took a great bite  where do you live george asked when the slice of pudding had half disappeared  anywheres the boy replied waving his hand round  i mean where do you sleep  the boy nodded to intimate that his sleepingplace was included in the general description of his domicile  and no one interferes with you george inquired  the beaks they moves you on when they ketches you but ef yer get under a cart or in among the baskets you generally dodges em  and suppose you want to pay for a place to sleep where do you go and how much do you pay  tuppence the boy said or if yer want a firstrate fourpence does yer want to find a crib he asked doubtfully examining his companion  well yes george said i want to find some quiet place where i can sleep cheap you know  out of work the boy inquired  yes i havent got anything to do at present i am looking for a place you know  dont know no one about  no i have just come in from croydon  the boy shook his head  dont know nothing as would suit he said why yerd get them clothes and any money yet had walked off with the wery fust night  i should not get a room to myself i suppose even for fourpence george asked making a rapid calculation that this would come to two and fourpence per week as much as his mother had paid for a comparatively comfortable room in croydon  the boy opened his eyes in astonishment at his companion requiring a room for himself  lor bless yer yerd have a score of them with yer  i dont care about a bed george said just some place to sleep in just some straw in any quiet corner  this seemed more reasonable to the boy and he thought the matter over  well he said at last i knows of a place where they puts up the hosses of the market carts i knows a hostler there sometimes when its wery cold he lets me sleep up in the loft aint it warm and comfortable just i helps him with the hosses sometimes and thats why i will ax him if yer likes  george assented at once his ideas as to the possibility of sleeping in the open air had vanished when he saw the surroundings and a bed in a quiet loft seemed to him vastly better than sleeping in a room with twenty others  how do you live he asked the lad and whats your name  they calls me the shadder the boy said rather proudly but my real names bill  why do they call you the shadow george asked  cause the bobbies finds it so hard to lay hands on me bill replied  but what do they want to lay hands on you for george asked  why for bagging things in course bill replied calmly  bagging things do you mean stealing george said greatly shocked  well not regular prigging the shadow replied not wipes yer know nor tickers nor them kind of things i aint never prigged nothing of that kind  well what is it then you doprig george asked mystified  apples or cabbages or a bunch of radishes onions sometimes or taters that aint regular prigging you know  well it seems to me the same sort of thing george said after a pause  i tell yer it aint the same sort of thing at all the shadow said angrily everyone as aint a fool knows that taters aint wipes and no one cant say as a apple and a ticker are the same  no not the same george agreed but you see one is just as much stealing as the other  no it aint the boy reasserted one is the same as money and tother aint i am hungry and i nips a apple off a stall no one aint the worse for it you dont suppose as they misses a apple here why theres wagonloads of em and lots of em is rotten well it aint no more if i takes one than if it was rotten is it now  george thought there was a difference but he did not feel equal to explaining it  the policemen must think differently he said at last else they wouldnt be always trying to catch you  who cares for the bobbies bill said contemptuously i dont and i dont want no more jaw with you about it if yer dont likes it yer leaves it i didnt ask for yer company did i so now then  george had really taken a fancy to the boy and moreover he saw that in the event of a quarrel his chance of finding a refuge for the night was small in his sense of utter loneliness in the great city he was loath to break with the only acquaintance he had made  i didnt mean to offend you bill he said only i was sorry to hear you say you took things it seems to me you might get into trouble and it would be better after all to work for a living  what sort of work bill said derisively whos agoing to give me work does yer think i have only got to walk into a shop and ask for ployment they wouldnt want to know nothing about my character i suppose nor where i had worked before nor where my feyther lived nor nothing oh no of course not its blooming easy to get work about here only got to ax for it thats all good wages and all found thats your kind  i dont suppose its easy george said but it seems to me people could get something to do if they tried  tried the boy said bitterly do yer think we dont try why we are always trying to earn a copper or two why we begins at three oclock in the morning when the marketcarts come in and we goes on till they comes out of that there theater at night just trying to pick up a copper sometimes one does and sometimes one doesnt its a good day i tell you when we have made a tanner by the end of it dont tell me and now as to this ere stable yer means it  yes george said certainly i mean it  wery well then you be here at this corner at nine oclock i will go before that and square it with ned thats the chap i was speaking of  i had better give you something to give him george said will a shilling do  yes a bob will do for three or four nights are you going to trust me with it  of course i am george replied i am sure you wouldnt be so mean as to do me out of it besides you told me that you never stole money and those sort of things  it aint everyone as would trust me with a bob for all that bill replied and yer are running a risk yer know and i tells yer if yer goes on with that sort of game yerll get took in rarely afore yerve done well hand it over i aint agoing to bilk yer  the shadow spoke carelessly but this proof of confidence on the part of his companion really touched him and as he went off he said to himself he aint a bad sort that chap though he is so precious green i must look arter him a bit and see he dont get into no mischief  george on his part as he walked away down into the strand again felt that he had certainly run a risk in thus intrusting a tenth of his capital to his new acquaintance but the boys face and manner had attracted him and he felt that although the shadows notions of right and wrong might be of a confused nature he meant to act straight toward him  george passed the intervening hours before the time named for his meeting in covent garden in staring into the shop windows in the strand and in wondering at the constant stream of vehicles and foot passengers flowing steadily out westward he was nearly knocked under the wheels of the vehicles a score of times from his ignorance as to the rule of the road and at last he was so confused by the jostling and pushing that he was glad to turn down a side street and to sit down for a time on a doorstep  when nine oclock approached he went into a bakers shop and bought a loaf which would he thought do for supper and breakfast for himself and his companion having further invested threepence in cheese he made his way up to the market  the shadow was standing at the corner whistling loudly  oh here yer be thats all right come along i have squared ned and its all right  he led the way down two or three streets and then stopped at a gateway  you stop here he said and i will see as there aint no one but ned about  he returned in a minute  its all clear ned hes arubbing down a hoss he wont take no notice of yer as yer pass he dont want to see yer yer know cause in case anyone comed and found yer up there he could swear he never saw yer go in and didnt know nothing about yer i will go with yer to the door and then yer will see a ladder in the corner if yer whip up that yerll find it all right up there  but you are coming too aint you george asked  oh no i aint acoming yer dont want a chap like me up there i might pick yer pocket yer know besides i aint your sort  oh nonsense george said i should like to have you with me bill i should really besides whats the difference between us we have both got to work for ourselves and make our way in the world  theres a lot of difference yer dont talk the way as i do yer have been brought up different dont tell me  i may have been brought up differently bill i have been fortunate there but now you see i have got to get my living in the best way i can and if i have had a better education than you have you know ever so much more about london and how to get your living than i do so that makes us quits  oh wery well bill said its all the same to this child so if yer aint too proud here goes  he led the way down a stable yard past several doors showing the empty stalls which would be all filled when the market carts arrived at the last door on the right he stopped george looked in at the further end a man was rubbing down a horse by the faint light of a lantern the rest of the stable was in darkness  this way bill whispered  keeping close behind him george entered the stable the boy stopped in the corner  heres the ladder i will go up fust and give yer a hand when yer gets to the top  george stood quiet until his companion had mounted and then ascended the ladder which was fixed against the wall presently a voice whispered in his ear  give us your hand mind how yer puts your foot  in a minute he was standing in the loft his companion drew him along in the darkness and in a few steps arrived at a pile of hay  there yer are bill said in a low voice yer ave only to make yourself comfortable there now mind you dont fall down one of the holes into the mangers  i wish we had a little light george said as he ensconced himself in the hay  i will give you some light in a minute bill said as he left his side and directly afterwards a door opened and the light of a gaslight in the yard streamed in  thats where they pitches the hay in bill said as he rejoined him i shuts it up afore i goes to sleep cause the master he comes out sometimes when the carts comes in and there would be a blooming row if he saw it open but we are all right now  thats much nicer george said now heres a loaf i brought with me we will cut it in half and put by a half for the morning and eat the other half between us now and i have got some cheese here too  thats tiptop the boy said yerre a good sort i could see that and i am pretty empty i am for i aint had nothing except that bit of duff yer gave me since morning and i only had a crust then cept for running against you i aint been lucky today couldnt get a job nohows and it aint for want of trying neither  for some minutes the boys ate in silence george had given much the largest portion to his companion for he himself was too dead tired to be very hungry when he had finished he said  look here bill we will talk in the morning i am so dead beat i can scarcely keep my eyes open so i will just say my prayers and go off to sleep  say your prayers bill said in astonishment do yer mean to say as yer says prayers  of course i do george replied dont you  never said one in my life bill said decidedly dont know how dont see as it would do no good ef i did  it would do good bill george said i hope some day you will think differently and i will teach you some you will like  i dont want to know none bill said positively a missionary chap he came and prayed with an old woman i lodged with once i could not make head nor tail of it and she died just the same so you see what good did it do her  but george was too tired to enter upon a theological argument he was already half asleep and bills voice sounded a long way off  goodnight he muttered i will talk to you in the morning and in another minute he was fast asleep  bill took an armful of hay and shook it lightly over his companion then he closed the door of the loft and threw himself on the hay and was soon also sound asleep when george woke in the morning the daylight was streaming in through the cracks of the door his companion was gone he heard the voices of several men in the yard while a steady champing noise and an occasional shout or the sound of a scraping on the stones told him the stalls below were all full now  george felt that he had better remain where he was bill had told him the evening before that the horses and carts generally set out again at about nine oclock and he thought he had better wait till they had gone before he slipped down below closing his eyes he was very soon off to sleep again when he woke bill was sitting by his side looking at him  well you are a oner to sleep the boy said why its nigh ten oclock and its time for us to be moving ned will be going off in a few minutes and the stables will be locked up till the evening  is there time to eat our bread and cheese george asked  no we had better eat it when we get down to the market come along  george at once rose shook the hay off his clothes and descended the ladder bill leading the way there was no one in the stable and the yard was also empty on reaching the market they sat down on two empty baskets and at once began to eat their bread and cheese     chapter ii  two friends   i did wake before bill george said after he had eaten a few mouthfuls but you were out  yes i turned out as soon as the carts began to come in bill said and a wery good morning i have had one old chap gave me twopence for looking arter his hoss and cart while he went into the market with his flowers but the best move was just now a chap as was driving off with flowers one of them swell westend shops i expect by the look of the trap let his rug fall he didnt see it till i ran after him with it then he gave me a tanner that was something like have yer finished yer bread and cheese  yes george said and i could manage a drink of water if i could get one  theres a fountain handy bill said but you come along with me i am agoing to stand two cups of coffee if yer aint too proud to take it and he looked doubtfully at his companion  i am not at all too proud george said for he saw that the slightest hesitation would hurt his companions feelings  it aint fustrate coffee bill said as with a brightened look on his face he turned and led the way to a little coffeestall but its hot and sweet and yer cant expect more nor that for a penny  george found the coffee really better than he had expected and bill was evidently very much gratified at his expression of approval  now he said when they had both finished for a draw of baccy and he produced a short clay pipe dont yer smoke  no i havent begun yet  ah ye dont know what a comfort a pipe is bill said why when yer are cold and hungry and down on your luck a pipe is a wonderful thing and so cheap why a ounce of baccy will fill yer thirty pipes if yer dont squeeze it in too hard well an ounce of baccy costs threepence halfpenny so as i makes out yer gets eight pipes for a penny and now he went on when he had filled and lit his pipe lets know whats yer game  you mean what am i going to do george asked  bill nodded  i want to get employment in some sort of works i have been an errandboy in a grocers for more than a year and i have got a written character from my master in my pocket but i dont like the sort of thing i would rather work with my own hands there are plenty of works where they employ boys and you know one might get on as one gets older the first thing is to find out whereabouts works of that sort are  there are lots of works at the east end i have heard tell bill said and then theres clerkenwell and kings cross they aint so far off and there are works there all sorts of works i should say but i dont know nuffin about that sort of work the only work as i have done is holding hosses and carrying plants into the market and sometimes when i have done pretty well i goes down and lays out what i got in echoes or globes or evening standards that pays yer that does for if yer can sell them all yer will get a bob for eight pennorth of papers that gives yer fourpence for an hours work and i calls that blooming good and cant yer get a tuckout for a bob oh no i should think not well what shall it be i knows the way out to whitechapel and to clerkenwell so whichever yer likes i can show yer  if clerkenwells the nearest we may as well try that first george said and i shall be much obliged to you for showing the way  the two boys spent the whole day in going from workshop to workshop for employment but the answers to his application were unvarying either he was too young or there was no place vacant george took the disappointment quietly for he had made up his mind that he would have difficulty in getting a place but bill became quite angry on behalf of his companion  this is worse nor the market he said a chap can pick up a few coppers there and here we have been atramping about all day and aint done nothing  day after day george set out on his quest but all was without success he and bill still slept in the loft and after the first day he took to getting up at the same time as his companion and going out with him to try and pick up a few pence from the men with the marketcarts every other morning they were able to lie later as there were only regular marketdays three mornings a week  on market mornings he found that he earned more than bill his better clothes giving him an advantage as the men were more willing to trust their carts and rugs to the care of a quiet respectablelooking boy than to that of the arabs who frequented the garden but all that was earned was laid out in common between the two boys and george found himself seldom obliged to draw above a few pence on his private stock he had by this time told the shadow exactly how much money he had and the boy seeing the difficulty that george found in getting work was most averse to the store being trenched upon and always gave his vote against the smallest addition to their ordinary fare of bread and cheese being purchased except from their earnings of the day this george felt was the more creditable on bills part inasmuch as the latter had in deference to his prejudices abstained from the petty thefts of fruit with which before he had seasoned his dry crusts  george had learned now what bill knew of his history which was little enough he supposed he had had a father but he knew nothing of him whether he had died or whether he had cut away and left mother bill had no idea his mother he remembered well though she had died when he was as he said a little chap he spoke of her always in a hushed voice and in a tone of reverence as a superior being  we was poor you know he said to george and i know mother was often short of grub but she was just kind i dont never remember her whacking me always spoke soft and low like she was good she was she used to pray you know and what i remember most is as the night afore she was took away to a hospital she says try and live honest bill it will be hard but try my boy dont you take to stealing however poor you may be and i aint bill said earnestly over and over again when i has seed any chap going along with a ticker handy which i could have boned and got away among the carts as safe as ninepence or when i has seed a woman with her purse asticking out of them outside pockets and i aint had a penny to bless myself with and perhaps nothing to eat all day i have felt it hard not to make a grab but i just thought of what she said and i aint done it as i told yer i have often nabbed things off the stalls or out of the baskets or carts it didnt seem to me as that was stealing but as you says it is i aint going to do so no more now look yer here george they tells me as the parsons says as when people die and they are good they goes up there yer know  george nodded for there was a question in his companions tone  then of course bill went on she is up there now it aint likely as ever i should see her again cause you know there aint nothing good about me but if she was to come my way wherever i might be and was to say to me bill have you been astealing do yer think she would feel very bad about them ere apples and things  no bill i am sure she would not you see you didnt quite know that was stealing and you kept from stealing the things that you thought she spoke of and now that you see it is wrong taking even little things you are not going to take them any more  that i wont so help me bob the boy said not if i never gets another apple between my teeth  thats right bill you see you ought to do it not only to please your mother but to please god thats what my mother has told me over and over again  has she now bill said with great interest and did you use to prig apples and sichlike sometimes  no george said not that sort of thing but she was talking of things in general of doing things that were wrong such as telling lies and deceiving and that sort of thing  and your mother thinks as god knows all about it  george nodded  and that he dont like it eh when things is done bad  george nodded again  lor what a time he must have of it bill said in solemn wonder why i heard a woman say last week as six children was enough to worrit anyone into the grave and just to think of all of us and bill waved his arm in a comprehensive way and repeated what a time he must have of it  for a time the boys sat silent in their loft bill wondering over the problem that had presented itself to him and george trying to find some appropriate explanation in reply to the difficulty bill had started at last he said  i am afraid bill that i cant explain all this to you for i am not accustomed to talk about such things my mother talks to me sometimes and of course i went to church regularly but thats different from my talking about it but you know what we have got to do is to try and please god and love him because he loves us  thats whear it is bill said thats what ive heard fellows say beats em if he loves a chap like me how is it he dont do something for him why dont he get you a place for instance you aint been aprigging apples or aputting him out thats what i wants to know  yes bill but as i have heard my mother say it would be very hard to understand if this world were the only one but you see we are only here a little time and after that theres on and on and on right up without any end and what does it matter if we are poor or unhappy in this little time if we are going to be ever so happy afterwards this is only a sort of little trial to see how we behave as it were and if we do the best we can even though that best is very little then you see we get a tremendous reward for instance you would not think a man was unkind who kept you five minutes holding his horse on a cold day if he were going to give you enough to get you clothes and good lodging for the rest of your life  no i should think not bill said fervently so its like that is it  george nodded like that only more  my eye bill murmured to himself lost in astonishment at this new view of things  after that there were few evenings when before they nestled themselves down in the hay the boys did not talk on this subject at first george felt awkward and nervous in speaking of it for like the generality of english boys however earnest their convictions may be he was shy of speaking what he felt but his companions eagerness to know more of this to him new story encouraged him to speak and having in his bundle a small bible which his mother had given him he took to reading to bill a chapter or two in the mornings when they had not to go out to the early market  it is true that bills questions frequently puzzled him the boy saw things in a light so wholly different from that in which he himself had been accustomed to regard them that he found a great difficulty in replying to them  george wrote a letter to his mother telling her exactly what he was doing for he knew that if he only said that he had not yet succeeded in getting work she would be very anxious about him and although he had nothing satisfactory to tell her at least he could tell her that he had sufficient to eat and as much comfort as he cared for twice he received replies from her directed to him at a little coffeehouse which when they had had luck the boys occasionally patronized as time went on without his succeeding in obtaining employment georges hopes fell and at last he said to his mate i will try for another fortnight bill and if at the end of that time i dont get anything to do i shall go back to croydon again  but yer can earn yer living here bill remonstrated  i can earn enough to prevent me from starving but that is all bill i came up to london in hopes of getting something to do by which i might some day make my way up if i were to stop here like this i should be going down and a nice sight i should be to mother if when she gets well enough to come out of the infirmary i were to go back all in rags  what sort of a place is croydon bill asked is there any chance of picking up a living there cause i tells yer fair if yer goes off i goes with yer i aint athinking of living with yer george but we might see each other sometime mightnt we yer wouldnt mind that  mind it certainly not bill you have been a good friend to me and i should be sorry to think of you all alone here  oh blow being a good friend to yer bill replied i aint done nothing except put yer in the way of getting a sleepingplace and as its given me one too i have had the best of that job its been good of yer to take up with a chap like me as dont know how to read or write or nothing and as aint no good anyway but you will let me go with yer to croydon wont yer  certainly i will bill but you wont be able to see much of me i shall have to get a place like the last the man i was with said he would take me back again if i wanted to come and you know i am all day in the shop or going out with parcels and of course you would have to be busy too at something  what sort of thing do yer think george i can hold a hoss but that aint much for a living one may go for days without getting a chance  i should say bill that your best chance would be to try and get work either in a brickfield or with a marketgardener at any rate we should be able to get a talk for half an hour in the evening i was always done at nine oclock and if we were both in work we could take a room together  bill shook his head  that would be wery nice but i couldnt have it george i knows as i aint fit company for yer and if yer was with a shopkeeping bloke he would think yer was going to run off with the money if he knew yer kept company with a chap like me no the greement must be as yer goes yer ways and i goes mine but i hopes as yer will find suffin to do up here not cause as i wouldnt like to go down to this place of yourn but because yer have set yer heart on getting work here  a week later the two boys were out late in covent garden trying to earn a few pence by fetching up cabs and carriages for people coming out from a concert in the floral hall george had just succeeded in earning threepence and had returned to the entrance to the hall and was watching the people come out and trying to get another job presently a gentleman with a girl of some nine or ten years old came out and took their place on the footpath  can i call you a carriage sir george asked  no thank you lad a man has gone for it  george fell back and stood watching the girl who was in a white dress with a little hood trimmed with swansdown over her head  presently his eye fell on something on which the light glittered as it hung from her neck just as he was looking a hand reached over her shoulder there was a jerk and a sudden cry from the child then a boy dived into the crowd and at the same moment george dashed after him there was a cry of stop thief and several hands made a grab at george as he dived through the crowd but he slipped through them and was soon in the roadway  some twenty yards ahead of him he saw the boy running he turned up bow street and then dashed down an alley he did not know that he was followed until suddenly george sprang upon his back and the two fell with a crash the young thief undermost george seized his right hand and kneeling upon him twisted it behind his back and forced him to open his fingers the boy taken by surprise and not knowing who was his assailant making but slight resistance  george seized the gold locket and dashed back at full speed into the market and was soon in the thick of the crowd round the entrance the gentleman was standing talking to a policeman who was taking a note of the description of the lost trinket the girl was standing by crying  here is your locket george said putting it into her hand i saw the boy take it and have got it from him  oh papa papa the girl cried here is my locket again  why where did you get it from her father asked in astonishment  this boy has just given it to me she replied he says he took it from the boy who stole it  which boy nellie which is the boy who brought it back  the girl looked round but george was gone  why didnt you stop him my dear her father said of course i should wish to thank and reward him for the locket was a very valuable one and the more so to us from its having belonged to your mother did you notice the boy policeman  no sir i did not see him at all  was he a poor boy nellie  not a very very poor boy father the girl replied at least i dont think so but i only looked at his face he didnt speak like a poor boy at all  would you know him again  oh yes i am sure i should he was a goodlooking boy with a nice face  well i am very sorry he has gone away my dear evidently he does not want a reward but at any rate i should have liked to thank him are you always on this beat policeman  i am on night duty sir while the concerts are on  at any rate i dare say you know the constables who are about here in the daytime i wish you would mention the fact to them and ask them if they get any clew to the boy who has rendered me this service to let me know here is a card with my name and address  after restoring the locket george made his way to the entrance to the stables where he generally met bill after the theater had closed and there was no farther chance of earning money it was not till half an hour later that the boy came running up  i have got eightpence he said that is something like luck i got three jobs one stood me fourpence the other two gave me tuppence each what do yer say shall we have a cup of coffee afore we turns in  i think we had better not bill i have got sixpence we will put that by with the sixpence we saved the other day for the hostler we havent given him anything for some time your eightpence will get us a good breakfast in the morning  when they had comfortably nestled themselves in the hay george told his companion how he had rescued and restored the locket  and he didnt give yer nuffin i never heerd tell of such a scaly trick as that i should ha said it ought to have been good for a bob anyway  i did not wait to see bill directly i had given the little girl her locket i bolted  well that were soft why couldnt yer have waited to have seen what the bloke meant to give yer  i did not want to be paid for such a thing as that george replied i dont mind being paid when i have done a job for anyone but this was different altogether  bill meditated for a minute or two  i cant see no difference nohow he said at last yer did him a good turn and got the thing back i dare say it were worth five bob  a good deal more than that bill  more nor that well then he ought to have come down handsome didnt yer run like winking and didnt yer jump on the chaps back and knock him down and didnt yer run back again and warnt there a chance ef one of the bobbies had got hold of yer collar and found it in yer hand of yer being had up for stealing it and then yer walks off and dont give him a chance of giving yer nuffin my eye but yer are a flat  i dont suppose you will quite understand bill but when people do a thing to oblige somebody and not as a piece of regular work they dont expect to be paid i shouldnt have liked it if they had offered me money for such a thing  well ef yer says so no doubt its right bill rejoined but it seems a rum sort of notion to me when people loses things they expects to pay to get em back why dont yer see outside the plice station and in the shop winders papers offering so much for giving back things as is lost i cant read em myself yer know but chaps have read em to me why ive heerd of as much as five quid being offered for watches and sichlike as was lost by ladies coming out of theayters and i have often thought what a turn of luck it would be to light on one of em and now yer says as i oughtnt to take the money ef i found it  no i dont say that bill if you found a thing and saw a reward offered and you wanted the money you would have good right to take it but you see in this case i saw how sorry the girl was at losing her locket and i went after it to please her and i was quite content that i got it back for her  bill tried again to think the matter over in his mind but he was getting warm and sleepy and in a few minutes was sound off  two or three days later the lads had to their great satisfaction obtained a job walnuts were just coming in and the boys were engaged to take off the green shucks bill was particularly pleased for he had never before been taken on for such a job and he considered it a sort of promotion five or six women were also employed and as the group were standing round some great baskets bill suddenly nudged his friend  i say my eye aint that little gal pretty  george looked up from his work and at once recognized the girl to whom he had restored the locket her eye fell on him at the same moment  there papa she exclaimed i told you if you brought me down to the market i felt sure i should know the boy again if i saw him thats him the one looking down into the basket but he knew me again for i saw him look surprised when he noticed me  the gentleman made his way through the women to george  my lad are you the boy who restored the locket to my daughter three evenings ago  yes sir george said coloring as he looked up i was standing close by when the boy took it so i gave chase and brought it back and thats all  you were off again in such a hurry that we hadnt time to thank you just come across to my daughter i suppose you can leave your work for a minute  yes sir we are working by the job george said and looking rather shamefaced he followed the gentleman to the sidewalk  this is your boy as you call him nellie  i was sure i should know him again the child said though i only saw him for a moment we are very much obliged to you boy papa and me because it had been mammas locket and we should have been very sorry to have lost it  i am glad i was able to get it back for you george said but i dont want to be thanked for doing it and i dont want to be paid either thank you sir he said flushing as the gentleman put his hand into his pocket  no and why not the gentleman said in surprise you have done me a great service and there is no reason why i should not pay you for it if i had lost it i would gladly have paid a reward to get it back  thank you sir george said quietly but all the same i would rather not be paid for a little thing like that  you are a strange fellow the gentleman said again one does not expect to find a boy in the market here refusing money when he has earned it  i should not refuse it if i had earned it george said but i dont call getting back a locket for a young lady who has lost it earning money  how do you live lad you dont speak like a boy who has been brought up in the market here  i have only been here three months george said i came up to london to look for work but could not get any most days i go about looking for it and do what odd jobs i can get when theres a chance  what sort of work do you want have you been accustomed to any work perhaps i could help you  i have been a year as an errandboy george answered but i didnt like it and i thought i would rather get some sort of work that i could work at when i got to be a man instead of sticking in a shop  did you run away from home then the gentleman asked  no sir my mother was ill and went into an infirmary and so as i was alone i thought i would come to london and try to get the sort of work i liked but i have tried almost all over london  and are you all alone here  no sir not quite alone i found a friend in that boy there and we have worked together since i came up  well lad if you really want work i can give it you  oh thank you sir george exclaimed fervently  and your friend too if he likes i have some works down at limehouse and employ a good many boys here is the address and he took a card from his pocket wrote a few words on the back of it and handed it to george  ask for the foreman and give him that and he will arrange for you to begin work on monday come along nellie we have got to buy the fruit for tomorrow you know  so saying he took his daughters hand and george wild with delight ran off to tell bill that he had obtained work for them both  well nellie are you satisfied  yes i am glad you could give him work papa didnt he look pleased wasnt it funny his saying he wouldnt have any money  yes i hardly expected to have met with a refusal in covent garden but you were right child and you are a better judge of character than i gave you credit for you said he was a nicelooking lad and spoke like a gentleman and he does he is really a very good style of boy of course he is shabby and dirty now and you see he has been an errandboy at a grocers but he must have been better brought up than the generality of such lads the one he called his friend looked a wild sort of specimen altogether a different sort of boy i should say he was one of the regular arabs hanging about this place if so i expect a very few days work will sicken him but i shouldnt be surprised if your boy as you call him sticks to it  the next morning the two boys presented themselves at mr penroses works at limehouse these were sawing and planing works and the sound of many wheels and the hoarse rasping sound of saws innumerable came out through the open windows of the building as they entered the yard  now what do you boys want a workman said as he appeared at one of the doors  we want to see the foreman george said i have a card for him from mr penrose  i will let him know the man replied  two minutes later the foreman came out and george handed him the card he read what mr penrose had written upon it and said  very well you can come in on monday pay eight shillings a week seven oclock there that will do oh what are your names taking out a pocketbook george andrews and william smith and then with a nod he went back into his room while the boys almost bewildered at the rapidity with which the business had been arranged went out into the street again  there we are bill employed george said in delight  yes there we is bill agreed but in a more doubtful tone its a rum start aint it i dont expect i shall make much hand of it but i am wery glad for you george  why shouldnt you make much hand of it you are as strong as i am  yes but then you see i aint been accustomed to work regular and i expect i shant like itnot at first but i am going to try george dont yer think as i aint agoing to try i aint that sort still i expects i shall get the sack afore long  nonsense bill you will like it when you once get accustomed to it and its a thousand times better having to draw your pay regularly at the end of the week than to get up in the morning not knowing whether you are going to have breakfast or not wont mother be pleased when i write and tell her i have got a place last time she wrote she said that she was a great deal better and the doctor thought she would be out in the spring and then i hope she will be coming up here and that will be jolly  yes thats just it bill said thats whear it is you and i will get on fustrate but it aint likely as your mother would put up with a chap like me  my mother knows that you have been a good friend to me bill and that will be quite enough for her you wait till you see her  my eye what a lot of little houses there is about here bill said just all the same pattern and how wide the streets is to what they is up drury lane  yes we ought to have no difficulty in getting a room here bill now that we shall have money to pay for it only think we shall have sixteen shillings a week between us  its a lot of money bill said vaguely sixteen bob my eye there aint no saying what it will buy i wish i looked a little bit more respectable he said with a new feeling as to the deficiencies of his attire it didnt matter in the garden but to go to work with a lot of other chaps these togs aint what you may call spicy  they certainly are not bill george said with a laugh we must see what we can manage  georges own clothes were worn and old but they looked respectable indeed by the side of those of his companion bills elbows were both out the jacket was torn and ragged he had no waistcoat and his trousers were far too large for him and were kept up by a single brace and were patched in a dozen places  when george first met him he was shoeless but soon after they had set up housekeeping together george had bought from a cobblers stall a pair of boots for two shillings and these although now almost falling to pieces were still the best part of bills outfit     chapter iii  work   the next morning george went out with the bundle containing his sunday clothes which had been untouched since his arrival in town and going to an oldclothes shop he exchanged them for a suit of working clothes in fair condition and then returning hid his bundle in the hay and rejoined bill who had from early morning been at work shelling walnuts although bill was somewhat surprised at his companion not beginning work at the usual time he asked no questions for his faith in george was so unbounded that everything he did was right in his eyes  there is our last days work in the market bill george said as they reached their loft that evening  its your last days work george i aint no doubt but i expects it aint mine by a long way i have been athinking over this ere go and i dont think as it will act nohow in the first place i aint fit to go to such a place and they are sure to make it hot for me  thats nonsense bill there are lots of roughish sort of boys in works of that sort and you will soon be at home with the rest  in the next place bill went on unheeding the interruption i shall be getting into some blooming row or other afore i have been there a week and they will like enough turn you out as well as me thats what i am athinking most on george if they chucks me the chances are as they chucks you too and if they did that arter all the pains you have had to get a place i should go straight off and make a hole in the water thats how i looks at it  but i dont think bill that theres any chance of your getting into a row of course at first we must both expect to be blown up sometimes but if we do our best and dont answer back again we shall do as well as the others  oh i shouldnt cheek em back bill said i am pretty well used to getting blown up every ones always at it and i know well enough as it dont pay to cheek back not unless you have got a marketcart between you and a clear road for a bolt i wasnt born yesterday yerve been wery good to me you have george and before any harm should come to yer through me shelp me id chuck myself under a marketwagon  i know you would bill but whatever you say you have been a far greater help to me than i have to you anyhow we are not going to part now you are coming to work with me to start with and i know you will do your best to keep your place if you fail well so much the worse it cant be helped but after our being sent there by mr penrose i feel quite sure that the foreman would not turn me off even if he had to get rid of you  dyer think so  i do indeed bill  will yer take yer davey  yes if its any satisfaction to you bill i will take my davey that i do not think that they would turn me off even if they sent you away  and yer really wants me to go with yer so help yer  really and truly bill  wery well george then i goes but mind yer its cause yer wishes me  so saying bill curled himself up in the hay and george soon heard by his regular breathing that he was sound asleep  the next morning before anyone was stirring they went down into the yard as was their custom on sunday mornings for a good wash stripping to the waist and taking it by turns to pump over each other bill had at first protested against the fashion saying as he did very well and did not see no use in it but seeing that george really enjoyed it he followed his example after a morning or two indeed and with the aid of a piece of soap which george had bought bill got himself so bright and shiny as to excite much sarcastic comment and remark from his former companions which led to more than one pugilistic encounter  that morning george remained behind in the loft for a minute or two after bill had run down attired only in his trousers when bill went up the ladder after his ablutions he began hunting about in the hay  what are you up to bill  blest if i can find my shirt heres two of yourn knocking about but i cant see wheres mine nor my jacket neither  its no use your looking bill for you wont find them and even if you found them you couldnt put em on i have torn them up  torn up my jacket bill exclaimed in consternation what lark are yer up to now george  no lark at all we are going together to work tomorrow and you could not go as you were so you put on that shirt and those things and he threw over the clothes he had procured the day before  bill looked in astonishment  why where did yer get em george i knows yer only had four bob with what we got yesterday yer didnt find em and yer didntno in course yer didntnip em  no i didnt steal them certainly george said laughing i swapped my sunday clothes for them yesterday i can do without them very well till we earn enough to get another suit there dont say anything about it bill else i will punch your head  bill stared at him with open eyes for a minute and then threw himself down in the hay and burst into tears  oh i say dont do that george exclaimed what have you to cry about  aint it enough to make a cove cry bill sobbed to find a chap doing things for him like that i wish i may die if i dont feel as if i should bust its too much thats what it is and its all on one side thats the wust of it  i dare say you will make it even some time bill so dont lets say anything more about it but put on your clothes we will have a cup of coffee each and a loaf between us for breakfast and then we will go for a walk into the park the same as we did last sunday and hear the preaching  the next morning they were up at their accustomed hour and arrived at the works at limehouse before the doors were opened presently some men and boys arrived the doors were opened and the two boys followed the others in  hallo who are you the man at the gate asked  george gave their names and the man looked at his timebook  yes its all right you are the new boys you are to go into that planingshop and he pointed to one of the doors opening into the yard  the boys were not long before they were at work bill was ordered to take planks from a large pile and to hand them to a man who passed them under one of the planingmachines george was told to take them away as fast as they were finished and pile them against a wall when the machines stopped for any adjustment or alteration both were to sweep up the shavings and ram them into bags in which they were carried to the enginehouse  for a time the boys were almost dazzled by the whirl of the machinery the rapid motion of the numerous wheels and shafting overhead and of the broad bands which carried the power from them to the machinery on the floor by the storm of shavings which flew from the cutters and the unceasing activity which prevailed around them beyond receiving an occasional order shouted in a loud tonefor conversation in an ordinary voice would have been inaudiblenothing occurred till the bell rang at halfpast eight for breakfast then the machinery suddenly stopped and a strange hush succeeded the din which had prevailed  how long have we got now george asked the man from whose bench he had been taking the planks  half an hour the man said as he hurried away  well what do you think of it bill george asked when they had got outside  didnt think as there could be such a row bill replied why talk about the garden lor why it aint nothing to it i hardly knew what i was adoing at first  no more did i bill you must mind what you do and not touch any of those straps and wheels and things i know when i was at croydon there was a man killed in a sawmill there by being caught in the strap they said it drew him up and smashed him against the ceiling and now we had better look out for a bakers  i suppose there aint a coffeestall nowhere handy  i dont suppose there is bill at any rate we have no time to spare to look for one theres a pump in the yard so we can have a drink of water as we come back well the work doesnt seem very hard bill george said as they ate their bread  no it aint hard bill admitted if it werent for all them rattling wheels but i expect it aint going to be like that regular theyve just gived us an easy job to begin with yerll see it will be worse presently  we shall soon get accustomed to the noise bill and i dont think we shall find the work any harder they dont put boys at hard work but just jobs like we are doing to help the men  what shall we do about night george  i think that at dinnertime we had better ask the man we work for he looks a goodnatured sort of chap he may know of someone he could recommend us to  they worked steadily till dinnertime then as they came out george said to the man with whom they were working  we want to get a room we have been lodging together in london and dont know anyone down here i thought perhaps you could tell us of some quiet respectable people who have a room to let  the man looked at george more closely than he had hitherto done  well there aint many people as would care about taking in two boys but you seem a wellspoken young chap and different to most of em do you think you could keep regular hours and not come clattering in and out fifty times in the evening and playing tomfools tricks of all sorts  i dont think we should be troublesome george said and i am quite sure we shouldnt be noisy  you would want to be cooked for in course  no i dont think so george said beyond hot water for a cup of tea in the evening we should not want much cooking done especially if there is a coffeestall anywhere where we could get a cup in the morning  you havent got any traps i suppose  george looked puzzled  i mean bed and chairs and so on  george shook his head  we might get them afterwards but we havent any now  well i dont mind trying you young fellows i have got a bedroom in my place empty a brother of mine who lodged and worked with me has just got a job as foreman down in the country at any rate i will try you for a week and if at the end of that time you and my missis dont get on together you must shift two bob a week i suppose that will about suit you  george said that would suit very well and expressed his thanks to the man for taking them in  they had been walking briskly since they left the works and now stopped suddenly before the door of a house in a row it was just like its neighbor except that george noticed that the blinds and windows were cleaner than the others and that the door had been newly painted and varnished  here we are the man said you had best come in and see the missis and the room missis he shouted and a woman appeared from the backroom i have let harrys room mother he said and these are the new lodgers  my stars john she exclaimed you dont mean to say that you let the room to them two boys i should have thought you had better sense why they will be trampling up and down the stairs like young hosses wear out the oil cloth and frighten the baby into fits i never did hear such a thing  i think they are quiet boys bessie and wont give much trouble at any rate i have agreed to try them for a week and if you dont get on with them at the end of that time of course they must go they have only come to work at the shop today they work with me and as far as i can see they are quiet young chaps enough come along lads i will show you your room  it was halfway up the stairs at the back of the house over the kitchen which was built out there it was a comfortable little room not large but sufficiently so for two boys there was a bed a chest of drawers two chairs and a dressingtable and a strip of carpet ran alongside the bed and there was moreover a small fireplace  will that do for you the man asked  capitally george said it could not be nicer while bill was so taken aback by its comfort and luxury that he was speechless  well thats settled then the man said if you have got any things you can bring em in when you like  we have not got any to speak of george said flushing a little i came up from the country three months ago to look for work and beyond odd jobs i have had nothing to do since so that everything i had is pretty well gone but i can pay a weeks rent in advance he said putting his hand in his pocket  oh you neednt mind that the man said as you work in the shop its safe enough now i must get my dinner else i shall be late for work  well bill what do you think of that george asked as they left the house  my eye bill exclaimed in admiration aint it nice just why yer couldnt get a room like that not furnished anywhere near the market not at four bob a week aint it clean just so help me if the house dont look as if it has been scrubbed down every day what a woman that must be for washing  yes we shall have to rub our feet well bill and make as little mess as we can in going in and out  i should think so bill said it dont seem to me as if it could be true as were to have such a room as that to ourselves and to walk into a house bold without being afraid as somebody would have his eye on you and chivey you and eight bob a week for grub regular  well lets get some bread and cheese bill pretty near half our time must be gone and mind we must be very saving at first there will be several things to get a kettle and a teapot and a coffeepot and some cups and saucers and we shall want a gridiron for frying rashers of bacon upon  my eye wont it be prime bill broke in  and we shall want some towels george went on with his enumeration  towels repeated bill what are they like  they are cloths for wiping your hands and face after you have washed  well if yer says we wants em george of course we must get em but ive always found my hands dried quick enough by themselves especially if i gived em a rub on my trousers  and then bill you know george went on i want to save every penny we can so as to get some things to furnish two rooms by the time mother comes out  yes in course we must bill agreed warmly though a slight shade passed over his face at the thought that they were not to be always alone together well yer know george i am game for anythink i can hold on with a pennorth of bread a day i have done it over and over and if yer says the word i am ready to do it again  no bill we neednt do that george laughed still we must live as cheap as we can we will stick to bread for breakfast and bread and cheese for dinner and bread for supper with sometimes a rasher as a great treat at any rate we will try to live on six shillings a week  oh we can do that fine bill said confidently and then two shillings for rent and that will leave us eight shillings a week to put by  mother said that the doctor didnt think she would be able to come out til the spring we are just at the beginning of november so if she comes out the first of april thats five months say twentytwo weeks twentytwo weeks at eight shillings let me see thats eight pounds in twenty weeks eight pounds sixteen altogether that would furnish two rooms very well i should think  my eye i should think so bill exclaimed for to his mind eight pound sixteen was an almost unheardof sum and the fact that his companion had been able to calculate it increased if possible his admiration for him  it needed but two or three days to reconcile mrs grimstone to her new lodgers  i wouldnt have believed she said at the end of the week to a neighbor as two boys could have been that quiet they comes in after work as regular as the master they rubs their feet on the mat and you can scarce hear em go upstairs and i dont hear no more of em till they goes out agin in the morning they dont come back here to breakfast or dinner eats it i suppose standing like  but what do they do with themselves all the evening mrs grimstone  one of em reads to the other i think i can hear a voice going regular over the kitchen  and hows their room  as clean and tidy as a new pin they dont lock the door when they goes out and i looked in yesterday expecting to find it like a pigsty but they had made the bed afore starting for work and set everything in its place and laid the fire like for when they come back  mrs grimstone was right george had expended six pence in as many old books at a bookstall one of them was a spellingbook and he had at once set to work teaching bill his letters bill had at first protested he had done very well without reading and didnt see much good in it however as george insisted he gave way as he would have done to any proposition whatever upon which his friend had set his mind so for an hour every evening after they had finished tea bill worked at his letters and spelling and then george read aloud to him from one of the other books  you must get on as fast as you can this winter bill he said because when the summer evenings come we shall want to go for long walks  they found that they did very well upon the sum they agreed on tea and sugar cost less than george had expected mrs grimstone took in for them regularly a halfpennyworth of milk and for tea they were generally able to afford a bloater between them or a very thin rasher of bacon their enjoyment of their meals was immense bill indeed frequently protested that they were spending too much money but george said as long as they kept within the sum agreed upon and paid their rent coal candles and what little washing they required out of the eight shillings a week they were doing very well  they had by this time got accustomed to the din of the machinery and were able to work in comfort mr penrose had several times come through the room and had given them a nod after they had been there a month he spoke to grimstone  how do those boys do their work  wonderful well sir they are the two best boys we have ever had no skylarking about and i never have to wait a minute for a plank they generally comes in a few minutes before time and gets the bench cleared up they are firstrate boys they lodge with me and two quieter and betterbehaved chaps in a house there never was  i am glad to hear it mr penrose said i am interested in them and am pleased to hear so good an account  that saturday to their surprise when they went to get their money they received ten shillings apiece  thats two shillings too much george said as the money was handed to them  thats all right the foreman said the governor ordered you both to have a rise  my eye bill said as they went out what do you think of that george four bob a week more to put by regularly how much more will that make by the time your mother comes  we wont put it all by bill i think the other will be enough this four shillings a week we will put aside at present for clothes we want two more shirts apiece and some more stockings and we shall want some shoes before long and another suit of clothes each we must keep ourselves decent you know  from the time when they began work the boys had gone regularly every sunday morning to a small iron church near their lodging and they also went to an evening service once a week their talk too at home was often on religion for bill was extremely anxious to learn and although his questions and remarks often puzzled george to answer he was always ready to explain things as far as he could  february came and to georges delight he heard from his mother that she was so much better that the doctor thought that when she came out at the end of april she would be as strong as she had ever been her eyes had benefited greatly by her long rest and she said that she was sure she should be able to do work as before she had written several times since they had been at limehouse expressing her great pleasure at hearing that george was so well and comfortable at christmas the works being closed for four days george had gone down to see her and they had a delightful talk together christmas had indeed been a memorable occasion to the boys for on christmas eve the carrier had left a basket at grimstones directed george andrews the boys had prepared their christmas dinner consisting of some fine rashers of bacon and sixpennyworth of cold plum pudding from a cookshop and had already rather lamented this outlay for mrs grimstone had that afternoon invited them to dine downstairs george was reading from a book which he bought for a penny that morning when there was a knock at the door and mrs grimstone said  here is a hamper for you george  a hamper for me george exclaimed in astonishment opening the door why whoever could have sent a hamper for me it must be a mistake  thats your name on the direction anyhows mrs grimstone said  yes thats my name sure enough george agreed and at once began to unknot the string which fastened down the lid  here is a christmas card at the top he shouted he turned it over on the back were the words  with all good wishes helen penrose  well that is kind george said in rather a husky voice and indeed it was the kindness that prompted the gift rather than the gift itself that touched him  now then george bill remonstrated never mind that there card lets see whats inside  the hamper was unpacked and was found to contain a cold goose a christmas pudding and some oranges and apples these were all placed on the table and when mrs grimstone had retired bill executed a wardance in triumph and delight  i never did see such a game he said at last as he sat down exhausted theres a christmas dinner for yer why its like them stories of the genii you was atelling me aboutchaps as come whenever yer rubbed a ring or an old lamp and brought a tuckout or whatever yer asked for of course that wasnt true yer told me it wasnt and i shouldnt have believed it if yer hadnt but this ere is true now i sees george as what yer said was right and what i said was wrong i thought yer were a flat cause yer wouldnt take nothing for getting back that there locket and now yer see whats come of it two good berths for us and a christmas dinner fit for a king now what are we going to do with it cause yer know we dines with them downstairs tomorrow  the best thing we can do i think george answered will be to invite all of them downstairs bob grimstone his wife and the three young uns to supper not tomorrow night nor the night after because i shant be back from croydon till late but say the evening after  but we cant hold them all bill said looking round the room  no we cant hold them here certainly but i dare say they will let us have the feed in their parlor there will be nothing to get you know but some bread and butter and some beer for bob mrs grimstone dont take it so we must have plenty of tea  i should like some beer too just for once george with such a blowout as that  no no bill you and i will stick to tea you know we agreed that we wouldnt take beer if we begin it once we shall want it again so we are not going to alter from what we agreed to we see plenty of the misery which drink causes all round and the way in which money is wasted over it i like a glass of beer as well as you do and when i get to be a man i dare say i shall take a glass with my dinner regularly though i wont do even that if i find it makes me want to take more but anyhow at present we can do without it  bill agreed and the dinnerparty downstairs and the supper two nights afterwards came off in due course and were both most successful  the acknowledgment of the gift had been a matter of some trouble to george but he had finally bought a pretty new years card and had written on the back with the grateful thanks of george andrews and had sent it to the daughter of his employer  at the beginning of april george had consulted grimstone and his wife as to the question of preparing a home for his mother  how much would two rooms cost he had asked one a goodsized one and the other the same size as ours  four shillings or four and sixpence mrs grimstone replied  and supposing we had a parlor and two little bedrooms  five and sixpence or six shillings i should say mrs grimstone replied  and how much for a whole house  it depends upon the size we pay seven shillings a week but you might get one without the kitchen and bedroom over it behind for six shillings  that would be much the nicest george said only it would cost such a lot to furnish it  but you neednt furnish it all at once mrs grimstone suggested just a kitchen and two bedrooms for a start and you can put things into the parlor afterwards thats the way we did when we first married but you must have some furniture  and how much will it cost for the kitchen and two bedrooms  of course going cheaply to work and buying the things secondhand i should say i could pick up the things for you so that you could do very well mrs grimstone said for six or seven pounds  that will do capitally george said for by the end of this month bill and i will have more than ten pounds laid by  what since you came here grimstone exclaimed in astonishment do you mean to say you boys have laid by five pounds apiece  yes and bought a lot of things too his wife put in  why you must have been starving yourselves  we dont look like it george laughed i am sure bill is a stone heavier than when he came here  well young chap it does you a lot of credit bob grimstone said it isnt every boy by a long way would stint himself as you must have done for the last five months to make a comfortable home for his mother for i know lots of men who are earning their two quid a week and has their old people in the workhouse well all i can say is that if i or the missis here can be of any use to you in taking a house we shall be right down glad  thank you george said we will look about for a house and when we have fixed on one if you or mrs grimstone will go about it for us i shall be much obliged for i dont think landlords would be inclined to let a house to two boys  all right george we will do that for you with pleasure besides you know there are things when you are going to take a house that you stand out for such as papering and painting or putting in a new range and things of that sort  after their dinner on the following sunday the two boys set out househunting  if its within a mile that will do george said it doesnt matter about our going home in the breakfast time we can bring our grub in a basket and our tea in a bottle as several of the hands do but if its over a mile we shall have to hurry to get there and back for dinner still there are plenty of houses in a mile  there were indeed plenty of houses in long regular rows bare and hardlooking but george wanted to find something more pleasant and homelike than these late in the afternoon he came upon what he wanted it was just about a mile from the works and beyond the lines of regular streets here he found a turning off the main road with but eight houses in it four on each side it looked as if the man who built them had intended to run a street down for some distance but had either been unable to obtain enough ground or had changed his mind  they stood in pairs each with its garden in front with a bowwindow and little portico they appeared to be inhabited by a different class to those who lived in the rows chiefly by city clerks for the gardens were nicely kept the blinds were clean and spotless muslin curtains hung in the windows and fancy tables with pretty ornaments stood between them fortunately one of them the last on the lefthand side was to let  what do you think of this bill  it seems to be just the thing but how about the rent george i should think they were awful dear  i dont suppose they are any more than the houses in the rows bill they are very small you see and i dont suppose they would suit workmen as well as the others at any rate we will see  whereupon george noted down on a scrap of paper the name of the agent of whom inquiry was to be made  no 8 he said but whats the name of the street oh there it is laburnum villas no 8 laburnum villas that sounds firstrate doesnt it i will get mrs grimstone to go round to the agent tomorrow  this mrs grimstone agreed to do directly she was asked after speaking to her husband she said i will get the key from the agents and will be there just after twelve tomorrow so if you go there straight when you get out you will be able to see the rooms and what state its in  but how about bobs dinner george asked  oh he will have it cold tomorrow and i will set it out for him before i start  that is very kind mrs grimstone thank you very much it would be just the thing  accordingly at ten minutes past twelve on the following day the two boys arrived breathless at no 8 laburnum villas  hurrah george shouted there is mrs grimstone at the window  the door was opened and they rushed in  its a tidy little place mrs grimstone said and its in good order and wont want any money laying out upon it  the house was certainly small but the boys were delighted with it on the groundfloor were two little rooms opening with folding doors and a little kitchen built out behind there was a room over this and two rooms above the sitting rooms  thats just the right number george said a bedroom each for us it couldnt be nicer and what pretty paper  and there is a good long slip of garden behind mrs grimstone said where you could grow lots of vegetables of course in the front you would have flowers  and how much do they want for it  seven and sixpence a week including rates and taxes i call it dear for its size but then of course its got the garden and it looks pretty and nice the agent says its been painted and papered from top to bottom since the last people left but he says the owner wont let it unless somebody comes who is likely to stop and he will want references of respectability  all right george said i can manage that for he had already been thinking of the question in his mind and we can manage seven and sixpence a week cant we bill  we will try anyhow bill said stoutly for he was as much pleased with the cottage as george was  they explored the garden behind the house this was about a hundred feet long by twentyfive wide half of it was covered with stumps of a plantation of cabbages the other half was empty and had evidently been dug up by the last tenants ready for planting  why i should think we shall be able to grow all our own potatoes here george exclaimed in delight  mrs grimstone was a country woman and she shook her head  you wouldnt be able to do that george not if you gave it all up to potatoes but if you planted the further end with potatoes you might get a good many and then you know at this end you might have three or four rows of peas and french beans and lettuces and such like but you will have to get some manure to put in things wont grow without manure even in the country and i am sure they wont here and then you know you can have flowers in the front of the house but its time for you to be off else you will be late at the works i am sure its more than half an hour since you came in i will take the key back and tell them they shall have an answer by wednesday or thursday  george did not think they could have been a quarter of an hour however he and bill started at a trot which they increased into a run at the top of their speed when the first clock they saw pointed to seven minutes to one the bell was ringing as they approached the works it stopped when they were within fifty yards and the gate was just closing as they rushed up  too late the man said  oh do let us through george panted out its the first time we have ever been late and we have run a mile to be here in time  oh its you is it the man said opening the gate a few inches to look through ah well i will let you in this time cause you are wellbehaved young chaps but dont you run it so close another time else you will have to lose your hour     chapter iv  home   that evening george wrote a letter to dr jeffries at croydon saying that he had taken a little house for his mother to come to when she came out of the infirmary and as he had kindly said that he would render her help if he could would he be good enough to write to the agent whose address he gave saying that mrs andrews who was about taking no 8 laburnum villas was a person of respectability  the following evening he received a letter from the doctor saying that he had written to the agent and that he was glad indeed to hear that george was getting on so well that he was able to provide a home for his mother  on wednesday at dinnertime mrs grimstone handed george a key  there you are george you are master of the house now the agent said the reference was most satisfactory so i paid him the seven and sixpence you gave me for a weeks rent in advance and you can go in when you like we shall be sorry to lose you both for i dont want two better lodgers you dont give no trouble and all has been quiet and pleasant in the house and to think what a taking i was in that day as bob brought you here for the first time to think as he had let the room to two boys but there one never knows and i wouldnt have believed it as boys could be so quiet in a house  now we must begin to see about furniture bob grimstone said the best plan i think will be for you two to go round of an evening to all the shops in the neighborhood and mark off just what you think will suit you you put down the prices stuck on them and just what they are and then the missis can go in the morning and bargain for them she will get them five shillings in the pound cheaper than you would its wonderful how women do beat men down to be sure when a man hears whats the price of a thing he leaves it or takes it just as he likes but a woman begins by offering half the sum then the chap says no and she makes as if she was going away he lets her go a little way and then he hollers after her and comes down a goodish bit in the price then she says she dont particularly want it and shouldnt think of giving any such price as that then he tries again and so they gets on till they hit on a figure as suits them both you see that little teacaddy in the corner my wife was just three weeks buying that caddy the chap wanted seven and six for it and she offered him half a crown he came down half a crown at the end of the first week and at last she got it for three and nine now the first thing you have got to do is to make out a list first of all you have got to put down the things as you must have and then the things you can do without though you will get them if you can afford it mother will help you at that  so mrs grimstone and george sat down with paper and a pencil and george was absolutely horrified at the list of things which mrs grimstone declared were absolutely indispensable however after much discussion some few items were marked as doubtful when the list was finished the two boys started on an exploring expedition and the next week all their evenings were fully occupied in ten days after they began the three bedrooms and the kitchen were really smartly furnished mrs grimstone proving a wonderful hand at bargaining and making the ten pounds go farther than george had believed possible on the sunday bob went with his wife and the boys to inspect the house  its a very comfortable little place he said and that front bedroom with the chintz curtains the missis made up is as nice a little room as you want to see as to the others they will do well enough for you boys  the only articles of furniture in the sitting room were two long muslin curtains which mrs grimstone had bought a bargain at a shop selling off for it was agreed that this was necessary to give the house a furnished appearance bob grimstone was so much pleased at what had been done that he shared georges feeling of regret that one of the sitting rooms could not also be furnished and on the walk home said  look here george i know you would like to have the house nice for your mother you couldnt make one of those sitting rooms comfortable not under a fivepound note not even with the missis to market for you but you might for that i have got a little money laid by in the savingsbank and i will lend you five pounds and welcome if you like to take it i know it will be just as safe with you as it will be there  thank you very much bobthank you very much but i wont take it in the first place i should like mother to know that the furniture is all ours bought out of bills savings and mine and in the next place i should find it hard at first to pay back anything i think we can just manage on our money but that will be all i told you mother does work but she maynt be able to get any at first so we cant reckon on that when she does you know we shall be able gradually to buy the furniture  well perhaps you are right george the man said after a pause you would have been welcome to the money but perhaps you are right not to take it i borrowed a little money when i first went into housekeeping and it took a wonderful trouble to pay off and if theres illness or anything of that sort it weighs on you not that i should be in any hurry about it it wouldnt worry me but it would worry you  a week later mrs andrews was to leave the infirmary and on saturday george asked for a day off to go down to fetch her every evening through the week he and bill had worked away at digging up the garden fortunately there was a moon for it was dark by the time they came out from the works bill was charged with the commission to lay in the store of provisions for the sunday and he was to be sure to have a capital fire and tea ready by four oclock the hour at which george calculated he would be back  very delighted was george as in his best suitfor he and bill had two suits each nowhe stepped out of the train at croydon and walked to the workhouse his mother had told him that she would meet him at the gate at halfpast two and punctually at the time he was there a few minutes later mrs andrews came out not dressed as he had seen her at christmas in the infirmary garb but in her own clothes george gave a cry of delight as he ran forward to meet her  my darling mother and you are looking quite yourself again  i am thank god george it has seemed a long nine months but the rest and quiet have done wonders for me everyone has been very kind and of course the knowledge dear boy that you had got work that you liked helped me to get strong again and you are looking well too and your friend i hope he is well  quite well mother but in a great fright about you he is glad you are coming because i am glad but the poor fellow has quite made up his mind that you wont like him and you wont think him a fit companion for me i told him over and over again that you are not that sort but nothing can persuade him of course mother he doesnt talk good grammar and he uses some queer expressions but he is very much changed in that way since i first knew him and he tries very hard and dont mind a bit how often i correct him and he is beginning to read easy words quite well and he is one of the besthearted fellows in the world  if he is kind to you george and fond of you thats enough for me mrs andrews said but i have no doubt i shall soon like him for himself you could not like him as much as you do if there were not something nice about him and you have succeeded in getting a room for me in the house in which you lodge for george had never mentioned a word in his letter about taking a house and had asked dr jeffries if he should see his mother to say nothing to her about his application to him  yes thats all right mother he replied briskly  and you have got some new clothes since i saw you last george you wanted them yours were getting rather shabby when i saw you at christmas  yes mother they were  i suppose you had to part with your best suit while you were so long out of work  that was it mother but you see i have been able to get some more things they are only cheap ones you know but they will do very well until i can afford better ones i am not walking too fast for you am i but we shall just catch the train or look here would you mind going straight by yourself to the railway station then you can walk slowly i will go round and get your box i went into our old place as i came along and mrs larkins said she would bring it downstairs for me as i came back  no i would rather go round with you george i want to thank her for having kept it for me so long even if we do miss the train it will not matter much as it will make no difference whether we get in town an hour earlier or later  as george could not explain his special reason for desiring to catch that train he was obliged to agree and they stopped a quarter of an hour at their old lodging as mrs larkins insisted upon their having a cup of tea which she had prepared for them however when they reached the station they found that a train was going shortly and when they reached town they were not so very much later than george had calculated upon  they took a cab for although mrs andrews box was not heavy it was too much for george to carry that distance besides mrs andrews herself was tired from her walk to the station from the infirmary having had no exercise for so long when they got into the neighborhood of limehouse george got outside to direct the cabman it was just a quarter past four when the cab drew up at no 8 laburnum villas  why is this the house mrs andrews asked in surprise as george jumped down and opened the door why you told me in one of your letters it was a house in a row what a pretty little place it is really here george  it is here mother we moved the other day there is bill at the door but bill having opened the door ran away out into the garden and george having paid the cabman carried his mothers box in and entered the house with her  straight on mother into the little room at the end  what a snug little kitchen mrs andrews said as she entered it and tea all laid and ready what have they lent you the room for this evening  my dear mother george said throwing his arms round her neck this is your kitchen and your house all there is of it only the sitting room isnt furnished yet we must wait for that you know  what you have taken a whole house my boy that is very nice but can we afford it george it seems too good to be true  it is quite true mother and i think its a dear little house and will be splendid when we have got it all furnished now come up and see the bedrooms this is bills you know and he opened the door on the staircase and this is mine and this is yours  oh what a pretty little room mrs andrews said but my dear george the rent of this house and the hire of the furniture will surely be more than we can afford to pay i know what a good manager you are my boy but i have such a horror of getting into debt that it almost frightens me  the rent of the house is seven and sixpence a week mother with rates and taxes and we can afford that out of bills earnings and mine even if you did not do any work at all and as to the furniture it is every bit paid for out of our savings since we went to work  on hearing which mrs andrews threw her arms round georges neck and burst into tears of happiness she was not very strong and the thought of the sacrifices these two boys must have made to get a house together for her completely overpowered her  it seems impossible george she said when she had recovered herself why you have only been earning ten shillings a week each and you have had to keep yourselves and get clothes and all sorts of things it seems impossible  it has not cost so much as you think mother and bill and i had both learned to live cheap in covent garden but now let us go downstairs you have not seen bill yet and i know tea will be ready  but bill had not yet come in and george had to go out into the garden to fetch him  come on bill mother is delighted with everything she wont eat you you know  no she wont eat me george but she will think me an outandout sort of ottentot which word had turned up in a book the boys had been reading on an evening previously  well wait till she says so come along  so linking his arm in bills george drew him along and brought him shamefaced and bashful into the kitchen  this is bill mother  i am glad to see you bill mrs andrews said holding out her hand i have heard so much of you from george that i seem to know you quite well  bill put his hand out shyly  i am sure we shall get on well together mrs andrews went on i shall never forget that you were a friend to my boy when he was friendless in london  its all the tother way maam bill said eagerly dont you go for to think it why just look what george has done for me there was i ahanging about the garden pretty nigh starving and sure to get quadded sooner or later and now here i am living decent and earning a good wage and he has taught me to read maam and to know about things and aint been ashamed of me though i am so different to what he is i tell you maam there aint no saying what a friend hes been to me and i aint done nothing for him as i can see  well bill you perhaps both owe each other something mrs andrews said and i owe you something as well as my son for george tells me that it is to your selfdenial as well as to his own that i owe this delightful surprise of finding a home ready for me and now she went on seeing how confused and unhappy bill looked i think you two ought to make tea this evening for you are the hosts and i am the guest in future it will be my turn  all right mother you sit down in this armchair bill you do the rashers and i will pour the water into the pot and then toast the muffins  bill was at home now such culinary efforts as they had hitherto attempted had generally fallen to his share as he had a greater aptitude for the work than george had and a dish of bacon fried to a turn was soon upon the table  mrs andrews had been watching bill closely and was pleased with the result of her observation bill was indeed greatly improved in appearance since he had first made georges acquaintance his cheeks had filled out and his face had lost its hardness of outline the quick restless hunted expression of his eyes had nearly died out and he no longer looked as if constantly on the watch to dodge an expected cuff his face had always had a large share of that merriment and love of fun which seem the common portion of the london arabs and seldom desert them under all their hardships but it was a happier and brighter spirit now and had altogether lost its reckless character a similar change is always observable among the waifs picked up off the streets by the london refuges after they have been a few months on board a training ship  when all was ready the party sat down to their meal mrs andrews undertook the pouring out of the tea saying that although she was a guest as the only lady present she should naturally preside george cut the bread and bill served the bacon the muffins were piled on a plate in the front of the fire as a second course  it was perhaps the happiest meal that any of the three had ever sat down to mrs andrews was not only happy at finding so comfortable a home prepared for her but was filled with a deep feeling of pride and thankfulness at the evidence of the love steadiness and selfsacrifice of her son george was delighted at having his mother with him again and at seeing her happiness and contentment at the home he had prepared for her bill was delighted because george was so and he was moreover vastly relieved at finding mrs andrews less terrible than he had depicted her  after tea was cleared away they talked together for a while and then billfeeling with instinctive delicacy that george and his mother would like to talk together for a timesaid he should take a turn for an hour and on getting outside the house executed so wild a wardance of satisfaction that it was fortunate it was dark or laburnum villas would have been astonished and scandalized at the spectacle  i like your friend bill very much mrs andrews said when she was alone with george i was sure from what you told me that he must be a goodhearted lad but brought up as he has been poor boy i feared a little that he would scarcely be a desirable companion in point of manners of course as you say his grammar is a little peculiar but his manners are wonderfully quiet and nice considering all  look what an example hes had mother george laughed but really he has taken great pains ever since he knew that you were coming home he has been asking me to tell him of anything he does which is not right especially about eating and that sort of thing you see he had never used a fork till we came down here and he made me show him directly how it should be held and what to do with it it has been quite funny to me to see him watching me at meals and doing exactly the same  and you have taught him to read george  yes mother  and something of better things george she asked  yes mother as much as i could he didnt know anything when i met him but he goes to church with me now regularly and says his prayers every night and i can tell you he thinks a lot of it more i think than i ever did he added honestly  perhaps he has done you as much good as you have done him george  perhaps he has mother yes i think so when you see a chap so very earnest for a thing you cant help being earnest yourself besides you know mother he went on a little shyly for george had not been accustomed to talk much of these matters with his motheryou see when ones down in the world and hard up and not quite sure about the next meal and without any friend one seems to think more of these things than one does when one is jolly at school with other fellows  perhaps so george though i do not know why it should be so for the more blessings one has the more reason for love and gratitude to the giver however dear i think we have both reason to be grateful now have we not  that we have mother only think of the difference since we said goodby to each other last summer now here you are strong and well again and we are together and dont mean to be separated and i have got a place i like and have a good chance of getting on in and we have got a pretty little house all to ourselves and you will be able to live a little like a lady againi mean as you were accustomed toand everything is so nice oh mother i am sure we have every reason to be grateful  we have indeed george and i even more than you in the proofs you have given me that my son is likely to turn out all that even i could wish him  bills hour was a very long one  you must not go out of an evening bill to get out of our way mrs andrews said when he returned else i shall think that i am in your way it was kind of you to think of it the first evening and george and i are glad to have had a long talk together but in future i hope you wont do it you see there will be lots to do of an evening there will be your lessons and georges for i hope now that hes settled he will give up an hour or two every evening to study not latin and greek george she added smiling seeing a look of something like dismay in georges face that will be only a waste of time to you now but a study of such things as may be useful to you in your present work and in your future life and a steady course of reading really good books by good authors then perhaps when you have both done your work you will take it by turns to read out loud while i do my sewing then perhaps some day who knows if we get on very flourishingly after we have furnished our sitting room we may be able to indulge in the luxury of a piano again and have a little music of an evening  that will be jolly mother why it will be really like old times when you used to sing to me  mrs andrews eyes filled with tears at the thought of the old times but she kept them back bravely so as not to mar even for a moment the happiness of this first evening so they chatted till nine oclock when they had supper after it was over mrs andrews left the room for a minute and went upstairs and opened her box and returned with a bible in her hand  i think boys she said we ought to end this first happy evening in our new home by thanking god together for his blessings  i am sure we ought mother george said and bills face expressed his approval  so mrs andrews read a chapter and then they knelt and thanked god for his blessings and the custom thus begun was continued henceforth in no 8 laburnum villas  hitherto george and his companion had found things much more pleasant at the works than they had expected they had of course had principally to do with bob grimstone still there were many other men in the shop and at times when his bench was standing idle while some slight alterations or adjustment of machinery were made they were set to work with others men are quick to see when boys are doing their best and finding the lads intent upon their work and given neither to idleness nor skylarking they seldom had a sharp word addressed to them but after mrs andrews had come home they found themselves addressed in a warmer and more kindly manner by the men bob grimstone had told two or three of his mates of the sacrifices the boys had made to save up money to make a home for the mother of one of them when she came out of hospital they were not less impressed than he had been and the story went the round of the workshops and even came to the ears of the foreman and there was not a man there but expressed himself in warm terms of surprise and admiration that two lads should for six months have stinted themselves of food in order to lay by half their pay for such a purpose  theres precious few would have done such a thing one of the older workmen said not one in a thousand why not one chap in a hundred even when hes going to be married will stint himself like that to make a home for the gal he is going to make his wife so as to start housekeeping out of debt and as to doing it for a mother where will you find em in course a man ought to do as much for his mother as for the gal who is agoing to be his wife seeing how much he owes her but how many does it thats what i says how many does it  so after that the boys were surprised to find how many of the men when they met them at the gate would give them a kindly nod or a hearty goodmorning young chaps  a day or two after mrs andrews had settled in laburnum villas she went up to town and called upon a number of shops asking for work as she was able to give an excellent reference to the firm for whom she had worked at croydon she succeeded before the end of the week in obtaining millinery work for a firm in st pauls churchyard and as she had excellent taste and was very quick at her needle she was soon able to earn considerably more than she had done at croydon  the three were equally determined that they would live as closely as possible until the sittingrooms were furnished and by strict management they kept within the boys pay mrs andrews earnings being devoted to the grand purpose the small articles were bought first and each week there was great congratulation and pleasure as some new article was placed in the rooms then there was a pause for some time then came the chairs then after an interval a table and lastly the carpet this crowning glory was not attained until the end of july after this they moved solemnly into the sittingroom agreeing that the lookingglass chiffonier and sofa could be added at a more gradual rate and that the whole of mrs andrews earnings need no longer be devoted  now boys mrs andrews said on that memorable evening i want you in future when you come in to change your working clothes before you come in here to your teas so long as we lived in the kitchen i have let things go on but i think theres something in the old saying company clothes company manners and i think it is good when boys come in that they should lay aside their heavynailed shoes and their working clothes certainly such boots and clothes are apt to render people clumsy in their movements and the difference of walk which you observe between men of different classes arises very greatly from the clumsy heavy boots which workingmen must wear  but what does it matter mother george urged for it seemed to him that it would be rather a trouble to change his clothes every day these little things dont make any real difference to a man  not any vital difference george but a real difference for all that manners make the man you know that is they influence strangers and people who only know him in connection with business if two men apply together for a place the chances are strongly in favor of the man with the best manners getting it besides my boy i think the observance of little courtesies of this kind make home pleasanter and brighter you see i always change my dress before tea and i am sure you prefer my sitting down to the table tidy and neat with a fresh collar and cuffs to my taking my place in my working dress with odds and ends of threads and litter clinging to it  of course i do mother and i see what you mean now certainly i will change my things in future you dont mind do you bill  bill would not have minded in the least any amount of trouble by which he could give the slightest satisfaction to mrs andrews who had now a place in his affections closely approximating to that which george occupied  during the summer months the programme for the evening was not carried out as arranged for at the end of april mrs andrews herself declared that there must be a change  the evenings are getting light enough now for a walk after tea boys and you must therefore cut short our reading and studies till the days close in again in the autumn it would do you good to get out in the air a bit  but will you come with us mother  no george sometimes as evenings get longer we may make little excursions together go across the river to greenwich and spend two or three hours in the park or take a steamer and go up the river to kew but as a general thing you had better take your rambles together i have my front garden to look after the vegetables are your work you know and if i like i can go out and do whatever shopping i have to do while you two are away  so the boys took to going out walks which got longer and longer as the evenings drew out and when they were not disposed for a long ramble they would go down to a disused wharf and sit there and watch the barges drifting down the river or tacking backwards and forwards if there was a wind with their great brown and yellow sails hauled tautly in and the great steamers dropping quietly down the river and the little busy tugs dragging great ships after them there was an endless source of amusement in wondering from what ports the various craft had come or what was their destination  what seems most wonderful to me george bill said one day when one looks at them big steamers  those george corrected  thank yeat those big steamers is to think that they can be tossed about and the sea go over them as one reads about just the same way as the wave they make when they goes down  go down bill  thank yego down the river tosses the little boats about it dont seem possible that water can toss itself about so high as that does it  it does seem extraordinary bill we know that it is so because there are constantly wrecks but looking at the water it does not seem possible that it should rise up into waves large enough to knock one of those great steamers in pieces some day bill not this year of course because the house isnt finished but next year i hope we shall be able all of us to go down for a trip to the sea i have seen it stuck up you can go to margate and back for three or four shillings and though bob grimstone says that isnt regular sea it would be enough to show us something of what its like  the garden occupied a good deal of the boys time bills long experience in the market had given him an interest in vegetables and he was always ready for an hours work in the garden after tea the results of much labor and plenty of manure were not unsatisfactory and mrs andrews was delighted with her regular supply of fresh vegetables bills anticipation however of the amount that could be grown in a limited space were by no means fulfilled and seeing the small amount which could be daily gathered and recalling the countless piledup wagons which he had been accustomed to see in covent garden he was continually expressing his astonishment at the enormous quantity of ground which must be employed in keeping up the supply of the market  they did not that year get the trip to margate but in the autumn after the great work of furnishing was finished they did get several long jaunts once out to epping forest on an omnibus once in a steamer up to kew and several times across to greenwich park mrs andrews found it a very happy summer free from the wear of anxiety which more even than the work had brought on her long illness she grew stronger and better than she had ever expected to be again and those who had only known the pale harassedlooking needlewoman of croydon would not have recognized her now indeed as george said sometimes his mother looked younger and younger every day she had married very young and was still scarcely fiveandthirty and although she laughed and said that george was a foolish boy when he said that people always took her for his sister she really looked some years younger than she was her step had regained its elasticity and there was a ring of gladness and happiness in her voice which was very attractive and even strangers sometimes looked round as they passed the bright pleasantlooking woman chatting gayly with the two healthy goodlooking young fellows     chapter v  an adventure   in august the annual outing or as it was called the beanfeast at the works took place usually the men went in vans down into epping forest but this year it was determined that a steamer should be engaged to take the whole party with their wives and families down to gravesend they were to make an early start and on arriving there all were to do as they pleased until they assembled to dine in a pavilion at one of the hotels after this they were to go to the gardens and amuse themselves there until the steamer started in the evening the party embarked at blackwell at ten oclock in the morning george and bill got together up in the bow of the steamer and were delighted with their voyage down their only regret being that mrs andrews had declined to accompany them saying that she would far rather go with them alone than with so large a party  what shall we do bill george said when they landed we are not to dine till two so we have two good hours before us i vote we hire a boat and go out it will be ten times as jolly here as up in that crowded river by london  this was said in reference to various short rows which they had had in boats belonging to barges which had been sometimes lent them for half an hour of an evening by a goodnatured bargeman as they hung about the wharves  i suppose you can row young chaps the waterman whom they hired the boat of said  oh yes we can row george replied with the confidence of youth  mind the tide is running out strong the waterman said  all right we will mind george answered scarce heeding his words and getting out the oars they pushed off  for some little time they rowed among the anchored vessels both being especially filled with delight at the yachts moored opposite the clubhouses these were new craft to them and the beauty and neatness of everything struck them with surprise and admiration tide had only turned a short time before they got into their boat and while keeping near the shore they had no difficulty in rowing against it  presently they determined to have a look at a fine eastindiaman moored well out in the stream a short distance below gravesend they ceased rowing when they approached her and sat idly on their oars talking over the distant voyage on which she was probably about to start and the country she might visit george was telling his companion the ports she would touch if her destination was china and absorbed in their conversation they paid no attention to anything else until george gave a sudden exclamation  good gracious bill why the ship is ever so far behind it is two miles i should think from the town we must set to work or we shant be back in time for dinner  the boys knowledge of the navigation of the thames was not sufficient to tell them that to row against tide it is necessary to keep close inshore and turning the boats head they set to work to row back in the middle of the river their knowledge of rowing was but slight and the mere operation of their oars took up all their attention they rowed away till their hands burned and the perspiration ran down their faces  after half an hour of this george looked round thinking that he ought to be near to the vessel by this time he uttered an exclamation of surprise and dismay neither the ship nor gravesend were visible their puny efforts had availed nothing against the sweeping tide they had already without knowing it swept round the turn in the river and were now entering sea reach  my goodness bill what are we to do just look at that buoy we are going past it as fast as a horse could trot look what a width the river is what on earth are we to do  i have no idea bill replied where shall we go to if we go on like this  right out to sea i should think george said i do not know how far it is but the river seems to get wider and wider in front  perhaps bill suggested the tide will turn again and take us back  not it george said it was against us you know all the way down and could only have turned a little while before we got in the boat look at that line of barges sailing down on the righthand side i vote we pull to them and ask the men what we had better do anyhow we could row to the land and get out there and wait till tide turns it turned at about eleven so that it will turn again somewhere about five the steamer is not to start till eight so we shall be back in plenty of time to catch it we shall lose the dinner and the fun in the gardens but that cant be helped  that dont make no odds bill said cheerfully this is a regular venture this is but i say shant we have to pay a lot for the boat  yes george assented mournfully but perhaps the man will let us off cheap when he sees we couldnt help it he looked a goodtempered sort of chap come let us set to work every minute it is taking us further away  they set steadily to work the boat was a large and heavy one and their progress was by no means rapid  how thick its getting george exclaimed suddenly  aint it just bill assented my eye george i cant see the barges  unobserved by them a fog had been steadily creeping up the river they were just at its edge when they made the discovery another two minutes and it rolled thickly over them and they could not see ten yards away they looked at each other in silent bewilderment  whats to be done george bill said at length in awestruck tones  i dont know bill i havent an idea its no use rowing that i see for we dont know which way the boats head is pointing  well it cant be helped bill said philosophically i am going to have a pipe oh i say aint my hands blistered  all right you can have your pipe bill but keep your oar in your hand to be ready to row  what for bill demanded i thought you said it warnt no use rowing  no more it is bill but we must look out for those big buoys if the tide were to sweep us against one of them we should capsize to a certainty that must have been a big steamer he went on as the boat rolled suddenly its lucky we were pretty well over towards the side of the river before the fog came on listentheres another i can hear the beat of her engines i have an idea bill he exclaimed suddenly we know the steamers were passing to the left of us when the fog came on if we listen to their whistles and the sound of their paddles and then row to the right we shall get to the bank at last  yes thats a good idea bill agreed laying down the pipe he had just lighted theres a whistle over there  yes and another the other way george said puzzled why how can that be oh i suppose one is coming up the river and one down but its awfully confusing  it was so but by dint of listening intently the boys gained some idea of the proper direction but they could only row a few strokes at a time being obliged to stop continually to listen for fresh guidance  fortunately for them the fog lay low on the water and the upper spars of the steamers were above it and men placed there were able to direct those on deck as to their course had it not been for this the steamers must all have anchored as it was they proceeded slowly and cautiously on their way whistling freely to warn any small craft that might be hidden in the fog of their coming  half an hours rowing and the boys gave a simultaneous exclamation the boat had quietly grounded on the edge of a mud flat they could not see the bank and had no idea how far distant it was bill at once offered to get overboard and reconnoiter but george would not hear of it  you might not be able to find your way back bill or you might sink in the mud and not be able to get out again no we wont separate and look here we must keep the boat afloat just at the edge of the mud if we were to get left here we should not float again till tide comes up to us and that wouldnt be till about two hours before high tide and it wont be high you know until twelve oclock at night  i wish this fog would clear off bill said looking round at the wall of white vapor which surrounded them it regular confuses a chap i say i expect they are just sitting down to dinner at present i feel awfully hungry  its no use thinking about that bill we shall be a good deal more hungry before we are done but i am so glad we have found the land and stopped going out to sea that i dont mind being hungry  but i say george if this fog keeps on how are we to find our way back to gravesend  the only way will be bill to keep quite close to the edge of the mudjust as close as the boat will swim that way you know we must come to gravesend at last  so we must i didnt think of that you have got a good head george you have i should never have thought about the way to find the bank if it hadnt been for you and might have gone on floating and floating till we was starved  this fog cant last forever bill  no but i have known them last a week in london  yes but not in august bill  no not in august bill assented but you see these here fogs may last just as long down here in august as they do in london in november  i dont think so bill anyhow it doesnt matter to us we have got the land for a guide and i hope we shall be back in gravesend before its quite dark  but if we dont george  well if we dont we must run her ashore before it gets too dark and wait till it is morning we shall be all right if we keep quite cool and use our senses if we had something to eat i shouldnt mind a bit except that mother will be getting anxious about us its a regular adventure and we shall have something to talk about for a long time look out bill we must push her further offshes getting aground  for an hour they sat and chatted  hullo whats that bill exclaimed at last thats the rattle of a chain i expect its a barge anchoring somewhere near listen i can hear voices i vote we hollo  george lifted up his voice in a lusty shout the shout was repeated not very far off and was followed by the shout of who are you  we have drifted down from gravesend and lost our way george shouted back we will come on board if you will let us  all right the voice replied i will go on shouting and you row to my voice  it was but a hundred yards and then a voice close at hand said sharply  row bow hard or you will be across the chain  bill rowed hard and george looking round saw that they were close to the bows of a barge half a dozen more strokes and they were alongside bill seized a handrope and sprang onto the barge and the boat was soon towing astern  well young men however did you manage to get here one of the bargemen asked its lucky for you you werent taken out to sea with the tide  george related the history of their voyage and how they had managed to reach the shore  well you are goodplucked uns anyhow the man said aint they jack most chaps your age would just have sat in the boat and howled and a good many longshoremen too you have done the best thing you could under the circumstances  where are we george asked  you are on board the sarah and jane topsail barge thats where you are about three parts down sea reach we know our way pretty well even in a fog but we agreed it was no use trying to find the swashway with it as thick as this so we brought up  where is the swashway george asked  the swashway is a channel where the barges go when they are making for sheerness its well buoyed out and easy enough to follow with the help of sheerness lights on a dark night but these fogs are worse than anything it aint no use groping about for the buoy when you cant see ten yards ahead and you might find yourself high and dry on the mud and have to wait till next tide mayhap this fog will clear off before evening and we shall be able to work in and now i expect you two young uns would like some grub come below  the two boys joyfully followed into the little cabin and were soon satisfying their hunger on bread and cold meat the bargee drew a jug of water from the breaker and placed it before them  the fire has gone out he said or i would give yer a cup of teathats our tipple we dont keep spirits on board the sarah and jane i like a drop on shore but it aint stuff to have on a barge where you wants your senses handy at all times and now what are you thinking of doing he asked when the boys had finished  what we had made up our minds to do was to lie where we were at the edge of the mud till tide turned and then to keep as close to the shore as we could until we got back to gravesend the steamer we came by does not go back till late and we thought we should be back by that time  no you wouldnt the man said out in the middle of the stream you would be back in two hours easy but not close inshore the tide dont help you much there and half your time you are in eddies and backcurrents no you wouldnt be back in gravesend by eight noway  then what would you advise us to do  well just at present i wont give no advice at all we will see how things are going after a bit now lets take a look round  so saying he climbed the ladder to the deck followed by the boys the white fog still shut the boat in like a curtain  what do you think of it jack  dont know the other replied thought just now there was a puff of air coming down the river i wish it would or we shant make sheerness tonight much less rochester yes thats a puff sure enough you are in luck young uns like enough in half an hour there will be a brisk wind blowing driving all this fog out to sea before it  another and another puff came and tiny ripples swept across the oillike face of the water  its acoming sure enough the bargeman said id bet a pot of beer as the fog will have lifted in a quarter of an hour  stronger and stronger came the puffs of wind  the fog seemed as if stirred by an invisible hand it was no longer a dull uniform whitishgray dark shadows seemed to flit across it and sometimes the view of the water extended here and there  theres the shore bill exclaimed suddenly but ere george could turn round to look it was gone again  i shall have the anchor up directly lads now i tell you what will be the best thing for you if the wind holds as i expect it will we shall be at sheerness in little over an hourthat will make it four oclock he added consulting his watch and the young flood will be coming up soon afterwards and i shall go up with the first of it to rochester we shall get there maybe somewhere about seven oclock now the best thing i can do for you is to tow that ere boat up to rochester with me and you can get a train there that will take you up to town in goodish time  you are very kind george said but what are we to do about the boat  i shall be going back tomorrow night or more likely next morning and i will take her along and hand her over to her rightful owner at gravesend  james kitson  yes i know him  but how about paying for it george said i am afraid he will expect a great deal of money for it has been away all the time and we have only got six shillings between us  you will want that to get up to town never mind about the boat i will put that square for you i will tell kitson as how you have been shipwrecked and he will think himself precious lucky in getting the boat without being damaged if i take the trouble to tow it up to rochester and back he neednt grumble about getting no fare  i would rather pay something george said though you see we cant afford to pay much  well then you send him a postoffice order for five bob i will tell him you are going to send him that and he will thank his stars he has got so well out of it if you had drifted out to sea as he expects you have by this time and the boat didnt get smashed by a steamer you would likely enough have been taken off by one of them but the captain wouldnt have troubled himself about that old tub i looks upon kitson as being in luck this job so dont you worry about him there the mists driving off fast we will up with the kedge  the boys lent a hand at the windlass and the anchor was soon hanging from the bow then the brail of the mainsail was loosed and the great sail shaken out the foresail was hoisted and in a few minutes the sarah and jane was running before a brisk wind down sea reach  the fog had rolled off now and it was clear astern though a thick bank still hung over the river ahead but this was rapidly melting away and the bargeman who told them his name was will atkins pointed out a large building low down on the water ahead  thats sheerness fort he said you can lend jack a hand to get up the topsail the wind is rising every minute and we shall soon be bowling along hand over hand  both ahead and astern of them were a line of barges which had like the sarah and jane anchored when the fog was thickest and were like her making their way to sheerness the wind was blowing briskly now and the barge made her way through the water at a rate which surprised the boys  i had no idea that barges sailed so fast george said  there are not many craft can beat them atkins replied with a breeze so strong that they can only just carry their topsails they will hold their own with pretty nigh anything afloat there are mighty few yachts can keep alongside us when we are doing our best  as atkins had predicted in little over an hour they brought up just inside the mouth of the medway and dropped the anchor to wait till the tide turned to help them up to rochester at six oclock they were again under way the wind had fortunately veered round somewhat to the north of west and they were able for the most part to lay their course so that soon after seven they were abreast of the dockyard and a few minutes later dropped anchor off rochester  jump into the boat boys the goodnatured bargeman said i will put you ashore at once there is the station close to the end of the bridge  with many very hearty thanks for his kindness the lads jumped ashore and hurried up to the station they found that there would be a train in half an hour and by nine oclock they arrived in town  before they had landed the bargeman had scrawled on a piece of paper your boat was picked up by the sarah and jane will bring her back on return trip no damage done william atkins this he had handed to the boys and they now got an envelope and directed it to james kitson waterman gravesend and posted it and then set out to walk home  its not been the sort of day we expected george said but its been good fun hasnt it  grand bill agreed but i didnt think so when we were in the middle of that fog listening to them whistles and trying to find out the way i didnt say much george but i felt downright funky  i didnt like it either bill there was such a horribly lonely feeling lost in the fog there but it was all right as soon as we touched the mouth and got an idea where we were i was worrying most about mother getting anxious if we did not get back tonight and a little about what we should have to pay for the boat it was lucky that bargeman took the matter in his hands for us i expect we should have had to pay over a pound he was an awfully good fellow wasnt he  i should just think he was bill said he was a good un and no mistake it aint cost us so very much either considering  that it hasnt bill two and threepence apiece railway fare thats four and sixpence and five bob we are to send down for the boat nine shillings and sixpence well we should have paid two shillings for the boat anyhow and i expect we should have spent another shilling apiece in things at the gardens perhaps more that would make four shillings anyhow so we have only spent about five shillings more than we calculated and havent we got a lot to talk about its been a regular adventure  it has bill said doubtfully but i dont think i want many more of them kind of adventures its all right now you know but it wasnt jolly at the time i always thought as adventures was jolly but that didnt seem to me to have no jolliness about it not when we was out there its all very well to hear tell of shipwrecks and fights with savages but i expect there aint no larks about it at the time i suppose you will send that five bob off tomorrow and get it off your mind  no atkins said we had better not send it for another three or four days the man will have got his boat back all right then and the five bob would come upon him unexpectedly he was going to tell kitson that he had arranged with us that was what we were to pay as we couldnt afford more but he will never expect to get it so when it comes he will be only too glad to receive it  they were met at the door of the house by bob grimstone who was just coming out  why what have you boys been up to he said angrily i have been wondering all day what has become of you and the missis has done nothing but worry and fidget its regular spoilt the day what have you been up to i havent seen you since we got ashore at gravesend and i have just come round to ask your mother if she has heard of you  i am very sorry bob but it wasnt our fault at least it was not altogether our fault we went for a row and the tide took us down and then the fog came on and we got lost  i expected better of you grimstone said angrily foggy indeed ive been anxious and worried all day i did think as you warnt like other boys but could be trusted and then you go and play such a prank as this well go in your mother is in a nice taking about you  my dear mother george said as he ran in i am so sorry you have been uneasy about us awfully sorry but really it hasnt been our fault altogether  never mind that now george mrs andrews said throwing her arms round his neck fortunately i did not know anything about it till mr grimstone came in a few minutes ago i had been expecting you in for some little time but i supposed the steamer was late and i was not at all uneasy till mr grimstone came in and said that he had not seen either of you since the steamer got to gravesend and that you had not come back with the rest is bill with you  yes mother he is at the door talking to bob  ask mr grimstone to come in again mrs andrews said he has been most kind and he had promised to go down to gravesend by the first train in the morning if you did not come home tonight and to make inquiries about you there he tried to cheer me up by saying that as you were together nothing could very well happen to you and that probably you had only got into some boyish scrapeperhaps he suggested only gone out into the country and had helped yourselves to some apples and had so got locked up  bob however would not come in again but went off saying he would hear all about it in the morning but would go off to tell his wife at once that they had returned safely for that she was in such a worry as never was  hearing that the boys had had nothing to eat since two oclock mrs andrews at once laid the table for supper and when they had finished it listened to georges account of their adventure  you had a very narrow escape boys she said when they had finished you might have been swept out to sea or run down by a steamer in the fog i hope tonight that you will neither of you forget to thank god for his protection through the danger you have run and i do hope my dear boys that you will be more careful in future  the next evening after work was over george went in to bob grimstones and told them all that had happened when the story was told bob agreed that after all it was not altogether their fault and that indeed they had in some respects justified his opinion of them mrs grimstone however was not so easily pacified they had come back she said but it was more than likely that they wouldnt have come back at all but might have been drifting out far at sea perhaps cutting each others throats and eating each other alive which was as the good woman said what she had heard happened when boats were lost at sea  two days later they sent off the money to the waterman and received in reply a letter from him saying that the boat had been brought safely back by the sarah and jane and that he was glad to get the five shillings  bill atkins told me as you said you would send it but knowing what boys is i say fair as i didnt expect to see the color of your money it aint everyone as would have paid up when they got safe away and i consider as you have behaved handsome  they had heard from atkins of the wharf off which the sarah and jane might generally be found moored between her cruises and after one or two ineffectual attempts they one day found the barge there when they rowed up to the spot she had but just returned from a trip to rochester and bill atkins was still on board he was very glad to see the boys but they had great difficulty in persuading him to accept a pound of tobacco which their mother had sent off to him with her compliments as a token of gratitude for his kindness to them  well young chaps i didnt look for nothing of the sort but seeing as your mother has got it for me it wouldnt be manners to say no well look here any time as you are disposed for a sail down to rochester and back youre free of the sarah and jane and heartily glad shall i be to have you with me  the boys thanked him for the offer but said as they were still at work there was but small chance of their being able to accept it but that they should be glad to come and have a chat with him sometimes when he was in the pool     chapter vi  fire   one saturday evening early in october the boys had been for a long walk down among the marshes they had told mrs andrews they would be late and it was past eight oclock when they came along past the works  we shant get home at this hour again for some time i expect george said for they say that we are going to begin to work overtime on monday and that the orders are so heavy that it will very likely have to be kept up all through the winter  i am glad it didnt begin earlier bill replied it would have been horrid if we had lost all our walks while the weather was fine how dark the place looks how its shut up and how quiet and still it is after the rattle we are accustomed to  stop a moment george said putting his hand on his arm  what is it george  i dont know it seemed to me for a moment as if i saw the big stack clearly and then it was dark again  how could that be george  i dont know it looked to me as if it was a reflection of light from one of the windows at the back there there it is again  yes i saw it bill agreed what can it be  i dont know bill lets run around to the back there might beits awful to think ofbut there might be a fire  the boys ran down a narrow lane by the side of the works onto a piece of waste ground behind  look bill look at the glare in the moldingroom there must be fire here help to put this bit of old timber against the wall  the piece of wood was placed into position the two lads climbed up it onto the wall and dropped into the yard within just as they did so there was a clatter of falling glass followed by a glare of light as a body of flame burst out from one of the windows  lets ring the dinnerbell bill that will call peoples attention and then we must do the best we can  they ran along until they reached the front gate and then seizing the bellrope rang it violently  in a minute or two there was a clatter of feet outside and shouts of whats the matter  there is a fire in the moldingroom george shouted run for the engines someone and break the gate open now come on bill  the two boys ran towards that part of the building where the flames had been seen broke a window and climbed in there was an almost stifling smell of burning wood and at a door at the end of the planingroom they could see a light flame flickering through the cracks of the door leading into the moldingroom which was next to it  quick bill screw that leather pipe onto the hydrant we must stop it from getting through here till the engines come  the hydrant communicated with the great tank at the top of the building and as soon as the hose was screwed on and bill stood with the nozzle directed towards the burning door george turned the cock and volumes of water flew out  the first result seemed disastrous the door was already nearly burned through and as the powerful jet flew against it it seemed to crumble away and a mass of flame darted out from the moldingroom the joists and timbers supporting the floor above the planingroom would have caught at once but the boys deluged them with water as also the framework of the door and then throwing the stream of water into the blazing workshop they kept down the flames near the door the smoke was stifling  we shall be choked george bill gasped  lie down bill i have heard the air is always better near the ground  this they found to be the case and they were still able to direct the jet of water but three or four minutes had elapsed when the outer door of the planinghouse was unlocked and bob grimstone and several other men rushed in but were at once driven back by the smoke george had recognized grimstones voice and shouted  this way bob the fire hasnt got through yet come and lend a hand for its gaining on us in spite of the water you can breathe if you kneel down  grimstone with two or three of the men crawled in and joined the boys  what is it you george how on earth did you get here bob exclaimed  we saw a light as we were passing and got in from behind when we saw what it was we rang the alarmbell and then came on here to do what we could till help came  you are goodplucked you are grimstone said admiringly but i am afraid its not much good  you take the hose bob and keep the rafters drenched there bill and i will crawl forward and clear the shavings out of the way if we can they have caught half a dozen times already  the two boys crawled forward and although the heat was tremendous they managed to clear away the shavings for a considerable distance the smoke and heat were so great that they were obliged to crawl back into the outer air where for a while they lay almost insensible there were crowds of men in the yard now but most of them were round at the back powerless to aid at present and only watching the flames as they roared through the whole of the windows of the moldingroom  men were hurrying past with buckets of water and one of them seeing the condition of the boys dashed some over their heads and faces and they presently staggered to their feet it was now a quarter of an hour since they had first given the alarm and they were just about to reenter the planingshop to rejoin bill when they met him and his comrades coming out  all the waters gone he said if the engines aint here in a minute or two it will be too late  but just at that moment there was a cheer outside and immediately afterwards a fireengine dashed through the gate grimstone ran up to the firemen as they leaped off  the great thing he said is to prevent it spreading from that shop into this we have been keeping it back till now but the tank has just run dry  while the other firemen were fitting the hose to the fireplug just outside the gates one of them made his way into the planingroom to ascertain the exact position of affairs  quick lads he said theres no time to be lost the fire is making its way through another five minutes and we should have been too late to save any of this block is there any communication through the upper floors he asked grimstone  yes there is a door on each floor  have you got any empty sacks about the place  yes there is a pile of them in there  the fireman gave instructions to one of his comrades while he himself made his way into the planingroom with the hose the other got out the sacks and assisted by grimstone and some of the hands drenched them with water and then proceeding to the door on the first floor piled them against it  it is hot already he said as he laid his hand upon it now do you men bring me buckets of water keep the sacks drenched till another engine comes up  george and bill finding they could be of no more use made their way out to the back and joined the crowd watching the flames which had already spread to the first floor they were however with the rest of the lookerson speedily turned out of the yard by the police who having now arrived in sufficient strength proceeded at once to clear the premises of all save a score or two of men who were engaged in assisting the firemen  as the boys went out through the front gate another engine dashed up at full speed dropping lighted cinders on its way  hurray bill said this is a steamer i expect they will do now  then the boys made their way round again to the back and by means of the pieces of timber established themselves on the wall where they were soon joined by a number of others and watched the struggle with the flames  in half an hour six engines were on the spot but even this force had no visible effect upon the flames in that portion of the building in which they had taken possession and the firemen turned the whole of their efforts to prevent it from spreading  the party wall dividing it from the main building was a very strong one but so hot had it become that the floor boards touching it were over and over again in flames  a score of men with saws and axes cut away the flooring adjoining the doors on the first and second stories the planingroom was fortunately not boarded while a portion of the fire brigade worked unceasingly in preventing the spread of the flames in this direction the rest turned their attention to the great wood piles which were repeatedly ignited by the fragments of burning wood  presently the roof fell in and the flames shot up high into the air but grand as the sight was the boys did not wait any longer looking on their faces smarted severely from the heat to which they had been exposed their hands had been a good deal burned by the shavings their hair eyebrows and eyelashes were singed and the eyeballs ached with the glare  i will run home now bill mother will likely enough hear of the fire and as we said we should be back soon after eight she will be getting anxious  i will go and tell her its all right you stop and see the end of it here  but this george would not hear of  very well then i will go with you i must get some grease or something to put on my face and hands they are smarting awfully  mrs andrews gave an exclamation of surprise and alarm as the boys entered the irritation of the wood smoke had so much inflamed their eyes that they could scarcely see out of them and their faces looked like pieces of raw beef  whatever has happened boys she exclaimed  theres a great fire at penroses mother it broke out just as we were passing so we stopped to help for a bit and then came home to tell you thinking that you might be anxious  a fire at the works mrs andrews exclaimed that is dreadful dreadful for mr penrose and for all of you who work there more perhaps for you than for him for no doubt he is insured and you may be out of work for months thank god i have plenty of work so i dare say we shall be able to tide it over  it is not all burned mother only the moldingshop and the floors above it are on fire at present and as there are six fireengines at work and they keep on arriving every minute i hope they will save the rest and now mother what can we do to our faces and hands they are smarting awfully  dear me george are you burnt i thought you were only dreadfully hot  we feel hot mother just as if our faces were being roasted  i will get some oil that will be the best thing mrs andrews said hurrying away to the kitchen and coming back with a piece of cottonwool and some oliveoil in a cup  you are burned george why child your hair is all singed and your eyebrows and eyelashes why what have you been doing to yourselves there could have been no occasion to put your heads into the flames like that why your hands are worse still they are quite blistered i had better wrap them up in cottonwool  its the inside thats the worst mother perhaps if you put a bit of cottonwool there and tie it round the back it will do we cant go out with our hands all swaddled round like that and now please directly you have done we want to go down again to see the fire just you go up to the road corner mother its a grand sight i can tell you  we will have tea first mrs andrews said decidedly everything has been ready except pouring the water in since eight oclock and its a quarter past nine now after we have done i will put on my bonnet and walk down with you as near as i can get i am not going to lose you out of my sight again  so after their meal they went down together but could not get anywhere near the works all the approaches now being guarded by the police it was a grand sight but the worst was over and there was a general feeling of confidence in the crowd that it would spread no further a dozen engines were at work now some of the firemen were on the roof some on the stacks of timber which looked redhot from the deep glow from the fire the flames were intermittent now sometimes leaping up high above the shell of the burnedout buildings then dying down again  thank god its no worse mrs andrews said fervently it would have been a bad winter for a great many down here if the fire had spread as it is not a quarter of the buildings are burned  no nothing like that mother not above a tenth i should say its lucky that there was a strong wall between that and the next shops or it must all have gone i have heard them say that part was added on five or six years ago so that the wall at the end of the planingshop was an outside wall before that accounts for its being so thick  after looking on for about half an hour they went back home but neither of the boys got much sleep that night the excitement they had gone through and the pain of their burns keeping them wide awake till nearly morning as mrs andrews heard no movement in their roomswhereas they were usually up and about almost as early on sundays as on other days being unable to sleep after their usual hour for risingshe did not disturb them george was the first to awake and looking out of the window felt sure by the light that it was later than usual he put his head out of the door and shouted  bill are you up there was no answer mother are you up what oclock is it  up hours ago george why its past eleven  george gave an exclamation of astonishment and rushed into bills room the latter had woke at his shout  its past eleven bill and mother has been up for hours and he dashed off again to his room to dress it was but a few minutes before they came downstairs just at the same moment  why didnt you wake us mother  because i thought it better to let you sleep on george i guessed that your burns had kept you awake for some time  that they did i thought i was never going to get to sleep george said and bill gave a similar account of himself still mother a short night does no harm for once and you havent been able to get to church  it does not matter for once george what figures you both are  we are figures george said ruefully i hardly knew myself when i looked in the glass my eyes are almost shut up and the skin is peeling off my nose and my hair is all rough and scrubby and bill looks as bad as i do you are a figure bill and george burst into a fit of laughter  hes no worse than you george but come along breakfast is waiting  you havent waited breakfast for us i hope mother  i made myself a cup of tea the first thing boys and had a slice of bread and butter for i thought you might not be down for some time but i am quite ready to join you we have got fish i put them down directly you called  well i am glad you are not starving mother and i am glad too you didnt have your regular breakfast it would have been horrid to sit down on sunday morning without you when its the only regular breakfast we get in the week  just as they had finished their meal there was a knock at the door it was bob grimstone bill opened the door  well how are you today lad i thought i would just come round and see you look pretty badly burned and so do you george he added as he followed bill into the sitting room  goodday mrs andrews  goodmorning mr grimstone mrs andrews said since her coming the grimstones had several times come in on sunday afternoon to laburnum villas mrs andrews would indeed have wished them to come in more frequently for she felt much indebted to them for their kindness to george and moreover liked them for themselves for both were good specimens of their class  i see you were busy last night too mr grimstone your face looks scorched but you did not manage to get yourself burned as these silly boys did what a blessing it is for us all that the fire did not spread  well mrs andrews i dont think those two lads can have told you what they did for if they had you would hardly call them silly boys  mrs andrews looked surprised  they told me they lent a hand to put out the firei think those were georges wordsbut they did not tell me anything else  they saved the building maam if it hadnt been for them there would not have been a stick or stone of penroses standing now the shops and the wood piles would all have gone and we should all have been idle for six months to come there is no doubt about that at all  why how was that mr grimstone how was it they did more than anyone else  in the first place they discovered it maam and rung the alarmbell it mightnt have been found out for another five minutes and five minutes would have been enough for the fire in the next place when they had given the alarm they did the only thing that could have saved the place they got into the planingshop and turned on the hose there and fought the fire from spreading through the door till we got in seven or eight minutes later it was all we could do to stop it then but if they hadnt done what they did the planingshop would have been alight from end to end and the floors above it too before the first engine arrived and then nothing could have saved the whole lot i can tell you mrs andrews that there isnt a man on the works nor the wife of a man who doesnt feel that they owe these two lads their living through the winter i dont know what mr penrose will say about it but i know what we all feel  why george mrs andrews said while her eyes were filled with happy tears at the praises of her son why did you not tell me about it  why mother there was not anything to tell george said and bob has made a great fuss about nothing as i told you we saw a light as we came along and when we went round behind and got on the wall we saw the place was on fire so we rang the alarmbell and then turned on the hose and flooded the place with water till bob and some more came to help us  it sounds very simple mrs andrews but i can tell you it wasnt so when we opened the door of the planingshop it was so full of smoke that it didnt seem as if anyone could breathe there for a minute and as we could see the glare of the flames at the other end we thought the place was gone we should have gone out and waited for the engines if we hadnt heard the boys sing out that they were there and even though we knelt down and crawled in as they shouted to us to do we were pretty nearly stifled when we took the hose they crawled forward and got the shavings cleared away that was how they burned their hands i expect and i hear they tumbled down insensible when they got out now maam they may make light of it but if ever two young chaps behaved like heroes they did and you have every right to be proud of themi say of them because although bills no son of yours i know he is what you and your boy have made him he was telling me about it one day  will work go on tomorrow as usual bob george asked in order to change the subject  in some of the shops it will no doubt bob said but in our shop and the floors above it it will take a day or two to clear up i saw the foreman just now and he tells me that a strong gang of carpenters will be put on for both the floors are burned away at the end of the wall and pretty near twenty feet of the roof are charred two surveyors are coming down this afternoon to examine the wall and say whether it is safe the walls of the shops that are burned out must come down of course the surveyor says that if the wall at the end of the planingroom looks pretty strong they will build up another wall against it as soon as it gets cold enough and the rubbish is cleared away for men to work that will make a strong job of it and there wont be any loss of time of course if the old one has to come down there cant be much work done in the shops till its finished the governor got down about ten oclock last night a messenger went up to him almost directly after the fire broke out but he was out at dinner and by the time he got down here all danger of it spreading was over he had a talk with the foreman and arranged about the wall with him he is as anxious as we are that there should be no delay for there are some heavy orders in and of course he doesnt want them taken anywhere else  will you look at their hands mr grimstone i dont know much about it but they seem to be badly burned  that they are maam mr grimstone said when he had examined them pretty nigh raw if i might give an opinion i should say as the doctor had better see them they are precious painful aint they george  they do feel as if they were on fire bob but i dont see any use in a doctor i dont suppose he can do more than mother has  perhaps not george but he had better see them for all that he may give you some cooling lotion for them and i can tell you burns on the hand are apt to be serious matters for the muscles of the fingers may get stiffened i have known two or three cases like that you had better go at once to dr maxwell he always attends if there are any accidents at the works you know the house george it is about halfway between this and the works  yes you had better go at once boys mrs andrews said there put on your hats and be off  i will walk with them i must be off anyway for the missis will be waiting dinner for me  are we to pay mother  no not till you have done george i dare say you will have to have your hands dressed several times  there wont be any occasion to pay him mrs andrews the firm always pays the doctor in case of accidents and you may be very sure that in this case they will be only too glad  well in any case george mrs andrews said you can tell the doctor that you will pay when he says that you need not come to him again if mr penrose hears about it and chooses to pay i should not think of refusing as you have been burned in his service but certainly i should not assume that he will do so  shall i go in with you boys bob asked when they reached the door i know the doctor he attended me two years ago when i pretty nigh had my finger taken off by one of the cutters  yes please bob i wish you would  they were shown into the surgery where the doctor soon joined them  ive brought these two young chaps for you to look at their hands dr maxwell they got them burnt last night at the fire mrs andrews the mother of this lad wished me to say that she would pay the charges when you have done with them but as if it hadnt been for them the works would have been burnt down as sure as you are standing there i expect the firm will take the matter in their own hands  yes they are nasty burns the doctor said examining the boys hands can you open and shut them boy  i think i could if tried sir george said but i shouldnt like to try for if i move my fingers at all it hurts them awfully  i see you have had oil and cottonwool on your hands  yes  the best thing you can do boys is to put on some soothing poultices tell your mother to get some linseed and mix it with oliveoil i will give you a bottle of laudanum let her put about twenty drops of that into the oil before she mixes it with the linseed every four or five hours change the poultices i think you will find that will relieve the pain a good deal i see your faces are scorched too you can do nothing better than keep them moistened with sweetoil i should advise you to keep as quiet as possible for three or four days  but we shall want to get to work sir george said  nonsense you will be very lucky if you can use your hands in another fortnight i will send in the usual certificate to the works  will you tell the foreman bob george said when they left the doctors how it is we cant come to work you tell him we wanted to and that we hope to come back as soon as our hands are all right because you see the men and boys at the shops which have been burnt down will be all out of work and it would be awful if we found our places filled up when we went to work again  dont you be afraid george there is no fear of your being out of work after what you have done  well what did the doctor say was mrs andrews first question when they returned home  he didnt say much mother except that we must not think of going to work for a fortnight anyhow and we are to have poultices made with linseed mixed with oil and twenty drops of laudanum from this bottle and it must be put on fresh every three or four hours i am afraid it will be an awful trouble  the trouble wont matter mrs andrews said brightly did he say you were to go to bed  no mother but we were to keep as quiet as we could  then in that case george i think you had better go to bed  no i am sure we had better not george said i should toss and fidget about there horridly the best thing will be for us to sit here and then we shall be all together and if you talk to us and perhaps read to us we shant feel it half so much what are you going to do mother he asked five minutes afterwards as mrs andrews came down with her bonnet on  i am going to get some linseed george of course i havent got any in the house  but its sunday mother and the shops will be shut  i shall get it at the chemists george they will always supply things that are needed even on sunday people are ill on sunday as well as any other day you know i shant be gone more than a quarter of an hour you must keep very quiet till i come back  the boys found a good deal of relief from the effect of the poultices and were very much better after a good nights rest at ten oclock the next morning as mrs andrews was sitting at her work with the boys both on the hearthrug in front of the fire there was a knock at the door it was a loud double knock quite unlike the ordinary summons of the bakers boy who was the only regular caller the boys jumped up in surprise  who can that be mother  we shall soon see mrs andrews said quietly  she was not surprised on opening the door to see a gentleman standing there whom by the description the boys had given of him she guessed to be their employer a little girl was standing by his side  is this mrs andrews the gentleman asked  i am mrs andrews the lady answered quietly  my name is penrose i have called with my daughter to inquire after the two ladsone of them your son i believewho so gallantly saved my place from being burned down on saturday evening i only heard about it late yesterday evening when i came down to arrange about some matters with the foreman he did not know the facts of the case on saturday night but had learned them yesterday and there can be no doubt whatever from what he says that had it not been for the presence of mind and bravery of these two lads nothing could have saved the entire works and all the wood piles from destruction i told my daughter this morning and she insisted on coming down with me you know she is already indebted to your son for saving a locket which we both greatly valued  will you walk in sir and mrs andrews showed them into the sitting room  mr penrose had been somewhat surprised by mrs andrews manner although the foreman in telling him of the boys conduct had also stated what he knew about them  they are outoftheway sort of boys sir he said there was quite a talk about them in the shops in the spring they lodged with grimstone and it seems that after they had been here at work five months andrews mother who had been ill was coming to them and they got grimstone to take a house for them and it turned out that ever since they had been at work here they had been putting by half their wages to furnish a place for her so they must have lived on about five shillings a week each and got clothes for themselves out of it now sir boys as would do that aint ordinary boys and there was quite a talk among the men about it i hear from grimstone that mrs andrews is a superior sort of person he says quite a lady she does work i believe for some london shop  mr penrose therefore was prepared to find the boys in a more comfortable abode than usual and their mother what the foreman called a superior sort of woman but he perceived at once by her address that grimstones estimate had been a correct one and that she was indeed a lady the prettiness of the little sitting room with its comfortable furniture its snowy curtains and pretty belongings heightened this feeling  i have come to see you boys he said and to tell you how indebted i feel to you for your exertions on saturday there is no doubt that had it not been for you the place would have been entirely burned it was fully insured but it would have been a serious matter for me as i should have lost four or five months work and it would have been still more serious for the men to have been thrown out of employment at this time of the year so we all feel very much indebted to you i hope you are not much burned  oh no sir our hands are burned a bit but they will be all right in a few days bill and i are very glad sir that we happened to be passing and were able to give the alarm and do something to stop the flames till the others came up but we dont feel that it was anything out of the way it was just a piece of fun and excitement to us  they didnt say anything about it mr penrose when they came home and it was only when one of the men came in next day to ask after them that i heard that they had really been of use  it is all very well to say so lads mr penrose replied but there is no doubt you showed a great deal of courage as well as presence of mind and you may be sure that i shall not forget it and now mrs andrews he said turning round to her i feel rather in a false position i came round to see the lads who when i last saw them were not in very flourishing circumstances and i was going to make them a present for the service they had done me and my daughter has brought them a basket with some wine jelly and other things such as are good for sick boys finding them as i find them in your care and in such a home you see i feel a difficulty about it altogether  thank you sir mrs andrews said for the kindness of your intention but my boysfor although one is in no way related to me i feel towards him as if he were my ownwould not like to take money for doing their duty towards their employer  no indeed george and bill exclaimed simultaneously  as you see sir thanks to the work you were good enough to give the boys and to my needleand she glanced towards the articles on the tablewe are very comfortable but i am sure the boys will be very glad to accept the things which your daughter has been so kind as to bring down for them and will feel very much obliged for her thoughtfulness  that is right mr penrose said relieved nelly you may as well leave the basket as it is i am sure you dont want to carry it back again  no papa nelly said and indeed even the empty basket would have been more than the child could well have carried it had come on the top of the carriage to the railwaystation and a porter had accompanied mr penrose with it to laburnum villas  you would have hardly known your young friend would you nelly  i dont think i should she said shaking her head he looks dreadfully burned and his hair is all funny and frizzled  it will soon grow again george said smiling the doctor says our faces will be all right when the skin is peeled off thank you very much miss penrose for all the nice things it was a fortunate day indeed for us when i caught that boy stealing your locket  and it was a fortunate day for us too mr penrose responded now mrs andrews we will say goodby you will not mind my calling again to see how the boys are getting on  it will be very kind of you sir and we shall be glad to see you mrs andrews replied but i hope in a few days they will both be out of the doctors hands  i cant shake hands with you mr penrose said patting the boys on the shoulder but i hope next time i see you to be able to do so goodmorning mrs andrews     chapter vii  saved   now let us have a look at the basket mother george said as mrs andrews returned into the room after seeing her two visitors off its very kind of him isnt it and i am glad he didnt offer us money that would have been horrid wouldnt it  i am glad he did not too george mr penrose is evidently a gentleman of delicacy and refinement of feeling and he saw that he would give pain if he did so  you see it too dont you bill george asked you know you thought i was a fool not to take money when he offered it for getting back the locket but you see it in the same way now dont you  yes i shouldnt have liked to take money bill said i sees  see mrs andrews corrected  thank you i see things differentdifferently he corrected himself seeing that george was about to speak to what i did then  now mother george said let us open the basket its almost as big as a clothesbasket isnt it  the cover was lifted and the contents which had after much thought been settled by nelly herself were disclosed there were two bottles of portwine a large mold of jelly a great cake two dozen oranges some apples a box of preserved fruit some almonds and raisins two packets of everton toffee a dozen mincepies and four pots of blackcurrant jelly on the cover of one of which was written in a sprawling hand two teaspoonfuls stirred up in a tumbler of water for a drink at night  this will make a grand feast mother what a jolly collection isnt it i think miss penrose must have chosen it herself dont you  it certainly looks like it george mrs andrews replied smiling i do not think any grownup person would have chosen mincepies and toffee as appropriate for sick boys  yes but she must have known we were not badly burned mother and besides you see she put in currantjelly to make drinks and there are the oranges too i vote that we have an orange and some toffee at once bill  i have tasted oranges bill said lots of them in the market but i never tasted toffee  its firstrate i can tell you  why they look like bits of tin bill said as the packet was opened  george burst into a laugh  thats tinfoil thats only to wrap it up you peel that off bill and you will find the toffee inside now mother you have a glass of wine and a piece of cake  i will have a piece of cake george but i am not going to open the wine we will put that by in case of illness or of any very extraordinary occasion  i am glad the other things wont keep mother or i expect you would be wanting to put them all away isnt this toffee good bill  firstrate bill agreed what is it made of  sugar and butter melted together over the fire  you are like two children mrs andrews laughed instead of boys getting on for sixteen years old now i must clear this table again and get to work i promised these four bonnets should be sent in tomorrow morning and theres lots to be done to them yet  it was three weeks before the boys were able to go to work again the foreman came round on saturdays with their wages mr penrose called again this time they were out but he chatted for some time with mrs andrews  i dont wish to pry into your affairs mrs andrews he said after asking about the boys but i have a motive for asking if your son has as i suppose he has from his way of speaking had a fair education  he was at school up to the age of twelve mrs andrews said quietly circumstances at that time obliged me to remove him but i have since done what i could myself towards continuing his education and he still works regularly of an evening  why i ask mrs andrews was that i should like in time to place him in the countinghouse i say in time because i think it will be better for him for the next two or three years to continue to work in the shops i will have him moved from shop to shop so as to learn thoroughly the various branches of the business that is what i should do had i a son of my own to bring into the business it will make him more valuable afterwards and fit him to take a good position either in my shops or in any similar business should an opening occur  i am greatly obliged to you sir mrs andrews said gratefully though i say it myself a better boy never lived  i am sure he is by what i have heard of him and i shall be only too glad after the service he has rendered me to do everything in my power to push him forward his friend i hear has not had the same advantages at the time i first saw him he looked a regular young arab  so he was sir but he is a fine young fellow he was very kind to my boy when he was alone in london and gave up his former life to be with him george taught him to read before i came here and he has worked hard ever since no one could be nicer in the house than he is and had i been his own mother he could not be more dutiful or anxious to please indeed i may say that i am indebted for my home here as much to him as to my own boy  i am glad to hear you say so mrs andrews for of course i should wish to do something for him too at any rate i will give him like your son every opportunity of learning the business and he will in time be fit for a position of foreman of a shopby no means a bad one for a lad who has had such a beginning as he has had after that of course it must depend upon himself i think if you will allow me to suggest it would be as well that you should not tell them the nature of our conversation of course it is for you to decide but however steady boys they are it might make them a little less able to get on well with their associates in a shop if they know that they are going to be advanced  i dont think it would make any difference to them sir but at the same time i do think it would be as well not to tell them  one day bill was out by himself as the men were coming out of the shop and he stopped to speak to bob grimstone  oh i am glad to find you without george bob said cause i want to talk to you look here the men in all the shops have made a subscription to give you and george a present everyone feels that its your doing that we have not got to idle all this winter and when someone started the idea there wasnt a man in the two shops that didnt agree with him i am the treasurer i am and its come to just thirty pounds now i dont know what you two boys would like whether you would like it in money or whether you would like it in something else so i thought i would ask you first i thought you would know what george would like seeing what friends you are and then you know it would come as a surprise to him now what do you say  its very kind of you bill said i am sure george would like anything better than money and so should i  well you think it over bill and let me know in a day or two we were thinking of a watch for each of you with an inscription saying it was presented to you by your shopmates for having saved the factory and so kept them at work for months just at the beginning of winter thats what seemed to me that you would like but if there is anything you would like better just you say so you come down here tomorrow or next day when you have thought it over and give me an answer of course you can consult george if you think best  bill met bob grimstone on the following day  i have thought it over he said and i know what george and me would like better than any possible thing you could get  well what is it bill  well what we have set our minds on and what we were going to save up our money to get was a piano for georges mother i heard her say that we could get a very nice one for about thirty pounds and it would be splendid if you were all to give it her  very well bill then a piano it shall be i know a chap as works at kirkmans and i expect he will be able to give us a good one for the money  accordingly on the saturday afternoon before the boys were going to work again mrs andrews and george were astonished at seeing a cart stop before the house and the foreman bob grimstone and four other men coming up to the door  bill ran and opened the door and the men entered he had been apprised of the time that they might be expected and at once showed them in  mrs andrews the foreman said i and my mates here are a deputation from the hands employed in the shop and we have come to offer you a little sort of testimonial of what we feel we owe your son and bill smith for putting out the fire and saving the shops if it hadnt been for them it would have been a bad winter for us all so after thinking it over and finding out what form of testimonial the lads would like best we have got you a piano which we hope you may live long to play on and enjoy we had proposed to give them a watch each but we found that they would rather that it took the form of a piano  oh how good and kind of you all mrs andrews said much affected i shall indeed be proud of your gift both for itself and for the kind feeling towards my boys which it expresses  then maam with your permission we will just bring it in and the deputation retired to assist with the piano  oh boys how could you do it without telling me mrs andrews exclaimed  george had hitherto stood speechless with surprise  but i didnt know anything about it mother i dont know what they mean by saying that we would rather have it than watches of course we would a hundred times but i dont know how they knew it  then it must have been your kind thought bill  it wasnt no kind thought mrs andrews but they spoke to me about it and i knew that a piano was what we should like better than anything else and i didnt say anything about it because bob grimstone thought that it would be nicer to be a surprise to george as well as to you  you are right old boy george said shaking bill by the hand why there never was such a good idea it is splendid mother isnt it  the men now appeared at the door with the piano this was at once placed in the position which had long ago been decided upon as the best place for the piano when it should come mrs andrews opened it and there on the front was a silver plate with the inscription  to mrs andrews from the employees at messrs penrose  co in token of their gratitude to george andrews and william smith for their courage and presence of mind by which the factory was saved from being destroyed by fire on saturday the 23d of october 1857  the tears which stood in mrs andrews eyes rendered it difficult for her to read the inscription  i thank you indeed she said now perhaps you would like to hear its tones so saying she sat down and played home sweet home it has a charming touch she said as she rose and you see the air was an appropriate one for your gift will serve to make home even sweeter than before give please my grateful thanks and those of my boys to all who have subscribed  the inhabitants of no 8 laburnum villas had long been a subject of considerable discussion and interest to their neighbors for the appearance of the boys as they came home of an evening in their working clothes seemed altogether incongruous with that of their mother and with the neatness and prettiness of the villa and was indeed considered derogatory to the respectability of laburnum villas in general upon this evening they were still further mystified at hearing the notes of a female voice of great power and sweetness accompanied by a piano played evidently by an accomplished musician issuing from the house as to the boys they thought that next only to that of the homecoming of mrs andrews never was such a happy evening spent in the world  i do not think that in all london there was a household that enjoyed that winter more than did the inmates of no 8 laburnum villas their total earnings were about thirtyfive shillings a week much less than that of many a mechanic but ample for them not only to live but to live in comfort and even refinement no stranger who had looked into the pretty drawing room in the evening would have dreamed that the lady at the piano worked as a milliner for her living or that the lads were boys in a manufactory  when spring came they began to plan various trips and excursions which could be taken on bank holidays or during the long summer evenings when an event happened which for a time cut short all their plans the word had been passed round the shops the first thing in the morning that mr penrose was coming down with a party of ladies and gentlemen to go over the works and that things were to be made as tidy as possible  accordingly there was a general clearing up and vast quantities of shavings and sawdust were swept up from the floors although when the machines had run again for a few hours no one would have thought that a broom had been seen in the place for weeks  george was now in a shop where a number of machines were at work grooving mortising and performing other work to prepare the wood for builders purposes the party arrived just as work had recommenced after dinner  there were ten or twelve gentlemen and as many ladies nelly penrose with two girls about her own age accompanied the party they stopped for a time in each shop while mr penrose explained the nature of the work and the various points of the machinery  they had passed through most of the other rooms before they entered that in which george was engaged and the young girls taking but little interest in the details of the machinery wandered somewhat away from the rest of the party chatting among themselves george had his eye upon them and was wishing that mr penrose would turn round and speak to them for they were moving about carelessly and not paying sufficient heed to the machinery  suddenly he threw down his work and darted forward with a shout but he was too late a revolvingband had caught nelly penroses dress in an instant she was dragged forward and in another moment would have been whirled into the middle of the machinery  there was a violent scream followed by a sudden crash and a harsh grating sound and then the whole of the machinery on that side of the room came to a standstill for a moment no one knew what had happened mr penrose and some of his friends rushed forward to raise nelly her hand was held fast between the band and the pulley and the band had to be cut to relieve it  what an escape what an escape mr penrose murmured as he lifted her another second and nothing could have saved her but what stopped the machinery and for the first time he looked round the shop there was a little group of men a few yards away and having handed nelly who was crying bitterly for her hand was much bruised to one of the ladies he stepped towards them the foreman came forward to meet him  i think sir you had better get the ladies out of the shop i am afraid young andrews is badly hurt  how is it what is the matter mr penrose asked  i think sir he saw the danger your daughter was in and shoved his foot in between two of the cogwheels  you dont say so mr penrose exclaimed as he pushed forward among the men  two of them were supporting george andrews who as pale as death lay in their arms one of his feet was jammed in between two of the cogwheels he was scarcely conscious  good heavens mr penrose exclaimed in a low tone his foot must be completely crushed have you thrown off the driving belt williams  yes sir i did that first thing  thats right now work away for your lives lads this was said to two men who had already seized spanners and were unscrewing the bolts of the bearings in order to enable the upper shafting to be lifted and the cogwheel removed then mr penrose returned to his friends  pray leave the shop he said and go down into the office theres been a bad accident a noble young fellow has sacrificed himself to save nellys life and is i fear terribly hurt williams send off a man instantly for the surgeon let him jump into one of the cabs he will find waiting at the gate and tell the man to drive as hard as he can go if dr maxwell is not at home let him fetch someone else  george had indeed sacrificed himself to save nelly penrose when he saw the band catch her dress he had looked round for an instant for something with which to stop the machinery but there was nothing at hand and without an instants hesitation he had thrust his foot between the cogwheels he had on very heavy thickly nailed working boots and the ironbound sole threw the cogs out of gear and bent the shaft thereby stopping the machinery george felt a dull sickening pain which seemed to numb and paralyze him all over and he remembered little more until on the shafting being removed his foot was extricated and he was laid gently down on a heap of shavings the first thing he realized when he was conscious was that someone was pouring some liquid which halfchoked him down his throat  when he opened his eyes mr penrose kneeling beside him was supporting his head while on the other side knelt bill smith the tears streaming down his cheeks and struggling to suppress his sobs  what is it bill whats the matter then the remembrance of what had passed flashed upon him  is she safe was i in time  quite safe my dear boy thank god your noble sacrifice was not in vain mr penrose answered with quivering lips for he too had the greatest difficulty in restraining his emotion  am i badly hurt sir george asked after a pause because if so will you please send home for mother i dont feel in any pain but i feel strange and weak  it is your foot my boy i fear that it is badly crushed but otherwise you are unhurt your boot threw the machinery out of gear  in ten minutes the doctor arrived he had already been informed of the nature of the accident  is it any use trying to cut the boot off mr penrose asked in a low voice as dr maxwell stooped over georges leg  not the slightest the doctor answered in the same tone the foot is crushed to a pulp it must come off at the ankle nothing can save it he had better be taken home at once you had best send to guys and get an operating surgeon for him i would rather it were done by someone whose hand is more used than mine to this sort of work  i am a governor of guys mr penrose said and will send off at once for one of their best men you are not afraid of the case i hope dr maxwell  not of the local injury dr maxwell replied but the shock to the system of such a smash is very severe however he has youth strength and a good constitution so we must hope for the best the chances are all in his favor we are thinking of taking you home my boy he went on speaking aloud to george are you in any great pain  i am not in any pain sir only i feel awfully cold and please will someone go on before and tell mother bill had better not go he would frighten her to death and make her think it was much worse than it is  i will go myself mr penrose replied i will prepare her for your coming  drink some more of this brandy the doctor said that will warm you and give you strength for your journey  there was a stretcher always kept at the works in case of emergency and george was placed on this and covered with some rugs four of the men raised it onto their shoulders and set out mr penrose at once driving on to prepare mrs andrews  bill followed the procession heartbroken when it neared home he fell behind and wandered away not being able to bring himself to witness the grief of mrs andrews for hours he wandered about sitting down in waste places and crying as if his heart would break if it had been me it wouldnt have mattered he kept on exclaimingwouldnt have mattered a bit it wouldnt have been no odds one way or the other there we have always been together in the shops till this week and now when we get separated this is what comes of it here am i walking about all right and george all crushed up and his mother breaking her heart why i would rather a hundred times that they had smashed me up all over than have gone and hurt george like that  it was dark before he made his way back and entering at the back door took off his boots and was about to creep upstairs when mrs andrews came out of the kitchen  oh mrs andrews he exclaimed and the tears again burst from him  do not cry bill george is in gods hands and the doctors have every hope that he will recover they are upstairs with him now with a nurse whom mr penrose has fetched down from the hospital he will have to lose his foot poor boy she added with a sob that she could not repress but we should feel very thankful that it is no worse after such an accident as that the doctor says that his thick boots saved him if it hadnt been for that his whole leg would have been drawn into the machinery and then nothing could have saved him now i must go upstairs as i only came down for some hot water  may i go up to him mrs andrews  i think my boy you had better stop down here for the present for both your sakes i will let you know when you can go up to him  so bill crouched before the fire and waited he heard movements upstairs and wondered what they were doing and why they didnt keep quiet and when he would be allowed to go up once or twice the nurse came down for hot water but bill did not speak to her but in half an hour mrs andrews herself returned looking bill thought even paler than before  i have just slipped down to tell you my boy that its all over they gave him chloroform and have taken his foot off  and didnt it hurt it awful bill asked in an awed voice  not in the least he knew nothing about it and the first thing he asked when he came to was when they were going to begin they will be going away directly and then you can come up and sit quietly in his room if you like the doctors say he will probably drop asleep  bill was obliged to go outside again and wrestle with himself before he felt that he was fit to go up into georges room it was a long struggle and had george caught his muttered remonstrances to himself he would have felt that bill had suffered a bad relapse into his former method of talking it came out in jerks between his sobs  come none of that now aint yer ashamed of yerself ahowling and ablubbering like a gal call yerself a manyou are a babby thats what you are now dry up and lets have no more of it  but it was a long time before he again mastered himself then he went to the scullery and held his head under the tap till the water took away his breath then polished his face till it shone and then went and sat quietly down till mrs andrews came in and told him that he could go upstairs to george he went up to the bedside and took georges hand but he could not trust himself to speak  well bill old boy george said cheerily but in a somewhat lower voice than usual this is a sudden go isnt it  bill nodded he was still speechless  dont you take it to heart bill george said feeling that the lad was shaking from head to foot it wont make much odds you know i shall soon be about again all right i expect they will be able to put on an artificial foot and i shall be stumping about as well as ever though i shouldnt be much good at a race  i wish it had been me bill broke out i would have jammed my head in between them wheels cheerful that i would rather than you should have gone and done it  fortunately there was no time george said with a smile dont you fret yourself bill one can get on well enough without a foot and it didnt hurt me a bit coming off no nor the squeeze either not regular hurting it was just a sort of scrunch and then i didnt feel anything more why i have often hurt myself ten times as much at play and thought nothing of it i expect it looked much worse to you than it felt to me  we will talk of it another time bill said huskily your mother said i wasnt to talk and i wasnt to let you talk but just to sit down here quiet and you are to try to go off to sleep so saying he sat down by the bedside george asked one or two more questions but bill only shook his head presently george closed his eyes and a short time afterwards his quiet regular breathing showed that he was asleep  the next six weeks passed pleasantly enough to george every day hampers containing flowers and various niceties in the way of food were sent down by mr penrose and that gentleman himself very frequently called in for a chat with him as soon as the wound had healed an instrumentmaker came down from town to measure him for an artificial foot but before he was able to wear this he could get about on crutches  the first day that he was downstairs mr penrose brought nelly down to see him the child looked pale and awed as he came in  my little girl has asked me to thank you for her george mr penrose said as she advanced timidly and placed her hand in his i have not said much to you about my own feelings and i wont say much about hers but you can understand what we both feel why my boy it was a good providence indeed which threw you in my way i thought so when you saved the mill from destruction i feel it tenfold more now that you have saved my child the ways of god are indeed strange who would have thought that all this could have sprung from that boy snatching the locket from helen as we came out of the theater and now about the future george i owe you a great debt infinitely greater than i can ever repay but what i can do i will in the future i shall regard you as my son and i hope that you will look to me as to a father i have been talking to your mother and she says that she thinks your tastes lie altogether in the direction of engineering is that so  yes sir i have often thought i would rather be an engineer than anything else but i dont like  never mind what you like and what you dont like mr penrose said quietly you belong to me now you know and must do as you are told what i propose is this that you shall go to a good school for another three years and i will then apprentice you to a firstclass engineer either mechanical or civil as you may then prefer and when you have learned your business i will take good care that you are pushed on what do you say to that  i think it is too much altogether george said  never mind about that mr penrose said that is my business if that is the only objection we can imagine it settled there is another thing i know how attached you are to your friend bill and i am indebted to him too for the part he played at the fire so i propose if he is willing to put him to a good middleclass school for a bit in the course of a couple of years he will get a sufficient education to get on fairly with and then i propose according as you may choose to be a civil or mechanical engineer to place him with a mason or smith then by the time that you are ready to start in business he will be ready to take a place under you so that you may again work together  oh thank you sir george exclaimed even more pleased at the news relating to bill than at his own good fortune great as was the delight which the prospect opened by mr penroses offer caused him  as soon as george could be moved mr penrose sent him with his mother and bill down to the seaside here george rapidly regained strength and when after a stay there of two months he returned to town he was able to walk so well with his artificial foot that his loss would not have been noticed by a stranger  the arrangements settled by mr penrose were all in due time carried out george went for three years to a good school and was then apprenticed to one of the leading civil engineers with him he remained five years and then went out for him to survey a railroad about to be constructed in brazil and remained there as one of the staff who superintended its construction bill who was now a clever young mason accompanied him and through georges interest with the contractor obtained the subcontract for the masonry of some of the bridges and culverts  this was ten years ago and george andrews is now one of the most rising engineers of the day and whatever business he undertakes his friend bill is still his righthand man mr penrose has been in all respects as good as his word and has been ready to assist george with his personal influence in all his undertakings and in all respects has treated him as a son while nelly has regarded him with the affection of a sister  both george and bill have been married some years and mrs andrews the elder is one of the proudest and happiest of mothers she still lives with her son at the earnest request of his wife who is often left alone during georges frequent absence abroad on professional duties as for bill he has not even yet got over his wonder at his own good fortune and ever blesses the day when he first met george in covent garden     do your duty   early in the month of march 1801 an old sailor was sitting on a bench gazing over the stretch of sea which lies between hayling island and the isle of wight the prospect was a lively one for in those days ships of war were constantly running in and out and great convoys of merchantmen sailed under the protection of our cruisers and the traffic between spithead and portsmouth resembled that of a much frequented road  peter langley had been a boatswain in the kings service and had settled down in his old age on a pension and lived in a small cottage near the western extremity of hayling island here he could see what was going on at spithead and when he needed a talk with his old chums could get into his boat which was lying hauled up on the sand and with a good wind arrive in an hour at the hard he was sitting at present on a portion of a wreck thrown up by a very high tide on the sandy slope when his meditations were disturbed by a light step behind him and a lad in a sailors dress some fifteen years of age with a bright honest face came running down behind him  hallo dad  hallo my boy bless me whod ha thought o seeing you and the old man clasped the boy in his arms in a way that showed the close relationship between the two i didnt expect you for another week  no weve made a quick passage of it the boy said fine wind all the way up with a gale or two in the right quarter we only arrived in the river on monday and as soon as we were fairly in dock i got leave to run down to see you  what were you in such a hurry for the old sailor said its the duty of every hand to stop by the ship till shes cleared out  i have always stayed before till the crew were paid off but no sooner had we cast anchor than one of the owners came on board and told the captain that another cargo was ready that the ship was to be unloaded with all speed and to take in cargo and sail again in a fortnight at the utmost as a fleet was on the point of sailing for the west indies under a strong convoy  a fortnight thats sharp work the old sailor said and the goods will have to be bundled out and in again with double speed i know what it will be you will be going out with the paint all wet and those lubbers the stevedores will rub it off as fast as its put on well a few days at sea will shake all down into its place but how did you get leave  i am rather a favorite with the first officer the lad said the men who desired to leave were to be discharged at once and a fresh gang taken on board so i asked him directly the news came round if i might have four days away he agreed at once and i came down by the night coach and here i am for eightandforty hours  its a short stay the old sailor said after more than a year away but we mustnt waste the time in regretting it youve grown harry and are getting on fast in another couple of years youll be fit to join a kings ship i suppose youve got over your silly idea about sticking to the merchant service its all very well to learn your business there as a boy and i grant that in some things a merchantman is a better school than a kings ship they have fewer hands and each man has to do more and to learn to think for himself still after all theres no place like a saucy frigate for excitement and happiness  i dont know dad the boy said i have been learning a little navigation the first officer has been very kind to me and i hope in the course of two or three years to pass and get a berth as a third mate still i should like three or four years on board a manofwar  i should think so the old sailor said for a man ought to do his duty to his country  but there are plenty of men to do their duty to their country the boy said  not a bit of it the sailor exclaimed theres a great difficulty in finding hands for the navy everyone wants to throw their duty upon everyone else they all hanker after the higher wages and loafing life on board a merchantman and hate to keep themselves smart and clean as they must do in a kings ship if i had my way every tar should serve at least five years of his life on board a manofwar it is above all things essential harry that you should do your duty  i am ready to do my duty dad the boy said when the time comes i do it now to the best of my power and i have in my pocket a letter from the first officer to you he told you when you went down with me to see me off on my last voyage that he would keep an eye upon me and he has done so  thats right the old man said as you say harry a man may do his duty anywhere still for all that it is part of his duty if he be a sailor to help his majesty for a time at least against his enemies look at me why i served man and boy for nigh fifty years and was in action one way and another over a hundred times and here i am now with a snug little pension and as comfortable as his gracious majesty himself what can you want more than that  i dont know that i can want more the boy said in its way at least but there are other ways in the merchant service i might command a ship by the time i am thirty and be my own master instead of being a mere part of a machine i have heard the balls flying too he said laughing  what did you have a brush with mounseer the old tar said greatly interested  yes we had a bit of a fight with a large privateer off the coast of spain fortunately the old bark carries a long eighteen as well as her twelves and when the frenchman found that we could play at long bowls as well as himself he soon drew off but not before we had drilled a few holes in his sails and knocked away a bit of his bulwarks  were you hit harry  yes two or three shots hulled her but they did little damage beyond knocking away a few of the fittings and frightening the lady passengers we had a strong crew and a good many were sorry that the skipper did not hide his teeth and let the frenchman come close before he opened fire we should like to have towed him up the river with our flag over the tricolor  there you see harry the old sailor said you were just as ready to fight as if you had been on a manofwar and while in a sailing ship you only get a chance if one of these privateers happens to see you in a kings ship you go looking about for an enemy and when you see one the chances are he is bigger instead of smaller than yourself  ah well dad we shall never quite agree on it i expect the boy said but for all that i do mean to serve for a few years in a manofwar i expect that we may have a chance of seeing some fighting in the west indies there are they say several french cruisers in that direction and although we shall have a considerable convoy the frenchmen generally have the legs of our ships i believe that some of the vessels of the convoy are taking out troops and that we are going to have a slap at some of the french islands has there been any news here since i went  nothing beyond a few rows with the smugglers the revenue officers have a busy time here theres no such place for smuggling on the coast as between portsmouth and chichester these creeks are just the places for smugglers and theres so much traffic in the channel that a solitary lugger does not attract the attention of the coastguard as it does where the seas more empty however i dont trouble myself one way or the other about it i may know a good deal of the smuggling or i may not but its no business of mine if it were my duty to lend a hand to the coastguard i should do it but as it isnt i have no illwill to the smugglers and am content enough to get my spirits cheap  but dad surely its your duty to prevent the king being cheated harry said with a smile  if the king himself were going to touch the money the old sailor said sturdily i would lend a hand to see that he got it but theres no saying where this money would have gone besides if the spirits hadnt been run they would not have been brought over here at all so after all the revenue is none the worse for the smuggling  the boy laughed you can cheat yourself dad when you like but you know as well as i do that smugglings dishonest and that those who smuggle cheat the revenue  ah well the sailor said it may be so but i dont clearly see that its my duty to give information in the matter if i did feel as it were going to be my duty i should let all my neighbors know it and take mighty good care that they didnt say anything within earshot of me that i might feel called on to repeat and now lets go up to the cottage and see the old woman  i looked in there for a moment harry said as i passed mother looks as hale and hearty as she did when i left and so do you dad  yes we have nothing to complain of the old man said i have been so thoroughly seasoned with salt water that it would take a long time for me to decay  when they got up to the cottage they found that jane langley had got breakfast prepared rashers of bacon were smoking on the table and a large tankard of beer stood by for in those days the use of tea had not become general in this country  have you heard mother peter langley said that the boy is to leave us again in fortyeight hours  no indeed the old woman said but this is hard news i had hoped that you would be with us for a bit my boy for were getting on fast in life and may not be here when you return  oh mother we will not think of such a thing as that harry said father was just saying that hes so seasoned that even time cannot make much of such a tough morsel and you seem as hearty as he is  aye boy peter said that be true but when old oak does come down he generally falls sudden however we wont make our first meal sad by talking of what might be  gayly during the meal they chatted over the incidents of harrys voyage to india and back it was his second trip the lad had had a much better education than most boys in his rank of life at that time the boatswain having placed him at the age of ten in charge of a schoolmaster at portsmouth when harry had reached that age peter had retired from the service and had settled down at hayling but for two years longer he had kept harry at school then he had apprenticed him to a firm of shipowners in london and one of the officers under whom peter had served had spoken to the heads of the firm so that the boy was put in a ship commanded by a kind and considerate officer and to whose charge he was specially recommended thus he had not forgotten what he had learned at school as is too often the case with lads in his position his skipper had seen that he not only kept up what he knew but that he studied for an hour or so each day such subjects as would be useful to him in his career  after breakfast the pair again went out onto the sandhills peter as usual carrying a huge telescope with him with which he was in the habit of surveying every ship as she rounded the west of the island and came running in through the channel to portsmouth most of the menofwar he knew in an instant and the others he could make a shrewd guess at generally when alone with harry he was full of talk of the sea of good advice as to the lads future bearing and of suggestions and hints as to the best course to be adopted in various emergencies but today he appeared unusually thoughtful and smoked his pipe and looked out in silence over the sea scarcely even lifting his telescope to his eye  ive been thinking harry he said at last that as you are going away again and as the old woman says you may not find us both here when you come back it is right that i should tell you a little more about yourself i once told you years ago that you were not my son and that i would give you more particulars some day  the lad looked anxiously up at the old sailor it was a matter which he had often thought over in his mind for although he loved the honest tar and his good wife as much as he could have done his natural parents still since he had known that he was their adopted son only he had naturally wondered much as to who his parents were and what was their condition in life  i thought it as well the old sailor began not to tell you this here yarn until you were getting on boys heads get upset with a little breeze especially if they have no ballast and though it isnt likely now that you will ever get any clew as to your birth and it will make no difference whether it was a duke or a ships caulker who was your father still its right that you should know the facts as no one can say when they start on a voyage in life what craft they may fall aboard before theyve done it may be harry that as you intends to stick to the merchant servicesaving of course that little time you mean to serve on board a kings shipyou may rise to be a skipper and perhaps an owner it may be boy that as a skipper you may fall in love with some taut craft sailing in your convoy ive seen such things before now and then the fact that you might be for aught you know the son of a marquis instead of being that of a boatswain might score in your favor women have curious notions and though for my part i cant see that it makes much difference where the keel of a craft was laid as long as its sound and wellbuilt there are those who thinks different  well to tell you the yarn it were nigh fourteen years ago that i was boatswain aboard the alert frigate as taut a craft as ever sailed we had a smart captain and as good a crew as youd want to see we were cruising in the west indies and had for months been off and on in chase of a craft that had done much damage there she carried a black flag and her skipper was said to be the biggest villain that ever even commanded a pirate scarce a week passed but some ship was missing it mattered little to him whether she sailed under the english the french or the spanish flag all was fish to him many and many a vessel sailed laden that never reached europe sometimes a few charred timbers would be thrown up on the shore of the islands showing that the ship to which they belonged had been taken and burned before she had gone many days on her way often and often had the pirate been chased she was barkrigged which was in itself a very unusual thing with piratesindeed i never knew of one before but she had been i believe a merchantman captured by the pirate and was such a beauty that he hoisted his flag on her and handed his own schooner over to his mate somehow or other he had altered her ballast and maybe lengthened her a bit for those pirates have a rendezvous in some of the islands where they are so strong that they can if need be build a ship of their own anyhow she was the fastest ship of her class that ever was seen on those seas and though our cruisers had over and over again chased her she laughed at them and would for a whole day keep just out of reach of their bowchasers with half her sails set while the cruisers were staggering under every rag they could put on their masts then when she was tired of that game she would hoist her full canvas and leave the kings vessel behind as if she was standing still once or twice she nearly got caught by cruisers coming up in different directions but each time she managed to slip away without ever having a rope or stay started by a shot we in the alert had been on her footsteps a dozen times but had had no more luck than the rest of them and the mere name of the seamew was sufficient to put any one of us into a passion there wasnt one of the ships company from the captain down to the powdermonkey who wouldnt have cheerfully given a years pay to get alongside the seamew the alert carried thirtytwo guns and our crew was stronger than usual in a vessel of that size for there was a good deal of boat service and it was considered that at any moment yellow jack might lay a good many hands upor down as the case may be well one night we were at anchor in porto rico and the first lieutenant had strolled up with two of the middies to the top of a hill just before the sun went down he had taken a glass with him just as the night was falling a middy on our quarterdeck who was looking at the shore with a glass said to the second lieutenant who was on watch  look sir here comes mr jones with keen and hobart down that hill as if he were running a race he isnt likely to be racing the middies what can he be after  no the second lieutenant said with a smile mr jones is hardly likely to be racing the middies which indeed was true enough for the first lieutenant was as stiff as a ramroda good officer but as strict a martinet as ever i sailed under  the second lieutenant took the glasses and saw that whatever the reason might be it was as the midshipman had said the news that mr jones was coming down the hill running as if old nick was after him soon spread and there was quite an excitement on the quarterdeck as to what could be the matter  ten minutes afterwards the gig was seen coming off to the ship and it was evident by the way the spray was flying and the oars bending that the men were pulling as if for life or death by this time the news had spread through the ship and the captain himself was on the quarterdeck  give me the speakingtrumpet he said and as the boat came within call he shouted whats the matter mr jones is anything wrong  ive sighted the lieutenant said standing up and making a trumpet with his two hands two craft together round the point of the island some fifteen miles at sea theyre low down on the sealine but by their look i think that one is the seamew and the other a merchantman she has captured  not a moment was lost the captain gave the orders sharp and quick the men who were all standing about were in a minute clustering on the yards and never was canvas got on a ship faster than it was on the alert that evening before the boat was fairly run up to the davits the anchor was at the cathead and the alerts bows were pointing seawards five minutes afterwards with every stitch of canvas set we were running out of the harbor the first lieutenant had taken the bearings pretty accurately and as there was a brisk evening breeze blowing we spun along at a famous rate by this time it was dark and we had every hope that we might come upon the pirate before she had finished transferring the cargo of her prize under her own hatches not a light was shown and as the moon was not up we hoped to get within gunshot before being seen as the pirate seeing no craft within sight before the sun went down would not suspect that the alert could be on his traces we had to sail close to the wind till we were round the point of the island and then to run nearly before it towards the spot where the vessels had been seen in two hours from the time of starting we reckoned that we must be getting close to them if they still remained hoveto  all of a sudden some two miles ahead a point or two off the starboard bow a great flame shot up every moment it grew and grew until we could see a large ship in flames while another lay about a quarter of a mile distant three or four boats were pulling from the ship in flames towards the other and as this was a bark we had no doubt that we had caught the seamew at her villainous work the pirate was lying between us and the burning merchantman so that while her spars stood out clear and distinct against the glare of light we must have been invisible to her the word was passed quickly forward for the men to go to quarters every gun was doubleshotted and run out and then all being ready for the fight the men stripped to their waists cutlasses and boardingpikes ready to hand we waited with breathless anxiety we were already within range of our bowchasers and as yet there was no sign that the pirate was conscious of our presence the boats were now near him and no doubt those on board were looking rather in their direction than to windward rapidly the alert tore through the water the sail trimmers were all ready to take in her light canvas at a moments notice the officers clustered on the quarterdeck and the men stood by their guns with every eye strained at the pirate nearer and nearer we came and our hopes rose higher and higher we were within a mile now when suddenly a great movement was seen on board the pirate the breeze was steady and the sea quiet and loud words of command could be heard shouted as a swarm of men ran up the rattlins it was clear we were seen there was no further need of concealment and the captain gave word for the bowchasers to open quickly as the pirate got her canvas spreadand i do think that sharp as we had been on board the alert the seamew was even quicker in getting under canvaswe were scarce a quarter of a mile from her when she got fairly under way up to this moment not a gun had spoken save the two bowchasers as the captain would not yaw her until the last moment then round she came and poured a broadside into the seamew orders had been given to fire high and every man was on his mettle the maintopmast of the seamew fell snapped at the cap the peak halyards of the mizzen were shot away and a number of holes were drilled through her sails a loud cheer broke from our men fast as the seamew was she was sufficiently crippled now to prevent her getting away and at last she was to show whether she could fight as well as run and i must say for her she did  she carried but twenty guns against our thirtytwo but they were of far heavier metal and after ten minutes the alert was as much bruised and battered as if she had been fighting a frenchman of equal size for an hour however we had not been idle and as our shot had been principally directed against the enemys rigging as our great object was to cripple her and so prevent her from getting away she was by this time a mere wreck above although her sides were scarcely touched whereas two of our ports had been knocked into one and some thirty of our men had been struck down either by shot or by splinters pouring a last broadside into her the captain ordered the alert to be brought alongside the seamew there was no need to call upon the boarders to be ready every man was prepared and as the vessels came alongside our men rushed to the assault but the crew of the seamew were as eager to board us as we were them and upon the very bulwarks a desperate combat ensued strong as we were the seamew carried fully as many hands and as they were fighting with halters round their necks its little wonder that they fought so well  ive been in a good many fights but never did i see one like that each man hacked and hewed and wielded his boardingpike as if the whole fight depended upon his single exertions gradually the men whose places were at the guns on the starboard side left their places and joined in the fight while those on the port side continued to pour a fire of grape into the enemy it was near half an hour before we got a fair footing on the pirates deck and then steadily and gradually we fought our way forward but it was another halfhour after the pirate captain and all his officers had been killed and fully half the crew cut down that the rest surrendered  on board the alert we had fully onethird of our complement killed or wounded mr jones had been shot through the head the second and third lieutenants were both badly wounded and the captain himself had had his jaw broken by a pistol fired in his face i got this scar on my cheek which spoiled my beauty for the rest of my life but as i had been over thirty years married to the old woman that made but little difference never were a crew more glorious than we were that night even the wounded felt that the victory had been cheaply purchased we had captured the scourge of these seas which had for ten years laughed at all the fastest cruisers of our navy and we felt as proud as if we had captured a french firstrate  all hands were at work next day in repairing damages i was up aloft seeing to the fitting of fresh gear to the topgallantmast when i saw something floating at sea which took my attention it seemed to me like a box and an empty one for it floated high on the water its lid seemed to be open and i thought once or twice that i saw something inside i slid down to the quarterdeck and reported what i had seen the third lieutenant who was doing duty with his arm in a sling was not disposed to take the men off their work to lower a boat but as i pointed out that the box might have belonged to the merchantman which had been burned overnight and that it might afford some clew as to the name of the ship he consented and with four hands i was soon rowing towards the box  i dont know what i had expected to see but i was never more surprised than when getting there i found that it was a trunk and that in it sitting up was a child about eighteen months old that was you harry in the bottom of the trunk were a locket with a womans likeness in it a curious indian bangle and a few other articles of jewelry how you got there we never knew but the supposition was that when the pirate was overhauling the merchantman and her true nature was ascertained some mother knowing the fate that awaited all on board had put you in an open trunk had thrown in what ornaments she had about her and had dropped the trunk overboard in hopes that it might drift away and be picked up by some passing ship it was a wild venture with a thousand to one against its success but the lord had watched over it and there you were as snug and comfortable as if you had been laying in your own cot though by the way you were squalling as loud as a litter of kittens and i expect had missed your breakfast considerably you were sitting up and it was lucky that you were backward of your age for although by your size we guessed you to be eighteen months you were still unable to walk if you had been as active as some chaps of that age you would have scrambled onto your feet and no doubt capsized your boat  well we brought you on board and there was a great talk as to what was to be done with you but as i was your discoverer i claimed you as a lawful prize and i thought you would amuse the old woman while i was at sea and perhaps be a comfort to me when i got laid up in ordinary as indeed you have been so thats all i know harry every inquiry was made but we never heard of any ship which exactly answered to the description you see beyond the fact that she was a squarerigged ship we could say but little about her the ornaments found in the box seemed to show that she had come from the east indies but of course that could not be for what would she be doing there but at any rate the person who put you into the trunk and who was no doubt your mother had been to the east indies or at least had been given those ornaments by someone who had for there was no doubt where they were turned out  well on board the alert everyone got promoted there was enough valuable property found on board the seamew to give us a handsome sum all round and it was my share of the prizemoney that enabled me to buy this little cottage and went no small way towards paying for your schooling and board as no one else claimed you and your friends could not be heard of no one disputed my right to your guardianship and so my boy here you have been cruising about the world as harry langley ever since  the old sailor was silent and harry was some time before he spoke  well dad you may not have been my real father but no one could have been a better father to me than you have and as it isnt likely now that i shall ever hit upon a clew which could lead me to discover who i am i shall continue to regard you as my real father still as you say it may perhaps in life be some advantage to me to be able to claim that i am the son of a marquis and he laughed merrily they talked the matter over for some time and then harry changed the subject  are all our friends well harry asked  all except poor tom hardy he slipped his cable six months since and his wife poor old soul is gone to some friends near winchester  whos living in the cottage  black jack has taken it  what has he moved from his old place then  no it is said that hes taken it for a frenchy who comes down off and on they say hes in the smuggling business with black jack and that he disposes of the silks and wines that are brought over in the lucy and that jack trades over in france with his friends the lieutenant at the coastguard station has his eye upon him and i believe that some day they will catch black jack as he runs his cargo but hes a slippery customer it would be a good day for hayling if they could do so for he and his crew do a lot of harm to the place they look more like men who have belonged to the seamew i was talking to you about than honest english fishermen  it is a curious thing dad that the frenchman should be coming backwards and forwards here and i wonder that the revenue people dont inquire into it  i dont suppose that they know very much about it harry he comes off and on generally arriving at night and leaving a few hours afterwards i hear about these things because everyone knows that old peter langley is not the chap to put his nose into other peoples business i dont like these goings on i must say and consider they will end badly however it is no business of ours lad we get our brandy cheap in haylingnowhere cheaper i should sayand that after all is the matter that concerns us most the winds rising fast i think were in for a gale  it was as peter said the clouds were rising fast behind the island the waves were breaking with a short sharp sound upon the beach white heads were beginning to show themselves out at sea the fishing craft were running in towards portsmouth under reefed sails the menofwar at spithead could be seen sending down their topmasts and everything betokened that it would be a nasty night  what time must you leave harry  i shall go off at three tomorrow morning shall cross the ferry and catch the coach as it goes along at eight i promised that i would be back on the following morning and i would not fail in keeping my appointment for as the captain has been so good i should be sorry that he should think that i had broken my word  in the course of the day harry went over to the village and saw many of his boy friends bill simpkins however his great chum happened to be away but his parents said that he would be back at nine in the evening he had gone over to winchester to see a brother who was in a regiment quartered there accordingly soon after nine oclock harry said to his father that he would just walk over to have a chat with his friend and be back in an hour or so  thou had best stop at home and go to bed at once jane langley said if thou hast to start at three oclock it were time thou wert in bed now  i am accustomed to short nights harry said laughing and i shall be able to sleep long tomorrow  putting on his hat he nodded to the old couple and went off at a run into the darkness  the road was a wide one and but little frequented and the grass grew thick over a considerable portion of the sides therefore as he ran along with a light springy tread the sound of his footsteps was deadened as he came along by the cottage of which he had been speaking to peter langley he heard the sound of voices within being curious to see what this mysterious frenchman was like harry paused lightly lifted the latch of the gate and entered the little garden he had intended to peep in at the window and having satisfied his curiosity to be off but just as he reached the door the latter opened suddenly and harry had only time to draw back behind the little porch before two men came out in one harry recognized by his voice the smuggler black jack the other was by his halting english evidently the foreigner they stopped for a moment looking out into the night  i tell you the smuggler said its going to be a storm and no mistake the lucy is a tight craft and has weathered gales when many a bigger ship has gone down still i dont like running out into it without necessity  necezity said the frenchman i sould have sought zat ze earning of five hundred pounds was as urgent a necezity as was wanted  aye the money will be handy enough the smuggler said though one does put ones head into the noose to earn it however the sum is bigger than usual and as you say the affair is important  bah the frenchman said what does it matter about ze nooze it hasnt got over your zick neck or my zin one and till it does we neednt trouble about it i tell you zis is ze most important dispatch we have ever sent and if it gets safe to hand zey cannot grudge us double pay i have ridden from london wizout stopping and have killed a horse worth fifty of your guineas however zat matters not zis letter should fetch us ze money to pay for a dozen horses and a dozen of your lucys  all right the smuggler said in an hour we will be off letters like that in your pocket are best not kept on hand you are sure that the chasse marée will put out to meet us in such weather as we are likely to have  she will put out if a hurricanes blowing the frenchman said zey know ze importance of ze news which is expected and which i am bringing zem mon dieu what sums have been paid to get ze news zats in zis little dispatch  do you know what it is the smuggler said  not for certain the frenchman replied but i believe it is ze orders zat are to be sent to ze british fleet and zat zey are about to strike a great blow zomewhere  well the smuggler said i will go round and tell the boys i warned them to be in readiness and i will send them straight down to the beach in a quarter of an hour i will return for you  while this conversation had been going on harry had been standing against the porch the sides of which were filled with latticework over which a creeper grew he had been frightened at the importance of the secret that he was hearing and had been rapidly meditating in his mind how this allportant information which was about to be conveyed to the enemy could be stopped he had made up his mind that the instant the smuggler moved out he would make his way down to the village tell the tale to half a dozen men and have the frenchman seized he saw at once that it would be difficult for the smuggler and his gang were not men to be attacked with impunity and the fishers of the village would hesitate in taking part in such a struggle merely on the information of a boy however harry saw that it was the only chance  in his anxiety to stand close to the lattice and so hide himself from the view of the two men who were standing on the little gardenpath in front he pressed too hard against it the woodwork was rotten with age and suddenly with a crash it gave way  with an oath the smuggler turned round and he and the frenchman dashed to the spot and in an instant had collared the lad in a moment he was dragged into the room  we must cut his throat mounseer the smuggler said with a terrible imprecation the scoundrel has heard what weve said and our lives wont be worth a minutes purchase if he were to be let free stand by and ill knock out his brains and he seized a heavy poker from the side of the hearth  no no the frenchman said dont let us have blood zere might be inquiries and zese sings will sometimes be found better take him to sea wis you in ze lucy and hand him over to ze chasse marée zey will take care zat he does not come back again  i will take care myself the smuggler said im not going to risk my neck on the chance of his blabbing its better as you say to have no blood but as soon as the lucys at sea overboard he goes  we can talk of it the frenchman said im wis you zat he must be silenced but it may be bettermy plan zan yours zis boy belongs i suppose to ze village  yes the smuggler said i know him by sight hes the son of an old manofwars man who lives half a mile away  well you see some of your men might some day if they quarreled wis you or in zeir drink drop some words which might lead to inquiries better put him on board ze chasse marée i will see ze matter is settled  harry had spoken no word from the time he was grasped he felt in an instant that his life was forfeited and was surprised that he had not been instantly killed he had not raised his voice to hallo for he knew that no cottagers were near and was sure that an attempt to give the alarm would insure his instant death to struggle would have been useless he was unarmed and although a stout lad was but a child in the grasp of a powerful man like the smuggler he saw too that on the instant the frenchman had drawn a dagger from his breast and though more quiet than the smuggler he felt by the tone of his voice that he was as determined as his colleague that his silence should be secured by death  in another minute he was bound and thrown into a corner the frenchman then took his seat near him assuring him in a low tone that he would at his first movement plant his dagger in his heart the smuggler strolled off to summon his crew and for a quarter of an hour silence reigned in the cottage  you are one fool the frenchman said at last as if he had been thinking the matter overone meddlesome fool why you want to listen at peoples doors and learn zeir secrets i dont want to kill you but what are we to do you make us kill you you push your own head into ze trap zat is ze way wis boys zey are forever meddling in affairs zat concern zem not and zen we have ze trouble to kill zem i would give a hundred pounds if zis had not happened but what can i do it is my life against yours and alzough i am sorry to have to do itparbleu my life is of much more value zan zat of a fishing boy bah you are one meddlesome fool  so exasperated was the frenchman at the trouble which the prying of this lad had brought upon him that he got up and angrily gave him a kick a few minutes later the smuggler returned  the men have all gone down to the boat he said briefly come along mounseer bring that tin case with you and those pistols  zere is no fear zat i forget ze tin case the frenchman said as to ze pistolszey are not of much use however i will take zem and he thrust them into the pockets of his coat  the smuggler stooped picked up harry threw him onto a sail which he had laid on the ground wrapped this round him and then cast him over his shoulder  im not likely to meet anyone on my way to the boat he said but should i do so im taking the mainsail of the lucy down to her  in another minute harry heard the door slam and then he felt himself being carried steadily along his weight being as nothing to the smuggler not a word was spoken between the two men on their way down to the shore presently harry felt by the deadened sound of the footsteps and by the more uneven motion that he was being carried over the sandy slopes down to the edge of the sea and through the canvas he could hear the loud roar of the waves which were now breaking violently  presently he was flung roughly down on the sands a minute later he was lifted by the head and feet and swung into a boat not a word was spoken as it was shoved off through the breakers and after ten minutes hard rowing he felt a shock and knew that they were alongside of the lucy he was hauled up on deck he heard a few words of command and then felt the vessel was on her way a minute or two later the covering was unloosed his cords were cut and the smuggler said to him you cant get away now and may as well make yourself handy for the present give a haul on that rope  the lucy was in fact shorthanded two of the six men who composed her crew being absent she was a lugger of some twentyfive tons burden built something like an ordinary fishingboat but longer and lower and was in fact used for fishing when her crew were not engaged upon other adventures she was a remarkably fast craft and had more than once showed her heels with success when chased by the revenue cutters she owed her immunity from capture however chiefly to her appearance as from her size and build she generally passed unsuspected as an innocent fisherman  the storm increased in violence and the little lugger although a good seaboat had difficulty in making her way almost in the teeth of the gale she was bound harry gained from a word or two dropped by the captain for the mouth of the loire off which she was to be met by the chasse marée long before morning the coast of england was out of sight and the lugger was struggling down channel bravely holding her way in the souwesterly gale  will she be zere true to her time the frenchman asked the smuggler  aye she will do it black jack said if the wind holds as at present two oclock in the morning is the time named and if your people are as punctual as i shall be the five hundred pounds will be gained theres one thingin such a gale as is blowing today none of our cruisers who may be off the coast are likely to trouble themselves about a boat like ours they may wonder what we are doing at sea but are scarcely likely to chase us  once or twice in the course of the day large vessels were seen in the distance which harry knew by the cut of their sails to be english cruisers all were however lyingto under the smallest canvas and harry knew that any assistance from them was out of the question towards evening the gale moderated but the sea was still very high during the day harry had turned over in his mind every possible plan by which he might destroy the tin case which contained as he knew such important documents from what he had gathered he learned that the success of some great undertaking upon which the british fleet were about to embark would be marred if these papers were to find their way into the hands of the french authorities his own life he regarded as absolutely forfeited for he was sure that no sooner was he fairly on board the french chasse marée than he would at the orders of the french spy be thrown overboard and that his life had been so preserved not from any feeling of mercy but in order that his death might be accomplished with less risk to those whose safety demanded it  he was determined if opportunity presented to seize the little case and to leap overboard with it the french spy never for one moment put it down it was a small tin case with a handle at the top and some eight inches long by three inches wide and the same deep sometimes the frenchman put it in his pocket beyond which it projected but even then he took the precaution always to keep his hand upon it during the day harry was constantly employed in work on board the lugger hauling at ropes and acting as if he were one of the regular crew he had shared in the meals with the men but beyond a curse now and then not a word had been addressed to him by any on board the night came on the wind was still going down but the sea was very heavy from the occasional rifts in the clouds the stars could be seen shining brightly and once or twice the moon broke through and spread a light over the angry sea as time went on the smuggler became anxious and kept a keen lookout ahead  it is past two he exclaimed presently to the frenchman and we are nearly off the mouth of the river when the moon shone out just now i thought i caught sight of a vessel coming out and i believe to windward an english cruiser is lying however i will get ready the lanterns  the next time the moon came out a vessel was clearly seen the smuggler raised the lantern above the bulwarks held it there for half a minute and then lowered it this he repeated three times a moment later a similar signal was made on the bows of the vessel  thats her the smuggler exclaimed exultingly and the five hundred pounds is as good as in my pocket  as he spoke a bright flash was seen to windward  confound it the smuggler said that cruiser has caught sight of the frenchman however we shall be on board in plenty of time and whether she gets safe to shore or not matters not much to me i shall have done my part of the work and you mounseer will give me the order for payment on london  its done my friend the frenchman said youve done your work well heres the order  by this time the french craft was within a distance of a quarter of a mile running down at a great pace under her reefed sails  itll be no easy matter to get on board the smuggler said for the sea is running tremendously they will have to throw a rope and you will have to catch it mounseer and jump overboard i suppose your dispatchbox is watertight  and the boy the frenchman asked  let them throw another rope the smuggler said and you can haul him on board too it wont make much matter whether i slip the noose round his body or his neck the last will be the easiest plan perhaps for then if he happens not to be alive when you pull him out it would be an accident and even if anyone chooses to peach they cant swear that it was purposely done  harry was standing near and heard the words he was close to the helm at the time and watched with intense anxiety as the chasse marée ran rapidly down to them it was clear that what had to be done must be done quickly for another flash came up from the cruiser and although in the din of the wind and the toss of the waves it could not be seen where her shot had fallen the brightness of the flash showed that she had come up since the last shot was discharged the chasse marée ran down and as she came her captain stood upon the bulwarks and shouted at the top of his voice keep her steady and as i run past i will throw a rope  throw two black jack shouted there are two to come on board  the course taken by the chasse marée would bring her along at a distance of some ten yards from the side of the lugger at the moment a squall came and the luggers head turned a little towards the approaching craft when she was just upon them harry saw that his one chance of escape had come with a sudden rush he knocked the man at the helm from his footing and put the tiller up hard the lugger paid off instantly black jack with an oath turned round and sprang at harry the lad leaped beneath his uplifted hand sprang at the frenchman who was standing with his back to him and snatching the tin box from his hand leaped overboard  momentary as had been his hold upon the tiller it had been sufficient the vessel had paid off from the wind and before the helmsman could regain his feet or black jack could seize the tiller she lay across the course of the chasse marée and in another moment the french craft plunged down upon her and with a crash the lucy sank under her bows and went down with all on board  as harry sank beneath the waves he heard a shout of dismay from those on board the lucy when he came up a minute later he saw the chasse marée plowing her way from him but no sign of the lucy was to be seen harry was a good swimmer and fortunately the dispatchbox which he grasped was watertight and buttoning it within his jacket he felt that it kept his head easily above the water he swam as well as he could away from the spot where the lucy had disappeared for he knew that if black jack or the frenchman had escaped being run down and should see him his death was certainnot indeed that his chances were in any case good but with the natural hopefulness of boyhood he clung to life and resolved to make a fight for it as long as possible had it not been for the dispatchbox he must have speedily succumbed for in so heavy a sea it was difficult in the extreme to swim however after a short time he turned his back to the wind and suffered himself quietly to drift  hour passed after hour and at last to his intense delight morning began to break he saw on his right the low shores of the french coast and looking round beheld seaward the british cruiser which had fired at the chasse marée she was running quietly along the coast and was evidently on guard at the mouth of the river the sea had now gone down much and the sun rose bright in an almost cloudless sky  invigorated by the sight of the vessel harry at once swam towards her she was farther out by a mile than the spot where he was swimming and was some two miles astern of him she was sailing but slowly and he hoped that by the time she came along he would be able to get within a distance whence he might be seen his fear was that she might run back before she reached the spot where she would be nearer to him  with all his strength he swam steadily out keeping his eye fixed steadily on the ship still she came onward and was within half a mile when she was abreast of him then raising himself as high as he could from the water he shouted at the top of his voice again and again he splashed with his hands to make as much spray and commotion as possible in order to attract attention his heart almost stood still with joy as he heard an answering hail and a moment later he saw the vessel come round into the wind and lay there with her sails back then a boat was lowered and five minutes later he was hauled in his senses almost leaving him now that the time for exertion had passed it was not until he had been lifted onto the deck of the viper and brandy had been poured down his throat that he was able to speak as soon as he was sufficiently recovered he was sent for to the captains cabin  and who are you boy and whence do you come the captain asked do you belong to the chasse marée which we chased in the night  the officer spoke in french supposing that harry had fallen overboard from that craft  i am english sir harry said and escaped from a lugger which was run down by the french craft just as you were firing at her  i thought exclaimed the captain that my eyes had not been wrong i was sure that i saw a small fishingboat close to the chasse marée we lost sight of her when a cloud came over the moon and thought we must have been mistaken how came you there in an english fishingboat  harry modestly told the story and produced the dispatchbox  this is important news indeed the officer said and your conduct has been in every way most gallant what is your name lad  harry langley he replied i am an apprentice on board the indiaman dundas castle and was to have sailed this week in the convoy for the west indies  you will not be able to do that now the captain said this is most important however the steward will take charge of you and i will talk to you again presently  the steward was called and was told to put harry into a cot slung for him and to give him a bowl of warm soup and in a few minutes the lad was asleep  the viper shortly afterwards hauled her wind and ran down to a consort who was keeping watch with her over the mouth of the loire the captain repaired on board the other ship whose commander was his senior officer and a consultation was held between them after which the viper was again got under sail and shaped her course for portsmouth  the wind was fair and the next morning the viper passed through the needles and soon afterwards anchored at spithead here a large number of menofwar and frigates were at anchor and above two of the largest floated the flags of admirals the viper had made her signal as she came in sight of the fleet and a reply was instantly run up from the masthead of the admirals ship directing the captain to come on board immediately the anchor was dropped the moment this was done the captains gig was lowered and calling to harry to follow him the captain took his seat in the sternsheets and rowed for the admirals ship directing the lad to remain on deck the captain at once entered the admirals cabin and a few minutes later the admirals orderly summoned harry to enter  admiral sir hyde parker had evidently had a breakfast party for a number of naval officers including admiral nelson and most of the captains of the menofwar were seated round the table the admiral turned to harry  so you are the lad who has brought this box of dispatches  yes sir harry said modestly  tell us your story over again the admiral said its a strange one  harry again repeated the account of his adventures from the time of leaving his fathers cottage when he had done admiral nelson exclaimed  very well my lad you could not have acted with more presence of mind had you been a captain of the fleet you showed great bravery and did your duty nobly  there wasnt much bravery sir harry said modestly for i knew that they were going to kill me anyhow so that it made no difference but i was determined if possible that the dispatches should be destroyed  the admiral smiled he was not accustomed to hear his dicta even so slightly questioned by a lad  you are an apprentice in the merchant service captain skinner tells me sir hyde parker said and have been two years at sea  yes sir harry said  would you like to be on the quarterdeck of one of his majestys vessels instead of that of a merchantman  harrys eyes glistened at the question  i should indeed sir he said  then you shall be my boy the admiral answered have any of you gentlemen a vacancy in the midshipmens berth if not ill have him ranked as a supernumerary on board my ship  i am short of a midshipman sir hyde one of the captains said poor little de lisle fell overboard the night before last as we came round from plymouth he was about the size of this lad and ill arrange for him to have his togs i like his look and i should be glad to have him with me i am sure he will be a credit to the service  thats settled then the admiral said you are now sir he said turning to harry again an officer in his majestys service and as captain ball remarks i am sure you will do credit to the service a lad who does his duty when death is staring him in the face and without a hope that the act of devotion will ever be known or recognized is sure to make a brave and worthy officer  harrys new captain wrote a few words on a piece of paper and said to the admirals servant will you tell the midshipman of my gig to come here  a minute afterwards the midshipman entered the captain gave him the slip of paper and said take this young gentleman on board the ship with you at once and present him to mr francis and with him give this note he will be your shipmate in future see that hes made comfortable  the midshipman then beckoned to harry to follow him gazing askance and with no slight astonishment in his face at the appearance of his new messmate harrys attire indeed was not in accordance with the received ideas of that of a midshipman freshly joining a ship his clothes were all so much shrunk that his ankles showed below his trousers and his wrists below his coatsleeves without a word the midshipman took his place in the sternsheets and beckoned harry to sit beside him  where have you sprung from he said shortly  i hail last from the admirals cabin harry said with a laugh before that from his majestys ship viper and before that from the sea  you look like the sea said the midshipman but what have you been doing have you served before  not in a kings ship harry said i have only just been appointed  the midshipman was too surprised at harrys appearance to question him further he felt that there was some mystery in the affair and that it would be better for him to wait until he saw the footing upon which harry was placed he had little doubt from the fact of his appointment being made under such circumstances that there must be something at once singular and noteworthy about it  upon reaching the ship harrys new messmate at once led him up to the first lieutenant and presented the captains note the lieutenant opened it and glanced at the contents they were brief  harry langley has been appointed midshipman on board the cæsar and has been promoted by sir hyde parker himself he has performed a most gallant action and one of the greatest importance make him at home at once and let him have poor de lisles kit i will arrange about it  the senior midshipman was at once sent for by mr francis and harry handed over to him the first lieutenant intimated to him briefly the contents of the captains letter telling the midshipman to make him as comfortable as possible  harry was led below to the cockpit where his arrival was greeted with a storm of questions as his appearance on the quarterdeck had naturally excited a great deal of observation the midshipman who had come with him could of course furnish no information and beyond the brief fact mentioned by the captain and repeated by the first lieutenant his new conductor could say no more  just wait the midshipman said till hes got into his new clothes and looks presentable hes in my charge and i am to make him comfortable as he has been put on the quarterdeck by sir hyde himself you may be sure he has done something out of the way  in a few minutes harry was rigged out in full midshipmans dress and being a very goodlooking and gentlemanly lad his appearance favorably impressed his new messmates who had at first been disposed to resent the intrusion among themselves of a youngster whose appearance was at least the reverse of reputable  now said one of the passed mates this meeting will resolve itself into a committee let everyone who can sit down and let those who cant stand quiet i am the president of the court now prisoner at the bar he said what is your name  harry langley  and how came you here  i was brought in the captains gig  no equivocation prisoner i mean what brought you onto the quarterdeck  i had the good luck harry said to prevent a very important dispatch falling into the hands of the french  the deuce you had the president said and how was that that is to say he said if theres no secret about it  none at all harry said the matter was very simple and for the second time that morning he told the story  when he had done there was a general exclamation of approval among those present and the midshipmen crowded round him shaking his hand patting him on the back and declaring that he was a trump  the prisoner is acquitted the president said and is received as a worthy member of this noble body boy  yes sir  go to the purser and ask him to send in two bottles of rum for this honorable mess to drink the health of a new comrade  presently the boy returned  the purser says sir who is going to pay for the rum  there was a roar of laughter among the middies for the masters mate who had acted as president was notoriously in the pursers books to the full amount of his credit however a midshipman who happened that morning to have received a remittance undertook to stand the liquor to the mess and harrys health was drunk with all honors  i suppose one of the midshipmen said that the contents of the dispatch were with reference to the point to which we are all bound i wonder where it can be  here an animated discussion arose as to the various points against which the attack of the fleet now rapidly assembling at spithead might be directed so far no whisper of its probable course had been made public and it was believed indeed that even the captains of the fleet were ignorant of its object  upon the following day harry at once obtained leave to go on shore for twentyfour hours immediately he reached the head he chartered a wherry and was on the point of sailing when he heard a wellknown voice among a group of sailors standing near him  i cant make head or tail of it peter langley said my boy left me merely to go down to the village and was to have returned the first thing in the morning to join his ship in london well he never came back no more what he did with himself unless he sailed in a smuggling lugger which put out an hour or two afterwards i cant make out the boy would never have shipped in that craft willingly and i can see no reason why he should have gone otherwise he didnt cross the ferry and i cant help suspecting there was some foul play when black jack returns i will have it out of him if i kill him for it he has a strong party there and i want half a dozen good tight hands to come with me to hayling he will probably be back in a couple of days and if we tackle him directly he lands we may find out something about him who will go with me  half a dozen voices exclaimed that they were willing to assist their old mate when suddenly harry stepped in among them saying theres no occasion for that i can tell them all about him  peter langley stepped backwards in his astonishment and stared openmouthed at harry  dash my buttons he exclaimed why if it isnt harry himself and in a midshipmans rig what means this my boy  it means father that i am a midshipman on board his majestys ship cæsar  peter stood for a moment as one stupefied with astonishment and then threw his tarpaulin high in the air with a shout of delight it fell into the water and the tide carried it away peter gave it no further thought but seizing harrys hand wrung it with enthusiastic delight  this is news indeed my boy he said to think of seeing you on the quarterdeck and that so soon  it was some minutes before harry could shake himself free from his friends all of whom were old chums of the boatswain and had known him in his childhood drawing peter aside at last he took him to a quiet hotel and there to the intense astonishment of the veteran he related to him the circumstances which had led to his elevation the old sailor was alternately filled with wrath and admiration and it was only the consideration that beyond doubt black jack and the frenchman had both perished in the lucy that restrained him from instantly rushing off to take vengeance upon them  an hour later the pair took a wherry and sailed to hayling where the joy of peter was rivaled by that of harrys fostermother that evening peter went out and so copiously ordered grog for all the seafaring population in honor of the event that the village was a scene of rejoicing and festivity such as was unknown in its quiet annals  the next day harry rejoined his ship and commenced his regular duties as a midshipman on board  a week later the whole of the ships destined to take part in it had arrived the blue peter was hoisted at the ships head and on a gun firing from the admirals ship the anchors were weighed and the fleet soon left spithead behind them it consisted of eighteen sail of the line with a number of frigates and gunboats the expedition was commanded by sir hyde parker with admiral nelson second in command contrary to the general expedition they sailed eastward instead of passing through the solent and coasting along the south of england passed through the straits of dover and stood out into the north sea  harry had had an interview with his captain four days after he had joined the latter told him that the dispatchbox which he had taken had been sent up to london and that its contents proved to be of the highest importance and that the lords of the admiralty had themselves written to the admiral expressing their extreme satisfaction at the capture saying that the whole of their plans would have been disconcerted had the papers fallen into the hands of the enemy they were pleased to express their strong approval of the conduct of harry langley and gave their assurance that when the time came his claim for promotion should not be ignored  so my lad the captain said you may be sure that when you have passed your cadetship you will get your epaulette without loss of time and if you are steady and well conducted you may look out for a brilliant position it is not many lads who enter the navy under such favorable conditions i should advise you to study hard in order to fit yourself for command when the time should come from what you tell me your education has not been neglected and i have no doubt you know as much as the majority of my midshipmen as to books but books are not all an officer in his majestys service should be a gentleman that you are that in manner i am happy to see but it is desirable also that an officer should be able in all society to hold his own in point of general knowledge with other gentlemen midshipmen as a class are too much given to shirking their studies and to think that if an officer can handle and fight a ship it is all that is required it may be all that is absolutely necessary but you will find that the men who have most made their mark are all something more than rough sailors i need say nothing to you as to the necessity of at all times and hazards doing your duty that is a lesson that you have clearly already learned  as the fleet still kept east expectation rose higher and higher as to the object of the expedition some supposed that a dash was to be made on holland others conceived that the object of the expedition must be one of the north german or russian forts and the latter were confirmed in their ideas when one fine morning the fleet were found to be entering the sound instead of passing through however the fleet anchored here out of gunshot of the forts of copenhagen and great was the astonishment of the officers and men alike of the fleet when it became known that an ultimatum had been sent on shore and that the danes who had been regarded as a neutral power were called upon at once to surrender their fleet to the english  upon the face of facts known to the world at large this was indeed a most monstrous breach of justice and right the danes had taken no part in the great struggle which had been going on and their sympathies were generally supposed to be with the english rather than the french thus for a fleet to appear before the capital of denmark and to summon its king to surrender his fleet appeared a highhanded act of brute force  in fact however the english government had learned that negotiations had been proceeding between the danish government and the french and that a great scheme had been agreed upon by which the danes should join the french at a given moment and the united fleets being augmented by ships of other powers a sudden attack would be made upon england had this secret confederation not been interfered with the position of england would have been seriously threatened the fleet which the allies would have been able to put onto the scene would have greatly exceeded that which england could have mustered to defend her coast and although peace nominally prevailed between england and denmark the english ministry considered itself justifiedand posterity has agreed in the verdictin taking time by the forelock and striking a blow before their seeming ally had time to throw off the mask and to join in the projected attack upon them  it was the news of this secret resolve on the part of the cabinet that having in some way been obtained by a heavy bribe from a subordinate in the admiralty was being carried over in cipher to france in the lucy and had it reached its destination the danes would have been warned in time and the enterprise undertaken by parker and nelson would have been impossible for the forts of copenhagen aided by the fleet in the harbor were too strong to have been attacked had they been thoroughly prepared for the strife as all these matters were unknown to the officers of the fleet great was the astonishment when the captains of the ships assembled in the admirals cabin and each received orders as to the position which his vessel was to take up and the part it was to bear in the contest this being settled the captains returned to their respective ships  several days were spent in negotiations but as the danes finally refused compliance with the english demands the longlookedfor signal was hoisted and the fleet stood in through the sound it was a fine sight as the leading squadron consisting of twelve lineofbattle ships and a number of frigates under admiral nelson steered on through the sound followed at a short distance by sir hyde parker with the rest of the fleet the danish forts on the sound cannonaded them but their fire was very ineffectual and the fleet without replying steered on until they had attained the position intended for them the danes were prepared for action their fleet of thirteen menofwar and a number of frigates supported by floating batteries mounting seventy heavy guns was moored in a line four miles long in front of the town and was further supported by the forts on shore  this great force was to be engaged by the squadron of admiral nelson alone as that of sir hyde parker remained outside menacing the formidable crown batteries and preventing these from adding their fire to that of the fleet and other shore batteries upon nelsons squadron  the cæsar the leading ship of the fleet had been directed to sail right past the line of ships and to operate against a detached fort standing on a spit of land on the right flank of the danish position this fort mounted many guns much superior to those of the cæsar in weight but the crew were in high spirits at the prospect of a fight little as they understood the cause for which they were engaged stripping to the waist they clustered round the guns each officer at his post harry with two other midshipmen being upon the quarterdeck near the captain to carry orders from him as might be required to different parts of the ship as the cæsar passed along the line of ships to take up her position she was saluted by a storm of fire from the danish vessels to which she made no reply she suffered however but little injury although shot and shell whistled between the masts and struck the water on all sides of her several striking the hull with a dull crashing sound while her sails were pierced with holes harry felt that he was rather pale and was disgusted with himself at the feeling of discomfort which he experienced but there is nothing that tries the nerves more than standing the fire of an enemy before it is time to set to work to reply as soon as orders were given for the cæsars fire to be opened directly the guns could be brought to bear and the roar of her cannon answered those of the fort the feeling of uneasiness on harrys part disappeared and was succeeded by that of the excitement of battle the din was prodigious along the whole line the british fleet was engaged and the boom of the heavy guns of the ships forts and batteries and the rattle of musketry from the tops of the ships kept up a deep roar like that of incessant thunder  the water is very shallow sir the first lieutenant reported to the captain there are but two fathoms under her foot the wind too is dropping so much that we have scarcely steerageway and the current is sweeping us along fast  prepare to anchor mr francis the captain said  he had scarcely spoken however when there was a slight shivering sensation in the ship and it was known by all on board that she was aground and that on a falling tide while the starboard guns were kept at work the men were called off from those of the port side boats were lowered and hawsers were got out and every effort was made to tow the ship off the shoal the sailors pulled hard in spite of the storm of shot and shell which fell round them from the fort and the nearest danish ships but the cæsar was fast calling the men on board again the captain requested the first lieutenant to go aloft and see what was going on in other parts of the line he returned with the news that four or five other ships were plainly aground and that things appeared to be going badly in the meantime the cæsar was suffering heavily the fire of the fort was well directed and the gunners working their pieces under comparative shelter were able to pour their fire steadily into the cæsar while a floating battery and two frigates also kept up an incessant fire  the number of killed and wounded was already large but as only the guns of the starboard side could be worked the fire was kept up with unabated zeal and the fort bore many signs of the accuracy of the fire the parapet was in many places shot away and several of the guns put out of action but the cæsar was clearly overmatched and the captain hastily wrote a note to the admiral stating that the ship was aground and was altogether overmatched and begging that another vessel might be dispatched to his aid if one could be spared in order to partially relieve her of the enemys fire  here mr langley take the gig and row off to the flagship instantly  harry obeyed orders through the storm of shot and shell which was flying striking up the water in all directions he made his way to the admirals ship which was lying nearly a mile away  admiral nelson opened the note and read it through  tell captain ball he said that i havent a ship to spare several are aground and all hard pressed he must do the best he can ah you are the lad whom i saw in sir hyde parkers cabin are you not  yes sir  the admiral nodded in token of approval and harry prepared to leave suddenly a thought struck him and running into the captains cabin he asked the steward for a small tablecloth  what on earth dyou want it for he exclaimed  never mind give it me at once  seizing the tablecloth he ran down into the boat as they returned towards the cæsar they could see how hardly matters were going with her one of her masts was down her sides were battered and torn and several of her portholes were knocked into one still her fire continued unabated but it was clear that she could not much longer resist  do you think she must haul down her flag harry said to the coxswain of the boat  aye aye sir the coxswain said wood and iron cant stand such a pounding as that much longer most captains would have hauled down the flag long before this and even our skipper cant stand out much longer there wont be a man alive to fight her  will you do as i order harry said  aye sir the coxswain said in surprise i will do what you like for the story of the conduct by which harry had gained his midshipmans promotion had been repeated through the ship and the men were all proud of the lad who had behaved so pluckily  at least harry said it may do good and it cant do harm wheres the boathook fasten this tablecloth to it and pull for the fort  the coxswain gave an exclamation of surprise but did as harry told him and with the white flag flying the boat pulled straight towards the fort as he was seen to do so the fire of the latter which had been directed towards the boat ceased although the duel between the battery and the cæsar continued with unabated vigor harry steered direct to the steps on the sea face and mounted to the interior of the fort where on saying that he brought a message from the captain he was at once conducted to the commandant  i am come sir harry said from the captain to beg of you to surrender at once your guns have been nobly fought but two more ships are coming down to engage with you and the captain would fain save further effusion of life you have done all that brave men could do but the fight everywhere goes against you and further resistance is vain in a quarter of an hour a fire will be centered upon your guns that will mean annihilation and the captain therefore begs you to spare the brave men under your orders from further sacrifice  taken by surprise by this sudden demand which was fortunately at the moment backed up by two ships of the squadron which had hitherto taken no part in the action being seen sailing in the governor after a hasty consultation with his officers resolved to surrender and two minutes afterwards the danish flag was hauled down in the fort and the white flag run up one of the danish officers was directed to return with harry to the ship to notify the captain of the surrender of the fort  the astonishment of captain ball at seeing the course of his boat suddenly altered a white flag hoisted and the gig proceeding direct to the fort had been extreme and he could only suppose that harry had received some orders direct from the admiral and that a general cessation of hostilities was ordered his surprise became astonishment when he saw the danish flag disappear and the white flag hoisted in its place and a shout of relief and exultation echoed from stem to stern of the cæsar for all had felt that the conflict was hopeless and that in a few minutes the cæsar must strike her flag all sorts of conjectures were rife as to the sudden and unexpected surrender of the fort and expectation was at its highest when the gig was seen rowing out again with a danish officer by the side of the midshipman  on reaching the ships side harry ascended the ladder with the danish officer and advancing to captain ball said  this officer sir has in compliance with the summons which i took to the commander of the fort in your name come off to surrender  the danish officer advanced and handed his sword to the captain saying  in the name of the commander of the fort i surrender  the captain handed him back his sword and ordering harry to follow him at once entered his cabin his astonishment was unbounded when the latter informed him what he had done with many apologies for having taken the matter into his own hands  i saw he said that the cæsar was being knocked to pieces and the coxswain told me that it was impossible she could much longer resist i therefore thought that i could do no harm by calling upon the governor to surrender and that it was possible that i might succeed as you see that i have  you certainly have saved the cæsar captain ball said warmly and we are all indeed indebted to you it was a piece of astounding impudence indeed for a midshipman to convey a message with which his captain had not charged him but success in the present case a thousand times condones the offense you have indeed done well young sir and i and the ships company are vastly indebted to you i will report the matter to the admiral  a hundred men speedily took their places in the boats lieutenant francis was sent ashore to take possession and a few minutes later the british flag was flying upon the fort  ordering harry to accompany him captain ball at once took his place in his gig and rowed to the flagship the battle was still raging and to the practiced eye there was no doubt that the english fleet was suffering very severely captain ball mounted the quarterdeck and saluting the admiral reported that the fort with which he was engaged had struck but that the cæsar being aground was unable to render any assistance to the general attack  a good many of us are aground ball admiral nelson said but i congratulate you on having caused the fort to haul down its colors several of the danish menofwar have struck but we cannot take possession and fresh boatloads of men came off from shore and their fire has reopened our position is an unpleasant one sir hyde parker has signaled to me to draw off but so far i have paid no attention i fear that we shall have to haul off and leave some four or five ships to the enemy  the fact is captain ball said it wasnt i who made the fort haul down its flag but this midshipman of mine  ha said the admiral glancing at harry who at captain balls order had left the boat and was standing a short distance off how on earth did he do that  when you told him sir that you could give us no aid he took upon himself instead of returning to the ship to row straight to the fort with one of your tablecloths fastened to the boathook and summoned the commander in my name to surrender at once so as to save all further effusion of life seeing that more ships were bearing down and that he had done all that a brave man could and should now think of the lives of his troops  an impudent little rascal the admiral exclaimed midshipmen were impudent enough in my days but this boy beats everything however his idea was an excellent one and by jupiter i will adopt it myself a man should never be above learning and we are in such a sore strait that one catches at a straw  so saying the admiral calling to his own captain entered his cabin and at once indited a letter to the king of denmark begging him to surrender in order to save the blood of his subjects expressing admiration at the way in which they had fought and saying that they had done all that was possible to save honor and might now surrender with a full consciousness of having done their duty this missive was at once dispatched to shore and the admiral awaited with anxiety its result  a halfhour elapsed the firing continuing with unabated fury  by jove ball the admiral suddenly exclaimed theres the white flag and a tremendous cheer broke along the whole of the british ships as the flag of truce waved over the principal fort of copenhagen instantly the fire on both sides ceased boats passed between the shore and the flagship with the proposals for surrender and conditions nelson insisted that the danish fleet should be surrendered in so firm and decisive a tone as to convince the king that he had it in his power completely to destroy the town and had only so far desisted from motives of humanity at length to the intense relief of the admiral and his principal officers who knew how sore the strait was and to the delight of the sailors the negotiations were completed and the victory of copenhagen won  wheres that boy the admiral asked  that boy was unfortunately no longer on the quarterdeck one of the last shots fired from the danish fleet had struck him above the knee carrying away his leg he had at once been carried down to the cockpit and was attended to by the surgeons of the flagship in the excitement of an action men take but little heed of what is happening around them and the fall of the young midshipman was unnoticed by his captain now however that the battle was over captain ball looked round for his midshipman and was filled with sorrow upon hearing what had happened he hurried below to the wounded boy whose leg had already been amputated above the point at which the ball had severed it by the surgeon  the white flag has been hoisted my lad he said and copenhagen has been captured and to you more than to anyone is this great victory due i am sorry indeed that you should have been shot  harry smiled faintly  it is the fortune of war sir my career in the navy has not been a long one it is but a fortnight since i got my commission and now i am leaving it altogether  leaving the navy perhaps the captain said cheerfully but not leaving life i hope i trust theres a long one before you but admiral nelson will i am sure be as grieved as i am that the career of a young officer who promised to rise to the highest honors of his profession and be a credit and glory to his country has been cut short  a short time later the admiral himself came down and shook hands with the boy and thanked him for his services and cheered him up by telling him that he would take care that his presence of mind and courage should be known  for some days harry lay between life and death but by the time that the ship sailed into portsmouth harbor the doctors had considerable hope that he would pull round he was carried at once to the naval hospital and a few hours later peter langley was by his bedside his captain frequently came to see him and upon one occasion came while his fosterfather was sitting by his bedside  ah peter is it you he said your son told me that you had served his majesty but i didnt recognize the name as that of my old boatswain on board the cleopatra  i am glad to see your honor peter said but i wish it had been on any other occasion however i think that the lad will not slip his wind this time but hes fretting that his career on blue water is at an end  it is sad that it should be so captain ball said but there are many men who may live to a good age and will have done less for their country than this lad in the short time he was at sea first he prevented the dispatch which would have warned the enemy of what was coming from reaching them and in the second place his sharpness and readiness saved no small portion of admiral nelsons fleet and converted what threatened to be a defeat into a victory you must be proud of your son old salt  has not the boy told you sir that hes not my son the boatswain said  no indeed captain ball exclaimed surprised on the contrary he spoke of you as his father  in a few words peter langley related the circumstances of the finding of harry when a baby captain ball was silent for a while and then said do you know peter that i have been greatly struck by the resemblance of that lad to an old friend and schoolfellow of mine a mr harper they are as like as two peasthat is he is exactly what my friend was at his age my friend never was married but i remember hearing a good many years agoi should say some fifteen years ago which would be about in accordance with this lads agethat he had lost a sister at sea the ship she was in was supposed to have foundered and was never heard of again she was the wife of the captain and was taking her first voyage with him of course it may be a mere coincidence still the likeness is so strong that it would be worth while making some inquiries have you anything by which the child can be identified  there are some trinkets sir of indian workmanship for the most part and a locket i will bring them over to your honor tomorrow if you will let me  do so captain ball said i am going up to london tomorrow and shall see my friend dont speak to the boy about it for its a thousand to one against its being more than a coincidence still i hope sincerely for his sake that it may be so  the next evening captain ball went up by coach to london and the following day called upon his friend who was a rich retired eastindian director he told the story as peter had told it to him  the dates answer he said and curiously although the ship was lost in the west indies its likely enough that the ornaments of my poor sister would have been indian as i was in the habit of often sending her home things from calcutta  i have them with me captain ball said and produced the little packet which peter had given him  the old gentleman glanced at the ornaments and then taking the locket pressed the spring he gave a cry as he saw the portrait within it and exclaimed yes thats the likeness of my sister as she was when i last saw her what an extraordinary discovery where is the lad of whom you have been speaking for surely he is my nephew the son of my sister mary and jack peters  captain ball then related the story of harrys doings from the time he had known him and the old gentleman was greatly moved at the tale of bravery the very next day he went down to portsmouth with captain ball and harry to his astonishment found himself claimed as nephew by the friend of his captain  when harry was well enough to be moved he went up to london with his uncle and a fortnight later received an official letter directing him to attend at the board of admiralty  donning his midshipman uniform he proceeded thither in his uncles carriage and walked with crutchesfor his wound was not as yet sufficiently healed to allow him to wear an artificial legto the boardroom here were assembled the first lord and his colleagues admiral nelson was also present and at once greeted him kindly  a seat was placed for him and the first lord then addressed him mr peters admiral nelson has brought to our notice the clever stratagem by which on your own initiation and without instruction you obtained the surrender of the danish fort and saved the cæsar at a time when she was aground and altogether overmatched admiral nelson has also been good enough to say that it was the success which attended your action which suggested to him the course that he took which brought the battle to a happy termination thus we cannot but feel that the victory which has been won is in no small degree due to you moreover we are mindful that it was your bravery and quickness which prevented the news of the intended sailing of the fleet from reaching the continent in which case the attack could not have been carried out under such extraordinary and exceptional circumstances we feel that an extraordinary and exceptional acknowledgment is due to you we all feel very deep regret that the loss of your leg will render you unfit for active service at sea and has deprived his majesty of the loss of so meritorious and most promising a young officer we are about therefore to take a course altogether without precedent you will be continued on the fullpay list all your life you will at once be promoted to the rank of lieutenant three years hence to that of commander and again in another three years to the rank of post captain the board are glad to hear from captain ball that you are in good hands and wish you every good fortune in life  harry was so overcome with pleasure that he could only stammer a word or two of thanks and the first lord his colleagues and admiral nelson having warmly shaken hands with him he was taken back to the carriage still in a state of bewilderment at the honor which had been bestowed upon him  there is little more to tell having no other relations his uncle adopted him as his heir and the only further connection that harry had with the sea was that when he was twentyone he possessed the fastest and bestequipped yacht which sailed out of an english port later on he sat in parliament married and to the end of his life declared that after all the luckiest point in his career was the cutting off of his leg by the last shot fired by the danish batteries for that had this not happened he should never have known who he was would never have met the wife whom he dearly loved and would have passed his life as a miserable bachelor peter langley when not at sea with harry in his yacht lived in a snug cottage at southsea and had never reason to the end of his life to regret the time when he sighted the floating box from the tops of the alert     surly joe   you wonder why i am called surly joe sir no as you say i hope i dont deserve the title now but i did once and a name like that sticks to a man for life well sir the fish are not biting at present and i dont mind if i tell you how i got it  the speaker was a boatman a man some fifty years old broad and weatherbeaten he had but one arm i had been spending a months wellearned holiday at scarborough and had been making the most of it sailing or fishing every day upon my first arrival i had gone out with the onearmed boatman and as he was a cheery companion and his boat the grateful mary was the best and fastest on the strand i had stuck to him throughout the boatmen at our wateringplaces soon learn when a visitor fixes upon a particular boat and cease to importune him with offers of a sail consequently it became an understood thing after a day or two that i was private property and as soon as i was seen making my way across the wet soppy sand which is the one drawback to the pleasure of scarborough a shout would at once be raised for surly joe the name seemed a singularly inappropriate one but it was not until the very day before i was returning to town that i made any remark on the subject by this time we had become great allies for what with a bathe in the morning early a sail before lunch and a fishing expedition afterwards i had almost lived on board the grateful mary the day had been too clear and bright for fishing the curlyheaded barefooted boy who assisted joe had grown tired of watching us catch nothing and had fallen asleep in the bow of the boat and the motion as the boat rose and fell gently on the swell was so eminently provocative of sleep that i had nodded once or twice as i sat with my eyes fixed on my line then the happy idea had occurred to me to remark that i wondered why my companion was called by a nickname which seemed so singularly inappropriate joes offer to tell me how he obtained it woke me at once i refilled my pipean invariable custom i observe with smokers when they are sitting down to listen to a storypassed my pouch to joe who followed my example and when we had lighted up joe began  well sir its about twelve years ago i was a strong active chap thennot that i aint strong now for i can shove a boat over the sandbar with any man on the shorebut i aint as active as i were i warnt called surly joe then and i had my two arms like other men my nickname then was curly cause you see my hair wont lay straight on my head not when it gets as wet as seaweed i owned my own boat and the boys that worked with me warnt strangers like dick there but they were my own flesh and blood i was mighty proud of the two boys fine straight toughbuilt lads was they and as goodplucked uns as any on the shore i had lost their mother ten years maybe before that and i never thought of giving them another one of em was about twelve just the size of dick there the other was a year older full of tricks and mischief they was but good boys sir and could handle the boat nigh as well as i could there was one thing they couldnt do sirthey couldnt swim i used to tell em they ought to learn but there you see i cant swim myself and out of all the men and boys on this shore i dont suppose one in twenty on em can swim rum aint it sir all their lives in the water or on the water seeing all these visitors as comes here either swimming or learning to swim and yet they wont try they talks about instinks i dont believe in instinks else everybody whos got to pass his life on the water would learn to swim instead of being just the boys as never does learn that year sir i was doing well there was a gentleman and his wife and darter used to use my boat regular morning and afternoon theyd go out for a sail whenever it warnt too rough for the boat to put out i dont think the old gentleman and lady cared so much for it but they was just wrapped up in the girl who was a pale quiet sort o girl who had come down to the sea for her health she was wonderful fond of the sea and a deal o good it did her she warnt like the same creature after she had been here two months  it was a roughish sort of afternoon with squalls from the east but not too rough to go out they was to go out at four oclock and they came down punctual but the gentleman says when he gets down  we have just got a telegram joe to say as a friend is coming down by the fiveoclock train and we must be at the station to meet her she being an invalid but i dont want mary to lose her sail so will trust her with you  youll take great care of her joe and bring her back safe the mother says half laughing like but i could see she were a little anxious about lettin her go alone which had never happened before  ill take care of her maam i says you may take your oath ill bring her back if i comes back myself  goodby mamma the girl says as she steps on the plank dont you fidget you know you can trust joe and ill be back at halfpast six to dinner  well sir as we pushed off i felt somehow responsible like and although id told the boys before that one reef would be enough i made em put in another before i hoisted the sail there warnt many boats out for there was more sea on than most visitors care to face but once fairly outside we went along through it splendid when we got within a mile of fley i asks her if we should turn or go on for a bit farther  we shall go back as quick as weve come shant we joe  just about the same miss the winds straight on the shore  we havent been out twenty minutes she says looking at her watch id rather go a bit farther  well sir we ran till we were off the brig the wind was freshening and the gusts coming down strong it was backing round rather to the north too and the sea was getting up  i amost think miss wed better run into filey i says and you could go across by the coach  but theres no danger is there joe  no miss there aint no danger but we shall get a ducking before we get back theres rain in that squall to windward  oh i dont care a bit for rain joe and the coach wont get in till halfpast seven and mamma would be in a dreadful fright oh id so much rather go on  i did not say no more but i put her about and in another few minutes the squall was down upon us the rain came against us as if it wanted to knock holes in the boat and the wind just howled again a sharper squall i dont know as ever i was put in it was so black you couldnt have seen two boats length i eased off the sheet and put the helm up but something went wrong andi dont know rightly how it was sir ive thought it over hundreds and hundreds of times and i cant reason it out in any sort of form but the sponsibility of that young gal weighed on me i expect and i must somehow ha lost my headi dont know i cant account for it but there it was and in less time than it takes me to tell you we were all in the water whatever id ha been before i was cool enough now i threw one arm round the gal as i felt her going and with the other i caught hold of the side of the boat we was under water for a moment and then i made shift to get hold of the rudder as she floated bottom upwards the boys had stuck to her too but they couldnt get hold of the keel for you know how deep them boats are forward drawing nigh a foot of water there more than they does astern however after a bit they managed to get down tords the stern and get a hand on the keel about halfway along they couldnt come no nigher because as you know the keel of them boats only runs halfway along hould on lads i shouted hould on for your lives theyll have seen us from the cliff and ll have a lugger out here for us in no time  i said so to cheer them up but i knew in my heart that a lugger to get out with that wind on would have to run right into tother side o the bay before she could get room enough to weather the brig the girl hadnt spoken a word since the squall struck us except that she gave a little short cry as the boat went over and when we came up she got her hands on the rudder and held on there as well as she could with my help the squall did not last five minutes and when it cleared off i could look round and judge of our chances they werent good there was a party of people on the cliff and another on the brig who were making their way out as far as they could on the brig for it were about halftide they must have seen us go over as we went into the squall for as we lifted i could see over the brig and there was a man galloping on horseback along the sands tords filey as hard as he could go we were maybe a quarter of a mile off the brig and i saw that we should drift down on it before a boat could beat out of the bay and get round to us the sea was breaking on it as it always does break if theres ever so little wind from the east and the spray was flying up fifty feet in places where the waves hit the face of the rock there aint a worse place on all the coast than this running as it do nigh a mile out from the head and bare at low water the waves broke over the boat heavy and i had as much as i could do to hold on by one hand to the rudder which swung backwards and forwards with every wave as to the boys i knew they couldnt hold on if they couldnt get onto the bottom of the boat so i shouted to em to try to climb up but they couldnt do it sir theyd tried already over and over again it would ha been easy enough in calm water but with the boat rolling and such waves going over her and knocking them back again when theyd half got up it was too much for em if id ha been free i could have got em up by working round to the side opposite em and given them a hand to haul them up but as it was with only one hand free it took me all my time to hold on where i was the girl saw it too for she turned her face round to me and spoke for the first time  let me go please says she and help your boys  i cant do it said i ive got to hold you till were both drowned together  i spoke short and hard sir for if youll believe me i was actually beginning to hate that gal there was my own two boys astruggling for their lives and i couldnt lend a hand to help em because i was hampered by that whitefaced thing she saw it in my face for she gave a sort of little cry and said  oh dodo let me go  i didnt answer a word but held on all the harder presently billhe was my youngest boysang out  father cant you get round and lend us a hand to get up i cant hold on much longer  i cant help you bill says i ive given my promise to take this young woman back and i must keep my word her lifes more precious to her father than yours is to me no doubt and shes got to be saved  it was cruel of me sir and altogether unjust and i knew it was when i said it but i couldnt help it i felt as if i had a devil in me i was just mad with sorrow and hopelessness and yet each word seemed to come as cold and hard from me as if it was frozen for a moment she didnt move and then all of a sudden like she gave a twist out of my arms and went straight down i grabbed at her and just got hold of her cloak and pulled her up again she never moved after that but just lay quiet on my arm as if she was dead her head was back half in half out of the water and it was only by the tears that run down sometimes through her eyelids and by a little sob in her breast that i knew that she was sensible  presently bill says goodby father god bless you and then he let go his hold and went down five minutes afterwards maybe though it seemed a week to me jack did the same  there we wasthe girl and ialone  i think now sir looking back upon it as i was mad then i felt somehow as that the gal had drowned my two boys and the devil kept whispering to me to beat her white face in and then to go with her to the bottom i should ha done it too but my promise kept me back i had sworn she should get safe to shore if i could and it seemed to me that included the promise that i would do my best for us both to get there i was getting weak now and sometimes i seemed to wander and my thoughts got mixed up and i talked to the boys as if they could hear me once or twice my hold had slipped and i had hard work enough to get hold again i was sensible enough to know as it couldnt last much longer and talking as in my sleep i had told the boys i would be with em in a minute or two when a sound of shouting quite close roused me up sudden  then i saw we had drifted close to the brig some men had climbed along taking hold handinhand when they passed across places where the sea was already breaking over and bringing with them the rope which as i afterwards heard the man on horseback had brought back from filey it was a brave deed on their part sir for the tide was rising fast when they saw i lifted my head and could hear them they shouted that they would throw me the rope and that i must leave go of the boat which would have smashed us to pieces as i knew if she had struck the rocks with us where they were standing the rock was full six feet above the sea but a little farther it shelved down and each wave ran three feet deep across the brig they asked me could i swim and when i shook my head for i was too far gone to speak now one of em jumped in with the end of the rope he twisted it round the two of us and shouted to his friends to pull it was time for we werent much above a boats length from the brig three of the chaps as had the rope run down to the low part of the rock and pulled together while another two kept hold of the end of the rope and kept on the rock so as to prevent us all being washed across the brig together i dont remember much more about it i let go the boat sank down at once as if the girl and i had been lead felt a tug of the rope and then just as the water seemed choking me a great smash and i remember nothing else when i came to my right senses again i was in a bed at filey i had had a bad knock on the head and my right arm which had been round the girl was just splintered they took it off that night the first thing as they told me when i came round was that the gal was safe i dont know whether i was glad or sorry to hear it i was glad because i had kept my promise and brought her back alive i was sorry because i hated her like pison why should she have been saved when my two boys was drowned she was wellplucked was that gal for she had never quite lost her senses and the moment she had got warm in bed with hot blankets and suchlike she wanted to get dry clothes and to go straight on to scarborough in a carriage however the doctor would not hear of it and she wrote a little letter saying as she was all right and a man galloped off with it on horseback and got there just as they had got a carriage to the door to drive over to filey to ask if there was any news there about the boat they came over and slept there and she went back with them next day i heard all this afterwards for i was off my head what with the blow i had got and one thing and another before i had been there an hour and i raved and cussed at the girl they tell me so that they wouldnt let her father in to see me  it was nigh a fortnight before i came to myself to find my arm gone and then i was another month before i was out of bed they came over to filey when i was sensible and i hear they had got the best doctor over from scarborough to see me and paid everything for me till i was well but i wouldnt see them when they came i was quite as bitter against her as i had been when i was in the sea drowning and i was so fierce when they talked of coming in that the doctor told them it would make me bad again if they came so they went up to london and when i could get about they sent me a letter the gal herself and her father and mother thanking me i suppose but i dont know for i just tore em into pieces without reading them then a lawyer of the town here came to me and said hed struction to buy me a new boat and to buy a nuity for me i told him his nuity couldnt bring my boys back again and that i warnt going to take bloodmoney and as to the boat id knock a hole in her and sink her if she came a year after that lawyer came to me again and said hed more structions and i told him though id only one arm left i was man enough still to knock his head off his shoulders and that id do it if he came to me with his structions or anything else  by this time id settled down to work on the shore and had got the name of surly joe rightly enough too i had one of them planks with wheels that people use to get in and out of the boats and as the boatmen on the shore was all good to me being sorry for my loss and so telling my story to people as went out with them i got enough to live on comfortable only there was nothing comfortable about me i wouldnt speak a word good or bad to a soul for days together unless it was to swear at anyone as tried to talk to me i hated everyone and myself wuss nor all i was always cussing the rocks that didnt kill me and wondering how many years id got to go on at this work before my turn came fortunately id never cared for drink but sometimes id find my thoughts too hard for me and id go and drink glass after glass till i tumbled under the table  at first my old mates tried to get me round and made offers to me to take a share in their boats or to make one in a fishing voyage but i would not hear them and in time they dropped off one by one and left me to myself and for six years there wasnt a surlier wussconditioned lonelier chap not in all england than i was well sir one dayit was just at the beginning of the season but was too rough a day for sailingi was asitting down on the steps of a machine doing nothing just wondering and wondering why things was as they was when two little gals cum up one was maybe five and the other a year younger i didnt notice as theyd just cum away from the side of a lady and gentleman i never did notice nothing that didnt just concern me but i did see that they had a nurse not far off the biggest girl had great big eyes dark and soft and she looked up into my face and held out a broken wooden spade and a bit of string and says she sailorman please mend our spade i was struck all of a heap like for though i had been mighty fond of little children in the old days and was still always careful of lifting them into boats my name and my black looks had been enough and none of them had spoken to me for years i felt quite strange like when that child spoke out to me amost like what ive read robinson crusoe he as was wrecked on the island felt when he saw the mark of a foot  i goes to hold out my hand and then i draws it back and says gruff dont you see i aint got but one hand go to your nurse  i expected to see her run right off but she didnt but stood as quiet as may be with her eyes looking up into my face  nurse cant mend spade break again when nina digs nina will hold spade together sailorman tie it up strong  i didnt answer at once but i saw her lip quiver and it was plain she had been crying just before so i put my hand into my pocket and brings out a bit of string for the stuff shed got in her hand was of no account and i says in a strange sort of voice as i hardly knew as my own all right missy ill tie it  so she held the broken pieces together and i ties em up with the aid of my hand and my teeth and makes a strong shipshape job of it i did it sitting on the bottom step with a child standing on each side watching me when i had done it the eldest took it and felt it  that is nice and strong she said thank you annie say thank you  tank you she said and with a little pat on my arm as a goodby the little ones trotted away to a nurse sitting some little distance off  it may seem a little thing to you sir just a halfminutes talk to a child but it warnt a little thing to me it seemed regularly to upset me like and i sat there thinking it over and wondering what was come over me till an hour afterwards they went past me with their nurse and the little things ran up to me and said the spades quite good nowgoodby sailorman and went on again so i shook it off and went to my work for as the tide rose the wind dropped and a few boats went out and thinking what a fool i was was gruffer and surlier than ever  next morning i was lending a mate a hand painting a boat when i saw the two children coming along the sand again and i wondered to myself whether they would know me again or think any more of me and though i wanted them to do so i turned my back to the way they was coming and went on with my painting somehow i felt wonderful glad when i heard their little feet come pattering along the sand and they sang out  goodmorning sailorman  goodmorning says i shortlike as if i didnt want no talk and i goes on with my work without turning round  just then one of the men at the boats hails me  joe theres a party coming down  im busy shouts i back shove the plank out yourself  the children stopped quiet by me for a minute or two watching me at work and then the eldest says  may we get inside the boat joe weve never been inside a boat and we do want to so much  my hand is all covered with paint says i making a fight with myself against giving in  then the little one said  oo stoop down joe sissy and me take hold round oor neck then oo stand up and we det in  well sir the touch of their little arms and those soft little faces against my cheeks as they got in fairly knocked me over and it was some time before i could see what i was doing  once in they never stopped talking they asked about everything and i had to answer them and as i got accustomed to it the words came freer till i was talking away with them as if i had known em all my life once i asked them didnt their papa and mamma ever take em out for a sail and they shook their heads and said mammy hated the sea and said it was a cruel sea by which i judged as she must have lost someone dear to her by it  well sir i must cut a long story short those children used to come every day down to talk with me and i got to look for it regular and if it was a wet day and they couldnt come id be regular put out by it and i got to getting apples and cakes in my pockets for them after a fortnight i took to carrying them across the wet sands and putting them on the stand as i wheeled it out and back with people to the boats i didnt do it till theyd asked their mother and brought back the message that she knew she could trust them with me  all this time it never once struck me as strange that their nurse should sit with a babybrother of theirs at a distance and let them play with me by the hour together without calling them away for i wondered so much at myself and to find myself telling stories to em just as id do with children who came out sailing with me in the old time and in knowing as i was so wrapped up in em that i couldnt wonder at anything else natural like i changed a good deal in other respects and i got to give a goodmorning to mates as i had scarce spoken with for years and the moment the children turned down onto the sands thered be sure to be a shout of theres your little ladies joe  i dont know why my mates should ha been pleased to see me coming round for i had made myself onpleasant enough on the shore but theyd made lowances for me and they met me as kindly as if id cum back from a vyage they did it just quiet like and would just say natural lend us a hand here joe boy or give us a shoulder over the bank joe and ask me what i thought o the weather it was a hard day for me when after staying nigh two months the little ladies came to say goodby it warnt as bad as might have been though for they were going to stay with some friends near york and were to come back again in a fortnight before they went back to london but they kissed me and cried and gave me a pipe and a lot o bacca and i was to think of them whenever i smoked it and they would be sure to think of me for they loved me very much  that very afternoon sir as i was standing by my stage jim saundershed been mate with me before i owned a boat of my ownsays out loud  lor heres my party acoming down and ive jammed my hand so as i cant hoist a sail wholl come out and lend me a hand  well everyone says they were busy and couldnt come but i believe now as the whole thing was a gotup plan to get me afloat again and then jim turns to me as if a sudden idea had struck him  come joe lend us a hand for the sake o old times come along old chap  i was taken aback like and could only say something about my stage but half a dozen chaps volunteers to look after my stage and afore i scarce knew what i was after i was bundled aboard the boat and as the party got in im blest if i dont think as every chap on the shore runs in to help shove her off and a score of hands was held out just to give me a shake as we started  i dont think i was much good on that vyage for i went and sat up in the bow with my back to the others and my eyes fixed far ahead  i neednt tell you sir when id once broken the ice i went regular to the sea again and handed my stage over to a poor fellow who had lost his craft and a leg the winter before  one day when i came in from a sail i saw two little figures upon the sands and it needed no word from anyone to tell me my little ladies had come back they jumped and clapped their hands when they saw me and would have run across the water to meet me hadnt i shouted to them to wait just a minute till i should be with them  weve been waiting a long time joe where have you been  ive been out sailing missy  joe dont you know its wicked to tell stories you told us you should never go on sea any more  no more i didnt think i should missy and i dont suppose i ever should if i hadnt met you though you wont understand that however ive give up the stage and have taken to the sea again  im glad of that joe the eldest said and mamma will be glad too  why should mamma be glad little one i asked  mamma will be glad she said positively i know she will be glad when i tells her  wed sat down by this time and i began to talk to them about their mamma mamma very good very kind very pretty they both agreed and then they went on telling me about their home in london and their carriage and amusements presently they stopped and i could see the eldest wanted to say something particular for she puckered up her forehead as she always did when she was very serious and then she said with her hands folded before her almost as if she was saying a lesson  mamma very happy woman shes got two little girls and babybrother and papa love her so much but theres one thing keeps her from being quite happy  is there missy i asked she ought to be happy with all these things what is it  mamma once had someone do a great thing for her if it hadnt been for him nina and sissy and little babybrother could never have been born and papa would never have had dear mamma to love but it cost the man who did it a great dealall he cared for and now he wont let mamma and papa and us love him and help him and it makes mamma unhappy when she thinks of it  here she had evidently finished what she had heard her mamma say for her forehead got smooth again and she began to fill my pockets with sand  it dont sound likely missy that doesnt i says it dont stand to reason nohow you cant have understood what mamma said  mamma said it over and over again lots of time nina said nina quite sure she said right  we didnt say no more about it then though after the children had gone i wondered to myself how a chap could go on so foolish as that well sir three days after come round from whitby this very boat the grateful mary she was sent care of joe denton and as that was me i had her hauled up on the beach till i should hear whose she was several visitors that had been out with me had said promiscuous like that they should like to have a boat of their own and i supposed they had bought her at whitby and sent her down though why they should have sent her to my care i couldnt quite see  two days afterwards them children come down and says  we want you to go through the town to the other cliff with us joe  i cant says i im all right talking to you here missies but i shouldnt be a credit to you in the town and your pa wouldnt be best pleased if he was to see you walking about in the streets with a boatman  papa said we might ask you joe  i shook my head and the little ladies ran off to their nurse who come back with them and says  master told me to say he should be pertickler glad if you would go with the young ladies  oh very well i says if their pa dont object and they wishes it id go with em anywheres you wait here a quarter of an hour while i goes and cleans myself and ill go with you  when i comes back the youngest takes my hand and the oldest holds by my jacket and we goes up into high street and across to the other cliff we goes along till we comes to a pretty little cottage looking over the sea there was a garden in front new planted with flowers  are you sure you are going right says i when they turned in  they nodded and ran up to the door and turned the handle  come in joe they said and they dragged me into a parlor where a lady and gentleman was sitting  the gentleman got up  my little girls have spoken so much to me about you joe that i feel that we know each other already  yes sir surely says i  well joe do you know that i owe you a great deal as to these little girls  bless you sir its i as owe a great deal to the little missies they have made a changed man of me they have you ask anyone on the shore  i hope they have joe for had they not got round your heart and led you to your better self i could never have done what i have done for you would have rendered it useless  i didnt say nothing sir for i could make neither head nor tail of what he was saying and i dessay looked as surprised as might be then he takes a step forward and he puts a hand on my shoulder and says he  joe have you never guessed who these little girls were  i looked first at the children and then at him and then at the lady who had a veil down but was wiping her eyes underneath it i was downright flummuxed  i see you havent the gentleman went on well joe it is time you should know now i owe to you all that is dear to me in this world and our one unhappiness has been that you would not hear us that you had lost everything and would not let us do anything to lighten your blow  still sir i couldnt make out what he meant and began to think that i was mad or that he was then the lady stood up and threw back her veil and come up in front of me with the tears arunning down her face and i fell back a step and sits down suddenly in a chair for sure enough it was that gal different to what i had seen her last healthylooking and wellolder in course a woman now and the mother of my little ladies  she stood before me sir with her hands out before her pleading like  dont hate me any more joe let my children stand between us i know what you have suffered and in all my happiness the thought of your loneliness has been a trouble as my husband will tell you i so often thought of youa broken lonely man i have talked to the children of you till they loved the man that saved their mothers life i cannot give you what you have lost joeno one can do that but you may make us happy in making you comfortable at least if you cannot help hating me let the love i know you bear my children weigh with you  as she spoke the children were hanging on me and when she stopped the little one said  oh joe oo must be dood oo mustnt hate mamma and make her cry  well sir i know as i need tell you more about it you can imagine how i quite broke down like a great baby and called myself every kind of name saying only that i thought and i amost think so now that i had been somehow mad from the moment the squall struck the kate till the time i first met the little girls  when i thought o that and how id cut that poor gal to her drowning heart with my words i could ha knelt to her if shed ha let me at last when i was quiet she explained that this cottage and its furniture and the grateful mary was all for me and wed a great fight over it and i only gave in when at last she says that if i didnt do as she wanted shed never come down to scarborough with the little ladies no more but that if i greed theyd come down regular every year and that the little girls should go out sailing with me regular in the grateful mary  well sir there was no arguing against that was there so here i am and next week i expect miss mary that was with her husband whos a parliament man as she was engaged to be married to at the time of the upset and my little ladies who is getting quite big girls too and if you hadnt been going away id ha sailed round the castle tower and id ha pointed out the cottage to you yes sir i see what you are going to ask i found it lonely there and i found the widow of a old mate of mine who seemed to think as how she could make me comfortable and comfortable i am sirno words could say how comfortable i am and do you know sir im blest if there aint a joe up there at this identical time only hes a very little one and has got both arms so you see sir i have got about as little right as has any chap in this mortial world to the name of surly joe     a fishwifes dream   falmouth is not a fashionable wateringplace capitalists and speculative builders have somehow left it alone and except for its great hotel standing in a position as far as i know unrivaled there have been comparatively few additions to it in the last quarter of a century were i a yachtsman i should make falmouth my headquarters blow high blow low there are shelter and plenty of sailing room while in fine weather there is a glorious coast along which to cruisesomething very different from the flat shores from southampton to brighton it is some six years since that i was lying in the harbor having sailed round in a friends yacht from cowes upon the day after we had come in my friend went into truro and i landed strolled up and sat down on a bench high on the seaward face of the hill that shelters the inner harbor  an old coastguardsman came along i offered him tobacco and in five minutes we were in full talk  i suppose those are the pilchard boats far out there  aye thats the pilchard fleet  do they do well generally  sometimes they do sometimes they dont its an uncertain fish the pilchard and its a rough life is fishing on this coast there aint a good harbor not this side of the lizard and if theyre caught in a gale from the southeast it goes hard with them with a southwester they can run back here  were you ever a fisherman yourself  aye i began life at it i went afishing as a boy wellnigh fifty year back but i got a sickener of it and tramped to plymouth and shipped in a frigate there and served all my time in queens ships  did you get sick of fishing because of the hardships of the life or from any particular circumstance  i got wrecked on the scillys there was fifty boats lost that night and scarce a hand was saved i shouldnt have been saved myself if it had not been for a dream of mothers  thats curious i said would you mind telling me about it  the old sailor did not speak for a minute or two and then after a sharp puff at his pipe he told me the following story of which i have but slightly altered the wording  i lived with mother at tregannock its a bit of a village now as it was then my father had been washed overboard and drowned two years before i was his only son the boat i sailed in was mothers and four men and myself worked her in shares i was twentyone or maybe twentytwo years old then it was one day early in october we had had a bad season and times were hard wed agreed to start at eight oclock in the morning i was up at five and went down to the boats to see as everything was ready when i got back mother had made breakfast and when we sat down i saw that the old woman had been crying and looked altogether queer like  my boy says she i want you not to go out this trip  not go out said i not go out mother why whats happened your share and mine didnt come to three pounds last month and it would be a talk if i didnt go out in the jane why what is it  my boy says she ive had a dream as how you was drowned  drowned said i im not going to be drowned mother  but what she said made me feel creepy like for us cornishmen goes a good deal on dreams and tokens and sure enough mother had dreamed father was going to be drowned before he started on that last trip of his  thats not all will she said i dreamed of you in bed and a chap was leaning over you cutting your throat  i didnt care much for going on with my breakfast after that but in a minute or two i plucks up and says  well mother youre wrong anyhow for if i be drowned no one has no call to cut my throat  i didnt see you downright drowned in my dream she said you was in the seaa terribly rough seaat night and the waves were breaking down on you  i cant help going mother i says after a bit its a fine day and its our boat all the lads and girls in the village would laugh at me if i stayed at home  thats just what your father said and he went to his death  and my mother as she says this puts her apron over her head and began to cry again id more than half a mind to give way but you know what young chaps are the thought of what the girls of the place would say about my being afraid to go was too much for me  at last when mother saw i was bent on going she got up and said  well will if my prayers cant keep you back will you do something else i ask you  i will mother said ianything but stay back  she went off without a word into her bedroom and she came back with something in her arms  look here will i made this for your father and he wouldnt have it now i ask you to take it and put it on if a storm comes on you see you can put it on under your dreadnaught coat and no one will be any the wiser  the thing she brought in was two flat dutch spiritbottles sewn between two pieces of canvas it had got strings sewed on for tying round the body and put on as she did to show me how one bottle each side of the chest it lay pretty flat  now will these bottles will keep you up for hours a gentleman who was staying in the village before you was born was talking about wrecks and he said that a couple of empty bottles well corked would keep up a fair swimmer for hours so i made it but no words could get your father to try it though he was willing enough to say that it would probably keep him afloat youll try it wont you will  i didnt much like taking it but i thought there wasnt much chance of a storm and that if i put it under my coat and hid it away down in the forecastle no one would see it and so to please her i said id take it and that if a bad storm came on i would slip it on  i will put a wineglass of brandy into one of the bottles mother said it may be useful to you who can say  i got the lifepreserver as you call it nowadays on board without its being seen and stowed it away in my locker i felt glad now id got it for mothers dream had made me feel uneasy and on my way down old dick tremaine said to me  i dont like the look of the sky lad  no says i why it looks fine enough  too fine lad i tell ye boy i dont like the look of it i think were going to have a bad blow  i told the others what he had said but they didnt heed much two boats had come in that morning with a fine catch and after the bad time wed been having it would have taken a lot to keep them in after that  we thought no more about it after we had once started the wind was light and puffy but we had great luck and were too busy to watch the weather what wind there was was northerly but towards sunset it dropped suddenly and as the sails flapped we looked round at the sky  i fear old dick was right lads jabez harper who was skipper said and i wish we had taken more heed to his words thats about as wild a sunset as may be and look how that drift is nearing our boat  even i who was the youngest of them was old enough to read the signs of a stormthe heavy bank of dark clouds the paleyellow broken light the horsetails high up in the sky and the small broken irregular masses of cloud that hurried across them instinctively we looked round towards the coast it was fully fifteen miles away and we were to the east of it the great change in the appearance of the sky had taken place in the last halfhour previous to that time there had been nothing which would have struck any but a man grown old upon the coast like dick tremaine  reef the mainsail jabez said and the foresail too take in the mizzen like enough it will come with a squall and wed best be as snug as may be what do you say shall we throw over some of the fish  it was a hard thing to agree to but every minute the sky was changing the scud was flying thicker and faster overhead and the land was lost in a black cloud that seemed to touch the water  we neednt throw em all out jabez said if we get rid of half shell be about in her best trim and shes as good a seaboat as there is on the coast come lads dont look at it  it was as he said no use looking at it and in five minutes half our catch of the day was overboard the jane was a halfdecked boat yawlrigged she wasnt built in our parts but had been brought round from somewhere east by a gentleman as a fishingcraft he had used her for two years and had got tired of the sport and my father had bought her of him she wasnt the sort of boat generally used about here but we all liked her and swore by her  it will be a tremendous blow for the first few minutes i reckon jabez said after a while lower down her sails altogether get her head to it with a sweep ill take the helm harry you stand ready to hoist the foresail a few feet and will you and john stand by the hoists of the mainsail we must show enough to keep her layingto as long as we can youd best get your coats out and put em on and batten down the hatch  i let the others go down first and when they came up i went in tied the lifebelt round me and put on my oilskin i fetched out a bottle of hollands from my locker and then came out and fastened the hatch  here comes the first puff jabez said  i stowed away the bottle among some ropes for our future use and took hold of the throat halyard  here it comes jabez said as a white line appeared under the cloud of mist and darkness ahead and then with a roar it was upon us  i have been at sea man and boy for forty years and i never remember in these latitudes such a squall as that for a few minutes i could scarcely see or breathe the spray flew in sheets over us and the wind roared so that you wouldnt have heard a sixtyeightpounder ten yards off at first i thought we were going down bodily it was lucky we had taken every stitch of canvas off her for as she spun round the force of the wind against the masts and rigging all but capsized her in five minutes the first burst was over and we were running before it under our closereefed foresail only there was no occasion for us to stand by the halyards now and we all gathered in the stern and crouched down in the well although the sun had only gone down half an hour it was pitchdark except that the white foam round us gave a sort of dim light that made the sky look all the blacker the sea got up in less time than it takes in telling and we were soon obliged to hoist the foresail a bit higher to prevent the waves from coming in over the stern for three hours we tore on before the gale and then it lulled almost as suddenly as it had come on there had scarcely been a word spoken between us during this time i was half asleep in spite of the showers of spray jim hackers who was always smoking puffed away steadily jabez was steering still and the others were quite quiet with the sudden lull we were all on our feet  is it all over jabez i asked  its only begun he said i scarce remember such a gale as this since i was a boy pass that bottle of yours round will we shall be busy again directly one of you take the helm im stiff with the wet we shall have it round from the south in a few minutes  there was scarce a breath of wind now and she rolled so i thought she would have turned turtle  get out a sweep jabez said and bring her head round  we had scarcely done so ere the first squall from behind struck us and in five minutes we were running back as fast as we had come the wind was at first south but settled round to southeast we got up a little more sail now and made a shift to keep her to the west for with this wind we should have been ashore long before morning if we had run straight before it the sea had been heavyit was tremendous now and light and seaworthy as the jane was we had to keep baling as the sea broke into her over and over again i thought that it was all over with us as the great waves towered above our stern but they slipped under us as we went driving on at twelve or fourteen knots an hour i stood up by the side of jabez and asked him what he thought of it  i cant keep her off the wind he said we must run and by midnight we shall be among the scillys then its a tossup  jabezs calculations could not have been far out for it was just midnight as far as i could tell when we saw a flash right ahead  thats a ship on one of the scillys jabez said i wish i knew which it was  he tried to bring her a little more up into the wind but she nearly lay over onto her beamends and jabez let her go ahead again we saw one more flash and then a broad faint light the ship was burning a blue light she was not a mile ahead now and we could see she was a large vessel i had often been to the scillys before and knew them as well as i did our coast but i could not see the land it was as jabez had saida tossup if we just missed one of them we might manage to bring up under its lee but if we ran dead into one or other of them the jane would break up like an eggshell  we were rapidly running down upon the wreck when the glare of a fire on shore shone up it was a great blaze and we could faintly see the land and a white cottage some hundred yards from the shore  i know it jabez shouted we are close to the end of the island we may miss it yet hoist the mainsail a bit  i leapt up with another to seize the halyards when a great wave struck us she gave a roll and the next moment i was in the water  after the first wild efforts i felt calm like i knew the shore was but half a mile ahead and that the wind would set me dead upon it i loosened my tarpaulin coat and shook it off and i found that with mothers belt i could keep easily enough afloat though i was half drowned with the waves as they swept in from behind me my mothers dream cheered me up for according to that it did not seem as i was to be drowned whatever was to come afterwards i drifted past the wreck within a hundred yards or so they were still burning blue lights but the sea made a clean sweep over her and i saw that in a very few minutes she would go to pieces many times as the seas broke over me i quite gave up hope of reaching shore but i was a fair swimmer and the bottles buoyed me up and i struggled on  i could see the fire on shore but the surf that broke against the rocks showed a certain death if i made for it and i tried hard to work to the left where i could see no breaking surf it seemed to me that the fire was built close to the end of the island as i came close i found that this was so i drifted past the point of land not fifty feet off where the waves were sending their spray a hundred feet up then i made a great struggle and got in under the lee of the point there was a little bay with a shelving shore and here i made a shift to land five minutes to rest and then i made my way towards the fire there was no one there and i went to the edge of the rocks here four or five men with ropes were standing trying to secure some of the casks chests and wreckage from the ship the surf was full of floating objects but nothing could stand the shock of a crash against those rocks the water was deep alongside and the waves as they struck flew up in spray which made standing almost impossible  the men came round me when they saw me there was no hearing one speak in the noise of the storm so i made signs i had landed behind the point and that if they came with their ropes to the point they might get something as it floated past they went off and i sat down by the fire wrung my clothes as well as i couldi thought nothing of the wet for one is wet through half the time in a fishingboattook off mothers belt and found one of the bottles had broke as i got ashore but luckily it was the one which was quite empty i got the cork out of the other and had a drink of brandy and then felt pretty right again i had good hopes the boat was all right for she would get round the point easy and jabez would bring her up under the lee of the island i thought i would go and see if i could help the others and perhaps save someone drifting from the wreck but i did not think there was very much chance for she lay some little distance to the right and i hardly thought a swimmer could keep off the shore  just as i was going to move i saw two of them coming back they had a body between them and they put it down a little distance from the fire i was on the other side and they had forgotten all about me they stooped over the figure and i could not see what they were doing i got up and went over and they gave a start when they saw me is he alive says i dunno one of em growled and i could see pretty well that if i had not been there it would have gone hard with the chap he was a foreign jewishlooking fellow and had around him one of the ships lifebuoys there were lots of rings on his fingers and he had a belt round his waist that looked pretty well stuffed out i put my hand to his heart and found he still breathed and then i poured a few drops of brandy which remained in my bottle down his throat  while i was doing this the two men had talked to each other aside hes alive all right says i thats a good job one of em said but i knew he didnt think so well carry him up to our cottage youll be all the better for a sleep it must be past two oclock by this time  they took the chap up and carried him to the cottage and put him on a bed he was moaning a little and between us we undressed him and got him into bed i doubt hell come round i said  i dont believe he will will you have a drink of whisky  i was mighty glad to do so and then throwing off my wet clothes i got into the other bed for there were two in the room  the men said they were going down again to see what they could get they left the whisky bottle on the table and as soon as i was alone i jumped out and poured a little into the other chaps teeth so as to give him as good a chance as i could but i didnt much think hed get round and then i got into bed and shut my eyes i was just going off when with a sudden jump i sat straight up mothers dream came right across me i was out of bed in a moment and looked at the door there was no bolt so i put a couple of chairs against it then i took my claspknife out of my pocket and opened it i gave the other chap a shake but there was no sense in him and i got into bed again i thought to myself they would never risk a fight when they saw me armed and ready but i soon found that i couldnt keep awake so i got up and dressed in my wet clothes and went to the door i found it was fastened on the outside i soon opened the window and got out but before i did that i rolled up some clothes and put em in the bed and made a sort of likeness of a man there the poor fellow in bed was lying very still now and i felt pretty sure that he would not live till morning the candle was a fresh one when they had first lighted it and i left it burning  when i had got out i shut the window and went away fifty yards or so where i could hear them come back presently i heard some footsteps coming from the opposite direction then i heard a voice i knew say there is the fire we shall soon know whether the poor lad has got ashore  here am i jabez i said hush as he and the other were going to break into a shout of welcome hush some wreckers are coming up directly to cut my throat and that of another chap in that cottage  in a word or two i told them all about it and they agreed to wait with me and see the end of it jabez had brought the jane up under the lee of the island and leaving two of the men on board had come on shore in the cobble with the other to look for me but with very faint hopes of finding me  you had best get hold of something to fight with if you mean to take these fellows jabez  a good lump of rock is as good a weapon as another jabez said  our plan was soon arranged and half an hour later we heard footsteps coming up from the shore again two men passed us went into the cottage and shut the door jabez and i made round to the window where we could see in and john redpath stood at the door he was to open it and rush in when he heard us shout we stood a little back but we could see well into the room presently we saw the door open very quietly little by little a hand came through and moved the chairs and then it opened wide then the two men entered one a big fellow had a knife in his hand and drew towards the bed where as it seemed i was sleeping with my head covered up by the clothes the other had no knife in his hand and came towards the other bed  get ready lad jabez said to me  the big fellow raised his knife and plunged it down into the figure throwing his weight onto it at the same moment while the smaller man snatched the pillow from under the others head and clapped it over his face and threw his weight on it as they did so we pushed the casement open and leapt in i seized the smaller man who was suffocating the other chap and before he could draw his knife i had him on the ground and my knee on his chest the big fellow had leapt up he gave a howl of rage as jabez rushed at him and stood at bay with his knife jabez stopped however and threw his lump of rock as big as a babys head right into his stomach it just tumbled him over like a cannonshot john burst in through the door and we had em both tied tightly before five minutes was over then we lit a big fire in the kitchen and with warm clothes and some hot whisky and water we got the foreign chap pretty well round  in the morning i went off and found a village on the other side of the island i woke them up and told my story and to do em justice though there were some who would have shielded the fellows we had caught the best part were on our side some of em told me there had been suspicion upon these men and that they bore a bad name there was no magistrate in the island and no one objected when i said we would take them across to penzance and give them in charge there  so we did and they were tried and got transportation for life for attempting to murder the foreign chap who it turned out was a brazilian jew with diamonds he offered us all sorts of presents but we would have none but thats neither here nor there  so you see master mothers dream saved me from drowning and from having my throat cut i gave up fishing after that and went into the queens service mother sold the boat and went to live with a sister of hers at truro the scilly islands have changed since those times and youll meet as much kindness there if youre wrecked as you will anywhere else but they were a rough lot in those days and i had a pretty close shave of it hadnt i     boys own library
