41437900	night watches  by ww jacobs     back to back  mrs scutts concealed behind the curtain gazed at the cab in uneasy amazement  the cabman clambered down from the box and opening the door stood by with his hands extended ready for any help that might be needed a stranger was the first to alight and with his back towards mrs scutts seemed to be struggling with something in the cab  he placed a dangling hand about his neck and staggering under the weight reeled backwards supporting mr scutts whose other arm was round the neck of a third man  in a flash mrs scutts was at the door  oh bill  she gasped  and by daylight too  mr scutts raised his head sharply and his lips parted then his head sank again and he became a dead weight in the grasp of his assistants  hes all right said one of them turning to mrs scutts  a deep groan from mr scutts confirmed the statement  what is it  inquired his wife anxiously  just a little bit of a railway accident said one of the strangers train ran into some empty trucks  nobody hurtseriously he added in response to a terrible and annoyed groan from mr scutts  with his feet dragging helplessly mr scutts was conveyed over his own doorstep and placed on the sofa  all the others went off home on their own legs said one of the strangers reproachfully  he said he couldnt walk and he wouldnt go to a hospital  wanted to die at home declared the sufferer  i aint going to be cut about at no ospitals  the two strangers stood by watching him then they looked at each other  i dont wantnoospitals gasped mr scutts im going to have my own doctor  of course the company will pay the doctors bill said one of the strangers to mrs scutts or theyll send their own doctor  i expect hell be all right tomorrow  i ope so said mr scutts but i dont think it  thank you for bringing of me ome  he closed his eyes languidly and kept them closed until the men had departed  cant you walk bill  inquired the tearful mrs scutts  her husband shook his head  you go and fetch the doctor he said slowly  that new one round the corner  he looks such a boy objected mrs scutts  you go and fetch im said mr scutts raising his voice  dye hear  but began his wife  if i get up to you my gal said the forgetful mr scutts youll know it  why i thought said his wife in surprise  mr scutts raised himself on the sofa and shook his fist at her  then as a tribute to appearances he sank back and groaned again  mrs scutts looking somewhat relieved took her bonnet from a nail and departed  the examination was long and tedious but mr scutts beyond remarking that he felt chilly made no complaint  he endeavoured but in vain to perform the tests suggested and even did his best to stand supported by his medical attendant  selfpreservation is the law of nature and when mr scuttss legs and back gave way he saw to it that the doctor was underneath  well have to get you up to bed said the latter rising slowly and dusting himself  mr scutts who was lying full length on the floor acquiesced and sent his wife for some neighbours  one of them was a professional furniture remover and halfway up the narrow stairs the unfortunate had to remind him that he was dealing with a british working man and not a piano  four pairs of hands deposited mr scutts with mathematical precision in the centre of the bed and then proceeded to tuck him in while mrs scutts drew the sheet in a straight line under his chin  dont look much the matter with im said one of the assistants  you cant tell with a face like that said the furnitureremover its wot you might call a appy face  why he was arf smiling as we carried im up the stairs  youre a liar said mr scutts opening his eyes  all right mate said the furnitureremover all right  theres no call to get annoyed about it  good old english pluck i call it  where dyou feel the pain  all over said mr scutts briefly  his neighbours regarded him with sympathetic eyes and then led by the furnitureremover filed out of the room on tiptoe  the doctor with a few parting instructions also took his departure  if youre not better by the morning he said pausing at the door you must send for your club doctor  mr scutts in a feeble voice thanked him and lay with a twisted smile on his face listening to his wifes vivid narrative to the little crowd which had collected at the front door  she came back followed by the nextdoor neighbour mr james flynn whose offers of assistance ranged from carrying mr scutts out pickaback when he wanted to take the air to filling his pipe for him and fetching his beer  but i dare say youll be up and about in a couple o days he concluded  you wouldnt look so well if youd got anything serious the matter rosy fat cheeks and  thatll do said the indignant invalid  its my back thats hurt not my face  i know said mr flynn nodding sagely but if it was hurt bad your face would be as white as that sheetwhiter  the doctor said as he was to be kep quiet remarked mrs scutts sharply  righto said mr flynn  tata old pal  keep your pecker up and if you want your back rubbed with turps or anything of that sort just knock on the wall  he went before mr scutts could think of a reply suitable for an invalid and at the same time bristling with virility  a sinful and foolish desire to leap out of bed and help mr flynn downstairs made him more rubicund than ever  he sent for the club doctor next morning and pending his arrival partook of a basin of arrowroot and drank a little beeftea  a bottle of castoroil and an empty pillbox on the table by the bedside added a little local colour to the scene  any pain  inquired the doctor after an examination in which bony and very cold fingers had played a prominent part  not much pain said mr scutts  dont seem to have no strength in my back  ah  said the doctor  i tried to get up this morning to go to my work said mr scutts but i cant stand  couldnt get out of bed  fearfully upset he was pore dear testified mrs scutts  he cant bear losing a day  i sposei spose the railway company will ave to do something if its serious wont they sir  nothing to do with me said the doctor  ill put him on the club for a few days i expect he will be all right soon  hes got a healthy coloura very healthy colour  mr scutts waited until he had left the house and then made a few remarks on the colour question that for impurity of english and strength of diction have probably never been surpassed  a second visitor that day came after dinnera tall man in a frockcoat bearing in his hand a silk hat which after a careful survey of the room he hung on a knob of the bedpost  mr scutts  he inquired bowing  thats me said mr scutts in a feeble voice  ive called from the railway company said the stranger  we have seen now all those who left their names and addresses on monday afternoon and i am glad to say that nobody was really hurt  nobody  mr scutts in a faint voice said he was glad to hear it  been a wonder if they had said the other cheerfully  why even the paint wasnt knocked off the engine  the most serious damage appears to be two tophats crushed and an umbrella broken  he leaned over the bedrail and laughed joyously  mr scutts through halfclosed eyes gazed at him in silent reproach  i dont say that one or two people didnt receive a little bit of a shock to their nerves said the visitor thoughtfully  one lady even stayed in bed next day  however i made it all right with them  the company is very generous and although of course there is no legal obligation they made several of them a present of a few pounds so that they could go away for a little change or anything of that sort to quiet their nerves  mr scutts who had been listening with closed eyes opened them languidly and said oh  i gave one gentleman twenty pounds  said the visitor jingling some coins in his trouserpocket  i never saw a man so pleased and grateful in my life  when he signed the receipt for iti always get them to sign a receipt so that the company can see that i havent kept the money for myselfhe nearly wept with joy  i should think he would said mr scutts slowlyif he wasnt hurt  youre the last on my list said the other hastily  he produced a slip of paper from his pocketbook and placed it on the small table with a fountain pen  then with a smile that was both tender and playful he plunged his hand in his pocket and poured a stream of gold on the table  what do you say to thirty pounds  he said in a hushed voice thirty golden goblins  what for  inquired mr scutts with a notable lack of interest  forwell to go away for a day or two said the visitor  i find you in bed it may be a cold or a bilious attack or perhaps you had a little upset of the nerves when the trains kissed each other  im in bedbecausei cant walkor stand said mr scutts speaking very distinctly  im on my club and if as ow i get well in a day or two theres no reason why the company should give me any money  im pore but im honest  take my advice as a friend said the other take the money while you can get it  he nodded significantly at mr scutts and closed one eye  mr scutts closed both of his  i ad my back hurt in the collision he said after a long pause  i ad to be helped ome  so far it seems to get worse but i ope for the best  dear me said the visitor how sad  i suppose it has been coming on for a long time  most of these back cases do  at least all the doctors say so  it was done in the collision said mr scutts mildly but firmly i was as right as rain before then  the visitor shook his head and smiled  ah you would have great difficulty in proving that he said softly in fact speaking as man to man i dont mind telling you it would be impossible  im afraid im exceeding my duty but as youre the last on my list supposesuppose we say forty pounds  forty  a small fortune  he added some more gold to the pile on the table and gently tapped mr scuttss arm with the end of the pen  good afternoon said the invalid  the visitor justly concerned at his lack of intelligence took a seat on the edge of the bed and spoke to him as a friend and a brother but in vain  mr scutts reminded him at last that it was medicinetime after which pain and weakness permitting he was going to try to get a little sleep  forty pounds  he said to his wife after the official had departed why didnt e offer me a bag o sweets  its a lot o money said mrs scutts wistfully  sos a thousand said her husband  i aint going to ave my back broke for nothing i can tell you  now you keep that mouth o yours shut and if i get it you shall ave a new pair o boots  a thousand  exclaimed the startled mrs scutts  have you took leave of your senses or what  i read a case in the paper where a man got it said mr scutts  he ad his back urt too pore chap  how would you like to lay on your back all your life for a thousand pounds  will you ave to lay abed all your life  inquired his wife staring  wait till i get the money said mr scutts then i might be able to tell you better  he gazed wistfully at the window  it was late october but the sun shone and the air was clear  the sound of traffic and cheerful voices ascended from the little street  to mr scutts it all seemed to be a part of a distant past  if that chap comes round tomorrow and offers me five hundred he said slowly i dont know as i wont take it  im sick of this mouldy bed  he waited expectantly next day but nothing happened and after a week of bed he began to realize that the job might be a long one  the monotony to a man of his active habits became almost intolerable and the narrated adventures of mr james flynn his only caller filled him with an uncontrollable longing to be up and doing  the fine weather went and mr scutts in his tumbled bed lay watching the rain beating softly on the windowpanes  then one morning he awoke to the darkness of a london fog  it gets worse and worse said mrs scutts as she returned home in the afternoon with a relish for his tea  cant see your and before your face  mr scutts looked thoughtful  he ate his tea in silence and after he had finished lit his pipe and sat up in bed smoking  penny for your thoughts said his wife  im going out said mr scutts in a voice that defied opposition im going to ave a walk and when im far enough away im going to ave one or two drinks  i believe this fog is sent apurpose to save my life  mrs scutts remonstrated but in vain and at halfpast six the invalid with his cap over his eyes and a large scarf tied round the lower part of his face listened for a moment at his front door and then disappeared in the fog  left to herself mrs scutts returned to the bedroom and poking the tiny fire into a blaze sat and pondered over the willfulness of men  she was awakened from a doze by a knocking at the streetdoor  it was just eight oclock and inwardly congratulating her husband on his return to common sense and home she went down and opened it  two tall men in silk hats entered the room  mrs scutts  said one of them  mrs scutts in a dazed fashion nodded  we have come to see your husband said the intruder  i am a doctor  the panicstricken mrs scutts tried in vain to think  hehes asleep she said at last  doesnt matter said the doctor  not a bit said his companion  youyou cant see him protested mrs scutts  he aint to be seen  hed be sorry to miss me said the doctor eyeing her keenly as she stood on guard by the inner door  i suppose hes at home  of course said mrs scutts stammering and flushing  why the pore man cant stir from his bed  well ill just peep in at the door then said the doctor  i wont wake him  you cant object to that  if you do  mrs scuttss head began to swim  ill go up and see whether hes awake she said  she closed the door on them and stood with her hand to her throat thinking  then instead of going upstairs she passed into the yard and stepping over the fence opened mr flynns back door  halloa  said that gentleman who was standing in the scullery removing mud from his boots  whats up  in a frenzied gabble mrs scutts told him  you must be im she said clutching him by the coat and dragging him towards the door  theyve never seen im and they wont know the difference  but exclaimed the astonished james  quick  she said sharply  go into the back room and undress then nip into his room and get into bed  and mind be fast asleep all the time  still holding the bewildered mr flynn by the coat she led him into the house and waved him upstairs and stood below listening until a slight creaking of the bed announced that he had obeyed orders  then she entered the parlour  hes fast asleep she said softly and mind i wont ave him disturbed  its the first real sleep hes ad for nearly a week  if you promise not to wake im you may just have a peep  we wont disturb him said the doctor and followed by his companion noiselessly ascended the stairs and peeped into the room  mr flynn was fast asleep and not a muscle moved as the two men approached the bed on tiptoe and stood looking at him  the doctor turned after a minute and led the way out of the room  well call again he said softly  yes sir said mrs scutts  when  the doctor and his companion exchanged glances  im very busy just at present he said slowly  well look in some time and take our chance of catching him awake  mrs scutts bowed them out and in some perplexity returned to mr flynn i dont like the look of em she said shaking her head youd better stay in bed till bill comes ome in case they come back  righto said the obliging mr flynn  just step in and tell my landlady im aving a chat with bill  he lit his pipe and sat up in bed smoking until a knock at the front door at halfpast eleven sent him off to sleep again  mrs scutts who was sitting downstairs opened it and admitted her husband  all serene  he inquired  what are you looking like that for whats up  he sat quivering with alarm and rage as she told him and then mounting the stairs with a heavy tread stood gazing in helpless fury at the slumbering form of mr james flynn  get out o my bed he said at last in a choking voice  what bill  said mr flynn opening his eyes  get out o my bed repeated the other  youve made a nice mess of it between you  its a fine thing if a man cant go out for arf a pint without coming home and finding all the riffraff of the neighbourhood in is bed  ows the pore back bill  inquired mr flynn with tenderness  mr scutts gurgled at him  outside  he said as soon as he could get his breath  bill said the voice of mrs scutts outside the door  halloa growled her husband  he mustnt go said mrs scutts  those gentlemen are coming again and they think he is you  what roared the infuriated mr scutts  dont you see  its me whats got the pore back now bill said mr flynn  you cant pass yourself off as me bill you aint goodlooking enough  mr scutts past speech raised his clenched fists to the ceiling  hell ave to stay in your bed continued the voice of mrs scutts hes got a good art and i know hell do it wont you jim  mr flynn pondered  tell my landlady in the morning that ive took your back room he said  what a fortunit thing it is im out o work what are you walking up and down like that for bill  back coming on agin  then o course pursued the voice of mrs scutts in meditative accents theres the club doctor and the other gentleman that knows bill  they might come at any moment  theres got to be two bills in bed so that if one party comes one bill can nip into the back room and if the other billparty i meancomes the other billyou know what i mean  mr scutts swore himself faint  thats ow it is mate said mr flynn  its no good standing there saying your little piece of poetry to yourself  take off your cloes and get to bed like a little man  now now  naughty  naughty  praps i oughtnt to ave let em up bill said his wife but i was afraid theyd smell a rat if i didnt  besides i was took by surprise  you get off to bed said mr scutts  get off to bed while youre safe  and get a good nights rest added the thoughtful mr flynn  if bills back is took bad in the night ill look after it  mr scutts turned a threatening face on him  for two pins he began  for two pins ill go back ome and stay there said mr flynn  he put one muscular leg out of bed and then at the earnest request of mr scutts put it back again  in a few simple manly words the latter apologized by putting all the blame on mrs scutts and removing his clothes got into bed  wrapped in bedclothes they passed the following day listening for knocks at the door and playing cards  by evening both men were weary and mr scutts made a few pointed remarks concerning dodging doctors and deceitful visitors to which mr flynn listened in silent approval  they mightnt come for a week he said dismally  its all right for you but where do i come in  halves  mr scutts had a rush of blood to the head  you leave it to me mate he said controlling himself by an effort if i get ten quid say you shall have arf  and suppose you get more  demanded the other  well see said mr scutts vaguely  mr flynn returned to the charge next day but got no satisfaction  mr scutts preferred to talk instead of the free board and lodging his friend was getting  on the subject of such pay for such work he was almost eloquent  ill bide my time said mr flynn darkly  treat me fair and ill treat you fair  his imprisonment came to an end on the fourth day  there was a knock at the door and the sound of mens voices followed by the hurried appearance of mrs scutts  its jims lot she said in a hurried whisper  ive just come up to get the room ready  mr scutts took his friend by the hand and after warmly urging him not to forget the expert instructions he had received concerning his back slipped into the back room and a prey to forebodings awaited the result  well he looks better said the doctor regarding mr flynn  much better said his companion  mrs scutts shook her head  his pore back dont seem no better sir she said in a low voice  cant you do something for it  let me have a look at it said the doctor  undo your shirt  mr flynn with slow fingers fumbled with the button at his neck and looked hard at mrs scutts  she cant bear to see me suffer he said in a feeble voice as she left the room  he bore the examination with the fortitude of an early christian martyr in response to inquiries he said he felt as though the mainspring of his back had gone  how long since you walked  inquired the doctor  not since the accident said mr flynn firmly  try now said the doctor  mr flynn smiled at him reproachfully  you cant walk because you think you cant said the doctor that is all  youll have to be encouraged the same way that a child is  i should like to cure you and i think i can  he took a small canvas bag from the other man and opened it  forty pounds he said  would you like to count it  mr flynns eyes shone  it is all yours said the doctor if you can walk across the room and take it from that gentlemans hand  honour bright asked mr flynn in tremulous tones as the other man held up the bag and gave him an encouraging smile  honour bright said the doctor  with a spring that nearly broke the bed mr flynn quitted it and snatched the bag and at the same moment mrs scutts impelled by a maddened arm burst into the room  your back  she moaned  itll kill you get back to bed  im cured lovey said mr flynn simply  his back is as strong as ever said the doctor giving it a thump  mr flynn who had taken his clothes from a chair and was hastily dressing himself assented  but if youll wait arf a tick ill walk as far as the corner with you he said quickly  id like to make sure its all right  he paused at the foot of the stairs and glancing up at the palid and murderous face of mr scutts which protruded from the back bedroom smiled at him rapturously  then with a lordly air he tossed him five pieces of gold
