nathaniel hawthorne     respectablelooking individual makes his bow and addresses the public in my daily walks along the principal street of my native town it has often occurred to me that if its growth from infancy upward and the vicissitude of characteristic scenes that have passed along this thoroughfare during the more than two centuries of its existence could be presented to the eye in a shifting panorama it would bean exceedingly effective method of illustrating the march of time  acting on this idea i have contrived a certain pictorial exhibition somewhat in the nature of a puppetshow by means of which i propose to call up the multiform and manycolored past before the spectator and show him the ghosts of his forefathers amid a succession of historic incidents with no greater trouble than the turning of a crank  be pleased therefore my indulgent patrons to walk into the showroom and take your seats before yonder mysterious curtain  the little wheels and springs of my machinery have been well oiled a multitude of puppets are dressed in character representing all varieties of fashion from the puritan cloak and jerkin to the latest oak hall coat the lamps are trimmed and shall brighten into noontide sunshine or fade away in moonlight or muffle their brilliancy in a november cloud as the nature of the scene may require and in short the exhibition is just ready to commence  unless something should go wrongas for instance the misplacing of a picture whereby the people and events of one century might be thrust into the middle of another or the breaking of a wire which would bring the course of time to a sudden periodbarring i say the casualties to which such a complicated piece of mechanism is liablei flatter myself ladies and gentlementhat the performance will elicit your generous approbation  tingatingting  goes the bell the curtain rises and we beholdnot indeed the main streetbut the track of leafstrewn forestland over which its dusty pavement is hereafter to extend  you perceive at a glance that this is the ancient and primitive woodthe everyouthful and venerably oldverdant with new twigs yet hoary as it were with the snowfall of innumerable years that have accumulated upon its intermingled branches  the white mans axe has never smitten a single tree his footstep has never crumpled a single one of the withered leaves which all the autumns since the flood have been harvesting beneath  yet see along through the vista of impending boughs there is already a faintly traced path running nearly east and west as if a prophecy or foreboding of the future street had stolen into the heart of the solemn old wood  onward goes this hardly perceptible track now ascending over a natural swell of land now subsiding gently into a hollow traversed here by a little streamlet which glitters like a snake through the gleam of sunshine and quickly hides itself among the underbrush in its quest for the neighboring cove and impeded there by the massy corpse of a giant of the forest which had lived out its incalculable term of life and been overthrown by mere old age and lies buried in the new vegetation that is born of its decay  what footsteps can have worn this halfseen path  hark  do we not hear them now rustling softly over the leaves  we discern an indian womana majestic and queenly woman or else her spectral image does not represent her trulyfor this is the great squaw sachem whose rule with that of her sons extends from mystic to agawam  that red chief who stalks by her side is wappacowet her second husband the priest and magician whose incantations shall hereafter affright the palefaced settlers with grisly phantoms dancing and shrieking in the woods at midnight  but greater would be the affright of the indian necromancer if mirrored in the pool of water at his feet he could catch a prophetic glimpse of the noonday marvels which the white man is destined to achieve if he could see as in a dream the stone front of the stately hall which will cast its shadow over this very spot if he could be aware that the future edifice will contain a noble museum where among countless curiosities of earth and sea a few indian arrowheads shall be treasured up as memorials of a vanished race  no such forebodings disturb the squaw sachem and wappacowet  they pass on beneath the tangled shade holding high talk on matters of state and religion and imagine doubtless that their own system of affairs will endure forever  meanwhile how full of its own proper life is the scene that lies around them  the gray squirrel runs up the trees and rustles among the upper branches  was not that the leap of a deer  and there is the whirr of a partridge  methinks too i catch the cruel and stealthy eye of a wolf as he draws back into yonder impervious density of underbrush  so there amid the murmur of boughs go the indian queen and the indian priest while the gloom of the broad wilderness impends over them and its sombre mystery invests them as with something preternatural and only momentary streaks of quivering sunlight once in a great while find their way down and glimmer among the feathers in their dusky hair  can it be that the thronged street of a city will ever pass into this twilight solitudeover those soft heaps of the decaying treetrunks and through the swampy places green with watermoss and penetrate that hopeless entanglement of great trees which have been uprooted and tossed together by a whirlwind  it has been a wilderness from the creation  must it not be a wilderness forever  here an acidulouslooking gentleman in blue glasses with bows of berlin steel who has taken a seat at the extremity of the front row begins at this early stage of the exhibition to criticise  the whole affair is a manifest catchpenny observes he scarcely under his breath  the trees look more like weeds in a garden than a primitive forest the squaw sachem and wappacowet are stiff in their pasteboard joints and the squirrels the deer and the wolf move with all the grace of a childs wooden monkey sliding up and down a stick  i am obliged to you sir for the candor of your remarks replies the showman with a bow  perhaps they are just  human art has its limits and we must now and then ask a little aid from the spectators imagination  you will get no such aid from mine responds the critic  i make it a point to see things precisely as they are  but come go ahead the stage is waiting  the showman proceeds  casting our eyes again over the scene we perceive that strangers have found their way into the solitary place  in more than one spot among the trees an upheaved axe is glittering in the sunshine  roger conant the first settler in naumkeag has built his dwelling months ago on the border of the forestpath and at this moment he comes eastward through the vista of woods with his gun over his shoulder bringing home the choice portions of a deer  his stalwart figure clad in a leathern jerkin and breeches of the same strides sturdily onward with such an air of physical force and energy that we might almost expect the very trees to stand aside and give him room to pass  and so indeed they must for humble as is his name in history roger conant still is of that class of men who do not merely find but make their place in the system of human affairs a man of thoughtful strength he has planted the germ of a city  there stands his habitation showing in its rough architecture some features of the indian wigwam and some of the logcabin and somewhat too of the strawthatched cottage in old england where this good yeoman had his birth and breeding  the dwelling is surrounded by a cleared space of a few acres where indian corn grows thrivingly among the stumps of the trees while the dark forest hems it in and scenes to gaze silently and solemnly as if wondering at the breadth of sunshine which the white man spreads around him  an indian half hidden in the dusky shade is gazing and wondering too  within the door of the cottage you discern the wife with her ruddy english cheek  she is singing doubtless a psalm tune at her household work or perhaps she sighs at the remembrance of the cheerful gossip and all the merry social life of her native village beyond the vast and melancholy sea  yet the next moment she laughs with sympathetic glee at the sports of her little tribe of children and soon turns round with the homelook in her face as her husbands foot is heard approaching the roughhewn threshold  how sweet must it be for those who have an eden in their hearts like roger conant and his wife to find a new world to project it into as they have instead of dwelling among old haunts of men where so many household fires have been kindled and burnt out that the very glow of happiness has something dreary in it  not that this pair are alone in their wild eden for here comes goodwife massey the young spouse of jeffrey massey from her home hard by with an infant at her breast  dame conant has another of like age and it shall hereafter be one of the disputed points of history which of these two babies was the first townborn child  but see  roger conant has other neighbors within view  peter palfrey likewise has built himself a house and so has balch and norman and woodbury  their dwellings indeedsuch is the ingenious contrivance of this piece of pictorial mechanismseem to have arisen at various points of the scene even while we have been looking at it  the foresttrack trodden more and more by the hobnailed shoes of these sturdy and ponderous englishmen has now a distinctness which it never could have acquired from the light tread of a hundred times as many indian moccasins  it will be a street anon  as we observe it now it goes onward from one clearing to another here plunging into a shadowy strip of woods there open to the sunshine but everywhere showing a decided line along which human interests have begun to hold their career  over yonder swampy spot two trees have been felled and laid side by side to make a causeway  in another place the axe has cleared away a confused intricacy of fallen trees and clustered boughs which had been tossed together by a hurricane  so now the little children just beginning to run alone may trip along the path and not often stumble over an impediment unless they stray from it to gather woodberries beneath the trees  and besides the feet of grown people and children there are the cloven hoofs of a small herd of cows who seek their subsistence from the native grasses and help to deepen the track of the future thoroughfare goats also browse along it and nibble at the twigs that thrust themselves across the way  not seldom in its more secluded portions where the black shadow of the forest strives to hide the trace of humanfootsteps stalks a gaunt wolf on the watch for a kid or a young calf or fixes his hungry gaze on the group of children gathering berries and can hardly forbear to rush upon them  and the indians coming from their distant wigwams to view the white mans settlement marvel at the deep track which he makes and perhaps are saddened by a flitting presentiment that this heavy tread will find its way over all the land and that the wildwoods the wild wolf and the wild indian will alike be trampled beneath it  even so shall it be  the pavements of the main street must be laid over the red mans grave  behold here is a spectacle which should be ushered in by the peal of trumpets if naumkeag had ever yet heard that cheery music and by the roar of cannon echoing among the woods  a processionfor by its dignity as marking an epoch in the history of the street it deserves that namea procession advances along the pathway  the good ship abigail has arrived from england bringing wares and merchandise for the comfort of the inhabitants and traffic with the indians bringing passengers too and more important than all a governor for the new settlement  roger conant and peter palfrey with their companions have been to the shore to welcome him and now with such honor and triumph as their rude way of life permits are escorting the seaflushed voyagers to their habitations  at the point where endicott enters upon the scene two venerable trees unite their branches high above his head thus forming a triumphal arch of living verdure beneath which he pauses with his wife leaning on his arm to catch the first impression of their newfound home  the old settlers gaze not less earnestly at him than he at the hoary woods and the rough surface of the clearings  they like his bearded face under the shadow of the broadbrimmed and steeplecrowned puritan hata visage resolute grave and thoughtful yet apt to kindle with that glow of a cheerful spirit by which men of strong character are enabled to go joyfully on their proper tasks  his form too as you see it in a doublet and hose of sadcolored cloth is of a manly make fit for toil and hardship and fit to wield the heavy sword that hangs from his leathern belt  his aspect is a better warrant for the rulers office than the parchment commission which he bears however fortified it may be with the broad seal of the london council  peter palfrey nods to roger conant  the worshipful court of assistants have done wisely say they between themselves  they have chosen for our governor a man out of a thousand  then they toss up their hatsthey and all the uncouth figures of their company most of whom are clad in skins inasmuch as their old kersey and linseywoolsey garments have been torn and tattered by many a long months wearthey all toss up their hats and salute their new governor and captain with a hearty english shout of welcome we seem to hear it with our own ears so perfectly is the action represented in this lifelike this almost magic picture  but have you observed the lady who leans upon the arm of endicotta rose of beauty from an english garden now to be transplanted to a fresher soil  it may be that long yearscenturies indeedafter this fair flower shall have decayed other flowers of the same race will appear in the same soil and gladden other generations with hereditary beauty  does not the vision haunt us yet  has not nature kept the mould unbroken deeming it a pity that the idea should vanish from mortal sight forever after only once assuming earthly substance  do we not recognize in that fair womans face a model of features which still beam at happy meets on what was then the woodland pathway but has out since grown into a busy street  this is too ridiculouspositively insufferable mutters the same critic who had before expressed his disapprobation  here is a pasteboard figure such as a child would cut out of a card with a pair of very dull scissors and the fellow modestly requests us to see in it the prototype of hereditary beauty  but sir you have not the proper point of view remarks the showman you sit altogether too near to get the best effect of my pictorial exhibition  pray oblige me by removing to this other bench and i venture assure you the proper light and shadow will transform the spectacle into quite another thing  pshaw replies the critic i want no other light and shade  i have already told you that it is my business to see things just as they are  i would suggest to the author of this ingenious exhibition observes a gentlemanly person who has shown signs of being much interestedi would suggest that anna gower the first wife of governor endicott and who came with him from england left no posterity and that consequently we cannot be indebted to that honorable lady for any specimens of feminine loveliness now extant among us  having nothing to allege against this genealogical objection the showman points again to the scene  during this little interruption you perceive that the anglosaxon energyas the phrase now goeshas been at work in the spectacle before us  so many chimneys now send up their smoke that it begins to have the aspect of a village street although everything is so inartificial and inceptive that it seems as if one returning wave of the wild nature might overwhelm it all  but the one edifice which gives the pledge of permanence to this bold enterprise is seen at the central point of the picture  there stands the meetinghouse a small structure lowroofed without a spire and built of rough timber newly hewn with the sap still in the logs and here and there a strip of bark adhering to them a meaner temple was never consecrated to the worship of the deity  with the alternative of kneeling beneath the awful vault of the firmament it is strange that men should creep into this pentup nook and expect gods presence there  such at least one would imagine might be the feeling of these forestsettlers accustomed as they had been to stand under the dim arches of vast cathedrals and to offer up their hereditary worship in the old ivycovered churches of rural england around which lay the bones of many generations of their forefathers  how could they dispense with the carved altarworkhow with the pictured windows where the light of common day was hallowed by being transmitted through the glorified figures of saintshow with the lofty roof imbued as it must have been with the prayers that had gone upward for centurieshow with the rich peal of the solemn organ rolling along the aisles pervading the whole church and sweeping the soul away on a flood of audible religion  they needed nothing of all this  their house of worship like their ceremonial was naked simple and severe  but the zeal of a recovered faith burned like a lamp within their hearts enriching everything around them with its radiance making of these new walls and this narrow compass its own cathedral and being in itself that spiritual mystery and experience of which sacred architecture pictured windows and the organs grand solemnity are remote and imperfect symbols  all was well so long as their lamps were freshly kindled at heavenly flame  after a while however whether in their time or their childrens these lamps began to burn more dimly or with a less genuine lustre and then it might be seen how hard cold and confined was their systemhow like an iron cage was that which they called liberty  too much of this  look again at the picture and observe how the aforesaid anglosaxon energy is now trampling along the street and raising a positive cloud of dust beneath its sturdy footsteps  for there the carpenters are building a new house the frame of which was hewn and fitted in england of english oak and sent hither on shipboard and here a blacksmith makes huge slang and clatter on his anvil shaping out tools and weapons and yonder a wheelwright who boasts himself a london workman regularly bred to his handicraft is fashioning a set of wagonwheels the track of which wall soon be visible  the wild forest is shrinking back the street has lost the aromatic odor of the pinetrees and of the sweetfern that grew beneath them  the tender and modest wildflowers those gentle children of savage nature that grew pale beneath the everbrooding shade have shrank away and disappeared like stars that vanish in the breadth of light  gardens are fenced in and display pumpkinbeds and rows of cabbages and beans and though the governor and the minister both view them with a disapproving eye plants of broadleaved tobacco which the cultivators are enjoined to use privily or not at all  no wolf for a year past has been heard to bark or known to range among the dwellings except that single one whose grisly head with a plash of blood beneath it is now affixed to the portal of the meetinghouse  the partridge has ceased to run across the toofrequented path  of all the wild life that used to throng here only the indians still come into the settlement bringing the skins of beaver and otter bear and elk which they sell to endicott for the wares of england  and there is little john massey the son of jeffrey massey and firstborn of naumkeag playing beside his fathers threshold a child of six or seven years old  which is the bettergrown infantthe town or the boy  the red men have become aware that the street is no longer free to them save by the sufferance and permission of the settlers  often to impress them with an awe of english power there is a muster and training of the townforces and a stately march of the mailclad band like this which we now see advancing up the street  there they come fifty of them or more all with their iron breastplates and steel caps well burnished and glimmering bravely against the sun their ponderous muskets on their shoulders their bandaliers about their waists their lighted matches in their hands and the drum and fife playing cheerily before them  see do they not step like martial men  do they not manoeuvre like soldiers who have seen stricken fields  and well they may for this band is composed of precisely such materials as those with which cromwell is preparing to beat down the strength of a kingdom and his famous regiment of ironsides might be recruited from just such men  in everything at this period new england was the essential spirit and flower of that which was about to become uppermost in the mothercountry  many a bold and wise man lost the fame which would have accrued to him in english history by crossing the atlantic with our forefathers  many a valiant captain who might have been foremost at marston moor or naseby exhausted his martial ardor in the command of a logbuilt fortress like that which you observe on the gently rising ground at the right of the pathwayits banner fluttering in the breeze and the culverins and sakers showing their deadly muzzles over the rampart  a multitude of people were now thronging to new england some because the ancient and ponderous framework of church and state threatened to crumble down upon their heads others because they despaired of such a downfall  among those who came to naumkeag were men of history and legend whose feet leave a track of brightness along any pathway which they have trodden  you shall behold their lifelike imagestheir spectres if you choose so to call thempassing encountering with a familiar nod stopping to converse together praying bearing weapons laboring or resting from their labors in the main street  here now comes hugh peters an earnest restless man walking swiftly as being impelled by that fiery activity of nature which shall hereafter thrust him into the conflict of dangerous affairs make him the chaplain and counsellor of cromwell and finally bring him to a bloody end  he pauses by the meetinghouse to exchange a greeting with roger williams whose face indicates methinks a gentler spirit kinder and more expansive than that of peters yet not less active for what he discerns to be the will of god or the welfare of mankind  and look here is a guest for endicott coming forth out of the forest through which he has been journeying from boston and which with its rude branches has caught hold of his attire and has wet his feet with its swamps and streams  still there is something in his mild and venerable though not aged presencea propriety an equilibrium in governor winthrops naturethat causes the disarray of his costume to be unnoticed and gives us the same impression as if he were clad in such rave and rich attire as we may suppose him to have worn in the council chamber of the colony  is not this characteristic wonderfully perceptible in our spectral representative of his person  but what dignitary is this crossing from the other side to greet the governor  a stately personage in a dark velvet cloak with a hoary beard and a gold chain across his breast he has the authoritative port of one who has filled the highest civic station in the first of cities  of all men in the world we should least expect to meet the lord mayor of londonas sir richard saltonstall has been once and againin a forestbordered settlement of the western wilderness  farther down the street we see emanuel downing a grave and worthy citizen with his son george a stripling who has a career before him his shrewd and quick capacity and pliant conscience shall not only exalt him high but secure him from a downfall  here is another figure on whose characteristic make and expressive action i will stake the credit of my pictorial puppetshow  have you not already detected a quaint sly humor in that facean eccentricity in the mannera certain indescribable waywardnessall the marks in short of an original man unmistakably impressed yet kept down by a sense of clerical restraint  that is nathaniel ward the minister of ipswich but better remembered as the simple cobbler of agawam  he hammered his sole so faithfully and stitched his upperleather so well that the shoe is hardly yet worn out though thrown aside for some two centuries past  and next among these puritans and roundheads we observe the very model of a cavalier with the curling lovelock the fantastically trimmed beard the embroidery the ornamented rapier the gilded dagger and all other foppishnesses that distinguished the wild gallants who rode headlong to their overthrow in the cause of king charles  this is morton of merry mount who has come hither to hold a council with endicott but will shortly be his prisoner  yonder pale decaying figure of a whiterobed woman who glides slowly along the street is the lady arabella looking for her own grave in the virgin soil  that other female form who seems to be talkingwe might almost say preaching or expoundingin the centre of a group of profoundly attentive auditors is ann hutchinson  and here comes vane  but my dear sir interrupts the same gentleman who before questioned the showmans genealogical accuracy allow me to observe that these historical personages could not possibly have met together in the main street  they might and probably did all visit our old town at one time or another but not simultaneously and you have fallen into anachronisms that i positively shudder to think of  the fellow adds the scarcely civil critic has learned a beadroll of historic names whom he lugs into his pictorial puppetshow as he calls it helterskelter without caring whether they were contemporaries or notand sets them all by the ears together  but was there ever such a fund of impudence  to hear his running commentary you would suppose that these miserable slips of painted pasteboard with hardly the remotest outlines of the human figure had all the character and expression of michael angeles pictures  well go on sir  sir you break the illusion of the scene mildly remonstrates the showman  illusion  what illusion rejoins the critic with a contemptuous snort  on the word of a gentleman i see nothing illusive in the wretchedly bedaubed sheet of canvas that forms your background or in these pasteboard slips that hitch and jerk along the front  the only illusion permit me to say is in the puppetshowmans tongueand that but a wretched one into the bargain  we public men replies the showman meekly must lay our account sometimes to meet an uncandid severity of criticism  butmerely for your own pleasure sirlet me entreat you to take another point of view sit farther back by that young lady in whose face i have watched the reflection of every changing scene only oblige me by sitting there and take my word for it the slips of pasteboard shall assume spiritual life and the bedaubed canvas become an airy and changeable reflex of what it purports to represent  i know better retorts the critic settling himself in his seat with sullen but selfcomplacent immovableness  and as for my own pleasure i shall best consult it by remaining precisely where i am  the showman bows and waves his hand and at the signal as if time and vicissitude had been awaiting his permission to move onward the mimic street becomes alive again  years have rolled over our scene and converted the foresttrack into a dusty thoroughfare which being intersected with lanes and crosspaths may fairly be designated as the main street  on the groundsites of many of the logbuilt sheds into which the first settlers crept for shelter houses of quaint architecture have now risen  these later edifices are built as you see in one generally accordant style though with such subordinate variety as keeps the beholders curiosity excited and causes each structure like its owners character to produce its own peculiar impression  most of them have a huge chimney in the centre with flues so vast that it must have been easy for the witches to fly out of them as they were wont to do when bound on an aerial visit to the black man in the forest  around this great chimney the wooden house clusters itself in a whole community of gableends each ascending into its own karate peak the second story with its latticewindows projecting over the first and the door which is perhaps arched provided on the outside with an iron hammer wherewith the visitors hand may give a thundering ratatat  the timber framework of these houses as compared with those of recent date is like the skeleton of an old giant beside the frail bones of a modern man of fashion  many of them by the vast strength and soundness of their oaken substance have been preserved through a length of time which would have tried the stability of brick and stone so that in all the progressive decay and continual reconstruction of the street down our own days we shall still behold these old edifices occupying their longaccustomed sites  for instance on the upper corner of that green lane which shall hereafter be north street we see the curwen house newly built with the carpenters still at work on the roof nailing down the last sheaf of shingles  on the lower corner stands another dwellingdestined at some period of its existence to be the abode of an unsuccessful alchemistwhich shall likewise survive to our own generation and perhaps long outlive it  thus through the medium of these patriarchal edifices we have now established a sort of kindred and hereditary acquaintance with the main street  great as is the transformation produced by a short term of years each single day creeps through the puritan settlement sluggishly enough  it shall pass before your eyes condensed into the space of a few moments the gray light of early morning is slowly diffusing itself over the scene and the bellman whose office it is to cry the hour at the streetcorners rings the last peal upon his hand bell and goes wearily homewards with the owls the bats and other creatures of the night lattices are thrust back on their hinges as if the town were opening its eyes in the summer morning  forth stumbles the still drowsy cowherd with his horn putting which to his lips it emits a bellowing bray impossible to be represented in the picture but which reaches the prickedup ears of every cow in the settlement and tells her that the dewy pasturehour is come  house after house awakes and sends the smoke up curling from its chimney like frosty breath from living nostrils and as those white wreaths of smoke though impregnated with earthy admixtures climb skyward so from each dwelling does the morning worshipits spiritual essence bearing up its human imperfectionfind its way to the heavenly fathers throne  the breakfasthour being passed the inhabitants do not as usual go to their fields or workshops but remain within doors or perhaps walk the street with a grave sobriety yet a disengaged and unburdened aspect that belongs neither to a holiday nor a sabbath  and indeed this passing day is neither nor is it a common weekday although partaking of all the three  it is the thursday lecture an institution which new england has long ago relinquished and almost forgotten yet which it would have been better to retain as bearing relations to both the spiritual and ordinary life and bringing each acquainted with the other the tokens of its observance however which here meet our eyes are of rather a questionable cast  it is in one sense a day of public shame the day on which transgressors who have made themselves liable to the minor severities of the puritan law receive their reward of ignominy  at this very moment this constable has bound an idle fellow to the whippingpost and is giving him his deserts with a catonine tails ever since sunrise daniel fairfield has been standing on the steps of the meetinghouse with a halter about his neck which he is condemned to wear visibly throughout his lifetime dorothy talby is chained to a post at the corner of prison lane with the hot sun blazing on her matronly face and all for no other offence than lifting her hand against her husband while through the bars of that great wooden cage in the centre of the scene we discern either a human being or a wild beast or both in one whom this public infamy causes to roar and gnash his teeth and shake the strong oaken bars as if he would breakforth and tear in pieces the little children who have been peeping at him  such are the profitable sights that serve the good people to while away the earlier part of lectureday  betimes in the forenoon a travellerthe first traveller that has come hitherward this morningrides slowly into the street on his patient steed  he seems a clergyman and as he draws near we recognize the minister of lynn who was preengaged to lecture here and has been revolving his discourse as he rode through the hoary wilderness  behold now the whole town thronging into the meetinghouse mostly with such sombre visages that the sunshine becomes little better than a shadow when it falls upon them  there go the thirteen men grim rulers of a grim community  there goes john massey the first townborn child now a youth of twenty whose eye wanders with peculiar interest towards that buxom damsel who comes up the steps at the same instant  there hobbles goody foster a sour and bitter old beldam looking as if she went to curse and not to pray and whom many of her neighbors suspect of taking an occasional airing on a broomstick  there too slinking shamefacedly in you observe that same poor donothing and goodfornothing whom we saw castigated just now at the whippingpost last of all there goes the tithingman lugging in a couple of small boys whom he has caught at play beneath gods blessed sunshine in a back lane  what native of naumkeag whose recollections go back more than thirty years does not still shudder at that dark ogre of his infancy who perhaps had long ceased to have an actual existence but still lived in his childish belief in a horrible idea and in the nurses threat as the tidy man  it will be hardly worth our while to wait two or it may be three turnings of the hourglass for the conclusion of the lecture therefore by my control over light and darkness i cause the dusk and then the starless night to brood over the street and summon forth again the bellman with his lantern casting a gleam about his footsteps to pace wearily from corner to corner and shout drowsily the hour to drowsy or dreaming ears  happy are we if for nothing else yet because we did not live in those days  in truth when the first novelty and stir of spirit had subsidedwhen the new settlement between the forestborder and the sea had become actually a little townits daily life must have trudged onward with hardly anything to diversify and enliven it while also its rigidity could not fail to cause miserable distortions of the moral nature  such a life was sinister to the intellect and sinister to the heart especially when one generation had bequeathed its religious gloom and the counterfeit of its religious ardor to the next for these characteristics as was inevitable assumed the form both of hypocrisy and exaggeration by being inherited from the example and precept of other human beings and not from an original and spiritual source  the sons and grandchildren of the first settlers were a race of lower and narrower souls than their progenitors had been  the latter were stern severe intolerant but not superstitious not even fanatical and endowed if any men of that age were with a farseeing worldly sagacity but it was impossible for the succeeding race to grow up in heavens freedom beneath the discipline which their gloomy energy of character had established nor it may be have we even yet thrown off all the unfavorable influences which among many good ones were bequeathed to us by our puritan forefathers  let us thank god for having given us such ancestors and let each successive generation thank him not less fervently for being one step further from them in the march of ages  what is all this cries the critic  a sermon  if so it is not in the bill  very true replies the showman and i ask pardon of the audience  look now at the street and observe a strange people entering it  their garments are torn and disordered their faces haggard their figures emaciated for they have made their way hither through pathless deserts suffering hunger and hardship with no other shelter thin a hollow tree the lair of a wild beast or an indian wigwam  nor in the most inhospitable and dangerous of such lodgingplaces was there half the peril that awaits them in this thoroughfare of christian men with those secure dwellings and warm hearths on either side of it and yonder meetinghouse as the central object of the scene  these wanderers have received from heaven a gift that in all epochs of the world has brought with it the penalties of mortal suffering and persecution scorn enmity and death itselfa gift that thus terrible to its possessors has ever been most hateful to all other men since its very existence seems to threaten the overthrow of whatever else the toilsome ages have built upthe gift of a new idea  you can discern it in them illuminating their facestheir whole persons indeed however earthly and cloddishwith a light that inevitably shines through and makes the startled community aware that these men are not as they themselves arenot brethren nor neighbors of their thought  forthwith it is as if an earthquake rumbled through the town making its vibrations felt at every hearthstone and especially causing the spire of the meetinghouse to totter  the quakers have come  we are in peril  see they trample upon our wise and wellestablished laws in the person of our chief magistrate for governor endicott is passing now an aged man and dignified with long habits of authorityand not one of the irreverent vagabonds has moved his bat  did you note the ominous frown of the whitebearded puritan governor as he turned himself about and in his anger half uplifted the staff that has become a needful support to his old age  here comes old mr norris our venerable minister  will they doff their hats and pay reverence to him  no their hats stick fast to their ungracious heads as if they grew there andimpious varlets that they are and worse than the heathen indiansthey eye our reverend pastor with a peculiar scorn distrust unbelief and utter denial of his sanctified pretensions of which he himself immediately becomes conscious the more bitterly conscious as he never knew nor dreamed of the like before  but look yonder  can we believe our eyes  a quaker woman clad in sackcloth and with ashes on her head has mounted the steps of the meetinghouse  she addresses the people in a wild shrill voicewild and shrill it must be to suit such a figurewhich makes them tremble and turn pale although they crowd openmouthed to hear her  she is bold against established authority she denounces the priest and his steeplehouse  many of her hearers are appalled some weep and others listen with a rapt attention as if a living truth had now for the first time forced its way through the crust of habit reached their hearts and awakened them to life  this matter must be looked to else we have brought our faith across the seas with us in vain and it had been better that the old forest were still standing here waving its tangled boughs and murmuring to the sky out of its desolate recesses instead of this goodly street if such blasphemies be spoken in it  so thought the old puritans  what was their mode of action may be partly judged from the spectacles which now pass before your eyes  joshua buffum is standing in the pillory  cassandra southwick is led to prison and there a woman it is ann colemannaked from the waist upward and bound to the tail of a cart is dragged through the main street at the pace of a brisk walk while the constable follows with a whip of knotted cords  a strongarmed fellow is that constable and each time that he flourishes his lash in the air you see a frown wrinkling and twisting his brow and at the same instant a smile upon his lips  he loves his business faithful officer that he is and puts his soul into every stroke zealous to fulfil the injunction of major hawthornes warrant in the spirit and to the letter  there came down a stroke that has drawn blood  ten such stripes are to be given in salem ten in boston and ten in dedham and with those thirty stripes of blood upon her she is to be driven into the forest  the crimson trail goes wavering along the main street but heaven grant that as the rain of so many years has wept upon it time after time and washed it all away so there may have been a dew of mercy to cleanse this cruel bloodstain out of the record of the persecutors life  pass on thou spectral constable and betake thee to thine own place of torment  meanwhile by the silent operation of the mechanism behind the scenes a considerable space of time would seem to have lapsed over the street  the older dwellings now begin to look weatherbeaten through the effect of the many eastern storms that have moistened their unpainted shingles and clapboards for not less than forty years  such is the age we would assign to the town judging by the aspect of john massey the first townborn child whom his neighbors now call goodman massey and whom we see yonder a grave almost autumnallooking man with children of his own about him  to the patriarchs of the settlement no doubt the main street is still but an affair of yesterday hardly more antique even if destined to be more permanent than a path shovelled through the snow  but to the middleaged and elderly men who came hither in childhood or early youth it presents the aspect of a long and wellestablished work on which they have expended the strength and ardor of their life  and the younger people native to the street whose earliest recollections are of creeping over the paternal threshold and rolling on the grassy margin of the track look at it as one of the perdurable things of our mortal stateas old as the hills of the great pasture or the headland at the harbors mouth  their fathers and grandsires tell them how within a few years past the forest stood here with but a lonely track beneath its tangled shade  vain legend  they cannot make it true and real to their conceptions  with them moreover the main street is a street indeed worthy to hold its way with the thronged and stately avenues of cities beyond the sea  the old puritans tell them of the crowds that hurry along cheapside and fleet street and the strand and of the rush of tumultuous life at temple bar  they describe london bridge itself a street with a row of houses on each side they speak of the vast structure of the tower and the solemn grandeur of westminster abbey  the children listen and still inquire if the streets of london are longer and broader than the one before their fathers door if the tower is bigger than the jail in prison lane if the old abbey will hold a larger congregation than our meetinghouse  nothing impresses them except their own experience  it seems all a fable too that wolves have ever prowled here and not less so that the squaw sachem and the sagamore her son once ruled over this region and treated as sovereign potentates with the english settlers then so few and stormbeaten now so powerful  there stand some schoolboys you observe in a little group around a drunken indian himself a prince of the squaw sachems lineage  he brought hither some beaverskins for sale and has already swallowed the larger portion of their price in deadly draughts of firewater  is there not a touch of pathos in that picture and does it not go far towards telling the whole story of the vast growth and prosperity of one race and the fated decay of anotherthe children of the stranger making game of the great squaw sachems grandson  but the whole race of red men have not vanished with that wild princess and her posterity  this march of soldiers along the street betokens the breaking out of king philips war and these young men the flower of essex are on their way to defend the villages on the connecticut where at bloody brook a terrible blow shall be smitten and hardly one of that gallant band be left alive  and there at that stately mansion with its three peaks in front and its two little peaked towers one on either side of the door we see brave captain gardner issuing forth clad in his embroidered buffcoat and his plumed cap upon his head  his trusty sword in its steel scabbard strikes clanking on the doorstep  see how the people throng to their doors and windows as the cavalier rides past reining his mettled steed so gallantly and looking so like the very soul and emblem of martial achievementdestined too to meet a warriors fate at the desperate assault on the fortress of the narragansetts  the mettled steed looks like a pig interrupts the critic and captain gardner himself like the devil though a very tame one and on a most diminutive scale  sir sir cries the persecuted showman losing all patiencefor indeed he had particularly prided himself on these figures of captain gardner and his horsei see that there is no hope of pleasing you pray sir do me the favor to take back your money and withdraw  not i answers the unconscionable critic  i am just beginning to get interested in the matter  come turn your crank and grind out a few more of these fooleries  the showman rubs his brow impulsively whisks the little rod with which he points out the notabilities of the scene but finally with the inevitable acquiescence of all public servants resumes his composure and goes on  pass onward onward time  build up new houses here and tear down thy works of yesterday that have already the rusty moss upon them  summon forth the minister to the abode of the young maiden and bid him unite her to the joyful bridegroom  let the youthful parents carry their firstborn to the meetinghouse to receive the baptismal rite  knock at the door whence the sable line of the funeral is next to issue  provide other successive generations of men to trade talk quarrel or walk in friendly intercourse along the street as their fathers did before them do all thy daily and accustomed business father time in this thoroughfare which thy footsteps for so many years have now made dusty  but here at last thou leadest along a procession which once witnessed shall appear no more and be remembered only as a hideous dream of thine or a frenzy of thy old brain  turn your crank i say bellows the remorseless critic and grind it out whatever it be without further preface  the showman deems it best to comply  then here comes the worshipful captain curwen sheriff of essex on horseback at the head of an armed guard escorting a company of condemned prisoners from the jail to their place of execution on gallows hill  the witches  there is no mistaking them  the witches  as they approach up prison lane and turn into the main street let us watch their faces as if we made a part of the pale crowd that presses so eagerly about them yet shrinks back with such shuddering dread leaving an open passage betwixt a dense throng on either side  listen to what the people say  there is old george jacobs known hereabouts these sixty years as a man whom we thought upright in all his way of life quiet blameless a good husband before his pious wife was summoned from the evil to come and a good father to the children whom she left him  ah but when that blessed woman went to heaven george jacobss heart was empty his hearth lonely his life broken tip his children were married and betook themselves to habitations of their own and satan in his wanderings up and down beheld this forlorn old man to whom life was a sameness and a weariness and found the way to tempt him  so the miserable sinner was prevailed with to mount into the air and career among the clouds and he is proved to have been present at a witchmeeting as far off as falmouth on the very same night that his next neighbors saw him with his rheumatic stoop going in at his own door  there is john willard too an honest man we thought him and so shrewd and active in his business so practical so intent on everyday affairs so constant at his little place of trade where he bartered english goods for indian corn and all kinds of country produce  how could such a man find time or what could put it into his mind to leave his proper calling and become a wizard it is a mystery unless the black man tempted him with great heaps of gold  see that aged couplea sad sight trulyjohn proctor and his wife elizabeth  if there were two old people in all the county of essex who seemed to have led a true christian life and to be treading hopefully the little remnant of their earthly path it was this very pair  yet have we heard it sworn to the satisfaction of the worshipful chiefjustice sewell and all the court and jury that proctor and his wife have shown their withered faces at childrens bedsides mocking making mouths and affrighting the poor little innocents in the nighttime  they or their spectral appearances have stuck pins into the afflicted ones and thrown them into deadly faintingfits with a touch or but a look  and while we supposed the old man to be reading the bible to his old wifeshe meanwhile knitting in the chimneycornerthe pair of hoary reprobates have whisked up the chimney both on one broomstick and flown away to a witchcommunion far into the depths of the chill dark forest  how foolish  were it only for fear of rheumatic pains in their old bones they had better have stayed at home  but away they went and the laughter of their decayed cackling voices has been heard at midnight aloft in the air  now in the sunny noontide as they go tottering to the gallows it is the devils turn to laugh  behind these twowho help another along and seem to be comforting and encouraging each other in a manner truly pitiful if it were not a sin to pity the old witch and wizardbehind them comes a woman with a dark proud face that has been beautiful and a figure that is still majestic do you know her  it is martha carrier whom the devil found in a humble cottage and looked into her discontented heart and saw pride there and tempted her with his promise that she should be queen of hell  and now with that lofty demeanor she is passing to her kingdom and by her unquenchable pride transforms this escort of shame into a triumphal procession that shall attend her to the gates of her infernal palace and seat her upon the fiery throne  within this hour she shall assume her royal dignity  last of the miserable train comes a man clad in black of small stature and a dark complexion with a clerical band about his neck  many a time in the years gone by that face has been uplifted heavenward from the pulpit of the east meetinghouse when the rev mr burroughs seemed to worship god  whathe  the holy manthe learnedthe wise  how has the devil tempted him  his fellowcriminals for the most part are obtuse uncultivated creatures some of them scarcely halfwitted by nature and others greatly decayed in their intellects through age  they were an easy prey for the destroyer  not so with this george burroughs as we judge by the inward light which glows through his dark countenance and we might almost say glorifies his figure in spite of the soil and haggardness of long imprisonmentin spite of the heavy shadow that must fall on him while death is walking by his side  what bribe could satan offer rich enough to tempt and overcome this mail  alas it may have been in the very strength of his high and searching intellect that the tempter found the weakness which betrayed him  he yearned for knowledge he went groping onward into a world of mystery at first as the witnesses have sworn he summoned up the ghosts of his two dead wives and talked with them of matters beyond the grave and when their responses failed to satisfy the intense and sinful craving of his spirit he called on satan and was heard  yetto look at himwho that had not known the proof could believe him guilty  who would not say while we see him offering comfort to the weak and aged partners of his horrible crimewhile we hear his ejaculations of prayer that seem to bubble up out of the depths of his heart and fly heavenward unawareswhile we behold a radiance brightening on his features as from the other world which is but a few steps offwho would not say that over the dusty track of the main street a christian saint is now going to a martyrs death  may not the archfiend have been too subtle for the court and jury and betrayed themlaughing in his sleeve the whileinto the awful error of pouring out sanctified blood as an acceptable sacrifice upon gods altar  ah no for listen to wise cotton mather who as he sits there on his horse speaks comfortably to the perplexed multitude and tells them that all has been religiously and justly done and that satans power shall this day receive its deathblow in new england  heaven grant it be sothe great scholar must be right so lead the poor creatures to their death  do you see that group of children and halfgrown girls and among them an old haglike indian woman tituba by me  those are the afflicted ones  behold at this very instant a proof of satans power and malice  mercy parris the ministers daughter has been smitten by a flash of martha carriers eye and falls down in the street writhing with horrible spasms and foaming at the mouth like the possessed one spoken of in scripture  hurry on the accursed witches to the gallows ere they do more mischiefere they fling out their withered aims and scatter pestilence by handfuls among the crowdere as their parting legacy they cast a blight over the land so that henceforth it may bear no fruit nor blade of grass and be fit for nothing but a sepulchre for their unhallowed carcasses  so on they go and old george jacobs has stumbled by reason of his infirmity but goodman proctor and his wife lean on one another and walk at a reasonably steady pace considering their age  mr burroughs seems to administer counsel to martha carrier whose face and mien methinks are milder and humbler than they were  among the multitude meanwhile there is horror fear and distrust and friend looks askance at friend and the husband at his wife and the wife at him and even the mother at her little child as if in every creature that god has made they suspected a witch or dreaded an accuser  never never again whether in this or any other shape may universal madness riot in the main street  i perceive in your eyes my indulgent spectators the criticism which you are too kind to utter  these scenes you think are all too sombre  so indeed they are but the blame must rest on the sombre spirit of our forefathers who wove their web of life with hardly a single thread of rosecolor or gold and not on me who have a tropiclove of sunshine and would gladly gild all the world with it if i knew where to find so much  that you may believe me i will exhibit one of the only class of scenes so far as my investigation has taught me in which our ancestors were wont to steep their tough old hearts in wine and strong drink and indulge an outbreak of grisly jollity  here it comes out of the same house whence we saw brave captain gardner go forth to the wars  what  a coffin borne on mens shoulders and six aged gentlemen as pallbearers and a long train of mourners with black gloves and black hatbands and everything black save a white handkerchief in each mourners hand to wipe away his tears withal  now my kind patrons you are angry with me  you were bidden to a bridaldance and find yourselves walking in a funeral procession  even so but look back through all the social customs of new england in the first century of her existence and read all her traits of character and if you find one occasion other than a funeral feast where jollity was sanctioned by universal practice i will set fire to my puppetshow without another word  these are the obsequies of old governor bradstreet the patriarch and survivor of the first settlers who having intermarried with the widow gardner is now resting from his labors at the great age of ninetyfour  the whitebearded corpse which was his spirits earthly garniture now lies beneath yonder coffinlid  many a cask of ale and cider is on tap and many a draught of spiced wine and aquavitae has been quaffed  else why should the bearers stagger as they tremulously uphold the coffinand the aged pallbearers too as they strive to walk solemnly beside itand wherefore do the mourners tread on one anothers heelsand why if we may ask without offence should the nose of the rev mr noyes through which he has just been delivering the funeral discourse glow like a ruddy coal of fire  well well old friends  pass on with your burden of mortality and lay it in the tomb with jolly hearts  people should be permitted to enjoy themselves in their own fashion every man to his taste but new england must have been a dismal abode for the man of pleasure when the only booncompanion was death  under cover of a mist that has settled over the scene a few years flit by and escape our notice  as the atmosphere becomes transparent we perceive a decrepit grandsire hobbling along the street  do you recognize him  we saw him first as the baby in goodwife masseys arms when the primeval trees were flinging their shadow over roger conants cabin we have seen him as the boy the youth the man bearing his humble part in all the successive scenes and forming the indexfigure whereby to note the age of his coeval town  and here he is old goodman massey taking his last walkoften pausingoften leaning over his staffand calling to mind whose dwelling stood at such and such a spot and whose field or garden occupied the site of those more recent houses he can render a reason for all the bends and deviations of the thoroughfare which in its flexible and plastic infancy was made to swerve aside from a straight line in order to visit every settlers door  the main street is still youthful the coeval man is in his latest age  soon he will be gone a patriarch of fourscore yet shall retain a sort of infantine life in our local history as the first townborn child  behold here a change wrought in the twinkling of an eye like an incident in a tale of magic even while your observation has been fixed upon the scene  the main street has vanished out of sight  in its stead appears a wintry waste of snow with the sun just peeping over it cold and bright and tingeing the white expanse with the faintest and most ethereal rosecolor  this is the great snow of 1717 famous for the mountaindrifts in which it buried the whole country  it would seem as if the street the growth of which we have noted so attentively following it from its first phase as an indian track until it reached the dignity of sidewalks were all at once obliterated and resolved into a drearier pathlessness than when the forest covered it  the gigantic swells and billows of the snow have swept over each mans metes and bounds and annihilated all the visible distinctions of human property so that now the traces of former times and hitherto accomplished deeds being done away mankind should be at liberty to enter on new paths and guide themselves by other laws than heretofore if indeed the race be not extinct and it be worth our while to go on with the march of life over the cold and desolate expanse that lies before us  it may be however that matters are not so desperate as they appear  that vast icicle glittering so cheerlessly in the sunshine must be the spire of the meetinghouse incrusted with frozen sleet  those great heaps too which we mistook for drifts are houses buried up to their eaves and with their peaked roofs rounded by the depth of snow upon them  there now comes a gush of smoke from what i judge to be the chimney of the ship tavernand anotheranotherand anotherfrom the chimneys of other dwellings where fireside comfort domestic peace the sports of children and the quietude of age are living yet in spite of the frozen crust above them  but it is time to change the scene  its dreary monotony shall not test your fortitude like one of our actual new england winters which leaves so large a blankso melancholy a deathspotin lives so brief that they ought to be all summertime  here at least i may claim to be ruler of the seasons  one turn of the crank shall melt away the snow from the main street and show the trees in their full foliage the rosebushes in bloom and a border of green grass along the sidewalk  there  but what how  the scene will not move  a wire is broken  the street continues buried beneath the snow and the fate of herculaneum and pompeii has its parallel in this catastrophe  alas  my kind and gentle audience you know not the extent of your misfortune  the scenes to come were far better than the past  the street itself would have been more worthy of pictorial exhibition the deeds of its inhabitants not less so  and how would your interest have deepened as passing out of the cold shadow of antiquity in my long and weary course i should arrive within the limits of mans memory and leading you at last into the sunshine of the present should give a reflex of the very life that is flitting past us  your own beauty my fair townswomen would have beamed upon you out of my scene  not a gentleman that walks the street but should have beheld his own face and figure his gait the peculiar swing of his arm and the coat that he put on yesterday  then tooand it is what i chiefly regreti had expended a vast deal of light and brilliancy on a representation of the street in its whole length from buffums corner downward on the night of the grand illumination for general taylors triumph  lastly i should have given the crank one other turn and have brought out the future showing you who shall walk the main street tomorrow and perchance whose funeral shall pass through it  but these like most other human purposes lie unaccomplished and i have only further to say that any lady or gentlemen who may feel dissatisfied with the evenings entertainment shall receive back the admission fee at the door  then give me mine cries the critic stretching out his palm  i said that your exhibition would prove a humbug and so it has turned out  so hand over my quarter
