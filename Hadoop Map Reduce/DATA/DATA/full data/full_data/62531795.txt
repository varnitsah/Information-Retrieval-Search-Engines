sheltered peoples mirth in jesting guisebut ye are wise and ye know what the jest is worth   general summary  we are very slightly changed from the semiapes who ranged    indias prehistoric clay whoso

viceroys praise    through the toil of other men  ere they hewed the sphinxs visage favoritism governed kissage even as it does in this age  who shall doubt the secret hid under cheops pyramid was that the contractor did    cheops out of several millions or that josephs sudden rise to comptroller of supplies was a fraud of monstrous size    on king pharoahs swart civilians  thus the artless songs i sing do not deal with anything    new or never said before  as it was in the beginning is today official sinning    and shall be forevermore   army headquarters  old is the song that i sing    old as my unpaid bills old as the chicken that kitmutgars bring men at dakbungalowsold as the hills  ahasuerus jenkins of the operatic own was dowered with a tenor voice of supersantley tone  his views on equitation were perhaps a trifle queer he had no seat worth mentioning but oh he had an ear  he clubbed his wretched company a dozen times a day he used to quit his charger in a parabolic way his method of saluting was the joy of all beholders but ahasuerus jenkins had a head upon his shoulders  he took two months to simla when the year was at the spring and underneath the deodars eternally did sing  he warbled like a bulbul but particularly at cornelia agrippina who was musical and fat  she controlled a humble husband who in turn controlled a dept where cornelia agrippinas human singingbirds were kept from april to october on a plump retaining fee supplied of course per mensem by the indian treasury  cornelia used to sing with him and jenkins used to play he praised unblushingly her notes for he was false as they so when the winds of april turned the budding roses brown cornelia told her husband tom you mustnt send him down  they haled him from his regiment which didnt much regret him they found for him an officestool and on that stool they set him to play with maps and catalogues three idle hours a day and draw his plump retaining feewhich means his double pay  now ever after dinner when the coffeecups are brought ahasuerus waileth oer the grand pianoforte and thanks to fair cornelia his fame hath waxen great and ahasuerus jenkins is a power in the state  study of an elevation in indian ink  this ditty is a string of lies buthow the deuce did gubbins rise  potiphar gubbins c e stands at the top of the tree and i muse in my bed on the reasons

quetta    he didnt understand the reason of his transfer    from the pleasant mountainland the season was september    and it killed him out of hand  jack barrett went to quetta    and there gave up the ghost attempting two mens duty    in that very healthy post and mrs barrett mourned for him    five lively months at most  jack barretts bones at quetta    enjoy profound repose but i shouldnt be astonished    if now his spirit knows the reason of his transfer    from the himalayan snows  and when the last great bugle call    adown the hurnal throbs when the last grim joke is entered    in the big black book of jobs and quetta graveyards give again    their victims to the air i shouldnt like to be the man    who sent jack barrett there   the post that fitted      though tangled and twisted the course of true love             this ditty explains     no tangles so tangled it cannot improve             if the lover has brains  ere the steamer bore him eastward sleary was engaged to marry an attractive girl at tunbridge whom he called my little carrie  slearys pay was very modest sleary was the other way who can cook a twoplate dinner on eight poor rupees a day  long he pondered oer the question in his scantly furnished quarters then proposed to minnie boffkin eldest of judge boffkins daughters  certainly an impecunious subaltern was not a catch but the boffkins knew that minnie mightnt make another match  so they recognised the business and to feed and clothe the bride got him made a something something somewhere on the bombay side  anyhow the billet carried pay enough for him to marry as the artless sleary put itjust the thing for me and carrie  did he therefore jilt miss boffkinimpulse of a baser mind no he started epileptic fits of an appalling kind  of his modus operandi only this much i could gather pearss shaving sticks will give you little taste and lots of lather  frequently in public places his affliction used to smite sleary with distressing vigouralways in the boffkins sight  ere a week was over minnie weepingly returned his ring told him his unhappy weakness stopped all thought of marrying  sleary bore the information with a chastened holy joy epileptic fits dont matter in political employ wired three short words to carrietook his ticket packed his kit bade farewell to minnie boffkin in one last long lingering fit  four weeks later carrie sleary readand laughed until she wept mrs boffkins warning letter on the wretched epilept     year by year in pious patience vengeful mrs boffkin sits waiting for the sleary babies to develop

the little tin gods on the mountain side  by the laws of the family circle tis written in letters of brass that only a colonel from chatham can manage the railways of state because of the gold on his breeks and the subjects wherein he must pass because in all matters that deal not with railways his knowledge is great  now exeter battleby tring had laboured from boyhood to eld on the lines of the east and the west and eke of the north and south many lines had he built and surveyedimportant the posts which he held and the lords of the iron horse were dumb when he opened his mouth  black as the raven his garb and his heresies jettier still hinting that railways required lifetimes of study and knowledge never clanked sword by his sidevauban he knew not nor drill nor was his name on the list of the men who had passed through the college  wherefore the little tin gods harried their little tin souls seeing he came not from chatham jingled no spurs at his heels knowing that nevertheless was he first on the government rolls for the billet of railway instructor to little tin gods on wheels  letters not seldom they wrote him having the honour to state it would be better for all men if he were laid on the shelf much would accrue to his bankbook an he consented to wait until the little tin gods built him a berth for himself  special well paid and exempt from the law of the fifty and five even to ninety and ninethese were the terms of the pact thus did the little tin gods long may their highnesses thrive silence his mouth with rupees keeping their circle intact  appointing a colonel from chatham who managed the bhamo state line the which was one mile and one furlonga guaranteed twentyinch gauge so exeter battleby tring consented his claims to resign and died on four thousand a month in the ninetieth year of his age   delilah  we have another viceroy nowthose days are dead and done of delilah aberyswith and depraved ulysses gunne  delilah aberyswith was a ladynot too young with a perfect taste in dresses and a badlybitted tongue with a thirst for information and a greater thirst for praise and a little house in simla in the prehistoric days  by reason of her marriage to a gentleman in power delilah was acquainted with the gossip of the hour and many little secrets of the halfofficial kind were whispered to delilah and she bore them all in mind  she patronized extensively a man ulysses gunne whose mode of earning money was a low and shameful one he wrote for certain papers which as everybody knows is worse than serving in a shop or scaring off the crows  he praised her queenly beauty first and later on he hinted at the vastness of her intellect with compliment unstinted he went with her ariding and his love for her was such that he lent her all his horses andshe galled them very much  one day they brewed a secret of a fine financial sort it related to appointments to a man and a report twas almost worth the keepingonly seven people knew it and gunne rose up to seek the truth and patiently pursue it  it was a viceroys secret butperhaps the wine was red perhaps an aged councillor had lost his aged head perhaps delilahs eyes were brightdelilahs whispers sweet the aged member told her what twere treason to repeat  ulysses went ariding and they talked of love and flowers ulysses went acalling and he called for several hours ulysses went awaltzing and delilah helped him dance ulysses let the waltzes go and waited for his chance  the summer sun was setting and the summer air was still the couple went awalking in the shade of summer hill the wasteful sunset faded out in turkishgreen and gold ulysses pleaded softly and that bad delilah told  next morn a startled empire learnt the allimportant news next week the aged councillor was shaking in his shoes next month i met delilah and she did not show the least hesitation in affirming that ulysses was a beast                           we have another viceroy now those days are dead and done of delilah aberyswith and most mean ulysses gunne   what happened  hurree chunder mookerjee pride of bow bazaar owner of a native press barrishteratlar waited on the government with a claim to wear sabres by the bucketful rifles by the pair  then the indian government winked a wicked wink said to chunder mookerjee stick to pen and ink they are safer implements but if you insist we will let you carry arms wheresoeer you list  hurree chunder mookerjee sought the gunsmith and bought the tubes of lancaster ballard dean and bland bought a shiny bowieknife bought a townmade sword jingled like a carriagehorse when he went abroad  but the indian government always keen to please also gave permission to horrid men like these yar mahommed yusufzai down to kill or steal chimbu singh from bikaneer tantia the bhil  killar khan the marri chief jowar singh the sikh nubbee baksh punjabi jat abdul huq rafiq he was a wahabi last little boh hlaoo took advantage of the acttook a snider too  they were unenlightened men ballard knew them not they procured their swords and guns chiefly on the spot and the lore of centuries plus a hundred fights made them slow to disregard one anothers rights  with a unanimity dear to patriot hearts all those hairy gentlemen out of foreign parts said the good old days are backlet us go to war swaggered down the grand trunk road into bow bazaar  nubbee baksh punjabi jat found a hidebound flail chimbu singh from bikaneer oiled his tonk jezail yar mahommed yusufzai spat and grinned with glee as he ground the butcherknife of the khyberee  jowar singh the sikh procured sabre quoit and mace abdul huq wahabi jerked his dagger from its place while amid the junglegrass danced and grinned and jabbered little boh hlaoo and cleared his dahblade from the scabbard  what became of mookerjee soothly who can say yar mahommed only grins in a nasty way jowar singh is reticent chimbu singh is mute but the belts of all of them simply bulge with loot  what became of ballards guns afghans black and grubby sell them for their silver weight to the men of pubbi and the shiny bowieknife and the townmade sword are hanging in a marri camp just across the border  what became of mookerjee ask mahommed yar prodding sivas sacred bull down the bow bazaar speak to placid nubbee bakshquestion land and sea ask the indian congressmenonly dont ask me   pink dominoes  they are fools who kiss and tell   wisely has the poet sung man may hold all sorts of posts   if hell only hold his tongue  jenny and me were engaged you see   on the eve of the fancy ball so a kiss or two was nothing to you   or any one else at all  jenny would go in a domino   pretty and pink but warm while i attended clad in a splendid   austrian uniform  now we had arranged through notes exchanged   early that afternoon at number four to waltz no more   but to sit in the dusk and spoon  i wish you to see that jenny and me   had barely exchanged our troth so a kiss or two was strictly due   by from and between us both  when three was over an eager lover   i fled to the gloom outside and a domino came out also   whom i took for my future bride  that is to say in a casual way   i slipped my arm around her with a kiss or two which is nothing to you   and ready to kiss i found her  she turned her head and the name she said   was certainly not my own but ere i could speak with a smothered shriek   she fled and left me alone  then jenny came and i saw with shame   shed doffed her domino and i had embraced an alien waist   but i did not tell her so  next morn i knew that there were two   dominoes pink and one had cloaked the spouse of sir julian house   our big political gun  sir j was old and her hair was gold   and her eye was a blue cerulean and the name she said when she turned her head   was not in the least like julian   the man who could write  shunshun the bowl that fatal facile drink   has ruined many geese who dipped their quills in t

the queen is a dismal failureis a mighthavebeen in a luckless moment he discovered men rise to high position through a ready pen boanerges blitzen argued thereforei with the selfsame weapon can attain as high only he did not possess when he made the trial wicked wit of clvn irony of ll  men who spar with government need to back their blows something more than ordinary journalistic prose  never young civilians prospects were so bright till an indian paper found that he could write never young civilians prospects were so dark when the wretched blitzen wrote to make his mark certainly he scored it bold and black and firm in that indian papermade his seniors squirm quoted office scandals wrote the tactless truth was there ever known a more misguided youth when the rag he wrote for praised his plucky game boanerges blitzen felt that this was fame when the men he wrote of shook their heads and swore boanerges blitzen only wrote the more  posed as young ithuriel resolute and grim till he found promotion didnt come to him till he found that reprimands weekly were his lot and his many districts curiously hot  till he found his furlough strangely hard to win boanerges blitzen didnt care to pin then it seemed to dawn on him something wasnt right boanerges blitzen put it down to spite  languished in a district desolate and dry watched the local government yearly pass him by wondered where the hitch was called it most unfair                                           that was seven years agoand he still is there   municipal          why is my district deathrate low           said binks of hezabad         well drains and sewageoutfalls are           my own peculiar fad          i learnt a lesson once it ran         thus quoth that most veracious man  it was an august evening and in snowy garments clad i paid a round of visits in the lines of hezabad when presently my waler saw and did not like at all a commissariat elephant careering down the mall  i couldnt see the driver and across my mind it rushed that that commissariat elephant had suddenly gone musth  i didnt care to meet him and i couldnt well get down so i let the waler have it and we headed for the town  the buggy was a new one and praise dykes it stood the strain till the waler jumped a bullock just above the city drain and the next that i remember was a hurricane of squeals and the creature making toothpicks of my fivefoot patent wheels  he seemed to want the owner so i fled distraught with fear to the main drain sewageoutfall while he snorted in my ear reached the fourfoot drainhead safely and in darkness and despair felt the brutes proboscis fingering my terrorstiffened hair  heard it trumpet on my shouldertried to crawl a little higher found the main drain sewage outfall blocked some eight feet up with mire and for twenty reeking minutes sir my very marrow froze while the trunk was feeling blindly for a purchase on my toes  it missed me by a fraction but my hair was turning grey before they called the drivers up and dragged the brute away  then i sought the city elders and my words were very plain they flushed that fourfoot drainhead andit never choked again  you may hold with surfacedrainage and the sunforgarbage cure till youve been a periwinkle shrinking coyly up a sewer  i believe in wellflushed culverts                                       this is why the deathrates small and if you dont believe me get shikarred yourself thats all   a code of morals           lest you should think this story true          i merely mention i          evolved it lately tis a most          unmitigated misstatement  now jones had left his newwed bride to keep his house in order and hied away to the hurrum hills above the afghan border to sit on a rock with a heliograph but ere he left he taught his wife the working of the code that sets the miles at naught  and love had made him very sage as nature made her fair so cupid and apollo linked  per heliograph the pair at dawn across the hurrum hills he flashed her counsel wise at een the dying sunset bore her husbands homilies  he warned her gainst seductive youths in scarlet clad and gold as much as gainst the blandishments paternal of the old but kept his gravest warnings for hereby the ditty hangs that snowyhaired lothario lieutenantgeneral bangs  twas general bangs with aide and staff who tittupped on the way when they beheld a heliograph tempestuously at play they thought of border risings and of stations sacked and burnt so stopped to take the message downand this is what they learnt

dot and dash he heliographed his wife some interesting details of the generals private life  the artless aidedecamp was mute the shining staff were still and red and ever redder grew the generals shaven gill  and this is what he said at last his feelings matter not i think weve tapped a private line hi threes about there trot  all honour unto bangs for neer did jones thereafter know by word or act official who read off that helio  but the tale is on the frontier and from michni to mooltan they know the worthy general as that most immoral man   the last department  twelve hundred million men

they locked me in my bedroom   me and one wee blood red mouse though i said to give my head room   you had best unroof the house  but my words were all unheeded   though i told the grave md that the treatment really needed   was a dip in open sea that was lapping just below me   smooth as silver white as snow and it took three men to throw me   when i found i could not go  half the night i watched the heavens   fizz like 81 champagne fly to sixes and to sevens   wheel and thunder back again and when all was peace and order   save one planet nailed askew much i wept because my warder   would not let me set it true  after frenzied hours of waiting   when the earth and skies were dumb pealed an awful voice dictating   an interminable sum changing to a tangle story   what she said you said i said till the moon arose in glory   and i found her    in my head  then a face came blind and weeping   and it couldnt wipe its eyes and it muttered i was keeping   back the moonlight from the skies so i patted it for pity   but it whistled shrill with wrath and a huge black devil city   poured its peoples on my path  so i fled with steps uncertain   on a thousandyear long race but the bellying of the curtain   kept me always in one place while the tumult rose and maddened   to the roar of earth on fire ere it ebbed and sank and saddened   to a whisper tense as wire  in tolerable stillness   rose one little little star and it chuckled at my illness   and it mocked me from afar and its brethren came and eyed me   called the universe to aid till i lay with naught to hide me   neath the scorn of all things made  dun and saffron robed and splendid   broke the solemn pitying day and i knew my pains were ended   and i turned and tried to pray but my speech was shattered wholly   and i wept as children weep  till the dawnwind softly slowly   brought to burning eyelids sleep   my rival  i go to concert party ball   what profit is in these i sit alone against the wall   and strive to look at ease  the incense that is mine by right   they burn before her shrine and thats because im seventeen   and she is fortynine  i cannot check my girlish blush   my color comes and goes i redden to my fingertips   and sometimes to my nose  but she is white where white should be   and red where red should shine the blush that flies at seventeen   is fixed at fortynine  i wish i had her constant cheek   i wish that i could sing all sorts of funny little songs   not quite the proper thing  im very gauche and very shy   her jokes arent in my line and worst of all im seventeen   while she is fortynine  the young men come the young men go   each pink and white and neat shes older than their mothers but   they grovel at her feet  they walk beside her rickshaw wheels   none ever walk by mine and thats because im seventeen   and she is fortynine  she rides with half a dozen men   she calls them boys and mashers i trot along the mall alone   my prettiest frocks and sashes dont help to fill my programmecard   and vainly i repine from ten to two am ah me   would i were fortynine  she calls me darling pet and dear   and sweet retiring maid im always at the back i know   she puts me in the shade  she introduces me to men   cast lovers i opine for sixty takes to seventeen   nineteen to fortynine  but even she must older grow   and end her dancing days she cant go on forever so   at concerts balls and plays  one ray of priceless hope i see   before my footsteps shine just think that shell be eightyone   when i am fortynine   the lovers litany  eyes of greya sodden

the lamps on the wall  he sendeth us years that are good as he sendeth the dearth he giveth to each man his food or her food to the earth  our kings and our queens are afar on their peoples be peace god bringeth the rain to the bar that our cattle increase  and the ploughman settled the share more deep in the sundried clod mogul mahratta and mlech from the north and white queen over the seas god

unwholesome by the swamp     moist and damp and the city and the viceroy as we see     dont agree  once two hundred years ago the trader came     meek and tame  where his timid foot first halted there he stayed     till mere trade grew to empire and he sent his armies forth     south and north till the country from peshawur to ceylon     was his own  thus the midday halt of charnockmores the pity

of morning from the blaze     of old days from the sickness of the noontide from the heat     beat retreat for the country from peshawur to ceylon     was their own  but the merchant risked the perils

and the day and turned the calkins upon her feet and ridden her far away  then up and spoke the colonels son that led a troop of the guides is there never a man of all my men can say where kamal hides then up and spoke mahommed khan the son of the ressaldar if ye know the track of the morningmist ye know where his pickets are  at dusk he harries the abazaiat dawn he is into bonair but he must go by fort bukloh to his own place to fare so if ye gallop to fort bukloh as fast as a bird can fly by the favour of god ye may cut him off ere he win to the tongue of jagai  but if he be past the tongue of jagai right swiftly turn ye then for the length and the breadth of that grisly plain is sown with kamals men there is rock to the left and rock to the right and low lean thorn between and ye may hear a breechbolt snick where never a man is seen  the colonels son has taken a horse and a raw rough dun was he with the mouth of a bell and the heart of hell and the head of the gallows tree  the colonels son to the fort has won they bid him stay to eat who rides at the tail of a border thief he sits not long at his meat  hes up and away from fort bukloh as fast as he can fly till he was aware of his fathers mare in the gut of the tongue of jagai till he was aware of his fathers mare with kamal upon her back and when he could spy the white of her eye he made the pistol crack  he has fired once he has fired twice but the whistling ball went wide ye shoot like a soldier kamal said  show now if ye can ride  its up and over the tongue of jagai as blown dustdevils go the dun he fled like a stag of ten but the mare like a barren doe  the dun he leaned against the bit and slugged his head above but the red mare played with the snafflebars as a maiden plays with a glove  there was rock to the left and rock to the right and low lean thorn between and thrice he heard a breechbolt snick tho never a man was seen  they have ridden the low moon out of the sky their hoofs drum up the dawn the dun he went like a wounded bull but the mare like a newroused fawn  the dun he fell at a watercoursein a woful heap fell he and kamal has turned the red mare back and pulled the rider free  he has knocked the pistol out of his handsmall room was there to strive twas only by favour of mine quoth he ye rode so long alive there was not a rock for twenty mile there was not a clump of tree but covered a man of my own men with his rifle cocked on his knee  if i had raised my bridlehand as i have held it low the little jackals that flee so fast were feasting all in a row if i had bowed my head on my breast as i have held it high the kite that whistles above us now were gorged till she could not fly lightly answered the colonels son  do good to bird and beast but count who come for the broken meats before thou makest a feast  if there should follow a thousand swords to carry my bones away belike the price of a jackals meal were more than a thief could pay  they will feed their horse on the standing crop their men on the garnered grain the thatch of the byres will serve their fires when all the cattle are slain  but if thou thinkest the price be fairthy brethren wait to sup the hound is kin to the jackalspawnhowl dog and call them up and if thou thinkest the price be high in steer and gear and stack give me my fathers mare again and ill fight my own way back  kamal has gripped him by the hand and set him upon his feet no talk shall be of dogs said he when wolf and gray wolf meet  may i eat dirt if thou hast hurt of me in deed or breath what dam of lances brought thee forth to jest at the dawn with death lightly answered the colonels son  i hold by the blood of my clan take up the mare for my fathers giftby god she has carried a man the red mare ran to the colonels son and nuzzled against his breast we be two strong men said kamal then but she loveth the younger best  so she shall go with a lifters dower my turquoisestudded rein my broidered saddle and saddlecloth and silver stirrups twain the colonels son a pistol drew and held it muzzleend ye have taken the one from a foe said he   will ye take the mate from a friend a gift for a gift said kamal straight a limb for the risk of a limb  thy father has sent his son to me ill send my son to him with that he whistled his only son that dropped from a mountaincrest he trod the ling like a buck in spring and he looked like a lance in rest  now here is thy master kamal said who leads a troop of the guides and thou must ride at his left side as shield on shoulder rides till death or i cut loose the tie at camp and board and bed thy life is histhy fate it is to guard him with thy head  so thou must eat the white queens meat and all her foes are thine and thou must harry thy fathers hold for the peace of the borderline and thou must make a trooper tough and hack thy way to power belike they will raise thee to ressaldar when i am hanged in peshawur  they have looked each other between the

wail went up to the stars behind the grim zenanabars     when they knew that the king was dead  the dumb priest knelt to tie his mouth     and robe him for the pyre the boondi queen beneath us cried see now that we die as our mothers died in the bridalbed by our masters side     out womento the fire  we drove the great gates home apace     white hands were on the sill but ere the rush of the unseen feet had reached the turn to the open street the bars shot down the guarddrum beat     we held the dovecot still  a face looked down in the gathering day     and laughing spoke from the wall ohe they mourn here  let me by azizun the  lucknow nautchgirl i when the house is rotten the rats must fly     and i seek another thrall  for i ruled the king as neer did queen     tonight the queens rule me guard them safely but let me go or ever they pay the debt they owe in scourge and torture  she leaped below     and the grim guard watched her flee  they knew that the king had spent his soul     on a northbred dancinggirl that he prayed to a flatnosed lucknow god and kissed the ground where her feet had trod and doomed to death at her drunken nod     and swore by her lightest curl  we bore the king to his fathers place     where the tombs of the sunborn stand where the gray apes swing and the peacocks preen on fretted pillar and jewelled screen and the wild boar couch in the house of the queen     on the drift of the desert sand  the herald read his titles forth     we set the logs aglow friend of the english free from fear baron of luni to jeysulmeer lord of the desert of bikaneer     king of the junglego  all night the red flame stabbed the sky     with wavering windtossed spears and out of a shattered temple crept a woman who veiled her head and wept and called on the kingbut the great king slept     and turned not for her tears  small thought had he to mark the strife     cold fear with hot desire when thrice she leaped from the leaping flame and thrice she beat her breast for shame and thrice like a wounded dove she came     and moaned about the fire  one watched a bowshot from the blaze     the silent streets between who had stood by the king in sport and fray to blade in ambush or boar at bay and he was a baron old and gray     and kin to the boondi queen  he said o shameless put aside     the veil upon thy brow who held the king and all his land to the wanton will of a harlots hand will the white ash rise from the blistered brand     stoop down and call him now  then she  by the faith of my tarnished soul     all things i did not well i had hoped to clear ere the fire died and lay me down by my masters side to rule in heaven his only bride     while the others howl in hell  but i have felt the fires breath     and hard it is to die yet if i may pray a rajpoot lord to sully the steel of a thakurs sword with baseborn blood of a trade abhorred     and the thakur answered ay  he drew and struck  the straight blade drank     the life beneath the breast  i had looked for the queen to face the flame but the harlot dies for the rajpoot dame sister of mine pass free from shame     pass with thy king to rest  the black log crashed above the white     the little flames and lean red as slaughter and blue as steel that whistled and fluttered from head to heel leaped up anew for they found their meal     on the heart ofthe boondi queen   the ballad of the kings mercy    abdhur rahman the durani chief     of him is the story told   his mercy fills the khyber hills     his grace is manifold   he has taken toll of the north and the south     his glory reacheth far   and they tell the tale of his charity     from balkh to kandahar   before the old peshawur gate where kurd and kaffir meet the governor of kabul dealt the justice of the street and that was strait as running noose and swift as plunging knife tho he who held the longer purse might hold the longer life   there was a hound of hindustan had struck a euzufzai wherefore they spat upon his face and led him out to die  it chanced the king went forth that hour when throat was bared to knife the kaffir grovelled underhoof and clamoured for his life   then said the king  have hope o friend  yea death disgraced is hard much honour shall be thine and called the captain of the guard yar khan a bastard of the blood so citybabble saith and he was honoured of the kingthe which is salt to death and he was son of daoud shah the reiver of the plains and blood of old durani lords ran fire in his veins and twas to tame an afghan pride nor hell nor heaven could bind the king would make him butcher to a yelping cur of hind   strike said the king kings blood art thouhis death shall be his pride then louder that the crowd might catch  fear nothis arms are tied yar khan drew clear the khyber knife and struck and sheathed again o man thy will is done quoth he a king this dog hath slain    abdhur rahman the durani chief     to the north and the south is sold   the north and the south shall open their mouth     to a ghilzai flag unrolled   when the big guns speak to the khyber peak     and his dogheratis fly   ye have heard the songhow long how long     wolves of the abazai  that night before the watch was set when all the streets were clear the governor of kabul spoke  my king hast thou no fear thou knowestthou hast heardhis speech died at his masters face  and grimly said the afghan king  i rule the afghan race my path is minesee thou to thinetonight upon thy bed think who there be in kabul now that clamour for thy head  that night when all the gates were shut to city and to throne within a little gardenhouse the king lay down alone  before the sinking of the moon which is the night of night yar khan came softly to the king to make his honour white the children of the town had mocked beneath his horses hoofs the harlots of the town had hailed him butcher from their roofs  but as he groped against the wall two hands upon him fell the king behind his shoulder spake  dead man thou dost not well tis ill to jest with kings by day and seek a boon by night and that thou bearest in thy hand is all too sharp to write  but three days hence if god be good and if thy strength remain thou shalt demand one boon of me and bless me in thy pain for i am merciful to all and most of all to thee  my butcher of the shambles restno knife hast thou for me    abdhur rahman the durani chief     holds hard by the south and the north   but the ghilzai knows ere the melting snows     when the swollen banks break forth   when the redcoats crawl to the sungar wall     and his usbeg lances fail   ye have heard the songhow long how long     wolves of the zuka kheyl  they stoned him in the rubbishfield when dawn was in the sky according to the written word see that he do not die  they stoned him till the stones were piled above him on the plain and those the labouring limbs displaced they tumbled back again   one watched beside the dreary mound that veiled the battered thing and him the king with laughter called the herald of the king   it was upon the second night the night of ramazan the watcher leaning earthward heard the message of yar khan  from shattered breast through shrivelled lips broke forth the rattling breath creature of god deliver me from agony of death  they sought the king among his girls and risked their lives thereby protector of the pitiful give orders that he die  bid him endure until the day a lagging answer came the night is short and he can pray and learn to bless my name  before the dawn three times he spoke and on the day once more creature of god deliver me and bless the king therefor  they shot him at the morning prayer to ease him of his pain and when he heard the matchlocks clink he blessed the king again  which thing the singers made a song for all the world to sing so that the outer seas may know the mercy of the king    abdhur rahman the durani chief     of him is the story told   he has opened his mouth to the north and the south     they have stuffed his mouth with gold    ye know the truth of his tender ruth     and sweet his favours are   ye have heard the songhow long how long     from balkh to kandahar   the ballad of the kings jest  when springtime flushes the desert grass our kafilas wind through the khyber pass  lean are the camels but fat the frails light are the purses but heavy the bales as the snowbound trade of the north comes down to the marketsquare of peshawur town  in a turquoise twilight crisp and chill a kafila camped at the foot of the hill  then blue smokehaze of the cooking rose and tentpeg answered to hammernose and the picketed ponies shag and wild strained at their ropes as the feed was piled and the bubbling camels beside the load sprawled for a furlong adown the road and the persian pussycats brought for sale spat at the dogs from the camelbale and the tribesmen bellowed to hasten the food and the campfires twinkled by fort jumrood and there fled on the wings of the gathering dusk a savour of camels and carpets and musk a murmur of voices a reek of smoke to tell us the trade of the khyber woke  the lid of the fleshpot chattered high the knives were whetted andthen came i to mahbub ali the muleteer patching his bridles and counting his gear crammed with the gossip of half a year  but mahbub ali the kindly said better is speech when the belly is fed so we plunged the hand to the midwrist deep in a cinnamon stew of the fattailed sheep and he who never hath tasted the food by allah he knoweth not bad from good  we cleansed our beards of the muttongrease we lay on the mats and were filled with peace and the talk slid north and the talk slid south with the sliding puffs from the hookahmouth  four things greater than all things are women and horses and power and war  we spake of them all but the last the most for i sought a word of a russian post of a shifty promise an unsheathed sword and a graycoat guard on the helmund ford  then mahbub ali lowered his eyes in the fashion of one who is weaving lies  quoth he of the russians who can say when the night is gathering all is gray but we look that the gloom of the night shall die in the morning flush of a bloodred sky  friend of my heart is it meet or wise to warn a king of his enemies we know what heaven or hell may bring but no man knoweth the mind of the king  that unsought counsel is cursed of god attesteth the story of wali dad  his sire was leaky of tongue and pen his dam was a clucking khuttuck hen and the colt bred close to the vice of each for he carried the curse of an unstanched speech  therewith madnessso that he sought the favour of kings at the kabul court and travelled in hope of honour far to the line where the graycoat squadrons are  there have i journeyed toobut i saw naught said naught anddid not die he harked to rumour and snatched at a breath of this one knoweth and that one saith legends that ran from mouth to mouth of a graycoat coming and sack of the south  these have i also heardthey pass with each new spring and the winter grass  hotfoot southward forgotten of god back to the city ran wali dad even to kabulin full durbar the king held talk with his chief in war  into the press of the crowd he broke and what he had heard of the coming spoke   then gholam hyder the red chief smiled as a mother might on a babbling child but those who would laugh restrained their breath when the face of the king showed dark as death  evil it is in full durbar to cry to a ruler of gathering war slowly he led to a peachtree small that grew by a cleft of the city wall  and he said to the boy they shall praise thy zeal so long as the red spurt follows the steel  and the russ is upon us even now great is thy prudenceawait them thou watch from the tree  thou art young and strong surely thy vigil is not for long  the russ is upon us thy clamour ran surely an hour shall bring their van wait and watch  when the host is near shout aloud that my men may hear  friend of my heart is it meet or wise to warn a king of his enemies a guard was set that he might not flee a score of bayonets ringed the tree  the peachbloom fell in showers of snow when he shook at his death as he looked below by the power of god who alone is great till the seventh day he fought with his fate  then madness took him and men declare he mowed in the branches as ape and bear and last as a sloth ere his body failed and he hung as a bat in the forks and wailed and sleep the cord of his hands untied and he fell and was caught on the points and died  heart of my heart is it meet or wise to warn a king of his enemies we know what heaven or hell may bring but no man knoweth the mind of the king  of the graycoat coming who can say when the night is gathering all is gray  to things greater than all things are the first is love and the second war  and since we know not how war may prove heart of my heart let us talk of love   the ballad of boh da thone            this is the ballad of boh da thone           erst a pretender to theebaws throne           who harried the district of alalone           how he met with his fate and the vpp            at the hand of harendra mukerji           senior gomashta gbt  boh da thone was a warrior bold his sword and his snider were bossed with gold  and the peacock banner his henchmen bore was stiff with bullion but stiffer with gore  he shot at the strong and he slashed at the weak from the salween scrub to the chindwin teak  he crucified noble he sacrificed mean he filled old ladies with kerosene  while over the water the papers cried the patriot fights for his countryside  but little they cared for the native press the worn white soldiers in khaki dress  who tramped through the jungle and camped in the byre who died in the swamp and were tombed in the mire  who gave up their lives at the queens command for the pride of their race and the peace of the land  now first of the foemen of boh da thone was captain oneil of the black tyrone and his was a company seventy strong who hustled that dissolute chief along  there were lads from galway and louth and meath who went to their death with a joke in their teeth and worshipped with fluency fervour and zeal the mud on the bootheels of crook oneil  but ever a blight on their labours lay and ever their quarry would vanish away till the sundried boys of the black tyrone took a brotherly interest in boh da thone and sooth if pursuit in possession ends the boh and his trackers were best of friends  the word of a scouta march by night a rush through the mista scattering fight a volley from covera corpse in the clearing the glimpse of a loincloth and heavy jade earring the flare of a villagethe tally of slain and  the boh was abroad on the raid again  they cursed their luck as the irish will they gave him credit for cunning and skill they buried their dead they bolted their beef and started anew on the track of the thief till in place of the kalends of greece men said when crook and his darlings come back with the head  they had hunted the boh from the hills to the plain he doubled and broke for the hills again they had crippled his power for rapine and raid they had routed him out of his pet stockade and at last they came when the day star tired to a camp deserteda village fired  a black cross blistered the morninggold and the body upon it was stark and cold the wind of the dawn went merrily past the high grass bowed her plumes to the blast  and out of the grass on a sudden broke a spirtle of fire a whorl of smoke  and captain oneil of the black tyrone was blessed with a slug in the ulnarbone the gift of his enemy boh da thone  now a slug that is hammered from telegraphwire is a thorn in the flesh and a rankling fire               the shotwound festeredas shotwounds may in a steaming barrack at mandalay  the left arm throbbed and the captain swore id like to be after the boh once more the fever held himthe captain said id give a hundred to look at his head  the hospital punkahs creaked and whirred but babu harendra gomashta heard  he thought of the canebrake green and dank that girdled his home by the dacca tank he thought of his wife and his high school son he thoughtbut abandoned the thoughtof a gun his sleep was broken by visions dread of a shining boh with a silver head  he kept his counsel and went his way and swindled the cartmen of half their pay               and the months went on as the worst must do and the boh returned to the raid anew  but the captain had quitted the longdrawn strife and in far simoorie had taken a wife and she was a damsel of delicate mould with hair like the sunshine and heart of gold  and little she knew the arms that embraced had cloven a man from the brow to the waist and little she knew that the loving lips had ordered a quivering lifes eclipse  and the eye that lit at her lightest breath had glared unawed in the gates of death  for these be matters a man would hide as a general rule from an innocent bride  and little the captain thought of the past and of all men babu harendra last               but slow in the sludge of the kathun road the government bullock train toted its load speckless and spotless and shining with ghee in the rearmost cart sat the babujee  and ever a phantom before him fled of a scowling boh with a silver head  then the leadcart stuck though the coolies slaved and the cartmen flogged and the escort raved and out of the jungle with yells and squeals pranced boh da thone and his gang at his heels  then belching blunderbuss answered back the sniders snarl and the carbines crack and the blithe revolver began to sing to the blade that twanged on the lockingring and the brown flesh blued where the baynet kissed as the steel shot back with a wrench and a twist and the great white bullocks with onyx eyes watched the souls of the dead arise and over the smoke of the fusillade the peacock banner staggered and swayed  oh gayest of scrimmages man may see is a wellworked rush on the gbt  the babu shook at the horrible sight and girded his ponderous loins for flight but fate had ordained that the boh should start on a lonehand raid of the rearmost cart and out of that cart with a bellow of woe the babu fellflat on the top of the boh  for years had harendra served the state to the growth of his purse and the girth of his pet  there were twenty stone as the tallyman knows on the broad of the chest of this best of bohs and twenty stone from a height discharged are bad for a boh with a spleen enlarged  oh short was the strugglesevere was the shock he dropped like a bullockhe lay like a block and the babu above him convulsed with fear heard the labouring lifebreath hissed out in his ear  and thus in a fashion undignified the princely pest of the chindwin died               turn now to simoorie where lapped in his ease the captain is petting the bride on his knees where the whit of the bullet the wounded mans scream are mixed as the mist of some devilish dream forgotten forgotten the sweat of the shambles where the hilldaisy blooms and the gray monkey gambols from the swordbelt set free and released from the steel the peace of the lord is with captain oneil               up the hill to simooriemost patient of drudges the bags on his shoulder the mailrunner trudges  for captain oneil sahib  one hundred and ten rupees to collect on delivery                                  then  their breakfast was stopped while the screwjack and hammer tore waxcloth split teakwood and chipped out the dammer  openeyed openmouthed on the naperys snow with a crash and a thud rolledthe head of the boh  and gummed to the scalp was a letter which ran

                 your                             h mukerji               as the rabbit is drawn to the rattlesnakes power as the smokers eye fills at the opium hour as a horse reaches up to the manger above as the waiting ear yearns for the whisper of love from the arms of the bride ironvisaged and slow the captain bent down to the head of the boh  and een as he looked on the thing where it lay twixt the winking new spoons and the napkins array the freed mind fled back to the longago days the handtohand scufflethe smoke and the blaze the forced march at night and the quick rush at dawn the banjo at twilight the burial ere morn the stench of the marshesthe raw piercing smell when the overhand stabbingcut silenced the yell the oaths of his irish that surged when they stood where the black crosses hung oer the kuttamow flood  as a derelict ship drifts away with the tide the captain went out on the past from his bride  back back through the springs to the chill of the year when he hunted the boh from maloon to tsaleer  as the shape of a corpse dimmers up through deep water in his eye lit the passionless passion of slaughter and men who had fought with oneil for the life had gazed on his face with less dread than his wife  for she who had held him so long could not hold him though a fourmonth eternity should have controlled him but watched the twin terrorthe head turned to head the scowling scarred black and the flushed savage red the spirit that changed from her knowing and flew to some grim hidden past she had never a clue to  but it knew as it grinned for he touched it unfearing and muttered aloud so you kept that jade earring  then nodded and kindly as friend nods to friend old man you fought well but you lost in the end               the visions departed and shame followed passion he took what i said in this horrible fashion  ill write to harendra  with language unsainted the captain came back to the bride  who had fainted               and this is a fiction  no  go to simoorie and look at their baby a twelvemonth old houri a pert little irisheyed kathleen mavournin shes always about on the mall of a mornin  and youll see if her right

my sinews fail for the wrong you have done to a chief of men  and a thief of the zukka kheyl  and if i fall to your hand afresh  i give you leave for the sin that you cram my throat with the foul pigs flesh  and swing me in the skin   the rhyme of the three captains  this ballad appears to refer to one of the exploits of the notorious paul jones the american pirate  it is founded on fact         at the close of a winter day their anchors down by london town the three great captains lay and one was admiral of the north from solway firth to skye and one was lord of the wessex coast and all the lands thereby and one was master of the thames from limehouse to blackwall and he was captain of the fleetthe bravest of them all  their good guns guarded their great gray sides that were thirty foot in the sheer when there came a certain tradingbrig with news of a privateer  her rigging was rough with the clotted drift that drives in a northern breeze her sides were clogged with the lazy weed that spawns in the eastern seas  light she rode in the rude tiderip to left and right she rolled and the skipper sat on the scuttlebutt and stared at an empty hold  i ha paid port dues for your law quoth he and where is the law ye boast if i sail unscathed from a heathen port to be robbed on a christian coast ye have smoked the hives of the laccadives as we burn the lice in a bunk we tack not now to a gallang prow or a plunging peiho junk i had no fear but the seas were clear as far as a sail might fare till i met with a limewashed yankee brig that rode off finisterre  there were canvas blinds to his bowgun ports to screen the weight he bore and the signals ran for a merchantman from sandy hook to the nore  he would not fly the rovers flagthe bloody or the black but now he floated the gridiron and now he flaunted the jack he spoke of the law as he crimped my crewhe swore it was only a loan but when i would ask for my own again he swore it was none of my own  he has taken my little parrakeets that nest beneath the line he has stripped my rails of the shaddockfrails and the green unripened pine he has taken my bale of dammer and spice i won beyond the seas he has taken my grinning heathen godsand what should he want o these my foremast would not mend his boom my deckhouse patch his boats he has whittled the two this yank yahoo to peddle for shoepeg oats  i could not fight for the failing light and a rough beamsea beside but i hulled him once for a clumsy crimp and twice because he lied  had i had guns as i had goods to work my christian harm i had run him up from his quarterdeck to trade with his own yardarm i had nailed his ears to my capstanhead and ripped them off with a saw and soused them in the bilgewater and served them to him raw i had flung him blind in a rudderless boat to rot in the rocking dark i had towed him aft of his own craft a bait for his brother shark i had lapped him round with cocoa husk and drenched him with the oil and lashed him fast to his own mast to blaze above my spoil i had stripped his hide for my hammockside and tasselled his beard i the mesh and spitted his crew on the live bamboo that grows through the gangrened flesh i had hove him down by the mangroves brown where the mudreef sucks and draws moored by the heel to his own keel to wait for the landcrabs claws he is lazar within and lime without ye can nose him far enow for he carries the taint of a musky shipthe reek of the slavers dhow the skipper looked at the tiering guns and the bulwarks tall and cold and the captains three full courteously peered down at the gutted hold and the captains three called courteously from deck to scuttlebutt good sir we ha dealt with that merchantman or ever your teeth were cut  your words be words of a lawless race and the law it standeth thus he comes of a race that have never a law and he never has boarded us  we ha sold him canvas and rope and sparwe know that his price is fair and we know that he weeps for the lack of a law as he rides off finisterre  and since he is damned for a gallowsthief by you and better than you we hold it meet that the english fleet should know that we hold him true the skipper called to the tall taffrailand what is that to me did ever you hear of a yankee brig that rifled a seventythree do i loom so large from your quarterdeck that i lift like a ship o the line he has learned to run from a shotted gun and harry such craft as mine  there is never a law on the cocos keys to hold a white man in but we do not steal the niggers meal for that is a niggers sin  must he have his law as a quid to chaw or laid in brass on his wheel does he steal with tears when he buccaneers fore gad then why does he steal the skipper bit on a deepsea word and the word it was not sweet for he could see the captains three had signalled to the fleet  but three and two in white and blue the whimpering flags began we have heard a tale of aforeign sail but he is a merchantman the skipper peered beneath his palm and swore by the great horn spoon fore gad the chaplain of the fleet would bless my picaroon by two and three the flags blew free to lash the laughing air we have sold our spars to the merchantmanwe know that his price is fair the skipper winked his western eye and swore by a china storm they ha rigged him a josephs jurycoat to keep his honour warm the halliards twanged against the tops the bunting bellied broad the skipper spat in the empty hold and mourned for a wasted cord  mastheadmasthead the signal sped by the line o the british craft the skipper called to his lascar crew and put her about and laughed its mainsail haul my bully boys allwell out to the seas again ere they set us to paint their pirate saint or scrub at his grapnelchain  its foresheet free with her head to the sea and the swing of the unbought brine well make no sport in an english court till we come as a ship o the line till we come as a ship o the line my lads of thirty foot in the sheer lifting again from the outer main with news of a privateer flying his pluck at our mizzentruck for weft of admiralty heaving his head for our dipseylead in sign that we keep the sea  then foresheet home as she lifts to the foamwe stand on the outward tack we are paid in the coin of the white mans tradethe bezant is hard ay and black  the frigatebird shall carry my word to the kling and the oranglaut how a man may sail from a heathen coast to be robbed in a christian port how a man may be robbed in christian port while three great captains there shall dip their flag to a slavers ragto show that his trade is fair   the ballad of the clampherdown  it was our warship clampherdown  would sweep the channel clean wherefore she kept her hatches close when the merry channel chops arose  to save the bleached marine  she had one bowgun of a hundred ton  and a great sterngun beside they dipped their noses deep in the sea they racked their stays and stanchions free  in the wash of the windwhipped tide  it was our warship clampherdown  fell in with a cruiser light that carried the dainty hotchkiss gun and a pair o heels wherewith to run  from the grip of a closefought fight  she opened fire at seven miles  as ye shoot at a bobbing cork and once she fired and twice she fired till the bowgun drooped like a lily tired  that lolls upon the stalk  captain the bowgun melts apace  the deckbeams break below twere well to rest for an hour or twain and patch the shattered plates again  and he answered make it so  she opened fire within the mile  as ye shoot at the flying duck and the great sterngun shot fair and true with the heave of the ship to the stainless blue  and the great sternturret stuck  captain the turret fills with steam  the feedpipes burst below you can hear the hiss of the helpless ram you can hear the twisted runners jam  and he answered turn and go  it was our warship clampherdown  and grimly did she roll swung round to take the cruisers fire as the white whale faces the threshers ire  when they war by the frozen pole  captain the shells are falling fast  and faster still fall we and it is not meet for english stock to bide in the heart of an eightday clock  the death they cannot see  lie down lie down my bold ab  we drift upon her beam we dare not ram for she can run and dare ye fire another gun  and die in the peeling steam  it was our warship

he answered grapple her stern and bow they have asked for the steel  they shall have it now  out cutlasses and board  it was our warship clampherdown  spewed up four hundred men and the scalded stokers yelped delight as they rolled in the waist and heard the fight  stamp oer their steelwalled pen  they cleared the cruiser end to end  from conningtower to hold they fought as they fought in nelsons fleet they were stripped to the waist they were bare to the feet  as it was in the days of old  it was the sinking clampherdown  heaved up her battered side and carried a million pounds in

from sunderlandmet the winter gales  seven days and seven nights to the start we drifted      racketing her rivets loose smokestack white as snow     all the coals adrift adeck half the rails below     leaking like a lobsterpot steering like a dray     out we took the bolivar out across the bay  one by one the lights came up winked and let us by  mile by mile we waddled on coal and focsle short met a blow that laid us down heard a bulkhead fly  left the wolf behind us with a twofoot list to port      trailing like a wounded duck working out her soul     clanging like a smithyshop after every roll     just a funnel and a mast lurching through the spray     so we threshed the bolivar out across the bay  felt her hog and felt her sag betted when shed break  wondered every time she raced if shed stand the shock heard the seas like drunken men pounding at her strake  hoped the lord ud keep his thumb on the plummerblock      banged against the iron decks bilges choked with coal     flayed

still  up and down and back we went never time for breath then the money paid at lloyds caught her by the heel  and the stars ran round and round dancin at our death      aching for an hours sleep dozing off between     heard the rotten rivets draw when she took it green     watched the compass chase its tail like a cat at play     that was on the bolivar south across the bay   once we saw between the squalls lyin head to swell  mad with work and weariness wishin they was we some damned liners lights go by like a long hotel  cheered her from the bolivarswampin in the sea      then a grayback cleared us out then the skipper laughed     boys the wheel has gone to hellrig the winches aft     yoke the kicking rudderheadget her under way     so we steered her pulleyhaul out across the

across the bay   the english flag       above the portico a flagstaff bearing the union jack      remained fluttering in the flames for some time but ultimately      when it fell the crowds rent the air with shouts      and seemed to see significance in the incidentdaily papers   winds of the world give answer  they are whimpering to and fro and what should they know of england who only england know the poor little streetbred people that vapour and fume and brag they are lifting their heads in the stillness to yelp at the english flag  must we borrow a clout from the boerto plaster anew with dirt an irish liars bandage or an english cowards shirt  we may not speak of england her flags to sell or share what is the flag of england  winds of the world declare  the north wind blewfrom bergen my steelshod vanguards go i chase your lazy whalers home from the disko floe by the great north lights above me i work the will of god and the liner splits on the icefield or the dogger fills with cod  i barred my gates with iron i shuttered my doors with flame because to force my ramparts your nutshell navies came i took the sun from their presence i cut them down with my blast and they died but the flag of england blew free ere the spirit passed  the lean white bear hath seen it in the long long arctic night the muskox knows the standard that flouts the northern light what is the flag of england  ye have but my bergs to dare ye have but my drifts to conquer  go forth for it is there  the south wind sighedfrom the virgins my midsea course was taen over a thousand islands lost in an idle main where the seaegg flames on the coral and the longbacked breakers croon their endless ocean legends to the lazy locked lagoon                                               strayed amid lonely islets mazed amid outer keys i waked the palms to laughteri tossed the scud in the breeze never was isle so little never was sea so lone but over the scud and the palmtrees an english flag was flown  i have wrenched it free from the halliard to hang for a wisp on the horn i have chased it north to the lizardribboned and rolled and torn i have spread its fold oer the dying adrift in a hopeless sea i have hurled it swift on the slaver and seen the slave set free  my basking sunfish know it and wheeling albatross where the lone wave fills with fire beneath the southern cross what is the flag of england  ye have but my reefs to dare ye have but my seas to furrow  go forth for it is there  the east wind roaredfrom the kuriles the bitter seas i come and me men call the homewind for i bring the english home looklook well to your shipping  by the breath of my mad typhoon i swept your closepacked praya and beached your best at kowloon  the reeling junks behind me and the racing seas before i raped your richest roadsteadi plundered singapore i set my hand on the hoogli as a hooded snake she rose and i flung your stoutest steamers to roost with the startled crows  never the lotus closes never the wildfowl wake but a soul goes out on the east wind that died for englands sake man or woman or suckling mother or bride or maid because on the bones of the english the english flag is stayed  the desertdust hath dimmed it the flying wildass knows the scared white leopard winds it across the taintless snows what is the flag of england  ye have but my sun to dare ye have but my sands to travel  go forth for it is there  the west wind calledin squadrons the thoughtless galleons fly that bear the wheat and cattle lest streetbred people die they make my might their porter they make my house their path till i loose my neck from their rudder and whelm them all in my wrath  i draw the gliding fogbank as a snake is drawn from the hole they bellow one to the other the frighted shipbells toll for day is a drifting terror till i raise the shroud with my breath and they see strange bows above them and the two go locked to death  but whether in calm or wrackwreath whether by dark or day i heave them whole to the conger or rip their plates away first of the scattered legions under a shrieking sky dipping between the rollers the english flag goes by  the dead dumb fog hath wrapped itthe frozen dews have kissed the naked stars have seen it a fellowstar in the mist what is the flag of england  ye have but my breath to dare ye have but my waves to conquer  go forth for it is there

honorable gentlemen have suffered grievous wrong  their noble names were mentionedo the burning black disgrace by a brutal saxon paper in an irish shootingcase they sat upon it for a year then steeled their heart to brave it and coruscating innocence the learned judges gave it  bear witness heaven of that grim crime beneath the surgeons knife the honorable gentlemen deplored the loss of life bear witness of those chanting choirs that burk and shirk and snigger no man laid hand upon the knife or finger to the trigger  cleared in the face of all mankind beneath the winking skies like phoenixes

ramping crowd to card a womans hide they never marked a man for deathwhat fault of theirs he died they only said intimidate and talked and went away by god the boys that did the work were braver men than they  their sin it was that fed the firesmall blame to them that heard the bhoys get drunk on rhetoric and madden at the word they knew whom they were talking at if they were irish too the gentlemen that lied in court they knew and well they knew  they only took the judasgold from fenians out of jail they only fawned for dollars on the blooddyed clannagael if black is black or white is

council the german kaiser decreed to ease the strong of their burden to help the weak in their need he sent a word to the peoples who struggle and pant and sweat that the straw might be counted fairly and the tally of bricks be set  the lords of their hands assembled from the east and the west they drew baltimore lille and essen brummagem clyde and crewe and some were black from the furnace and some were brown from the soil and some were blue from the dyevat but all were wearied of toil  and the young king saidi have found it the road to the rest ye seek the strong shall wait for the weary the hale shall halt for the weak with the even tramp of an army where no man breaks from the line ye shall march to peace and plenty in the bond of brotherhoodsign  the paper lay on the table the strong heads bowed thereby and a wail went up from the peoplesay signgive rest for we die a hand was stretched to the goosequill a fist was cramped to scrawl whenthe laugh of a blueeyed maiden ran clear through the councilhall  and each one heard her laughing as each one saw her plain saidie mimi or olga gretchen or mary jane and the spirit of man that is in him to the light of the vision woke and the men drew back from the paper as a yankee delegate spoke  theres a girl in jersey city who works on the telephone were going to hitch our horses and dig for a house of our own with gas and water connections and steamheat through to the top and w hohenzollern i guess i shall work till i drop  and an english delegate thunderedthe weak an the lame be blowed ive a berth in the souwest workshops a home in the wandsworth road and till the sociation has footed my buryin bill i work for the kids an the missus  pull up  i be damned if i will  and over the german benches the bearded whisper ran lager der girls und der dollars dey makes or dey breaks a man if schmitt haf collared der dollars he collars der girl deremit but if schmitt bust in der pizness we collars der girl from schmitt  they passed one resolutionyour subcommittee believe you can lighten the curse of adam when youve lightened the curse of eve but till we are built like angels with hammer and chisel and pen we will work for ourself and a woman for ever and ever amen  now this is the tale of the council the german kaiser held the day that they razored the grindstone the day that the cat was belled the day of the figs from thistles the day of the twisted sands the day that the laugh of a maiden made light of the lords of their hands   tomlinson  now tomlinson gave up the ghost in his house in berkeley square and a spirit came to his bedside and gripped him by the hair a spirit gripped him by the hair and carried him far away till he heard as the roar of a rainfed ford the roar of the milky way till he heard the roar of the milky way die down and drone and cease and they came to the gate within the wall where peter holds the keys  stand up stand up now tomlinson and answer loud and high the good that ye did for the sake of men or ever ye came to die the good that ye did for the sake of men in little earth so lone and the naked soul of tomlinson grew white as a rainwashed bone  o i have a friend on earth he said that was my priest and guide and well would he answer all for me if he were by my side for that ye strove in neighbourlove it shall be written fair but now ye wait at heavens gate and not in berkeley square though we called your friend from his bed this night he could not speak for you for the race is run by one and one and never by two and two then tomlinson looked up and down and little gain was there for the naked stars grinned overhead and he saw that his soul was bare the wind that blows between the worlds it cut him like a knife and tomlinson took up his tale and spoke of his good in life  this i have read in a book he said and that was told to me and this i have thought that another man thought of a prince in muscovy the good souls flocked like homing doves and bade him clear the path and peter twirled the jangling keys in weariness and wrath  ye have read ye have heard ye have thought he said and the tale is yet to run by the worth of the body that once ye had give answerwhat haye done then tomlinson looked back and forth and little good it bore for the darkness stayed at his shoulderblade and heavens gate before o this i have felt and this i have guessed and this i have heard men say and this they wrote that another man wrote of a carl in norroway ye have read ye have felt ye have guessed good lack ye have hampered heavens gate theres little room between the stars in idleness to prate o none may reach by hired speech of neighbour priest and kin through borrowed deed to gods good meed that lies so fair within get hence get hence to the lord of wrong for doom has yet to run and  the faith that ye share with berkeley square uphold you tomlinson               the spirit gripped him by the hair and sun by sun they fell till they came to the belt of naughty stars that rim the mouth of hell the first are red with pride and wrath the next are white with pain but the third are black with clinkered sin that cannot burn again they may hold their path they may leave their path with never a soul to mark they may burn or freeze but they must not cease in the scorn of the outer dark  the wind that blows between the worlds it nipped him to the bone and he yearned to the flare of hellgate there as the light of his own hearth stone  the devil he sat behind the bars where the desperate legions drew but he caught the hasting tomlinson and would not let him through  wot ye the price of good pitcoal that i must pay said he that ye rank yoursel so fit for hell and ask no leave of me i am all oersib to adams breed that ye should give me scorn for i strove with god for your first father the day that he was born  sit down sit down upon the slag and answer loud and high the harm that ye did to the sons of men or ever you came to die and tomlinson looked up and up and saw against the night the belly of a tortured star bloodred in hellmouth light and tomlinson looked down and down and saw beneath his feet the frontlet of a tortured star milkwhite in hellmouth heat  o i had a love on earth said he that kissed me to my fall and if ye would call my love to me i know she would answer all all that ye did in love forbid it shall be written fair but now ye wait at hellmouth gate and not in berkeley square though we whistled your love from her bed tonight i trow she would not run for the sin ye do by two and two ye must pay for one by one the wind that blows between the worlds it cut him like a knife and tomlinson took up the tale and spoke of his sin in life once i ha laughed at the power of love and twice at the grip of the grave and thrice i ha patted my god on the head that men might call me brave the devil he blew on a brandered soul and set it aside to cool do ye think i would waste my good pitcoal on the hide of a brainsick fool i see no worth in the hobnailed mirth or the jolthead jest ye did that i should waken my gentlemen that are sleeping three on a grid then tomlinson looked back and forth and there was little grace for hellgate filled the houseless soul with the fear of naked space  nay this i ha heard quo  tomlinson and this was noised abroad and this i ha got from a belgian book on the word of a dead french lord ye ha heard ye ha read ye ha got good lack and the tale begins afresh have ye sinned one sin for the pride o the eye or the sinful lust of the flesh then tomlinson he gripped the bars and yammered let me in for i mind that i borrowed my neighbours wife to sin the deadly sin the devil he grinned behind the bars and banked the fires high did ye read of that sin in a book said he and tomlinson said ay the devil he blew upon his nails and the little devils ran and he said  go husk this whimpering thief that comes in the guise of a man winnow him out twixt star and star and sieve his proper worth theres sore decline in adams line if this be spawn of earth  empusas crew so nakednew they may not face the fire but weep that they bin too small to sin to the height of their desire over the coal they chased the soul and racked it all abroad as children rifle a caddiscase or the ravens foolish hoard  and back they came with the tattered thing as children after play and they said  the soul that he got from god he has bartered clean away  we have threshed a stook of print and book and winnowed a chattering wind and many a soul wherefrom he stole but his we cannot find we have handled him we have dandled him we have seared him to the bone and sure if tooth and nail show truth he has no soul of his own the devil he bowed his head on his breast and rumbled deep and low im all oersib to adams breed that i should bid him go  yet close we lie and deep we lie and if i gave him place my gentlemen that are so proud would flout me to my face theyd call my house a common stews and me a careless host andi would not anger my gentlemen for the sake of a shiftless ghost the devil he looked at the mangled soul that prayed to feel the flame and he thought of holy charity but he thought of his own good name now ye could haste my coal to waste and sit ye down to fry did ye think of that theft for yourself said he and tomlinson said ay the devil he blew an outward breath for his heart was free from care ye have scarce the soul of a louse he said but the roots of sin are there and for that sin should ye come in were i the lord alone but sinful pride has rule insideand mightier than my own  honour and wit foredamned they sit to each his priest and whore nay scarce i dare myself go there and you theyd torture sore  ye are neither spirit nor spirk he said ye are neither book nor brute go get ye back to the flesh again for the sake of mans repute  im all oersib to adams breed that i should mock your pain but look that ye win to worthier sin ere ye come back again get hence the hearse is at your doorthe grim black stallions wait they bear your clay to place today  speed lest ye come too late go back to earth with a lip unsealedgo back with an open eye and carry my word to the sons of men or ever ye come to die that the sin they do by two and two they must pay for one by one and  the god that you took from a printed book be with you tomlinson

      volume iii the phantom rickshaw and other ghost stories   the phantom rickshaw  may no ill dreams disturb my rest nor powers of darkness me molest         evening hymn  one of the few advantages that india has over england is a great knowability after five years service a man is directly or indirectly acquainted with the two or three hundred civilians in his province all the messes of ten or twelve regiments and batteries and some fifteen hundred other people of the nonofficial caste in ten years his knowledge should be doubled and at the end of twenty he knows or knows something about every englishman in the empire and may travel anywhere and everywhere without paying hotelbills  globetrotters who expect entertainment as a right have even within my memory blunted this openheartedness but none the less today if you belong to the inner circle and are neither a bear nor a black sheep all houses are open to you and our small world is very very kind and helpful  rickett of kamartha stayed with polder of kumaon some fifteen years ago he meant to stay two nights but was knocked down by rheumatic fever and for six weeks disorganized polders establishment stopped polders work and nearly died in polders bedroom polder behaves as though he had been placed under eternal obligation by rickett and yearly sends the little ricketts a box of presents and toys it is the same everywhere the men who do not take the trouble to conceal from you their opinion that you are an incompetent ass and the women who blacken your character and misunderstand your wifes amusements will work themselves to the bone in your behalf if you fall sick or into serious trouble  heatherlegh the doctor kept in addition to his regular practice a hospital on his private accountan arrangement of loose boxes for incurables his friend called itbut it was really a sort of fittingup shed for craft that had been damaged by stress of weather the weather in india is often sultry and since the tale of bricks is always a fixed quantity and the only liberty allowed is permission to work overtime and get no thanks men occasionally break down and become as mixed as the metaphors in this sentence  heatherlegh is the dearest doctor that ever was and his invariable prescription to all his patients is lie low go slow and keep cool he says that more men are killed by overwork than the importance of this world justifies he maintains that overwork slew pansay who died under his hands about three years ago he has of course the right to speak authoritatively and he laughs at my theory that there was a crack in pansays head and a little bit of the dark world came through and pressed him to death pansay went off the handle says heatherlegh after the stimulus of long leave at home he may or he may not have behaved like a blackguard to mrs keith wessington my notion is that the work of the katabundi settlement ran him off his legs and that he took to brooding and making much of an ordinary p  0 flirtation he certainly was engaged to miss mannering and she certainly broke off the engagement then he took a feverish chill and all that nonsense about ghosts developed overwork started his illness kept it alight and killed him poor devil write him off to the systemone man to take the work of two and a half men  i do not believe this i used to sit up with pansay sometimes when heatherlegh was called out to patients and i happened to be within claim the man would make me most unhappy by describing in a low even voice the procession that was always passing at the bottom of his bed he had a sick mans command of language  when he recovered i suggested that he should write out the whole affair from beginning to end knowing that ink might assist him to ease his mind when little boys have learned a new bad word they are never happy till they have chalked it up on a door and this also is literature  he was in a high fever while he was writing and the bloodandthunder magazine diction he adopted did not calm him two months afterward he was reported fit for duty but in spite of the fact that he was urgently needed to help an undermanned commission stagger through a deficit he preferred to die vowing at the last that he was hagridden i got his manuscript before he died and this is his version of the affair dated 1885  my doctor tells me that i need rest and change of air it is not improbable that i shall get both ere longrest that neither the redcoated messenger nor the midday gun can break and change of air far beyond that which any homewardbound steamer can give me in the meantime i am resolved to stay where i am and in flat defiance of my doctors orders to take all the world into my confidence you shall learn for yourselves the precise nature of my malady and shall too judge for yourselves whether any man born of woman on this weary earth was ever so tormented as i  speaking now as a condemned criminal might speak ere the dropbolts are drawn my story wild and hideously improbable as it may appear demands at least attention that it will ever receive credence i utterly disbelieve two months ago i should have scouted as mad or drunk the man who had dared tell me the like two months ago i was the happiest man in india today from peshawur to the sea there is no one more wretched my doctor and i are the only two who know this his explanation is that my brain digestion and eyesight are all slightly affected giving rise to my frequent and persistent delusions delusions indeed i call him a fool but he attends me still with the same unwearied smile the same bland professional manner the same neatly trimmed red whiskers till i begin to suspect that i am an ungrateful eviltempered invalid but you shall judge for yourselves  three years ago it was my fortunemy great misfortuneto sail from gravesend to bombay on return from long leave with one agnes keithwessington wife of an officer on the bombay side it does not in the least concern you to know what manner of woman she was be content with the knowledge that ere the voyage had ended both she and i were desperately and unreasoningly in love with one another heaven knows that i can make the admission now without one particle of vanity in matters of this sort there is always one who gives and another who accepts from the first day of our illomened attachment i was conscious that agness passion was a stronger a more dominant andif i may use the expressiona purer sentiment than mine whether she recognized the fact then i do not know afterward it was bitterly plain to both of us  arrived at bombay in the spring of the year we went our respective ways to meet no more for the next three or four months when my leave and her love took us both to simla there we spent the season together and there my fire of straw burned itself out to a pitiful end with the closing year i attempt no excuse i make no apology mrs wessington had given up much for my sake and was prepared to give up all from my own lips in august 1882 she learned that i was sick of her presence tired of her company and weary of the sound of her voice ninetynine women out of a hundred would have wearied of me as i wearied of them seventyfive of that number would have promptly avenged themselves by active and obtrusive flirtation with other men mrs wessington was the hundredth on her neither my openly expressed aversion nor the cutting brutalities with which i garnished our interviews had the least effect jack darling was her one eternal cuckoo cry im sure its all a mistakea hideous mistake and well be good friends again some day please forgive me jack dear  i was the offender and i knew it that knowledge transformed my pity into passive endurance and eventually into blind hatethe same instinct i suppose which prompts a man to savagely stamp on the spider he has but half killed and with this hate in my bosom the season of 1882 came to an end  next year we met again at simlashe with her monotonous face and timid attempts at reconciliation and i with loathing of her in every fibre of my frame several times i could not avoid meeting her alone and on each occasion her words were identically the same still the unreasoning wail that it was all a mistake and still the hope of eventually making friends i might have seen had i cared to look that that hope only was keeping her alive she grew more wan and thin month by month you will agree with me at least that such conduct would have driven any one to despair it was uncalled for childish unwomanly i maintain that she was much to blame and again sometimes in the black feverstricken nightwatches i have begun to think that i might have been a little kinder to her but that really is a delusion i could not have continued pretending to love her when i didnt could i it would have been unfair to us both  last year we met againon the same terms as before the same weary appeal and the same curt answers from my lips at least i would make her see how wholly wrong and hopeless were her attempts at resuming the old relationship as the season wore on we fell apartthat is to say she found it difficult to meet me for i had other and more absorbing interests to attend to when i think it over quietly in my sickroom the season of 1884 seems a confused nightmare wherein light and shade were fantastically intermingledmy courtship of little kitty mannering my hopes doubts and fears our long rides together my trembling avowal of attachment her reply and now and again a vision of a white face flitting by in the rickshaw with the black and white liveries i once watched for so earnestly the wave of mrs wessingtons gloved hand and when she met me alone which was but seldom the irksome monotony of her appeal i loved kitty mannering honestly heartily loved her and with my love for her grew my hatred for agnes in august kitty and i were engaged the next day i met those accursed magpie jhampanies at the back of jakko and moved by some passing sentiment of pity stopped to tell mrs wessington everything she knew it already  so i hear youre engaged jack dear then without a moments pauseim sure its all a mistakea hideous mistake we shall be as good friends some day jack as we ever were  my answer might have made even a man wince it cut the dying woman before me like the blow of a whip please forgive me jack i didnt mean to make you angry but its true its true  and mrs wessington broke down completely i turned away and left her to finish her journey in peace feeling but only for a moment or two that i had been an unutterably mean hound i looked back and saw that she had turned her rickshaw with the idea i suppose of overtaking me  the scene and its surroundings were photographed on my memory  the rainswept sky we were at the end of the wet weather the sodden dingy pines the muddy road and the black powderriven cliffs formed a gloomy background against which the black and white liveries of the jhampanies the yellowpaneled rickshaw and mrs wessingtons downbowed golden head stood out clearly she was holding her handkerchief in her left hand and was leaning hack exhausted against the rickshaw cushions i turned my horse up a bypath near the sanjowlie reservoir and literally ran away once i fancied i heard a faint call of jack this may have been imagination i never stopped to verify it ten minutes later i came across kitty on horseback and in the delight of a long ride with her forgot all about the interview  a week later mrs wessington died and the inexpressible burden of her existence was removed from my life i went plainsward perfectly happy before three months were over i had forgotten all about her except that at times the discovery of some of her old letters reminded me unpleasantly of our bygone relationship by january i had disinterred what was left of our correspondence from among my scattered belongings and had burned it at the beginning of april of this year 1885 i was at simlasemideserted simlaonce more and was deep in lovers talks and walks with kitty it was decided that we should be married at the end of june you will understand therefore that loving kitty as i did i am not saying too much when i pronounce myself to have been at that time the happiest man in india  fourteen delightful days passed almost before i noticed their flight  then aroused to the sense of what was proper among mortals circumstanced as we were i pointed out to kitty that an engagement ring was the outward and visible sign of her dignity as an engaged girl and that she must forthwith come to hamiltons to be measured for one up to that moment i give you my word we had completely forgotten so trivial a matter to hamiltons we accordingly went on the 15th of april 1885 remember thatwhatever my doctor may say to the contraryi was then in perfect health enjoying a well balanced mind and an absolute tranquil spirit kitty and i entered hamiltons shop together and there regardless of the order of affairs i measured kitty for the ring in the presence of the amused assistant the ring was a sapphire with two diamonds we then rode out down the slope that leads to the combermere bridge and pelitis shop   while my waler was cautiously feeling his way over the loose shale and kitty was laughing and chattering at my sidewhile all simla that is to say as much of it as had then come from the plains was grouped round the reading room and pelitis verandai was aware that some one apparently at a vast distance was calling me by my christian name it struck me that i had heard the voice before but when and where i could not at once determine in the short space it took to cover the road between the path from hamiltons shop and the first plank of the combermere bridge i had thought over half a dozen people who might have committed such a solecism and had eventually decided that it must have been singing in my ears immediately opposite pelitis shop my eye was arrested by the sight of four jharnpanies in magpie livery pulling a yellowpaneled cheap bazar rickshaw in a moment my mind flew back to the previous season and mrs wessington with a sense of irritation and disgust was it not enough that the woman was dead and done with without her black and white servitors reappearing to spoil the days happiness whoever employed them now i thought i would call upon and ask as a personal favor to change her jhampanies livery i would hire the men myself and if necessary buy their coats from off their backs it is impossible to say here what a flood of undesirable memories their presence evoked  kitty i cried there are poor mrs wessingtons jhampanies turned up again i wonder who has them now  kitty had known mrs wessington slightly last season and had always been interested in the sickly woman  what where she asked i cant see them anywhere  even as she spoke her horse swerving from a laden mule threw himself directly in front of the advancing rickshaw i had scarcely time to utter a word of warning when to my unutterable horror horse and rider passed through men and carriage as if they had been thin air                     whats the matter cried kitty what made you call out so foolishly jack if i am engaged i dont want all creation to know about it there was lots of space between the mule and the veranda and if you think i cant ride  there  whereupon wilful kitty set off her dainty little head in the air at a hand gallop in the direction of the bandstand fully expecting as she herself afterward told me that i should follow her what was the matter nothing indeed either that i was mad or drunk or that simla was haunted with devils i reined in my impatient cob and turned round the rickshaw had turned too and now stood immediately facing me near the left railing of the combermere bridge  jack jack darling there was no mistake about the words this time they rang through my brain as if they had been shouted in my ear its some hideous mistake im sure please forgive me jack and lets be friends again  the rickshawhood had fallen back and inside as i hope and pray daily for the death i dread by night sat mrs keithwessington handkerchief in hand and golden head bowed on her breast  how long i stared motionless i do not know finally i was aroused by my syce taking the walers bridle and asking whether i was ill from the horrible to the commonplace is but a step i tumbled off my horse and dashed half fainting into pelitis for a glass of cherrybrandy there two or three couples were gathered round the coffeetables discussing the gossip of the day their trivialities were more comforting to me just then than the consolations of religion could have been i plunged into the midst of the conversation at once chatted laughed and jested with a face when i caught a glimpse of it in a mirror as white and drawn as that of a corpse three or four mem noticed my condition and evidently setting it down to the results of overmany pegs charitably endeavoured to draw me apart from the rest of the loungers but i refused to be led away i wanted the company of my kind as a child rushes into the midst of the dinnerparty after a fright in the dark i must have talked for about ten minutes or so though it seemed an eternity to me when i heard kittys clear voice outside inquiring for me in another minute she had entered the shop prepared to roundly upbraid me for failing so signally in my duties something in my face stopped her  why jack she cried what have you been doing what has happened are you ill thus driven into a direct lie i said that the sun had been a little too much for me it was close upon five oclock of a cloudy april afternoon and the sun had been hidden all day i saw my mistake as soon as the words were out of my mouth attempted to recover it blundered hopelessly and followed kitty in a regal rage out of doors amid the smiles of my acquaintances i made some excuse i have forgotten what on the score of my feeling faint and cantered away to my hotel leaving kitty to finish the ride by herself  in my room i sat down and tried calmly to reason out the matter  here was i theobald jack pansay a welleducated bengal civilian in the year of grace 1885 presumably sane certainly healthy driven in terror from my sweethearts side by the apparition of a woman who had been dead and buried eight months ago these were facts that i could not blink nothing was further from my thought than any memory of mrs wessington when kitty and i left hamiltons shop nothing was more utterly commonplace than the stretch of wall opposite pelitis it was broad daylight the road was full of people and yet here look you in defiance of every law of probability in direct outrage of natures ordinance there had appeared to me a face from the grave  kittys arab had gone through the rickshaw so that my first hope that some woman marvelously like mrs wessington had hired the carriage and the coolies with their old livery was lost again and again i went round this treadmill of thought and again and again gave up baffled and in despair the voice was as inexplicable as the apparition i had originally some wild notion of confiding it all to kitty of begging her to marry me at once and in her arms defying the ghostly occupant of the rickshaw after all i argued the presence of the rickshaw is in itself enough to prove the existence of a spectral illusion one may see ghosts of men and women but surely never of coolies and carriages the whole thing is absurd fancy the ghost of a hillman  next morning i sent a penitent note to kitty imploring her to overlook my strange conduct of the previous afternoon my divinity was still very wroth and a personal apology was necessary i explained with a fluency born of nightlong pondering over a falsehood that i had been attacked with sudden palpitation of the heartthe result of indigestion this eminently practical solution had its effect and kitty and i rode out that afternoon with the shadow of my first lie dividing us  nothing would please her save a canter round jakko with my nerves still unstrung from the previous night i feebly protested against the notion suggesting observatory hill jutogh the boileaugunge roadanything rather than the jakko round kitty was angry and a little hurt so i yielded from fear of provoking further misunderstanding and we set out together toward chota simla we walked a greater part of the way and according to our custom cantered from a mile or so below the convent to the stretch of level road by the sanjowlie reservoir the wretched horses appeared to fly and my heart beat quicker and quicker as we neared the crest of the ascent my mind had been full of mrs wessington all the afternoon and every inch of the jakko road bore witness to our oldtime walks and talks the bowlders were full of it the pines sang it aloud overhead the rainfed torrents giggled and chuckled unseen over the shameful story and the wind in my ears chanted the iniquity aloud  as a fitting climax in the middle of the level men call the ladies mile the horror was awaiting me no other rickshaw was in sightonly the four black and white jhampanies the yellowpaneled carriage and the golden head of the woman withinall apparently just as i had left them eight months and one fortnight ago for an instant i fancied that kitty must see what i sawwe were so marvelously sympathetic in all things her next words undeceived me not a soul in sight come along jack and ill race you to the reservoir buildings her wiry little arab was off like a bird my waler following close behind and in this order we dashed under the cliffs half a minute brought us within fifty yards of the rickshaw i pulled my waler and fell back a little the rickshaw was directly in the middle of the road and once more the arab passed through it my horse following jack jack dear please forgive me rang with a wail in my ears and after an intervalits a mistake a hideous mistake  i spurred my horse like a man possessed when i turned my head at the reservoir works the black and white liveries were still waitingpatiently waitingunder the grey hillside and the wind brought me a mocking echo of the words i had just heard kitty bantered me a good deal on my silence throughout the remainder of the ride i had been talking up till then wildly and at random  to save my life i could not speak afterward naturally and from sanjowlie to the church wisely held my tongue  i was to dine with the mannerings that night and had barely time to canter home to dress on the road to elysium hill i overheard two men talking together in the duskits a curious thing said one how completely all trace of it disappeared you know my wife was insanely fond of the woman never could see anything in her myself and wanted me to pick up her old rickshaw and coolies if they were to be got for love or money morbid sort of fancy i call it but ive got to do what the memsahib tells me  would you believe that the man she hired it from tells me that all four of the menthey were brothersdied of cholera on the way to hardwar poor devils and the rickshaw has been broken up by the man himself told me he never used a dead memsahibs rickshaw spoiled his luck queer notion wasnt it fancy poor little mrs wessington spoiling any ones luck except her own i laughed aloud at this point and my laugh jarred on me as i uttered it so there were ghosts of rickshaws after all and ghostly employments in the other world how much did mrs wessington give her men what were their hours where did they go  and for visible answer to my last question i saw the infernal thing blocking my path in the twilight the dead travel fast and by short cuts unknown to ordinary coolies i laughed aloud a second time and checked my laughter suddenly for i was afraid i was going mad mad to a certain extent i must have been for i recollect that i reined in my horse at the head of the rickshaw and politely wished mrs wessington good evening her answer was one i knew only too well i listened to the end and replied that i had heard it all before but should be delighted if she had anything further to say some malignant devil stronger than i must have entered into me that evening for i have a dim recollection of talking the commonplaces of the day for five minutes to the thing in front of me  mad as a hatter poor devilor drunk max try and get him to come home  surely that was not mrs wessingtons voice the two men had overheard me speaking to the empty air and had returned to look after me they were very kind and considerate and from their words evidently gathered that i was extremely drunk i thanked them confusedly and cantered away to my hotel there changed and arrived at the mannerings ten minutes late i pleaded the darkness of the night as an excuse was rebuked by kitty for my unloverlike tardiness and sat down  the conversation had already become general and under cover of it i was addressing some tender small talk to my sweetheart when i was aware that at the further end of the table a short redwhiskered man was describing with much broidery his encounter with a mad unknown that evening  a few sentences convinced me that he was repeating the incident of half an hour ago in the middle of the story he looked round for applause as professional storytellers do caught my eye and straightway collapsed there was a moments awkward silence and the redwhiskered man muttered something to the effect that he had forgotten the rest thereby sacrificing a reputation as a good storyteller which he had built up for six seasons past i blessed him from the bottom of my heart andwent on with my fish  in the fulness of time that dinner came to an end and with genuine regret i tore myself away from kittyas certain as i was of my own existence that it would be waiting for me outside the door the redwhiskered man who had been introduced to me as doctor heatherlegh of simla volunteered to bear me company as far as our roads lay together i accepted his offer with gratitude  my instinct had not deceived me it lay in readiness in the mall and in what seemed devilish mockery of our ways with a lighted headlamp the red whiskered man went to the point at once in a manner that showed he bad been thinking over it all dinner time  i say pansay what the deuce was the matter with you this evening on the elysium road the suddenness of the question wrenched an answer from me before i was aware  that said i pointing to it  that may be either d t or eyes for aught i know now you dont liquor i saw as much at dinner so it cant be d t theres nothing whatever where youre pointing though youre sweating and trembling with fright like a scared pony therefore i conclude that its eyes and i ought to understand all about them come along home with me im on the blessington lower road  to my intense delight the rickshaw instead of waiting for us kept about twenty yards aheadand this too whether we walked trotted or cantered in the course of that long night ride i had told my companion almost as much as i have told you here  well youve spoiled one of the best tales ive ever laid tongue to said he but ill forgive you for the sake of what youve gone through now come home and do what i tell you and when ive cured you young man let this be a lesson to you to steer clear of women and indigestible food till the day of your death  the rickshaw kept steady in front and my redwhiskered friend seemed to derive great pleasure from my account of its exact whereabouts  eyes pansayall eyes brain and stomach and the greatest of these three is stomach youve too much conceited brain too little stomach and thoroughly unhealthy eyes get your stomach straight and the rest follows and all thats french for a liver pill  ill take sole medical charge of you from this hour for youre too interesting a phenomenon to be passed over  by this time we were deep in the shadow of the blessington lower road and the rickshaw came to a dead stop under a pineclad overhanging shale cliff instinctively i halted too giving my reason heatherlegh rapped out an oath  now if you think im going to spend a cold night on the hillside for the sake of a stomachcumbraincumeye illusionlord ha mercy whats that  there was a muffled report a blinding smother of dust just in front of us a crack the noise of rent boughs and about ten yards of the cliffsidepines undergrowth and allslid down into the road below completely blocking it up the uprooted trees swayed and tottered for a moment like drunken giants in the gloom and then fell prone among their fellows with a thunderous crash our two horses stood motionless and sweating with fear as soon as the rattle of falling earth and stone had subsided my companion mutteredman if wed gone forward we should have been ten feet deep in our graves by now there are more things in heaven and earth come home pansay and thank god i want a peg badly  we retraced our way over the church ridge and i arrived at dr heatherleghs house shortly after midnight  his attempts toward my cure commenced almost immediately and for a week i never left his sight many a time in the course of that week did i bless the good fortune which had thrown me in contact with simlas best and kindest doctor day by day my spirits grew lighter and more equable day by day too i became more and more inclined to fall in with heatherleghs spectral illusion theory implicating eyes brain and stomach i wrote to kitty telling her that a slight sprain caused by a fall from my horse kept me indoors for a few days and that i should be recovered before she had time to regret my absence  heatherleghs treatment was simple to a degree it consisted of liver pills coldwater baths and strong exercise taken in the dusk or at early dawn for as he sagely observeda man with a sprained ankle doesnt walk a dozen miles a day and your young woman might be wondering if she saw you  at the end of the week after much examination of pupil and pulse and strict injunction as to diet and pedestrianism heatherlegh dismissed me as brusquely as he had taken charge of me here is his parting benediction man i can certify to your mental cure and thats as much as to say ive cured most of your bodily ailments now get your traps out of this as soon as you can and be off to make love to miss kitty  i was endeavoring to express my thanks for his kindness he cut me short  dont think i did this because i like you i gather that youve behaved like a blackguard all through but all the same you re a phenomenon and as queer a phenomenon as you are a blackguard nochecking me a second timenot a rupee please go out and see if you can find the eyesbrainandstomach business again ill give you a lakh for each time you see it  half an hour later i was in the mannerings drawingroom with kittydrunk with the intoxication of present happiness and the foreknowledge that i should never more be troubled with its hideous presence strong in the sense of my newfound security i proposed a ride at once and by preference a canter round jakko  never had i felt so well so overladen with vitality and mere animal spirits as i did on the afternoon of the 30th of april kitty was delighted at the change in my appearance and complimented me on it in her delightfully frank and outspoken manner we left the mannerings house together laughing and talking and cantered along the chota simla road as of old  i was in haste to reach the sanjowlie reservoir and there make my assurance doubly sure the horses did their best but seemed all too slow to my impatient mind kitty was astonished at my boisterousness why jack she cried at last you are behaving like a child what are you doing  we were just below the convent and from sheer wantonness i was making my waler plunge and curvet across the road as i tickled it with the loop of my ridingwhip  doing i answered nothing dear thats just it if youd been doing nothing for a week except lie up youd be as riotous as i  singing and murmuring in your feastful mirth joying to feel yourself alive lord over nature lord of the visible earth lord of the senses five  my quotation was hardly out of my lips before we had rounded the corner above the convent and a few yards further on could see across to sanjowlie in the centre of the level road stood the black and white liveries the yellow paneled rickshaw and mrs keithwessington i pulled up looked rubbed my eyes and i believe must have said something the next thing i knew was that i was lying face downward on the road with kitty kneeling above me in tears  has it gone child  i gasped kitty only wept more bitterly  has what gone jack dear what does it all mean there must be a mistake somewhere jack a hideous mistake her last words brought me to my feet madraving for the time being  yes there is a mistake somewhere i repeated a hideous mistake come and look at it  i have an indistinct idea that i dragged kitty by the wrist along the road up to where it stood and implored her for pitys sake to speak to it to tell it that we were betrothed that neither death nor hell could break the tie between us and kitty only knows how much more to the same effect now and again i appealed passionately to the terror in the rickshaw to bear witness to all i had said and to release me from a torture that was killing me as i talked i suppose i must have told kitty of my old relations with mrs wessington for i saw her listen intently with white face and blazing eyes  thank you mr pansay she said thats quite enough syce ghora lao  the syces impassive as orientals always are had come up with the recaptured horses and as kitty sprang into her saddle i caught hold of the bridle entreating her to hear me out and forgive my answer was the cut of her ridingwhip across my face from mouth to eye and a word or two of farewell that even now i cannot write down so i judged and judged rightly that kitty knew all and i staggered back to the side of the rickshaw my face was cut and bleeding and the blow of the ridingwhip had raised a livid blue wheal on it i had no selfrespect just then heatherlegh who must have been following kitty and me at a distance cantered up  doctor i said pointing to my face heres miss mannerings signature to my order of dismissal andill thank you for that lakh as soon as convenient  heatherleghs face even in my abject misery moved me to laughter  ill stake my professional reputationhe began  dont be a fool i whispered ive lost my lifes happiness and youd better take me home  as i spoke the rickshaw was gone then i lost all knowledge of what was passing the crest of jakko seemed to heave and roll like the crest of a cloud and fall in upon me  seven days later on the 7th of may that is to say i was aware that i was lying in heatherleghs room as weak as a little child heatherlegh was watching me intently from behind the papers on his writingtable his first words were not encouraging but i was too far spent to be much moved by them  heres miss kitty has sent back your letters you corresponded a good deal you young people heres a packet that looks like a ring and a cheerful sort of a note from mannering papa which ive taken the liberty of reading and burning the old gentlemans not pleased with you  and kitty i asked dully  rather more drawn than her father from what she says by the same token you must have been letting out any number of queer reminiscences just before i met you says that a man who would have behaved to a woman as you did to mrs wessington ought to kill himself out of sheer pity for his kind shes a hot headed little virago your mash will have it too that you were suffering from d t when that row on the jakko road turned up says shell die before she ever speaks to you again  i groaned and turned over to the other side  now youve got your choice my friend this engagement has to be broken off and the mannerings dont want to be too hard on you was it broken through d t or epileptic fits sorry i cant offer you a better exchange unless youd prefer hereditary insanity say the word and ill tell em its fits all simla knows about that scene on the ladies mile come ill give you five minutes to think over it  during those five minutes i believe that i explored thoroughly the lowest circles of the inferno which it is permitted man to tread on earth and at the same time i myself was watching myself faltering through the dark labyrinths of doubt misery and utter despair i wondered as heatherlegh in his chair might have wondered which dreadful alternative i should adopt presently i heard myself answering in a voice that i hardly recognized theyre confoundedly particular about morality in these parts give em fits heatherlegh and my love now let me sleep a bit longer  then my two selves joined and it was only i half crazed devildriven i that tossed in my bed tracing step by step the history of the past month  but i am in simla i kept repeating to myself i jack pansay am in simla and there are no ghosts here its unreasonable of that woman to pretend there are why couldnt agnes have left me alone i never did her any harm it might just as well have been me as agnes only id never have come hack on purpose to kill her why cant i be left aloneleft alone and happy  it was high noon when i first awoke and the sun was low in the sky before i sleptslept as the tortured criminal sleeps on his rack too worn to feel further pain  next day i could not leave my bed heatherlegh told me in the morning that he had received an answer from mr mannering and that thanks to his heatherleghs friendly offices the story of my affliction had traveled through the length and breadth of simla where i was on all sides much pitied  and thats rather more than you deserve he concluded pleasantly though the lord knows youve been going through a pretty severe mill never mind well cure you yet you perverse phenomenon  i declined firmly to be cured youve been much too good to me already old man said i but i dont think i need trouble you further  in my heart i knew that nothing heatherlegh could do would lighten the burden that had been laid upon me  with that knowledge came also a sense of hopeless impotent rebellion against the unreasonableness of it all there were scores of men no better than i whose punishments had at least been reserved for another world and i felt that it was bitterly cruelly unfair that i alone should have been singled out for so hideous a fate this mood would in time give place to another where it seemed that the rickshaw and i were the only realities in a world of shadows that kitty was a ghost that mannering heatherlegh and all the other men and women i knew were all ghosts and the great grey hills themselves but vain shadows devised to torture me from mood to mood i tossed backward and forward for seven weary days my body growing daily stronger and stronger until the bedroom lookingglass told me that i had returned to everyday life and was as other men once more curiously enough my face showed no signs of the struggle i had gone through it was pale indeed but as expressionless and commonplace as ever i had expected some permanent alterationvisible evidence of the disease that was eating me away i found nothing  on the 15th of may i left heatherleghs house at eleven oclock in the morning and the instinct of the bachelor drove me to the club there i found that every man knew my story as told by heatherlegh and was in clumsy fashion abnormally kind and attentive nevertheless i recognized that for the rest of my natural life i should be among but not of my fellows and i envied very bitterly indeed the laughing coolies on the mall below i lunched at the club and at four oclock wandered aimlessly down the mall in the vague hope of meeting kitty close to the bandstand the black and white liveries joined me and i heard mrs wessingtons old appeal at my side i had been expecting this ever since i came out and was only surprised at her delay the phantom rickshaw and i went side by side along the chota simla road in silence close to the bazar kitty and a man on horseback overtook and passed us for any sign she gave i might have been a dog in the road she did not even pay me the compliment of quickening her pace though the rainy afternoon had served for an excuse  so kitty and her companion and i and my ghostly lightolove crept round jakko in couples the road was streaming with water the pines dripped like roofpipes on the rocks below and the air was full of fine driving rain two or three times i found myself saying to myself almost aloudim jack pansay on leave at simlaat simla everyday ordinary simla i mustnt forget that i mustnt forget that then i would try to recollect some of the gossip i had heard at the club the prices of soandsos horsesanything in fact that related to the workaday angloindian world i knew so well i even repeated the multiplicationtable rapidly to myself to make quite sure that i was not taking leave of my senses it gave me much comfort and must have prevented my hearing mrs wessington for a time  once more i wearily climbed the convent slope and entered the level road here kitty and the man started off at a canter and i was left alone with mrs wessington agnes said i will you put back your hood and tell me what it all means the hood dropped noiselessly and i was face to face with my dead and buried mistress she was wearing the dress in which i had last seen her alive carried the same tiny handkerchief in her right hand and the same cardcase in her left a woman eight months dead with a cardcase i had to pin myself down to the multiplicationtable and to set both hands on the stone parapet of the road to assure myself that that at least was real  agnes i repeated for pitys sake tell me what it all means mrs wessington leaned forward with that odd quick turn of the head i used to know so well and spoke  if my story had not already so madly overleaped the hounds of all human belief i should apologize to you now as i know that no oneno not even kitty for whom it is written as some sort of justification of my conductwill believe me i will go on mrs wessington spoke and i walked with her from the sanjowlie road to the turning below the commanderinchiefs house as i might walk by the side of any living womans rickshaw deep in conversation the second and most tormenting of my moods of sickness had suddenly laid hold upon me and like the prince in tennysons poem i seemed to move amid a world of ghosts there had been a gardenparty at the commanderinchiefs and we two joined the crowd of homewardbound folk as i saw them then it seemed that they were the shadowsimpalpable  fantastic shadowsthat divided for mrs wessingtons rickshaw to pass through what we said during the course of that weird interview i cannotindeed i dare nottell heatherleghs comment would have been a short laugh and a remark that i had been mashing a brain eyeandstomach chimera it was a ghastly and yet in some indefinable way a marvelously dear experience could it be possible i wondered that i was in this life to woo a second time the woman i had killed by my own neglect and cruelty  i met kitty on the homeward roada shadow among shadows  if i were to describe all the incidents of the next fortnight in their order my story would never come to an end and your patience would he exhausted morning after morning and evening after evening the ghostly rickshaw and i used to wander through simla together wherever i went there the four black and white liveries followed me and bore me company to and from my hotel at the theatre i found them amid the crowd of yelling jhampanies outside the club veranda after a long evening of whist at the birthday ball waiting patiently for my reappearance and in broad daylight when i went calling save that it cast no shadow the rickshaw was in every respect as real to look upon as one of wood and iron more than once indeed i have had to check myself from warning some hardriding friend against cantering over it more than once i have walked down the mall deep in conversation with mrs wessington to the unspeakable amazement of the passersby  before i had been out and about a week i learned that the fit theory had been discarded in favor of insanity however i made no change in my mode of life i called rode and dined out as freely as ever i had a passion for the society of my kind which i had never felt before i hungered to be among the realities of life and at the same time i felt vaguely unhappy when i had been separated too long from my ghostly companion it would be almost impossible to describe my varying moods from the 15th of may up to today  the presence of the rickshaw filled me by turns with horror blind fear a dim sort of pleasure and utter despair i dared not leave simla and i knew that my stay there was killing me i knew moreover that it was my destiny to die slowly and a little every day my only anxiety was to get the penance over as quietly as might be alternately i hungered for a sight of kitty and watched her outrageous flirtations with my successorto speak more accurately my successorswith amused interest she was as much out of my life as i was out of hers by day i wandered with mrs wessington almost content by night i implored heaven to let me return to the world as i used to know it above all these varying moods lay the sensation of dull numbing wonder that the seen and the unseen should mingle so strangely on this earth to hound one poor soul to its grave                        august 27heatherlegh has been indefatigable in his attendance on me and only yesterday told me that i ought to send in an application for sick leave an application to escape the company of a phantom a request that the government would graciously permit me to get rid of five ghosts and an airy rickshaw by going to england heatherleghs proposition moved me to almost hysterical laughter i told him that i should await the end quietly at simla and i am sure that the end is not far off believe me that i dread its advent more than any word can say and i torture myself nightly with a thousand speculations as to the manner of my death  shall i die in my bed decently and as an english gentleman should die or in one last walk on the mall will my soul be wrenched from me to take its place forever and ever by the side of that ghastly phantasm shall i return to my old lost allegiance in the next world or shall i meet agnes loathing her and bound to her side through all eternity shall we two hover over the scene of our lives till the end of time as the day of my death draws nearer the intense horror that all living flesh feels toward escaped spirits from beyond the grave grows more and more powerful it is an awful thing to go down quick among the dead with scarcely onehalf of your life completed it is a thousand times more awful to wait as i do in your midst for i know not what unimaginable terror pity me at least on the score of my delusion for i know you will never believe what i have written here yet as surely as ever a man was done to death by the powers of darkness i am that man  in justice too pity her for as surely as ever woman was killed by man i killed mrs wessington and the last portion of my punishment is ever now upon me                      my own true ghost story  as i came through the desert thus it wasas i came through the desert            the city of dreadful night  somewhere in the other world where there are books and pictures and plays and shop windows to look at and thousands of men who spend their lives in building up all four lives a gentleman who writes real stories about the real insides of people and his name is mr walter besant but he will insist upon treating his ghostshe has published half a workshopful of themwith levity he makes his ghostseers talk familiarly and in some cases flirt outrageously with the phantoms you may treat anything from a viceroy to a vernacular paper with levity but you must behave reverently toward a ghost and particularly an indian one  there are in this land ghosts who take the form of fat cold pobby corpses and hide in trees near the roadside till a traveler passes then they drop upon his neck and remain there are also terrible ghosts of women who have died in childbed these wander along the pathways at dusk or hide in the crops near a village and call seductively but to answer their call is death in this world and the next their feet are turned backward that all sober men may recognize them there are ghosts of little children who have been thrown into wells these haunt well curbs and the fringes of jungles and wail under the stars or catch women by the wrist and beg to be taken up and carried these and the corpse ghosts however are only vernacular articles and do not attack sahibs no native ghost has yet been authentically reported to have frightened an englishman but many english ghosts have scared the life out of both white and black  nearly every other station owns a ghost there are said to be two at simla not counting the woman who blows the bellows at syree dakbungalow on the old road mussoorie has a house haunted of a very lively thing a white lady is supposed to do nightwatchman round a house in lahore dalhousie says that one of her houses repeats on autumn evenings all the incidents of a horrible horseandprecipice accident murree has a merry ghost and now that she has been swept by cholera will have room for a sorrowful one there are officers quarters in mian mir whose doors open without reason and whose furniture is guaranteed to creak not with the heat of june but with the weight of invisibles who come to lounge in the chairs peshawur possesses houses that none will willingly rent and there is somethingnot feverwrong with a big bungalow in allahabad the older provinces simply bristle with haunted houses and march phantom armies along their main thoroughfares  some of the dakbungalows on the grand trunk road have handy little cemeteries in their compoundwitnesses to the changes and chances of this mortal life in the days when men drove from calcutta to the northwest these bungalows are objectionable places to put up in they are generally very old always dirty while the khansamah is as ancient as the bungalow he either chatters senilely or falls into the long trances of age in both moods he is useless if you get angry with him he refers to some sahib dead and buried these thirty years and says that when he was in that sahibs service not a khansamah in the province could touch him then he jabbers and mows and trembles and fidgets among the dishes and you repent of your irritation  in these dakbungalows ghosts are most likely to be found and when found they should be made a note of not long ago it was my business to live in dak bungalows i never inhabited the same house for three nights running and grew to be learned in the breed i lived in governmentbuilt ones with red brick walls and rail ceilings an inventory of the furniture posted in every room and an excited snake at the threshold to give welcome i lived in converted onesold houses officiating as dakbungalowswhere nothing was in its proper place and there wasnt even a fowl for dinner i lived in secondhand palaces where the wind blew through openwork marble tracery just as uncomfortably as through a broken pane i lived in dakbungalows where the last entry in the visitors book was fifteen months old and where they slashed off the curry kids head with a sword it was my good luck to meet all sorts of men from sober traveling missionaries and deserters flying from british regiments to drunken loafers who threw whisky bottles at all who passed and my still greater good fortune just to escape a maternity case seeing that a fair proportion of the tragedy of our lives out here acted itself in dak bungalows i wondered that i had met no ghosts a ghost that would voluntarily hang about a dakbungalow would be mad of course but so many men have died mad in dakbungalows that there must be a fair percentage of lunatic ghosts  in due time i found my ghost or ghosts rather for there were two of them up till that hour i had sympathized with mr besants method of handling them as shown in the strange case of mr lucraft and other stories i am now in the opposition                                we will call the bungalow katmal dakbungalow but that was the smallest part of the horror a man with a sensitive hide has no right to sleep in dak bungalows he should marry katmal dakbungalow was old and rotten and unrepaired the floor was of worn brick the walls were filthy and the windows were nearly black with grime it stood on a bypath largely used by native subdeputy assistants of all kinds from finance to forests but real sahibs were rare the khansamah who was nearly bent double with old age said so  when i arrived there was a fitful undecided rain on the face of the land accompanied by a restless wind and every gust made a noise like the rattling of dry bones in the stiff toddy palms outside the khansamah completely lost his head on my arrival he had served a sahib once did i know that sahib he gave me the name of a wellknown man who has been buried for more than a quarter of a century and showed me an ancient daguerreotype of that man in his prehistoric youth i had seen a steel engraving of him at the head of a double volume of memoirs a month before and i felt ancient beyond telling  the day shut in and the khansamah went to get me food he did not go through the pretense of calling it khanamans victuals he said ratub and that means among other things grubdogs rations there was no insult in his choice of the term he had forgotten the other word i suppose  while he was cutting up the dead bodies of animals i settled myself down after exploring the dakbungalow there were three rooms beside my own which was a corner kennel each giving into the other through dingy white doors fastened with long iron bars the bungalow was a very solid one but the partition walls of the rooms were almost jerrybuilt in their flimsiness every step or bang of a trunk echoed from my room down the other three and every footfall came back tremulously from the far walls for this reason i shut the door there were no lampsonly candles in long glass shades an oil wick was set in the bathroom  for bleak unadulterated misery that dakbungalow was the worst of the many that i had ever set foot in there was no fireplace and the windows would not open so a brazier of charcoal would have been useless the rain and the wind splashed and gurgled and moaned round the house and the toddy palms rattled and roared  half a dozen jackals went through the compound singing and a hyena stood afar off and mocked them a hyena would convince a sadducee of the resurrection of the deadthe worst sort of dead then came the ratuba curious meal half native and half english in compositionwith the old khansamah babbling behind my chair about dead and gone english people and the windblown candles playing shadowbopeep with the bed and the mosquitocurtains it was just the sort of dinner and evening to make a man think of every single one of his past sins and of all the others that he intended to commit if he lived  sleep for several hundred reasons was not easy the lamp in the bathroom threw the most absurd shadows into the room and the wind was beginning to talk nonsense  just when the reasons were drowsy with bloodsucking i heard the regular letustakeandheavehimover grunt of dooliebearers in the compound first one doolie came in then a second and then a third i heard the doolies dumped on the ground and the shutter in front of my door shook thats some one trying to come in i said but no one spoke and i persuaded myself that it was the gusty wind the shutter of the room next to mine was attacked flung back and the inner door opened thats some subdeputy assistant i said and he has brought his friends with him now theyll talk and spit and smoke for an hour  but there were no voices and no footsteps no one was putting his luggage into the next room the door shut and i thanked providence that i was to be left in peace but i was curious to know where the doolies had gone i got out of bed and looked into the darkness there was never a sign of a doolie just as i was getting into bed again i heard in the next room the sound that no man in his senses can possibly mistakethe whir of a billiard ball down the length of the slates when the striker is stringing for break no other sound is like it a minute afterwards there was another whir and i got into bed i was not frightenedindeed i was not i was very curious to know what had become of the doolies i jumped into bed for that reason  next minute i heard the double click of a cannon and my hair sat up it is a mistake to say that hair stands up the skin of the head tightens and you can feel a faint prickly bristling all over the scalp that is the hair sitting up  there was a whir and a click and both sounds could only have been made by one thinga billiard ball i argued the matter out at great length with myself and the more i argued the less probable it seemed that one bed one table and two chairsall the furniture of the room next to minecould so exactly duplicate the sounds of a game of billiards after another cannon a three cushion one to judge by the whir i argued no more i had found my ghost and would have given worlds to have escaped from that dakbungalow i listened and with each listen the game grew clearer  there was whir on whir and click on click sometimes there was a double click and a whir and another click beyond any sort of doubt people were playing billiards in the next room and the next room was not big enough to hold a billiard table  between the pauses of the wind i heard the game go forwardstroke after stroke i tried to believe that i could not hear voices but that attempt was a failure  do you know what fear is not ordinary fear of insult injury or death but abject quivering dread of something that you cannot seefear that dries the inside of the mouth and half of the throatfear that makes you sweat on the palms of the hands and gulp in order to keep the uvula at work this is a fine feara great cowardice and must be felt to be appreciated the very improbability of billiards in a dakbungalow proved the reality of the thing no mandrunk or sobercould imagine a game at billiards or invent the spitting crack of a screwcannon  a severe course of dakbungalows has this disadvantageit breeds infinite credulity if a man said to a confirmed dakbungalow haunterthere is a corpse in the next room and theres a mad girl in the next but one and the woman and man on that camel have just eloped from a place sixty miles away the hearer would not disbelieve because he would know that nothing is too wild grotesque or horrible to happen in a dakbungalow  this credulity unfortunately extends to ghosts a rational person fresh from his own house would have turned on his side and slept i did not so surely as i was given up as a bad carcass by the scores of things in the bed because the bulk of my blood was in my heart so surely did i hear every stroke of a long game at billiards played in the echoing room behind the ironbarred door my dominant fear was that the players might want a marker it was an absurd fear because creatures who could play in the dark would be above such superfluities i only know that that was my terror and it was real  after a long long while the game stopped and the door banged i slept because i was dead tired otherwise i should have preferred to have kept awake not for everything in asia would i have dropped the doorbar and peered into the dark of the next room  when the morning came i considered that i had done well and wisely and inquired for the means of departure  by the way khansamah i said what were those three doolies doing in my compound in the night  there were no doolies said the khansamah  i went into the next room and the daylight streamed through the open door i was immensely brave i would at that hour have played black pool with the owner of the big black pool down below  has this place always been a dakbungalow i asked  no said the khansamah ten or twenty years ago i have forgotten how long it was a billiard room  a how much  a billiard room for the sahibs who built the railway i was khansamah then in the big house where all the railwaysahibs lived and i used to come across with brandyshrab these three rooms were all one and they held a big table on which the sahibs played every evening but the sahibs are all dead now and the railway runs you say nearly to kabul  do you remember anything about the sahibs  it is long ago but i remember that one sahib a fat man and always angry was playing here one night and he said to memangal khan brandypani do and i filled the glass and he bent over the table to strike and his head fell lower and lower till it hit the table and his spectacles came off and when wethe sahibs and i myselfran to lift him he was dead i helped to carry him out aha he was a strong sahib but he is dead and i old mangal khan am still living by your favor  that was more than enough i had my ghosta firsthand authenticated article i would write to the society for psychical researchi would paralyze the empire with the news but i would first of all put eighty miles of assessed crop land between myself and that dakbungalow before nightfall the society might send their regular agent to investigate later on  i went into my own room and prepared to pack after noting down the facts of the case as i smoked i heard the game begin againwith a miss in balk this time for the whir was a short one  the door was open and i could see into the room clickc1ick that was a cannon i entered the room without fear for there was sunlight within and a fresh breeze without the unseen game was going on at a tremendous rate and well it might when a restless little rat was running to and fro inside the dingy ceilingcloth and a piece of loose windowsash was making fifty breaks off the windowbolt as it shook in the breeze  impossible to mistake the sound of billiard balls impossible to mistake the whir of a ball over the slate but i was to be excused even when i shut my enlightened eyes the sound was marvelously like that of a fast game  entered angrily the faithful partner of my sorrows kadir baksh  this bungalow is very bad and lowcaste no wonder the presence was disturbed and is speckled three sets of dooliebearers came to the bungalow late last night when i was sleeping outside and said that it was their custom to rest in the rooms set apart for the english people what honor has the khansamah they tried to enter but i told them to go no wonder if these oorias have been here that the presence is sorely spotted it is shame and the work of a dirty man  kadir baksh did not say that he had taken from each gang two annas for rent in advance and then beyond my earshot had beaten them with the big green umbrella whose use i could never before divine but kadir baksh has no notions of morality  there was an interview with the khansamah but as he promptly lost his head wrath gave place to pity and pity led to a long conversation in the course of which he put the fat engineersahibs tragic death in three separate stationstwo of them fifty miles away the third shift was to calcutta and there the sahib died while driving a dogcart  if i had encouraged him the khansamah would have wandered all through bengal with his corpse  i did not go away as soon as i intended i stayed for the night while the wind and the rat and the sash and the windowbolt played a dingdong hundred and fifty up then the wind ran out and the billiards stopped and i felt that i had ruined my one genuine hallmarked ghost story  had i only stopped at the proper time i could have made anything out of it  that was the bitterest thought of all   the strange ride of morrowbie jukes   alive or deadthere is no other way              native proverb  there is as the conjurers say no deception about this tale jukes by accident stumbled upon a village that is well known to exist though he is the only englishman who has been there a somewhat similar institution used to flourish on the outskirts of calcutta and there is a story that if you go into the heart of bikanir which is in the heart of the great indian desert you shall come across not a village but a town where the dead who did not die but may not live have established their headquarters and since it is perfectly true that in the same desert is a wonderful city where all the rich money lenders retreat after they have made their fortunes fortunes so vast that the owners cannot trust even the strong hand of the government to protect them but take refuge in the waterless sands and drive sumptuous cspring barouches and buy beautiful girls and decorate their palaces with gold and ivory and minton tiles and motherofpearl i do not see why jukess tale should not be true he is a civil engineer with a head for plans and distances and things of that kind and he certainly would not take the trouble to invent imaginary traps he could earn more by doing his legitimate work he never varies the tale in the telling and grows very hot and indignant when he thinks of the disrespectful treatment he received he wrote this quite straightforwardly at first but he has since touched it up in places and introduced moral reflections thus  in the beginning it all arose from a slight attack of fever my work necessitated my being in camp for some months between pakpattan and muharakpura desolate sandy stretch of country as every one who has had the misfortune to go there may know my coolies were neither more nor less exasperating than other gangs and my work demanded sufficient attention to keep me from moping had i been inclined to so unmanly a weakness  on the 23d december 1884 i felt a little feverish there was a full moon at the time and in consequence every dog near my tent was baying it the brutes assembled in twos and threes and drove me frantic a few days previously i had shot one loudmouthed singer and suspended his carcass in terrorem about fifty yards from my tentdoor but his friends fell upon fought for and ultimately devoured the body and as it seemed to me sang their hymns of thanksgiving afterward with renewed energy  the lightheartedness which accompanies fever acts differently on different men my irritation gave way after a short time to a fixed determination to slaughter one huge black and white beast who had been foremost in song and first in flight throughout the evening thanks to a shaking hand and a giddy head i had already missed him twice with both barrels of my shotgun when it struck me that my best plan would be to ride him down in the open and finish him off with a hogspear this of course was merely the semidelirious notion of a fever patient but i remember that it struck me at the time as being eminently practical and feasible  i therefore ordered my groom to saddle pornic and bring him round quietly to the rear of my tent when the pony was ready i stood at his head prepared to mount and dash out as soon as the dog should again lift up his voice pornic by the way had not been out of his pickets for a couple of days the night air was crisp and chilly and i was armed with a specially long and sharp pair of persuaders with which i had been rousing a sluggish cob that afternoon you will easily believe then that when he was let go he went quickly in one moment for the brute bolted as straight as a die the tent was left far behind and we were flying over the smooth sandy soil at racing speed  in another we had passed the wretched dog and i had almost forgotten why it was that i had taken the horse and hogspear  the delirium of fever and the excitement of rapid motion through the air must have taken away the remnant of my senses i have a faint recollection of standing upright in my stirrups and of brandishing my hogspear at the great white moon that looked down so calmly on my mad gallop and of shouting challenges to the camelthorn bushes as they whizzed past once or twice i believe i swayed forward on pornics neck and literally hung on by my spurs as the marks next morning showed  the wretched beast went forward like a thing possessed over what seemed to be a limitless expanse of moonlit sand next i remember the ground rose suddenly in front of us and as we topped the ascent i saw the waters of the sutlej shining like a silver bar below then pornic blundered heavily on his nose and we rolled together down some unseen slope  i must have lost consciousness for when i recovered i was lying on my stomach in a heap of soft white sand and the dawn was beginning to break dimly over the edge of the slope down which i had fallen as the light grew stronger i saw that i was at the bottom of a horseshoe shaped crater of sand opening on one side directly on to the shoals of the sutlej my fever had altogether left me and with the exception of a slight dizziness in the head i felt no had effects from the fall over night  pornic who was standing a few yards away was naturally a good deal exhausted but had not hurt himself in the least his saddle a favorite polo one was much knocked about and had been twisted under his belly it took me some time to put him to rights and in the meantime i had ample opportunities of observing the spot into which i had so foolishly dropped  at the risk of being considered tedious i must describe it at length inasmuch as an accurate mental picture of its peculiarities will be of material assistance in enabling the reader to understand what follows  imagine then as i have said before a horseshoeshaped crater of sand with steeply graded sand walls about thirtyfive feet high the slope i fancy must have been about 65 degrees this crater enclosed a level piece of ground about fifty yards long by thirty at its broadest part with a crude well in the centre round the bottom of the crater about three feet from the level of the ground proper ran a series of eightythree semicircular ovoid square and multilateral holes all about three feet at the mouth each hole on inspection showed that it was carefully shored internally with driftwood and bamboos and over the mouth a wooden dripboard projected like the peak of a jockeys cap for two feet no sign of life was visible in these tunnels but a most sickening stench pervaded the entire amphitheatrea stench fouler than any which my wanderings in indian villages have introduced me to  having remounted pornic who was as anxious as i to get back to camp i rode round the base of the horseshoe to find some place whence an exit would be practicable the inhabitants whoever they might be had not thought fit to put in an appearance so i was left to my own devices my first attempt to rush pornic up the steep sandbanks showed me that i had fallen into a trap exactly on the same model as that which the antlion sets for its prey at each step the shifting sand poured down from above in tons and rattled on the dripboards of the holes like small shot a couple of ineffectual charges sent us both rolling down to the bottom half choked with the torrents of sand and i was constrained to turn my attention to the riverbank  here everything seemed easy enough the sand hills ran down to the river edge it is true but there were plenty of shoals and shallows across which i could gallop pornic and find my way back to terra firma by turning sharply to the right or left as i led pornic over the sands i was startled by the faint pop of a rifle across the river and at the same moment a bullet dropped with a sharp whit close to pornics head  there was no mistaking the nature of the missilea regulation martinihenry picket about five hundred yards away a countryboat was anchored in midstream and a jet of smoke drifting away from its bows in the still morning air showed me whence the delicate attention had come was ever a respectable gentleman in such an impasse the treacherous sand slope allowed no escape from a spot which i had visited most involuntarily and a promenade on the river frontage was the signal for a bombardment from some insane native in a boat im afraid that i lost my temper very much indeed  another bullet reminded me that i had better save my breath to cool my porridge and i retreated hastily up the sands and back to the horseshoe where i saw that the noise of the rifle had drawn sixtyfive human beings from the badgerholes which i had up till that point supposed to be untenanted i found myself in the midst of a crowd of spectatorsabout forty men twenty women and one child who could not have been more than five years old they were all scantily clothed in that salmoncolored cloth which one associates with hindu mendicants and at first sight gave me the impression of a band of loathsome fakirs the filth and repulsiveness of the assembly were beyond all description and i shuddered to think what their life in the badgerholes must be  even in these days when local self government has destroyed the greater part of a natives respect for a sahib i have been accustomed to a certain amount of civility from my inferiors and on approaching the crowd naturally expected that there would be some recognition of my presence as a matter of fact there was but it was by no means what i had looked for  the ragged crew actually laughed at mesuch laughter i hope i may never hear again  they cackled yelled whistled and howled as i walked into their midst some of them literally throwing themselves down on the ground in convulsions of unholy mirth in a moment i had let go pornics head and irritated beyond expression at the mornings adventure commenced cuffing those nearest to me with all the force i could the wretches dropped under my blows like ninepins and the laughter gave place to wails for mercy while those yet untouched clasped me round the knees imploring me in all sorts of uncouth tongues to spare them  in the tumult and just when i was feeling very much ashamed of myself for having thus easily given way to my temper a thin high voice murmured in english from behind my shoulder sahib sahib do you not know me sahib it is gunga dass the telegraphmaster  i spun round quickly and faced the speaker  gunga dass i have of course no hesitation in mentioning the mans real name i had known four years before as a deccanee brahmin loaned by the punjab government to one of the khalsia states he was in charge of a branch telegraphoffice there and when i had last met him was a jovial full stomached portly government servant with a marvelous capacity for making had puns in englisha peculiarity which made me remember him long after i had forgotten his services to me in his official capacity it is seldom that a hindu makes english puns  now however the man was changed beyond all recognition castemark stomach slatecolored continuations and unctuous speech were all gone i looked at a withered skeleton turbanless and almost naked with long matted hair and deepset codfisheyes  but for a crescentshaped scar on the left cheekthe result of an accident for which i was responsible i should never have known him but it was indubitably gunga dass andfor this i was thankfulan englishspeaking native who might at least tell me the meaning of all that i had gone through that day  the crowd retreated to some distance as i turned toward the miserable figure and ordered him to show me some method of escaping from the crate he held a freshly plucked crow in his hand and in reply to my question climbed slowly on a platform of sand which ran in front of the holes and commenced lighting a fire there in silence dried bents sandpoppies and driftwood burn quickly and i derived much consolation from the fact that he lit them with an ordinary sulphurmatch when they were in a bright glow and the crow was neatly spitted in front thereof gunga dass began without a word of preamble  there are only two kinds of men sar the alive and the dead when you are dead you are dead but when you are alive you live here the crow demanded his attention for an instant as it twirled before the fire in danger of being burned to a cinder if you die at home and do not die when you come to the ghat to be burned you come here  the nature of the reeking village was made plain now and all that i had known or read of the grotesque and the horrible paled before the fact just communicated by the exbrahmin sixteen years ago when i first landed in bombay i had been told by a wandering armenian of the existence somewhere in india of a place to which such hindus as had the misfortune to recover from trance or catalepsy were conveyed and kept and i recollect laughing heartily at what i was then pleased to consider a travelers tale  sitting at the bottom of the sandtrap the memory of watsons hotel with its swinging punkahs whiterobed attendants and the sallowfaced armenian rose up in my mind as vividly as a photograph and i burst into a loud fit of laughter the contrast was too absurd  gunga dass as he bent over the unclean bird watched me curiously hindus seldom laugh and his surroundings were not such as to move gunga dass to any undue excess of hilarity he removed the crow solemnly from the wooden spit and as solemnly devoured it then he continued his story which i give in his own words  in epidemics of the cholera you are carried to be burned almost before you are dead when you come to the riverside the cold air perhaps makes you alive and then if you are only little alive mud is put on your nose and mouth and you die conclusively if you are rather more alive more mud is put but if you are too lively they let you go and take you away i was too lively and made protestation with anger against the indignities that they endeavored to press upon me in those days i was brahmin and proud man  now i am dead man and eathere he eyed the wellgnawed breast bone with the first sign of emotion that i had seen in him since we metcrows and other things they took me from my sheets when they saw that i was too lively and gave me medicines for one week and i survived successfully then they sent me by rail from my place to okara station with a man to take care of me and at okara station we met two other men and they conducted we three on camels in the night from okara station to this place and they propelled me from the top to the bottom and the other two succeeded and i have been here ever since two and a half years once i was brahmin and proud man and now i eat crows  there is no way of getting out  none of what kind at all when i first came i made experiments frequently and all the others also but we have always succumbed to the sand which is precipitated upon our heads  but surely i broke in at this point the riverfront is open and it is worth while dodging the bullets while at nighti had already matured a rough plan of escape which a natural instinct of selfishness forbade me sharing with gunga dass he however divined my unspoken thought almost as soon as it was formed and to my intense astonishment gave vent to a long low chuckle of derisionthe laughter be it understood of a superior or at least of an equal  you will nothe had dropped the sir completely after his opening sentence make any escape that way but you can try i have tried once only  the sensation of nameless terror and abject fear which i had in vain attempted to strive against overmastered me completely my long fastit was now close upon ten oclock and i had eaten nothing since tiffin on the previous day combined with the violent and unnatural agitation of the ride had exhausted me and i verily believe that for a few minutes i acted as one mad i hurled myself against the pitiless sandslope i ran round the base of the crater blaspheming and praying by turns i crawled out among the sedges of the river front only to be driven back each time in an agony of nervous dread by the riflebullets which cut up the sand round mefor i dared not face the death of a mad dog among that hideous crowdand finally fell spent and raving at the curb of the well no one had taken the slightest notion of an exhibition which makes me blush hotly even when i think of it now  two or three men trod on my panting body as they drew water but they were evidently used to this sort of thing and had no time to waste upon me the situation was humiliating gunga dass indeed when he had banked the embers of his fire with sand was at some pains to throw half a cupful of fetid water over my head an attention for which i could have fallen on my knees and thanked him but he was laughing all the while in the same mirthless wheezy key that greeted me on my first attempt to force the shoals and so in a semicomatose condition i lay till noon  then being only a man after all i felt hungry and intimated as much to gunga dass whom i had begun to regard as my natural protector following the impulse of the outer world when dealing with natives i put my hand into my pocket and drew out four annas the absurdity of the gift struck me at once and i was about to replace the money  gunga dass however was of a different opinion give me the money said he all you have or i will get help and we will kill you all this as if it were the most natural thing in the world  a britons first impulse i believe is to guard the contents of his pockets but a moments reflection convinced me of the futility of differing with the one man who had it in his power to make me comfortable and with whose help it was possible that i might eventually escape from the crater i gave him all the money in my possession rs 985nine rupees eight annas and five pie for i always keep small change as bakshish when i am in camp gunga dass clutched the coins and hid them at once in his ragged loin cloth his expression changing to something diabolical as he looked round to assure himself that no one had observed us  now i will give you something to eat said he  what pleasure the possession of my money could have afforded him i am unable to say but inasmuch as it did give him evident delight i was not sorry that i had parted with it so readily for i had no doubt that he would have had me killed if i had refused one does not protest against the vagaries of a den of wild beasts and my companions were lower than any beasts while i devoured what gunga dass had provided a coarse chapatti and a cupful of the foul well water the people showed not the faintest sign of curiositythat curiosity which is so rampant as a rule in an indian village  i could even fancy that they despised me at all events they treated me with the most chilling indifference and gunga dass was nearly as bad i plied him with questions about the terrible village and received extremely unsatisfactory answers so far as i could gather it had been in existence from time immemorialwhence i concluded that it was at least a century old and during that time no one had ever been known to escape from it i had to control myself here with both hands lest the blind terror should lay hold of me a second time and drive me raving round the crater gunga dass took a malicious pleasure in emphasizing this point and in watching me wince nothing that i could do would induce him to tell me who the mysterious they were  it is so ordered he would reply and i do not yet know any one who has disobeyed the orders  only wait till my servants find that i am missing i retorted and i promise you that this place shall be cleared off the face of the earth and ill give you a lesson in civility too my friend  your servants would be torn in pieces before they came near this place and besides you are dead my dear friend it is not your fault of course but none the less you are dead and buried  at irregular intervals supplies of food i was told were dropped down from the land side into the amphitheatre and the inhabitants fought for them like wild beasts when a man felt his death coming on he retreated to his lair and died there the body was sometimes dragged out of the hole and thrown on to the sand or allowed to rot where it lay  the phrase thrown on to the sand caught my attention and i asked gunga dass whether this sort of thing was not likely to breed a pestilence  that said he with another of his wheezy chuckles you may see for yourself subsequently you will have much time to make observations  whereat to his great delight i winced once more and hastily continued the conversation and how do you live here from day to day what do you do the question elicited exactly the same answer as before coupled with the information that this place is like your european heaven there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage  gunga dass had been educated at a mission school and as he himself admitted had he only changed his religion like a wise man might have avoided the living grave which was now his portion but as long as i was with him i fancy he was happy  here was a sahib a representative of the dominant race helpless as a child and completely at the mercy of his native neighbors in a deliberate lazy way he set himself to torture me as a schoolboy would devote a rapturous halfhour to watching the agonies of an impaled beetle or as a ferret in a blind burrow might glue himself comfortably to the neck of a rabbit the burden of his conversation was that there was no escape of no kind whatever and that i should stay here till i died and was thrown on to the sand if it were possible to forejudge the conversation of the damned on the advent of a new soul in their abode i should say that they would speak as gunga dass did to me throughout that long afternoon i was powerless to protest or answer all my energies being devoted to a struggle against the inexplicable terror that threatened to overwhelm me again and again i can compare the feeling to nothing except the struggles of a man against the overpowering nausea of the channel passageonly my agony was of the spirit and infinitely more terrible  as the day wore on the inhabitants began to appear in full strength to catch the rays of the afternoon sun which were now sloping in at the mouth of the crater they assembled in little knots and talked among themselves without even throwing a glance in my direction about four oclock as far as i could judge gunga dass rose and dived into his lair for a moment emerging with a live crow in his hands the wretched bird was in a most draggled and deplorable condition but seemed to be in no way afraid of its master advancing cautiously to the river front gunga dass stepped from tussock to tussock until he had reached a smooth patch of sand directly in the line of the boats fire the occupants of the boat took no notice here he stopped and with a couple of dexterous turns of the wrist pegged the bird on its back with outstretched wings as was only natural the crow began to shriek at once and beat the air with its claws in a few seconds the clamor had attracted the attention of a bevy of wild crows on a shoal a few hundred yards away where they were discussing something that looked like a corpse half a dozen crows flew over at once to see what was going on and also as it proved to attack the pinioned bird gunga dass who had lain down on a tussock motioned to me to be quiet though i fancy this was a needless precaution in a moment and before i could see how it happened a wild crow who had grappled with the shrieking and helpless bird was entangled in the latters claws swiftly disengaged by gunga dass and pegged down beside its companion in adversity curiosity it seemed overpowered the rest of the flock and almost before gunga dass and i had time to withdraw to the tussock two more captives were struggling in the upturned claws of the decoys so the chaseif i can give it so dignified a namecontinued until gunga dass had captured seven crows five of them he throttled at once reserving two for further operations another day i was a good deal impressed by this to me novel method of securing food and complimented gunga dass on his skill  it is nothing to do said he tomorrow you must do it for me you are stronger than i am  this calm assumption of superiority upset me not a little and i answered peremptorilyindeed you old ruffian what do you think i have given you money for  very well was the unmoved reply perhaps not tomorrow nor the day after nor subsequently but in the end and for many years you will catch crows and eat crows and you will thank your european god that you have crows to catch and eat  i could have cheerfully strangled him for this but judged it best under the circumstances to smother my resentment an hour later i was eating one of the crows and as gunga dass had said thanking my god that i had a crow to eat never as long as i live shall i forget that evening meal the whole population were squatting on the hard sand platform opposite their dens huddled over tiny fires of refuse and dried rushes death having once laid his hand upon these men and forborne to strike seemed to stand aloof from them now for most of our company were old men bent and worn and twisted with years and women aged to all appearance as the fates themselves they sat together in knots and talkedgod only knows what they found to discussin low equable tones curiously in contrast to the strident babble with which natives are accustomed to make day hideous now and then an access of that sudden fury which had possessed me in the morning would lay hold on a man or woman and with yells and imprecations the sufferer would attack the steep slope until baffled and bleeding he fell back on the platform incapable of moving a limb the others would never even raise their eyes when this happened as men too well aware of the futility of their fellows attempts and wearied with their useless repetition i saw four such outbursts in the course of the evening  gunga dass took an eminently businesslike view of my situation and while we were diningi can afford to laugh at the recollection now but it was painful enough at the time propounded the terms on which he would consent to do for me my nine rupees eight annas he argued at the rate of three annas a day would provide me with food for fiftyone days or about seven weeks that is to say he would be willing to cater for me for that length of time at the end of it i was to look after myself for a further considerationvidelicet my bootshe would be willing to allow me to occupy the den next to his own and would supply me with as much dried grass for bedding as he could spare  very well gunga dass i replied to the first terms i cheerfully agree but as there is nothing on earth to prevent my killing you as you sit here and taking everything that you have i thought of the two invaluable crows at the time i flatly refuse to give you my boots and shall take whichever den i please  the stroke was a bold one and i was glad when i saw that it had succeeded gunga dass changed his tone immediately and disavowed all intention of asking for my boots at the time it did not strike me as at all strange that i a civil engineer a man of thirteen years standing in the service and i trust an average englishman should thus calmly threaten murder and violence against the man who had for a consideration it is true taken me under his wing i had left the world it seemed for centuries i was as certain then as i am now of my own existence that in the accursed settlement there was no law save that of the strongest that the living dead men had thrown behind them every canon of the world which had cast them out and that i had to depend for my own life on my strength and vigilance alone the crew of the illfated mignonette are the only men who would understand my frame of mind at present i argued to myself i am strong and a match for six of these wretches it is imperatively necessary that i should for my own sake keep both health and strength until the hour of my release comesif it ever does  fortified with these resolutions i ate and drank as much as i could and made gunga dass understand that i intended to be his master and that the least sign of insubordination on his part would be visited with the only punishment i had it in my power to inflictsudden and violent death shortly after this i went to bed  that is to say gunga dass gave me a double armful of dried bents which i thrust down the mouth of the lair to the right of his and followed myself feet foremost the hole running about nine feet into the sand with a slight downward inclination and being neatly shored with timbers from my den which faced the riverfront i was able to watch the waters of the sutlej flowing past under the light of a young moon and compose myself to sleep as best i might  the horrors of that night i shall never forget my den was nearly as narrow as a coffin and the sides had been worn smooth and greasy by the contact of innumerable naked bodies added to which it smelled abominably sleep was altogether out of question to one in my excited frame of mind as the night wore on it seemed that the entire amphitheatre was filled with legions of unclean devils that trooping up from the shoals below mocked the unfortunates in their lairs  personally i am not of an imaginative temperamentvery few engineers are but on that occasion i was as completely prostrated with nervous terror as any woman after half an hour or so however i was able once more to calmly review my chances of escape any exit by the steep sand walls was of course impracticable i had been thoroughly convinced of this some time before it was possible just possible that i might in the uncertain moonlight safely run the gauntlet of the rifle shots the place was so full of terror for me that i was prepared to undergo any risk in leaving it imagine my delight then when after creeping stealthily to the riverfront i found that the infernal boat was not there my freedom lay before me in the next few steps  by walking out to the first shallow pool that lay at the foot of the projecting left horn of the horseshoe i could wade across turn the flank of the crater and make my way inland without a moments hesitation i marched briskly past the tussocks where gunga dass had snared the crows and out in the direction of the smooth white sand beyond my first step from the tufts of dried grass showed me how utterly futile was any hope of escape for as i put my foot down i felt an indescribable drawing sucking motion of the sand below another moment and my leg was swallowed up nearly to the knee in the moonlight the whole surface of the sand seemed to be shaken with devilish delight at my disappointment i struggled clear sweating with terror and exertion back to the tussocks behind me and fell on my face  my only means of escape from the semicircle was protected with a quicksand  how long i lay i have not the faintest idea but i was roused at last by the malevolent chuckle of gunga dass at my ear i would advise you protector of the poor the ruffian was speaking english to return to your house it is unhealthy to lie down here moreover when the boat returns you will most certainly be rifled at he stood over me in the dim light of the dawn chuckling and laughing to himself suppressing my first impulse to catch the man by the neck and throw him on to the quicksand i rose sullenly and followed him to the platform below the burrows  suddenly and futilely as i thought while i spoke i askedgunga dass what is the good of the boat if i cant get out anyhow i recollect that even in my deepest trouble i had been speculating vaguely on the waste of ammunition in guarding an already well protected foreshore  gunga dass laughed again and made answerthey have the boat only in daytime it is for the reason that there is a way i hope we shall have the pleasure of your company for much longer time it is a pleasant spot when you have been here some years and eaten roast crow long enough  i staggered numbed and helpless toward the fetid burrow allotted to me and fell asleep an hour or so later i was awakened by a piercing screamthe shrill highpitched scream of a horse in pain those who have once heard that will never forget the sound i found some little difficulty in scrambling out of the burrow when i was in the open i saw pornic my poor old pornic lying dead on the sandy soil how they had killed him i cannot guess  gunga dass explained that horse was better than crow and greatest good of greatest number is political maxim we are now republic mister jukes and you are entitled to a fair share of the beast if you like we will pass a vote of thanks shall i propose  yes we were a republic indeed a republic of wild beasts penned at the bottom of a pit to eat and fight and sleep till we died i attempted no protest of any kind but sat down and stared at the hideous sight in front of me in less time almost than it takes me to write this pornics body was divided in some unclear way or other the men and women had dragged the fragments on to the platform and were preparing their normal meal gunga dass cooked mine the almost irresistible impulse to fly at the sand walls until i was wearied laid hold of me afresh and i had to struggle against it with all my might gunga dass was offensively jocular till i told him that if he addressed another remark of any kind whatever to me i should strangle him where he sat this silenced him till silence became insupportable and i bade him say something  you will live here till you die like the other feringhi he said coolly watching me over the fragment of gristle that he was gnawing  what other sahib you swine speak at once and dont stop to tell me a lie  he is over there answered gunga dass pointing to a burrowmouth about four doors ta the left of my own you can see for yourself he died in the burrow as you will die and i will die and as all these men and women and the one child will also die  for pitys sake tell me all you know about him who was he when did he come and when did he die  this appeal was a weak step on my part gunga dass only leered and replied i will notunless you give me something first  then i recollected where i was and struck the man between the eyes partially stunning him he stepped down from the platform at once and cringing and fawning and weeping and attempting to embrace my feet led me round to the burrow which he had indicated  i know nothing whatever about the gentleman your god be my witness that i do not he was as anxious to escape as you were and he was shot from the boat though we all did all things to prevent him from attempting he was shot here gunga dass laid his hand on his lean stomach and bowed to the earth  well and what then go on  and thenand then your honor we carried him in to his house and gave him water and put wet cloths on the wound and he laid down in his house and gave up the ghost  in how long in how long  about half an hour after he received his wound i call vishnu to witness yelled the wretched man that i did everything for him everything which was possible that i did  he threw himself down on the ground and clasped my ankles but i had my doubts about gunga dasss benevolence and kicked him off as he lay protesting  i believe you robbed him of everything he had but i can find out in a minute or two how long was the sahib here  nearly a year and a half i think he must have gone mad but hear me swear protector of the poor wont your honor hear me swear that i never touched an article that belonged to him what is your worship going to do  i had taken gunga dass by the waist and had hauled him on to the platform opposite the deserted burrow as i did so i thought of my wretched fellow prisoners unspeakable misery among all these horrors for eighteen months and the final agony of dying like a rat in a hole with a bulletwound in the stomach gunga dass fancied i was going to kill him and howled pitifully the rest of the population in the plethora that follows a full flesh meal watched us without stirring  go inside gunga dass said i and fetch it out  i was feeling sick and faint with horror now gunga dass nearly rolled off the platform and howled aloud  but i am brahmin sahiba highcaste brahmin by your soul by your fathers soul do not make me do this thing  brahmin or no brahmin by my soul and my fathers soul in you go i said and seizing him by the shoulders i crammed his head into the mouth of the burrow kicked the rest of him in and sitting down covered my face with my hands  at the end of a few minutes i heard a rustle and a creak then gunga dass in a sobbing choking whisper speaking to himself then a soft thudand i uncovered my eyes  the dry sand had turned the corpse entrusted to its keeping into a yellow brown mummy i told gunga dass to stand off while i examined it  the bodyclad in an olivegreen huntingsuit much stained and worn with leather pads on the shoulderswas that of a man between thirty and forty above middle height with light sandy hair long mustache and a rough unkempt beard the left canine of the upper jaw was missing and a portion of the lobe of the right ear was gone on the second finger of the left hand was a ringa shieldshaped bloodstone set in gold with a monogram that might have been either bk or bl on the third finger of the right hand was a silver ring in the shape of a coiled cobra much worn and tarnished gunga dass deposited a handful of trifles he had picked out of the burrow at my feet and covering the face of the body with my handkerchief i turned to examine these i give the full list in the hope that it may lead to the identification of the unfortunate man  1 bowl of a briarwood pipe serrated at the edge much worn and blackened bound with string at the crew  2 two patentlever keys wards of both broken  3 tortoiseshellhandled penknife silver or nickel nameplate marked with monogram bk  4 envelope postmark undecipherable bearing a victorian stamp addressed to miss mon rest illegible hamnt  5 imitation crocodileskin notebook with pencil  first fortyfive pages blank four and a half

or jack  6handle of smallsized huntingknife blade snapped short bucks horn diamond cut with swivel and ring on the butt fragment of cotton cord attached  it must not be supposed that i inventoried all these things on the spot as fully as i have here written them down the notebook first attracted my attention and i put it in my pocket with a view of studying it later on  the rest of the articles i conveyed to my burrow for safetys sake and there being a methodical man i inventoried them i then returned to the corpse and ordered gunga dass to help me to carry it out to the riverfront while we were engaged in this the exploded shell of an old brown cartridge dropped out of one of the pockets and rolled at my feet gunga dass had not seen it and i fell to thinking that a man does not carry exploded cartridgecases especially browns which will not bear loading twice about with him when shooting in other words that cartridgecase had been fired inside the crater consequently there must be a gun somewhere i was on the verge of asking gunga dass but checked myself knowing that he would lie we laid the body down on the edge of the quicksand by the tussocks it was my intention to push it out and let it be swallowed upthe only possible mode of burial that i could think of i ordered gunga dass to go away  then i gingerly put the corpse out on the quicksand in doing soit was lying face downwardi tore the frail and rotten khaki shootingcoat open disclosing a hideous cavity in the back i have already told you that the dry sand had as it were mummified the body a moments glance showed that the gaping hole had been caused by a gunshot wound the gun must have been fired with the muzzle almost touching the back the shootingcoat being intact had been drawn over the body after death which must have been instantaneous the secret of the poor wretchs death was plain to me in a flash some one of the crater presumably gunga dass must have shot him with his own gunthe gun that fitted the brown cartridges he had never attempted to escape in the face of the riflefire from the boat  i pushed the corpse out hastily and saw it sink from sight literally in a few seconds i shuddered as i watched in a dazed halfconscious way i turned to peruse the notebook a stained and discolored slip of paper bad been inserted between the binding and the back and dropped out as i opened the pages this is what it containedfour out from crowclump three left nine out two right three back two left fourteen out two left seven out one left nine back two right six back four right seven back the paper had been burned and charred at the edges what it meant i could not understand i sat down on the dried bents turning it over and over between my fingers until i was aware of gunga dass standing immediately behind me with glowing eyes and outstretched hands  have you got it he panted will you not let me look at it also i swear that i will return it  got what  return what asked  that which you have in your hands it will help us both he stretched out his long birdlike talons trembling with eagerness  i could never find it he continued he had secreted it about his person therefore i shot him but nevertheless i was unable to obtain it  gunga dass had quite forgotten his little fiction about the riflebullet i received the information perfectly calmly morality is blunted by consorting with the dead who are alive  what on earth are you raving about what is it you want me to give you  the piece of paper in the notebook it will help us both oh you fool you fool can you not see what it will do for us we shall escape  his voice rose almost to a scream and he danced with excitement before me i own i was moved at the chance of my getting away  dont skip explain yourself do you mean to say that this slip of paper will help us what does it mean  read it aloud read it aloud i beg and i pray you to read it aloud  i did so gunga dass listened delightedly and drew an irregular line in the sand with his fingers  see now it was the length of his gunbarrels without the stock i have those barrels four gunbarrels out from the place where i caught crows straight out do you follow me then three leftah how well i remember when that man worked it out night after night then nine out and so on out is always straight before you across the quicksand he told me so before i killed him  but if you knew all this why didnt you get out before  i did not know it he told me that he was working it out a year and a half ago and how he was working it out night after night when the boat had gone away and he could get out near the quicksand safely then he said that we would get away together but i was afraid that he would leave me behind one night when he had worked it all out and so i shot him besides it is not advisable that the men who once get in here should escape only i and i am a brahmin  the prospect of escape had brought gunga dasss caste back to him he stood up walked about and gesticulated violently eventually i managed to make him talk soberly and he told me how this englishman had spent six months night after night in exploring inch by inch the passage across the quicksand how he had declared it to be simplicity itself up to within about twenty yards of the river bank after turning the flank of the left horn of the horseshoe this much he had evidently not completed when gunga dass shot him with his own gun  in my frenzy of delight at the possibilities of escape i recollect shaking hands effusively with gunga dass after we had decided that we were to make an attempt to get away that very night it was weary work waiting throughout the afternoon  about ten oclock as far as i could judge when the moon had just risen above the lip of the crater gunga dass made a move for his burrow to bring out the gunbarrels whereby to measure our path all the other wretched inhabitants had retired to their lairs long ago the guardian boat drifted downstream some hours before and we were utterly alone by the crowclump gunga dass while carrying the gunbarrels let slip the piece of paper which was to be our guide i stooped down hastily to recover it and as i did so i was aware that the diabolical brahmin was aiming a violent blow at the back of my head with the gunbarrels it was too late to turn round i must have received the blow somewhere on the nape of my neck a hundred thousand fiery stars danced before my eyes and i fell forwards senseless at the edge of the quicksand  when i recovered consciousness the moon was going down and i was sensible of intolerable pain in the back of my head gunga dass had disappeared and my mouth was full of blood i lay down again and prayed that i might die without more ado then the unreasoning fury which i had before mentioned laid hold upon me and i staggered inland toward the walls of the crater it seemed that some one was calling to me in a whispersahib sahib sahib exactly as my bearer used to call me in the morning i fancied that i was delirious until a handful of sand fell at my feet then i looked up and saw a head peering down into the amphitheatrethe head of dunnoo my dogboy who attended to my collies as soon as he had attracted my attention he held up his hand and showed a rope i motioned staggering to and fro for the while that he should throw it down it was a couple of leather punkahropes knotted together with a loop at one end i slipped the loop over my head and under my arms heard dunnoo urge something forward was conscious that i was being dragged face downward up the steep sand slope and the next instant found myself choked and half fainting on the sand hills overlooking the crater dunnoo with his face ashy grey in the moonlight implored me not to stay but to get back to my tent at once  it seems that he had tracked pornics footprints fourteen miles across the sands to the crater had returned and told my servants who flatly refused to meddle with any one white or black once fallen into the hideous village of the dead whereupon dunnoo had taken one of my ponies and a couple of punkah ropes returned to the crater and hauled me out as i have described  to cut a long story short dunnoo is now my personal servant on a gold mohur a montha sum which i still think far too little for the services he has rendered nothing on earth will induce me to go near that devilish spot again or to reveal its whereabouts more clearly than i have done of gunga dass i have never found a trace nor do i wish to do my sole motive in giving this to be published is the hope that some one may possibly identify from the details and the inventory which i have given above the corpse of the man in the olivegreen huntingsuit                   the man who would be king   brother to a prince and fellow to a beggar if he be found worthy   the law as quoted lays down a fair conduct of life and one not easy to follow i have been fellow to a beggar again and again under circumstances which prevented either of us finding out whether the other was worthy i have still to be brother to a prince though i once came near to kinship with what might have been a veritable king and was promised the reversion of a kingdom army lawcourts revenue and policy all complete but today i greatly fear that my king is dead and if i want a crown i must go hunt it for myself  the beginning of everything was in a railwaytrain upon the road to mhow from ajmir there had been a deficit in the budget which necessitated travelling not secondclass which is only half as dear as firstclass but by intermediate which is very awful indeed there are no cushions in the intermediate class and the population are either intermediate which is eurasian or native which for a long night journey is nasty or loafer which is amusing though intoxicated intermediates do not buy from refreshment rooms they carry their food in bundles and pots and buy sweets from the native sweetmeatsellers and drink the roadside water this is why in hot weather intermediates are taken out of the carriages dead and in all weathers are most properly looked down upon  my particular intermediate happened to be empty till i reached nasirabad when the big blackbrowed gentleman in shirtsleeves entered and following the custom of intermediates passed the time of day he was a wanderer and a vagabond like myself but with an educated taste for whisky he told tales of things he had seen and done of outoftheway corners of the empire into which he had penetrated and of adventures in which he risked his life for a few days food  if india was filled with men like you and me not knowing more than the crows where theyd get their next days rations it isnt seventy millions of revenue the land would be payingits seven hundred millions said he and as i looked at his mouth and chin i was disposed to agree with him  we talked politicsthe politics of loaferdom that sees things from the under side where the lath and plaster is not smoothed offand we talked postal arrangements because my friend wanted to send a telegram back from the next station to ajmir the turningoff place from the bombay to the mhow line as you travel westward my friend had no money beyond eight annas which he wanted for dinner and i had no money at all owing to the hitch in the budget before mentioned further i was going into a wilderness where though i should resume touch with the treasury there were no telegraph offices i was therefore unable to help him in any way  we might threaten a stationmaster and make him send a wire on tick said my friend but thatd mean inquiries for you and for me and ive got my hands full these days did you say you were travelling back along this line within any days  within ten i said  cant you make it eight said he mine is rather urgent business  i can send your telegrams within ten days if that will serve you i said  i couldnt trust the wire to fetch him now i think of it its this way he leaves delhi on the 23rd for bombay that means hell be running through ajmir about the night of the 23rd  but im going into the indian desert i explained  well and good said he youll be changing at marwar junction to get into jodhpore territoryyou must do thatand hell be coming through marwar junction in the early morning of the 24th by the bombay mail can you be at marwar junction on that time t wont be inconveniencing you because i know that theres precious few pickings to be got out of these central india stateseven though you pretend to be correspondent of the backwoodsman   have you ever tried that trick i asked  again and again but the residents find you out and then you get escorted to the border before youve time to get your knife into them but about my friend here i must give him a word o mouth to tell him whats come to me or else he wont know where to go i would take it more than kind of you if you was to come out of central india in time to catch him at marwar junction and say to him he has gone south for the week hell know what that means hes a big man with a red beard and a great swell he is  youll find him sleeping like a gentleman with all his luggage round him in a secondclass apartment but dont you be afraid  slip down the window and say he has gone south for the week and hell tumble its only cutting your time of stay in those parts by two days i ask you as a strangergoing to the west he said with emphasis  where have you come from said i  from the east said he and i am hoping that you will give him the message on the squarefor the sake of my mother as well as your own  englishmen are not usually softened by appeals to the memory of their mothers but for certain reasons which will be fully apparent i saw fit to agree  its more than a little matter said he and thats why i asked you to do itand now i know that i can depend on you doing it a secondclass carriage at marwar junction and a redhaired man asleep in it youll be sure to remember i get out at the next station and i must hold on there till he comes or sends me what i want  ill give the message if i catch him i said and for the sake of your mother as well as mine ill give you a word of advice dont try to run the central india states just now as the correspondent of the backwoodsman theres a real one knocking about here and it might lead to trouble  thank you said he simply and when will the swine be gone i cant starve because hes ruining my work i wanted to get hold of the degumber rajah down here about his fathers widow and give him a jump  what did he do to his fathers widow then  filled her up with red pepper and slippered her to death as she hung from a beam i found that out myself and im the only man that would dare going into the state to get hushmoney for it theyll try to poison me same as they did in chortumna when i went on the loot there but youll give the man at marwar junction my message  he got out at a little roadside station and i reflected i had heard more than once of men personating correspondents of newspapers and bleeding small native states with threats of exposure but i had never met any of the caste before they lead a hard life and generally die with great suddenness the native states have a wholesome horror of english newspapers which may throw light on their peculiar methods of government and do their best to choke correspondents with champagne or drive them out of their mind with fourin hand barouches they do not understand that nobody cares a straw for the internal administration of native states so long as oppression and crime are kept within decent limits and the ruler is not drugged drunk or diseased from one end of the year to the other they are the dark places of the earth full of unimaginable cruelty touching the railway and the telegraph on one side and on the other the days of harunalraschid when i left the train i did business with divers kings and in eight days passed through many changes of life sometimes i wore dressclothes and consorted with princes and politicals drinking from crystal and eating from silver sometimes i lay out upon the ground and devoured what i could get from a plate made of leaves and drank the running water and slept under the same rug as my servant it was all in the days work  then i headed for the great indian desert upon the proper date as i had promised and the night mail set me down at marwar junction where a funny little happygolucky native managed railway runs to jodhpore the bombay mail from delhi makes a short halt at marwar she arrived just as i got in and i had just time to hurry to her platform and go down the carriages there was only one secondclass on the train i slipped the window and looked down upon a flamingred beard half covered by a railwayrug that was my man fast asleep and i dug him gently in the ribs  he woke with a grunt and i saw his face in the light of the lamps  it was a great and shining face  tickets again said he  no said i i am to tell you that he is gone south for the week he has gone south for the week  the train had begun to move out the red man rubbed his eyes  he has gone south for the week he repeated now thats just like his impidence did he say that i was to give you anything cause i wont  he didnt i said and dropped away and watched the red lights die out in the dark it was horribly cold because the wind was blowing off the sands i climbed into my own trainnot an intermediate carriage this timeand went to sleep  if the man with the beard had given me a rupee i should have kept it as a memento of a rather curious affair but the consciousness of having done my duty was my only reward  later on i reflected that two gentlemen like my friends could not do any good if they foregathered and personated correspondents of newspapers and might if they blackmailed one of the little rattrap states of central india or southern rajputana get themselves into serious difficulties i therefore took some trouble to describe them as accurately as i could remember to people who would be interested in deporting them and succeeded so i was later informed in having them headed back from the degumber borders  then i became respectable and returned to an office where there were no kings and no incidents outside the daily manufacture of a newspaper a newspaper office seems to attract every conceivable sort of person to the prejudice of discipline zenanamission ladies arrive and beg that the editor will instantly abandon all his duties to describe a christian prizegiving in a back slum of a perfectly inaccessible village colonels who have been overpassed for command sit down and sketch the outline of a series of ten twelve or twenty four leading articles on seniority versus selection missionaries wish to know why they have not been permitted to escape from their regular vehicles of abuse and swear at a brother missionary under special patronage of the editorial we stranded theatrical companies troop up to explain that they cannot pay for their advertisements but on their return from new zealand or tahiti will do so with interest inventors of patent punkapulling machines carriage couplings and unbreakable swords and axletrees call with specifications in their pockets and hours at their disposal tea companies enter and elaborate their prospectuses with the office pens secretaries of ball committees clamour to have the glories of their last dance more fully described strange ladies rustle in and say i want a hundred ladys cards printed at once please which is manifestly part of an editors duty and every dissolute ruffian that ever tramped the grand trunk road makes it his business to ask for employment as a proofreader and all the time the telephonebell is ringing madly and kings are being killed on the continent and empires are saying youre another and mister gladstone is calling down brimstone upon the british dominions and the little black copyboys are whining kaapi chayhayeh copy wanted like tired bees and most of the paper is as blank as modreds shield  but that is the amusing part of the year there are six other months when none ever come to call and the thermometer walks inch by inch up to the top of the glass and the office is darkened to just above readinglight and the press machines are redhot to touch and nobody writes anything but accounts of amusements in the hillstations or obituary notices then the telephone becomes a tinkling terror because it tells you of the sudden deaths of men and women that you knew intimately and the prickly heat covers you with a garment and you sit down and write a slight increase of sickness is reported from the khuda janta khan district the outbreak is purely sporadic in its nature and thanks to the energetic efforts of the district authorities is now almost at an end it is however with deep regret we record the death etc  then the sickness really breaks out and the less recording and reporting the better for the peace of the subscribers but the empires and the kings continue to divert themselves as selfishly as before and the foreman thinks that a daily paper really ought to come out once in twentyfour hours and all the people at the hillstations in the middle of their amusements say good gracious why cant the paper be sparkling im sure theres plenty going on up here  that is the dark half of the moon and as the advertisements say must be experienced to be appreciated  it was in that season and a remarkably evil season that the paper began running the last issue of the week on saturday night which is to say sunday morning after the custom of a london paper this was a great convenience for immediately after the paper was put to bed the dawn would lower the thermometer from 96 degrees to almost 84 degrees for half an hour and in that chillyou have no idea how cold is 84 degrees on the grass until you begin to pray for ita very tired man could get off to sleep ere the heat roused him  one saturday night it was my pleasant duty to put the paper to bed alone a king or courtier or a courtesan or a community was going to die or get a new constitution or do something that was important on the other side of the world and the paper was to be held open till the latest possible minute in order to catch the telegram  it was a pitchyblack night as stifling as a june night can be and the loo the redhot wind from the westward was booming among the tinderdry trees and pretending that the rain was on its heels  now and again a spot of almost boiling water would fall on the dust with the flop of a frog but all our weary world knew that was only pretence it was a shade cooler in the pressroom than the office so i sat there while the type ticked and clicked and the nightjars hooted at the windows and the all but naked compositors wiped the sweat from their foreheads and called for water the thing that was keeping us back whatever it was would not come off though the loo dropped and the last type was set and the whole round earth stood still in the choking heat with its finger on its lip to wait the event i drowsed and wondered whether the telegraph was a blessing and whether this dying man or struggling people might be aware of the inconvenience the delay was causing there was no special reason beyond the heat and worry to make tension but as the clockhands crept up to three oclock and the machines spun their flywheels two and three times to see that all was in order before i said the word that would set them off i could have shrieked aloud  then the roar and rattle of the wheels shivered the quiet into little bits i rose to go away but two men in white clothes stood in front of me the first one said its him the second said so it is and they both laughed almost as loudly as the machinery roared and mopped their foreheads we seed there was a light burning across the road and we were sleeping in that ditch there for coolness and i said to my friend here the office is open lets come along and speak to him as turned us back from degumber state said the smaller of the two he was the man i had met in the mhow train and his fellow was the redbearded man of marwar junction there was no mistaking the eyebrows of the one or the beard of the other  i was not pleased because i wished to go to sleep not to squabble with loafers what do you want i asked  half an hours talk with you cool and comfortable in the office said the redbearded man wed like some drinkthe contrack doesnt begin yet peachey so you neednt lookbut what we really want is advice we dont want money we ask you as a favour because we found out you did us a bad turn about degumber state  i led from the pressroom to the stifling office with the maps on the walls and the redhaired man rubbed his hands thats something like said he this was the proper shop to come to  now sir let me introduce you to brother peachey carnehan thats him and brother daniel dravot that is me and the less said about our professions the better for we have been most things in our timesoldier sailor compositor photographer proofreader streetpreacher and correspondents of the backwoodsman when we thought the paper wanted one carnehan is sober and so am i look at us first and see thats sure it will save you cutting into my talk well take one of your cigars apiece and you shall see us light up  i watched the test the men were absolutely sober so i gave them each a tepid whiskyandsoda  well and good said carnehan of the eyebrows wiping the froth from his moustache let me talk now dan we have been all over india mostly on foot we have been boilerfitters enginedrivers petty contractors and all that and we have decided that india isnt big enough for such as us  they certainly were too big for the office dravots beard seemed to fill half the room and carnehans shoulders the other half as they sat on the big table carnehan continued the country isnt half worked out because they that governs it wont let you touch it they spend all their blessed time in governing it and you cant lift a spade nor chip a rock nor look for oil nor anything like that without all the government saying leave it alone and let us govern therefore such as it is we will let it alone and go away to some other place where a man isnt crowded and can come to his own we are not little men and there is nothing that we are afraid of except drink and we have signed a contrack on that  therefore we are going away to be kings  kings in our own right muttered dravot  yes of course i said youve been tramping in the sun and its a very warm night and hadnt you better sleep over the notion come tomorrow  neither drunk nor sunstruck said dravot we have slept over the notion half a year and require to see books and atlases and we have decided that there is only one place now in the world that two strong men can sarawhack they call it kafiristan by my reckoning its the top righthand corner of afghanistan not more than three hundred miles from peshawar they have two and thirty heathen idols there and well be the thirtythird and fourth its a mountaineous country the women of those parts are very beautiful  but that is provided against in the contrack said carnehan neither women nor liquor daniel  and thats all we know except that no one has gone there and they fight and in any place where they fight a man who knows how to drill men can always be a king we shall go to those parts and say to any king we find d you want to vanquish your foes and we will show him how to drill men for that we know better than anything else then we will subvert that king and seize his throne and establish a dynasty  youll be cut to pieces before youre fifty miles across the border i said you have to travel through afghanistan to get to that country its one mass of mountains and peaks and glaciers and no englishman has been through it the people are utter brutes and even if you reached them you couldnt do anything  thats more like said carnehan if you could think us a little more mad we would be more pleased we have come to you to know about this country to read a book about it and to be shown maps we want you to tell us that we are fools and to show us your books he turned to the bookcases  are you at all in earnest i said  a little said dravot sweetly as big a map as you have got even if its all blank where kafiristan is and any books youve got we can read though we arent very educated  i uncased the big thirtytwomilestotheinch map of india and two smaller frontier maps hauled down volume infkan of the encyclopaedia britannica and the men consulted them  see here said dravot his thumb on the map up to jagdallak peachey and me know the road we was there with roberts army well have to turn off to the right at jagdallak through laghmann territory then we get among the hillsfourteen thousand feetfifteen thousandit will be cold work there but it dont look very far on the map  i handed him wood on the sources of the oxus carnehan was deep in the encyclopaedia  theyre a mixed lot said dravot reflectively and it wont help us to know the names of their tribes the more tribes the more theyll fight and the better for us from jagdallak to ashang hmm  but all the information about the country is as sketchy and inaccurate as can be i protested no one knows anything about it really heres the file of the united services institute read what bellew says  blow bellew said carnehan dan theyre a stinkin lot of heathens but this book here says they think theyre related to us english  i smoked while the men poured over raverty wood the maps and the encyclopaedia  there is no use your waiting said dravot politely its about four oclock now well go before six oclock if you want to sleep and we wont steal any of the papers dont you sit up were two harmless lunatics and if you come tomorrow evening down to the serai well say goodbye to you  you are two fools i answered youll be turned back at the frontier or cut up the minute you set foot in afghanistan do you want any money or a recommendation downcountry i can help you to the chance of work next week  next week we shall be hard at work ourselves thank you said dravot it isnt so easy being a king as it looks when weve got our kingdom in going order well let you know and you can come up and help us govern it  would two lunatics make a contrack like that said carnehan with subdued pride showing me a greasy halfsheet of notepaper on which was written the following i copied it then and there as a curiosity   this contrack between me and you persuing witnesseth in  the name of god amen and so forth    one that me and you will settle this matter together ie to be kings of kafiristan    twothat you and me will not while this matter is being settled look at any liquor nor any woman black white        or brown so as to get mixed up with one or the other harmful    three that we conduct ourselves with dignity and discretion and if one of us gets into trouble the other will stay by him     signed by you and me this day       peachey taliaferro carnehan       daniel dravot     both gentlemen at large  there was no need for the last article said carnehan blushing modestly but it looks regular now you know the sort of men that loafers arewe are loafers dan until we get out of indiaand do you think that we would sign a contrack like that unless we was in earnest we have kept away from the two things that make life worth having  you wont enjoy your lives much longer if you are going to try this idiotic adventure dont set the office on fire i said and go away before nine oclock  i left them still poring over the maps and making notes on the back of the contrack be sure to come down to the serai tomorrow were their parting words  the kumharsen serai is the great foursquare sink of humanity where the strings of camels and horses from the north load and unload all the nationalities of central asia may be found there and most of the folk of india proper balkh and bokhara there meet bengal and bombay and try to draw eyeteeth you can buy ponies turquoises persian pussycats saddlebags fattailed sheep and musk in the kumharsen serai and get many strange things for nothing in the afternoon i went down to see whether my friends intended to keep their word or were lying there drunk  a priest attired in fragments of ribbons and rags stalked up to me gravely twisting a childs paper whirligig behind him was his servant bending under the load of a crate of mud toys the two were loading up two camels and the inhabitants of the serai watched them with shrieks of laughter  the priest is mad said a horsedealer to me he is going up to kabul to sell toys to the amir he will either be raised to honour or have his head cut off he came in here this morning and has been behaving madly ever since  the witless are under the protection of god stammered a flatcheeked usbeg in broken hindi they foretell future events  would they could have foretold that my caravan would have been cut up by the shinwaris almost within shadow of the pass grunted the eusufzai agent of a rajputana tradinghouse whose goods had been diverted into the hands of other robbers just across the border and whose misfortunes were the laughingstock of the bazaar ohe priest whence come you and whither do you go  from roum have i come shouted the priest waving his whirligig from roum blown by the breath of a hundred devils across the sea o thieves robbers liars the blessing of pir khan on pigs dogs and perjurers who will take the protected of god to the north to sell charms that are never still to the amir the camels shall not gall the sons shall not fall sick and the wives shall remain faithful while they are away of the men who give me place in their caravan who will assist me to slipper the king of the roos with a golden slipper with a silver heel the protection of pir khan be upon his labours he spread out the skirts of his gabardine and pirouetted between the lines of tethered horses  there starts a caravan from peshawar to kabul in twenty days huzrut said the eusufzai trader my camels go therewith do thou also go and bring us good luck  i will go even now shouted the priest i will depart upon my winged camels and be at peshawar in a day ho hazar mir khan he yelled to his servant drive out the camels but let me first mount my own  he leaped on the back of his beast as it knelt and turning round to me cried come thou also sahib a little along the road and i will sell thee a charman amulet that shall make thee king of kafiristan  then the light broke upon me and i followed the two camels out of the serai till we reached open road and the priest halted  what d you think o that said he in english carnehan cant talk their patter so ive made him my servant he makes a handsome servant t isnt for nothing that ive been knocking about the country for fourteen years didnt i do that talk neat well hitch on to a caravan at peshawar till we get to jagdallak and then well see if we can get donkeys for our camels and strike into kafiristan whirligigs for the amir o lor put your hand under the camelbags and tell me what you feel  i felt the butt of a martini and another and another  twenty of em said dravot placidly twenty of em and ammunition to correspond under the whirligigs and the mud dolls  heaven help you if you are caught with those things i said a martini is worth her weight in silver among the pathans  fifteen hundred rupees of capitalevery rupee we could beg borrow or stealare invested on these two camels said dravot  we wont get caught were going through the khaiber with a regular caravan whod touch a poor mad priest  have you got everything you want i asked overcome with astonishment  not yet but we shall soon give us a memento of your kindness brother you did me a service yesterday and that time in marwar half my kingdom shall you have as the saying is i slipped a small charm compass from my watchchain and handed it up to the priest  goodbye said dravot giving me hand cautiously its the last time well shake hands with an englishman these many days shake hands with him carnehan he cried as the second camel passed me  carnehan leaned down and shook hands then the camels passed away along the dusty road and i was left alone to wonder my eye could detect no failure in the disguises the scene in the serai proved that they were complete to the native mind there was just the chance therefore that carnehan and dravot would be able to wander through afghanistan without detection but beyond they would find deathcertain and awful death  ten days later a native correspondent giving me the news of the day from peshawar wound up his letter with there has been much laughter here on account of a certain mad priest who is going in his estimation to sell petty gauds and insignificant trinkets which he ascribes as great charms to h h the amir of bokhara he passed through peshawar and associated himself to the second summer caravan that goes to kabul the merchants are pleased because through superstition they imagine that such mad fellows bring good fortune  the two then were beyond the border i would have prayed for them but that night a real king died in europe and demanded an obituary notice  the wheel of the world swings through the same phases again and again summer passed and winter thereafter and came and passed again the daily paper continued and i with it and upon the third summer there fell a hot night a night issue and a strained waiting for something to be telegraphed from the other side of the world exactly as had happened before a few great men had died in the past two years the machines worked with more clatter and some of the trees in the office garden were a few feet taller but that was all the difference  i passed over to the pressroom and went through just such a scene as i have already described the nervous tension was stronger than it had been two years before and i felt the heat more acutely at three oclock i cried print off and turned to go when there crept to my chair what was left of a man he was bent into a circle his head was sunk between his shoulders and he moved his feet one over the other like a bear i could hardly see whether he walked or crawledthis ragwrapped whining cripple who addressed me by name crying that he was come back can you give me a drink he whimpered for the lords sake give me a drink  i went back to the office the man following with groans of pain and i turned up the lamp  dont you know me he gasped dropping into a chair and he turned his drawn face surmounted by a shock of gray hair to the light  i looked at him intently once before had i seen eyebrows that met over the nose in an inchbroad black band but for the life of me i could not tell where  i dont know you i said handing him the whisky what can i do for you  he took a gulp of the spirit raw and shivered in spite of the suffocating heat  ive come back he repeated and i was the king of kafiristanme and dravotcrowned kings we was in this office we settled ityou setting there and giving us the books i am peacheypeachey taliaferro carnehanand youve been setting here ever sinceo lord  i was more than a little astonished and expressed my feelings accordingly  its true said carnehan with a dry cackle nursing his feet which were wrapped in ragstrue as gospel kings we were with crowns upon our heads me and dravotpoor danoh poor poor dan that would never take advice not though i begged of him  take the whisky i said and take your own time tell me all you can recollect of everything from beginning to end you got across the border on your camels dravot dressed as a mad priest and you his servant do you remember that  i aint madyet but i shall be that way soon of course i remember keep looking at me or maybe my words will go all to pieces keep looking at me in my eyes and dont say anything  i leaned forward and looked into his face as steadily as i could he dropped one hand upon the table and i grasped it by the wrist it was twisted like a birds claw and upon the back was a ragged red diamondshaped scar  no dont look there look at me said carnehan that comes afterward but for the lords sake dont distrack me we left with that caravan me and dravot playing all sorts of antics to amuse the people we were with dravot used to make us laugh in the evenings when all the people was cooking their dinnerscooking their dinners and    what did they do then they lit little fires with sparks that went into dravots beard and we all laughed fit to die little red fires they was going into dravots big red beardso funny his eyes left mine and he smiled foolishly  you went as far as jagdallak with that caravan i said at a venture after you had lit those fires to jagdallak where you turned off to try to get into kafiristan  no we didnt neither what are you talking about we turned off before jagdallak because we heard the roads was good but they wasnt good enough for our two camelsmine and dravots when we left the caravan dravot took off all his clothes and mine too and said we would be heathen because the kafirs didnt allow mohammedans to talk to them so we dressed betwixt and between and such a sight as daniel dravot i never saw yet nor expect to see again he burned half his beard and slung a sheepskin over his shoulder and shaved his head into patterns he shaved mine too and made me wear outrageous things to look like a heathen that was in a most mountaineous country and our camels couldnt go along any more because of the mountains they were tall and black and coming home i saw them fight like wild goatsthere are lots of goats in kafiristan and these mountains they never keep still no more than the goats always fighting they are and dont let you sleep at night  take some more whisky i said very slowly what did you and daniel dravot do when the camels could go no farther because of the rough roads that led into kafiristan  what did which do there was a party called peachey taliaferro carnehan that was with dravot shall i tell you about him he died out there in the cold slap from the bridge fell old peachey turning and twisting in the air like a penny whirligig that you can sell to the amir no they was two for three hapence those whirligigs or i am much mistaken and woful sore and then these camels were no use and peachey said to dravot for the lords sake lets get out of this before our heads are chopped off and with that they killed the camels all among the mountains not having anything in particular to eat but first they took off the boxes with the guns and the ammunition till two men came along driving four mules dravot up and dances in front of them singing sell me four mules says the first man if you are rich enough to buy you are rich enough to rob but before ever he could put his hand to his knife dravot breaks his neck over his knee and the other party runs away so carnehan loaded the mules with the rifles that was taken off the camels and together we starts forward into those bittercold mountaineous parts and never a road broader than the back of your hand  he paused for a moment while i asked him if he could remember the nature of the country through which he had journeyed  i am telling you as straight as i can but my head isnt as good as it might be they drove nails through it to make me hear better how dravot died the country was mountaineous and the mules were most contrary and the inhabitants was dispersed and solitary they went up and up and down and down and that other party carnehan was imploring of dravot not to sing and whistle so loud for fear of bringing down the tremenjus avalanches but dravot says that if a king couldnt sing it wasnt worth being king and whacked the mules over the rump and never took no heed for ten cold days we came to a big level valley all among the mountains and the mules were near dead so we killed them not having anything in special for them or us to eat we sat upon the boxes and played odd and even with the cartridges that was jolted out  then ten men with bows and arrows ran down that valley chasing twenty men with bows and arrows and the row was tremenjus  they was fair menfairer than you or mewith yellow hair and remarkable well built says dravot unpacking the guns this is the beginning of the business well fight for the ten men and with that he fires two rifles at the twenty men and drops one of them at two hundred yards from the rock where he was sitting the other men began to run but carnehan and dravot sits on the boxes picking them off at all ranges up and down the valley then we goes up to the ten men that had run across the snow too and they fires a footy little arrow at us dravot he shoots above their heads and they all falls down flat then he walks over them and kicks them and then he lifts them up and shakes hands all round to make them friendly like he calls them and gives them the boxes to carry and waves his hand for all the world as though he was king already they takes the boxes and him across the valley and up the hill into a pine wood on the top where there was half a dozen big stone idols dravot he goes to the biggesta fellow they call imbraand lays a rifle and a cartridge at his feet rubbing his nose respectfully with his own nose patting him on the head and nods his head and says thats all right im in the know too and these old jimjams are my friends then he opens his mouth and points down it and when the first man brings him food he says no and when the second man brings him food he says no but when one of the old priests and the boss of the village brings him food he says yes very haughty and eats it slow that was how he came to our first village without any trouble just as though we had tumbled from the skies but we tumbled from one of those damned ropebridges you see andyou couldnt expect a man to laugh much after that  take some more whisky and go on i said that was the first village you came into how did you get to be king  i wasnt king said carnehan dravot he was the king and a handsome man he looked with the gold crown on his head and all him and the other party stayed in that village and every morning dravot sat by the side of old imbra and the people came and worshipped that was dravots order then a lot of men came into the valley and carnehan dravot picks them off with the rifles before they knew where they was and runs down into the valley and up again the other side and finds another village same as the first one and the people all falls down flat on their faces and dravot says now what is the trouble between you two villages and the people points to a woman as fair as you or me that was carried off and dravot takes her back to the first village and counts up the deadeight there was for each dead man dravot pours a little milk on the ground and waves his arms like a whirligig and thats all right says he then he and carnehan takes the big boss of each village by the arm and walks them down the valley and shows them how to scratch a line with a spear right down the valley and gives each a sod of turf from both sides of the line then all the people comes down and shouts like the devil and all and dravot says go and dig the land and be fruitful and multiply which they did though they didnt understand then we asks the names of things in their lingobread and water and fire and idols and such and dravot leads the priest of each village up to the idol and says he must sit there and judge the people and if anything goes wrong he is to be shot  next week they was all turning up the land in the valley as quiet as bees and much prettier and the priests heard all the complaints and told dravot in dumbshow what it was about thats just the beginning says dravot they think were gods he and carnehan picks out twenty good men and shows them how to click off a rifle and form fours and advance in line and they was very pleased to do so and clever to see the hang of it then he takes out his pipe and his baccypouch and leaves one at one village and one at the other and off we two goes to see what was to be done in the next valley that was all rock and there was a little village there and carnehan says send em to the old valley to plant and takes em there and gives em some land that wasnt took before they were a poor lot and we blooded em with a kid before letting em into the new kingdom that was to impress the people and then they settled down quiet and carnehan went back to dravot who had got into another valley all snow and ice and most mountaineous  there was no people there and the army got afraid so dravot shoots one of them and goes on till he finds some people in a village and the army explains that unless the people wants to be killed they had better not shoot their little matchlocks for they had matchlocks we makes friends with the priest and i stays there alone with two of the army teaching the men how to drill and a thundering big chief comes across the snow with kettledrums and horns twanging because he heard there was a new god kicking about carnehan sights for the brown of the men half a mile across the snow and wings one of them then he sends a message to the chief that unless he wished to be killed he must come and shake hands with me and leave his arms behind the chief comes alone first and carnehan shakes hands with him and whirls his arms about same as dravot used and very much surprised that chief was and strokes my eyebrows then carnehan goes alone to the chief and asks him in dumbshow if he had an enemy he hated i have says the chief so carnehan weeds out the pick of his men and sets the two of the army to show them drill and at the end of two weeks the men can manoeuvre about as well as volunteers so he marches with the chief to a great big plain on the top of a mountain and the chiefs men rushes into a village and takes it we three martinis firing into the brown of the enemy so we took that village too and i gives the chief a rag from my coat and says occupy till i come which was scriptural by way of a reminder when me and the army was eighteen hundred yards away i drops a bullet near him standing on the snow and all the people falls flat on their faces then i sends a letter to dravot wherever he be by land or by sea  at the risk of throwing the creature out of train i interrupted how could you write a letter up yonder  the letterohthe letter keep looking at me between the eyes please it was a stringtalk letter that wed learned the way of it from a blind beggar in the punjab  i remember that there had once come to the office a blind man with a knotted twig and a piece of string which he wound round the twig according to some cipher of his own he could after the lapse of days or hours repeat the sentence which he had reeled up  he had reduced the alphabet to eleven primitive sounds and tried to teach me his method but i could not understand  i sent that letter to dravot said carnehan and told him to come back because this kingdom was growing too big for me to handle and then i struck for the first valley to see how the priests were working they called the village we took along with the chief bashkai and the first village we took erheb the priests at erheb was doing all right but they had a lot of pending cases about land to show me and some men from another village had been firing arrows at night i went out and looked for that village and fired four rounds at it from a thousand yards that used all the cartridges i cared to spend and i waited for dravot who had been away two or three months and i kept my people quiet  one morning i heard the devils own noise of drums and horns and dan dravot marches down the hill with his army and a tail of hundreds of men and which was the most amazing a great gold crown on his head my gord carnehan says daniel this is a tremenjus business and weve got the whole country as far as its worth having i am the son of alexander by queen semiramis and youre my younger brother and a god too its the biggest thing weve ever seen ive been marching and fighting for six weeks with the army and every footy little village for fifty miles has come in rejoiceful and more than that ive got the key of the whole show as youll see and ive got a crown for you i told em to make two of em at a place called shu where the gold lies in the rock like suet in mutton gold ive seen and turquoise ive kicked out of the cliffs and theres garnets in the sands of the river and heres a chunk of amber that a man brought me call up all the priests and here take your crown  one of the men opens a black hair bag and i slips the crown on it was too small and too heavy but i wore it for the glory hammered gold it wasfive pounds weight like a hoop of a barrel  peachey says dravot we dont want to fight no more the crafts the trick so help me and he brings forward that same chief that i left at bashkaibilly fish we called him afterward because he was so like billy fish that drove the big tankengine at mach on the bolan in the old days shake hands with him says dravot and i shook hands and nearly dropped for billy fish gave me the grip i said nothing but tried him with the fellowcraft grip he answers all right and i tried the masters grip but that was a slip a fellowcraft he is i says to dan does he know the word he does says dan and all the priests know its a miracle the chiefs and the priests can work a fellowcraft lodge in a way thats very like ours and theyve cut the marks on the rocks but they dont know the third degree and theyve come to find out its gords truth ive known these long years that the afghans knew up to the fellowcraft degree but this is a miracle a god and a grand master of the craft am i and a lodge in the third degree i will open and well raise the head priests and the chiefs of the villages  its against all the law i says holding a lodge without warrant from any one and you know we never held office in any lodge  its a master stroke o policy says dravot it means running the country as easy as a fourwheeled bogie on a down grade we cant stop to inquire now or theyll turn against us ive forty chiefs at my heel and passed and raised according to their merit they shall be billet these men on the villages and see that we run up a lodge of some kind the temple of imbra will do for a lodgeroom the women must make aprons as you show them ill hold a levee of chiefs tonight and lodge tomorrow  i was fair run off my legs but i wasnt such a fool as not to see what a pull this craft business gave us i showed the priests families how to make aprons of the degrees but for dravots apron the blue border and marks was made of turquoise lumps on white hide not cloth we took a great square stone in the temple for the masters chair and little stones for the officers chairs and painted the black pavement with white squares and did what we could to make things regular  at the levee which was held that night on the hillside with big bonfires dravot gives out that him and me were gods and sons of alexander and passed grand masters in the craft and was come to make kafiristan a country where every man should eat in peace and drink in quiet and specially obey us then the chiefs come round to shake hands and they were so hairy and white and fair it was just shaking hands with old friends we gave them names according as they was like men we had known in indiabilly fish holly dilworth pikky kergan that was bazaarmaster when i was at mhow and so on and so on   the most amazing miracles was at lodge next night one of the old priests was watching us continuous and i felt uneasy for i knew wed have to fudge the ritual and i didnt know what the men knew the old priest was a stranger come in from beyond the village of bashkai the minute dravot puts on the masters apron that the girls had made for him the priest fetches a whoop and a howl and tries to overturn the stone that dravot was sitting on its all up now i says that comes of meddling with the craft without warrant dravot never winked an eye not when ten priests took and tilted over the grand masters chairwhich was to say the stone of imbra the priest begins rubbing the bottom end of it to clear away the black dirt and presently he shows all the other priests the masters mark same as was on dravots apron cut into the stone not even the priests of the temple of imbra knew it was there the old chap falls flat on his face at dravots feet and kisses em luck again says dravot across the lodge to me they say its the missing mark that no one could understand the why of  were more than safe now then he bangs the butt of his gun for a gavel and says by virtue of the authority vested in me by my own right hand and the help of peachey i declare myself grand master of all freemasonry in kafiristan in this the mother lodge o the country and king of kafiristan equally with peachey at that he puts on his crown and i puts on minei was doing senior wardenand we opens the lodge in most ample form it was an amazing miracle the priests moved in lodge through the first two degrees almost without telling as if the memory was coming back to them after that peachey and dravot raised such as was worthyhigh priests and chiefs of far off villages billy fish was the first and i can tell you we scared the soul out of him it was not in any way according to ritual but it served our turn we didnt raise more than ten of the biggest men because we didnt want to make the degree common and they was clamouring to be raised  in another six months says dravot well hold another communication and see how you are working then he asks them about their villages and learns that they was fighting one against the other and were sick and tired of it and when they wasnt doing that they was fighting with the mohammedans you can fight those when they come into our country says dravot tell off every tenth man of your tribes for a frontier guard and send two hundred at a time to this valley to be drilled nobody is going to be shot or speared any more so long as he does well and i know that you wont cheat me because youre white peoplesons of alexanderand not like common black mohammedans you are my people and by god says he running off into english at the end ill make a damned fine nation of you or ill die in the making  i cant tell all we did for the next six months because dravot did a lot i couldnt see the hang of and he learned their lingo in a way i never could my work was to help the people plough and now and again go out with some of the army and see what the other villages were doing and make em throw rope bridges across the ravines which cut up the country horrid dravot was very kind to me but when he walked up and down in the pine wood pulling that bloody red beard of his with both fists i knew he was thinking plans i could not advise about and i just waited for orders  but dravot never showed me disrespect before the people they were afraid of me and the army but they loved dan he was the best of friends with the priests and the chiefs but any one could come across the hills with a complaint and dravot would hear him out fair and call four priests together and say what was to be done  he used to call in billy fish from bashkai and pikky kergan from shu and an old chief we called kafuzelumit was like enough to his real nameand hold councils with em when there was any fighting to be done in small villages that was his council of war and the four priests of bashkai shu khawak and madora was his privy council between the lot of em they sent me with forty men and twenty rifles and sixty men carrying turquoises into the ghorband country to buy those handmade martini rifles that come out of the amirs workshops at kabul from one of the amirs herati regiments that would have sold the very teeth out of their mouths for turquoises  i stayed in ghorband a month and gave the governor there the pick of my baskets for hushmoney and bribed the colonel of the regiment some more and between the two and the tribespeople we got more than a hundred handmade martinis a hundred good kohat jezails thatll throw to six hundred yards and forty manloads of very bad ammunition for the rifles i came back with what i had and distributed em among the men that the chiefs sent in to me to drill dravot was too busy to attend to those things but the old army that we first made helped me and we turned out five hundred men that could drill and two hundred that knew how to hold arms pretty straight even those cork screwed handmade guns was a miracle to them dravot talked big about powder shops and factories walking up and down in the pine wood when the winter was coming on  i wont make a nation says he ill make an empire these men arent niggers theyre english look at their eyeslook at their mouths look at the way they stand up they sit on chairs in their own houses theyre the lost tribes or something like it and theyve grown to be english ill take a census in the spring if the priests dont get frightened there must be a fair two million of em in these hills the villages are full o little children two million peopletwo hundred and fifty thousand fighting

hundred thousand sniders run through the amirs country in dribletsid be content with twenty thousand in one year and wed be an empire  when everything was shipshape id hand over the crownthis crown im wearing nowto queen victoria on my knees and shed say rise up sir daniel dravot oh its big its big i tell you but theres so much to be done in every placebashkai khawak shu and everywhere else  what is it i says there are no more men coming in to be drilled this autumn look at those fat black clouds theyre bringing the snow  it isnt that says daniel putting his hand very hard on my shoulder and i dont wish to say anything thats against you for no other living man would have followed me and made me what i am as you have done youre a firstclass commanderinchief and the people know you butits a big country and somehow you cant help me peachey in the way i want to be helped  go to your blasted priests then i said and i was sorry when i made that remark but it did hurt me sore to find daniel talking so superior when id drilled all the men and done all he told me  dont lets quarrel peachey says daniel without cursing youre a king too and the half of this kingdom is yours but cant you see peachey we want cleverer men than us nowthree or four of em that we can scatter about for our deputies its a hugeous great state and i cant always tell the right thing to do and i havent time for all i want to do and heres the winter coming on and all  he put half his beard into his mouth all red like the gold of his crown  im sorry daniel says i ive done all i could ive drilled the men and shown the people how to stack their oats better and ive brought in those tinware rifles from ghorbandbut i know what youre driving at i take it kings always feel oppressed that way  theres another thing too says dravot walking up and down the winters coming and these people wont be giving much trouble and if they do we cant move about i want a wife  for gords sake leave the women alone i says weve both got all the work we can though i am a fool remember the contrack and keep clear o women  the contrack only lasted till such time as we was kings and kings we have been these months past says dravot weighing his crown in his hand you go get a wife too peacheya nice strappin plump girl thatll keep you warm in the winter theyre prettier than english girls and we can take the pick of em boil em once or twice in hot water and theyll come out like chicken and ham  dont tempt me i says i will not have any dealings with a woman not till we are a dam side more settled than we are now ive been doing the work o two men and youve been doing the work of three lets lie off a bit and see if we can get some better tobacco from afghan country and run in some good liquor and no women  whos talking o women says dravot i said wifea queen to breed a kings son for the king a queen out of the strongest tribe thatll make them your bloodbrothers and thatll lie by your side and tell you all the people thinks about you and their own affairs thats what i want  do you remember that bengali woman i kept at mogul serai when i was a plate layer says i a fat lot o good she was to me she taught me the lingo and one or two other things but what happened she ran away with the station masters servant and half my months pay then she turned up at dadur junction in tow of a halfcaste and had the impidence to say i was her husbandall among the drivers in the runningshed too  weve done with that says dravot these women are whiter than you or me and a queen i will have for the winter months  for the last time o asking dan do not i says itll only bring us harm the bible says that kings aint to waste their strength on women specially when theyve got a new raw kingdom to work over  for the last time of answering i will said dravot and he went away through the pine trees looking like a big red devil the sun being on his crown and beard and all  but getting a wife was not as easy as dan thought he put it before the council and there was no answer till billy fish said that hed better ask the girls dravot damned them all round  whats wrong with me he shouts standing by the idol imbra am i a dog or am i not enough of a man for your wenches havent i put the shadow of my hand over this country who stopped the last afghan raid it was me really but dravot was too angry to remember who bought your guns who repaired the bridges whos the grand master of the sign cut in the stone says he and he thumped his hand on the block that he used to sit on in lodge and at council which opened like lodge always billy fish said nothing and no more did the others keep your hair on dan said i and ask the girls thats how its done at home and these people are quite english  the marriage of the king is a matter of state says dan in a whitehot rage for he could feel i hope that he was going against his better mind he walked out of the councilroom and the others sat still looking at the ground  billy fish says i to the chief of bashkai whats the difficulty here a straight answer to a true friend  you know says billy fish how should a man tell you who knows everything how can daughters of men marry gods or devils its not proper  i remembered something like that in the bible but if after seeing us as long as they had they still believed we were gods it wasnt for me to undeceive them  a god can do anything says i if the king is fond of a girl hell not let her die shell have to said billy fish there are all sorts of gods and devils in these mountains and now and again a girl marries one of them and isnt seen any more besides you two know the mark cut in the stone only the gods know that we thought you were men till you showed the sign of the master  i wished then that we had explained about the loss of the genuine secrets of a master mason at the first gooff but i said nothing all that night there was a blowing of horns in a little dark temple halfway down the hill and i heard the girl crying fit to die one of the priests told us that she was being prepared to marry the king  ill have no nonsense of that kind says dan i dont want to interfere with your customs but ill take my own wife the girls a little bit afraid says the priest she thinks shes going to die and they are a heartening of her up down in the temple  hearten her very tender then says dravot or ill hearten you with the butt of a gun so youll never want to be heartened again  he licked his lips did dan and stayed up walking about more than half the night thinking of the wife that he was going to get in the morning i wasnt any means comfortable for i knew that dealings with a woman in foreign parts though you was a crowned king twenty times over could not but be risky i got up very early in the morning while dravot was asleep and i saw the priests talking together in whispers and the chiefs talking together too and they looked at me out of the corners of their eyes  what is up fish i say to the bashkai man who was wrapped up in his furs and looking splendid to behold  i cant rightly say says he but if you can make the king drop all this nonsense about marriage youll be doing him and me and yourself a great service  that i do believe says i but sure you know billy as well as me having fought against and for us that the king and me are nothing more than two of the finest men that god almighty ever made nothing more i do assure you  that may be says billy fish and yet i should be sorry if it was he sinks his head upon his great fur cloak for a minute and thinks king says he be you man or god or devil ill stick by you today i have twenty of my men with me and they will follow me well go to bashkai until the storm blows over  a little snow had fallen in the night and everything was white except the greasy fat clouds that blew down and down from the north dravot came out with his crown on his head swinging his arms and stamping his feet and looking more pleased than punch  for the last time drop it dan says i in a whisper billy fish here says that there will be a row  a row among my people says dravot not much peachey youre a fool not to get a wife too wheres the girl says he with a voice as loud as the braying of a jackass call up all the chiefs and priests and let the emperor see if his wife suits him  there was no need to call any one they were all there leaning on their guns and spears round the clearing in the centre of the pine wood a lot of priests went down to the little temple to bring up the girl and the horns blew fit to wake the dead billy fish saunters round and gets as close to daniel as he could and behind him stood his twenty men with matchlocksnot a man of them under six feet i was next to dravot and behind me was twenty men of the regular army up comes the girl and a strapping wench she was covered with silver and turquoises but white as death and looking back every minute at the priests  shell do said dan looking her over whats to be afraid of lass come and kiss me he puts his arm round her she shuts her eyes gives a bit of a squeak and down goes her face in the side of dans flamingred beard  the sluts bitten me says he clapping his hand to his neck and sure enough his hand was red with blood billy fish and two of his matchlock men catches hold of dan by the shoulders and drags him into the bashkai lot while the priests howls in their lingo neither god nor devil but a man i was all taken aback for a priest cut at me in front and the army behind began firing into the bashkai men  god amighty says dan what is the meaning o this  come back come away says billy fish ruin and mutiny is the matter well break for bashkai if we can  i tried to give some sort of orders to my menthe men o the regular army but it was no use so i fired into the brown of em with an english martini and drilled three beggars in a line the valley was full of shouting howling creatures and every soul was shrieking not a god nor a devil but only a man the bashkai troops stuck to billy fish all they were worth but their matchlocks wasnt half as good as the kabul breechloaders and four of them dropped dan was bellowing like a bull for he was very wrathy and billy fish had a hard job to prevent him running out at the crowd  we cant stand says billy fish make a run for it down the valley the whole place is against us the matchlockmen ran and we went down the valley in spite of dravot he was swearing horrible and crying out that he was a king the priests rolled great stones on us and the regular army fired hard and there wasnt more than six men not counting dan billy fish and me that came down to the bottom of the valley alive  then they stopped firing and the horns in the temple blew again  come awayfor gords sake come away says billy fish theyll send runners out to all the villages before ever we get to bashkai i can protect you there but i cant do anything now  my own notion is that dan began to go mad in his head from that hour he stared up and down like a stuck pig then he was all for walking back alone and killing the priests with his bare hands which he could have done an emperor am i says daniel and next year i shall be a knight of the queen  all right dan says i but come along now while theres time  its your fault says he for not looking after your army better there was mutiny in the midst and you didnt knowyou damned enginedriving platelaying missionaryspasshunting hound he sat upon a rock and called me every foul name he could lay tongue to i was too heartsick to care though it was all his foolishness that brought the smash  im sorry dan says i but theres no accounting for natives this business is our fiftyseven maybe well make something out of it yet when weve got to bashkai  lets get to bashkai then says dan and by god when i come back here again ill sweep the valley so there isnt a bug in a blanket left  we walked all that day and all that night dan was stumping up and down on the snow chewing his beard and muttering to himself  theres no hope o getting clear said billy fish the priests have sent runners to the villages to say that you are only men why didnt you stick on as gods till things was more settled im a dead man says billy fish and he throws himself down on the snow and begins to pray to his gods  next morning we was in a cruel bad countryall up and down no level ground at all and no food either the six bashkai men looked at billy fish hungry way as if they wanted to ask something but they never said a word at noon we came to the top of a flat mountain all covered with snow and when we climbed up into it behold there was an army in position waiting in the middle  the runners have been very quick says billy fish with a little bit of a laugh they are waiting for us  three or four men began to fire from the enemys side and a chance shot took daniel in the calf of the leg that brought him to his senses he looks across the snow at the army and sees the rifles that we had brought into the country  were done for says he they are englishmen these peopleand its my blasted nonsense that has brought you to this get back billy fish and take your men away youve done what you could and now cut for it carnehan says he shake hands with me and go along with billy maybe they wont kill you ill go and meet em alone its me that did it me the king  go says i go to hell dan im with you here billy fish you clear out and we two will meet those folk  im a chief says billy fish quite quiet i stay with you my men can go  the bashkai fellows didnt wait for a second word but ran off and dan and me and billy fish walked across to where the drums were drumming and the horns were horning it was coldawful cold ive got that cold in the back of my head now theres a lump of it there  the punkacoolies had gone to sleep two kerosene lamps were blazing in the office and the perspiration poured down my face and splashed on the blotter as i leaned forward carnehan was shivering and i feared that his mind might go i wiped my face took a fresh grip of the piteously mangled hands and said what happened after that  the momentary shift of my eyes had broken the clear current  what was you pleased to say whined carnehan they took them without any sound not a little whisper all along the snow not though the king knocked down the first man that set hand on himnot though old peachey fired his last cartridge into the brown of em not a single solitary sound did those swines make they just closed up tight and i tell you their furs stunk there was a man called billy fish a good friend of us all and they cut his throat sir then and there like a pig and the king kicks up the bloody snow and says weve had a dashed fine run for our money whats coming next but peachey peachey taliaferro i tell you sir in confidence as betwixt two friends he lost his head sir no he didnt neither the king lost his head so he did all along o one of those cunning rope bridges kindly let me have the paper cutter sir it tilted this way they marched him a mile across that snow to a rope bridge over a ravine with a river at the bottom you may have seen such they prodded him behind like an ox damn your eyes says the king d you suppose i cant die like a gentleman  he turns to peacheypeachey that was crying like a child ive brought you to this peachey says he brought you out of your happy life to be killed in kafiristan where you was late commanderinchief of the emperors forces say you forgive me peachey i do says peachey fully and freely do i forgive you dan shake hands peachey says he im going now out he goes looking neither right nor left and when he was plumb in the middle of those dizzy dancing ropes cut you beggars he shouts and they cut and old dan fell turning round and round and round twenty thousand miles for he took half an hour to fall till he struck the water and i could see his body caught on a rock with the gold crown close beside  but do you know what they did to peachey between two pine trees they crucified him sir as peacheys hand will show they used wooden pegs for his hands and feet but he didnt die he hung there and screamed and they took him down next day and said it was a miracle that he wasnt dead they took him downpoor old peachey that hadnt done them any harmthat hadnt done them any  he rocked to and fro and wept bitterly wiping his eyes with the back of his scarred hands and moaning like a child for some ten minutes  they was cruel enough to feed him up in the temple because they said he was more of a god than old daniel that was a man then they turned him out on the snow and told him to go home and peachey came home in about a year begging along the roads quite safe for daniel dravot he walked before and said come along peachey its a big thing were doing the mountains they danced at night and the mountains they tried to fall on peacheys head but dan he held up his hand and peachey came along bent double he never let go of dans hand and he never let go of dans head they gave it to him as a present in the temple to remind him not to come again and though the crown was pure gold and peachey was starving never would peachey sell the same you know dravot sir you knew right worshipful brother dravot look at him now  he fumbled in the mass of rags round his bent waist brought out a black horsehair bag embroidered with silver thread and shook therefrom on to my tablethe dried withered head of daniel dravot the morning sun that had long been paling the lamps struck the red beard and blind sunken eyes struck too a heavy circlet of gold studded with raw turquoises that carnehan placed tenderly on the battered temples  you beold now said carnehan the emperor in his abit as he livedthe king of kafiristan with his crown upon his head poor old daniel that was a monarch once  i shuddered for in spite of defacements manifold i recognised the head of the man of marwar junction carnehan rose to go i attempted to stop him he was not fit to walk abroad let me take away the whisky and give me a little money he gasped i was a king once ill go to the deputy commissioner and ask to set in the poorhouse till i get my health no thank you i cant wait till you get a carriage for me ive urgent private affairsin the southat marwar  he shambled out of the office and departed in the direction of the deputy commissioners house that day at noon i had occasion to go down the blinding hot mall and i saw a crooked man crawling along the white dust of the roadside his hat in his hand quavering dolorously after the fashion of streetsingers at home there was not a soul in sight and he was out of all possible earshot of the houses and he sang through his nose turning his head from right to left   the son of man goes forth to war  a golden crown to gain  his bloodred banner streams afar  who follows in his train  i waited to hear no more but put the poor wretch into my carriage and drove him off to the nearest missionary for eventual transfer to the asylum he repeated the hymn twice while he was with me whom he did not in the least recognise and i left him singing it to the missionary  two days later i inquired after his welfare of the superintendent of the asylum  he was admitted suffering from sunstroke he died early yesterday morning said the superintendent is it true that he was half an hour bareheaded in the sun at midday  yes said i but do you happen to know if he had anything upon him by any chance when he died  not to my knowledge said the superintendent  and there the matter rests                    the finest story in the world   o ever the knightly years were gone  with the old world to the grave  i was a king in babylon  and you were a christian slave                 w e henley  his name was charlie mears he was the only son of his mother who was a widow and he lived in the north of london coming into the city every day to work in a bank he was twenty years old and suffered from aspirations i met him in a public billiardsaloon where the marker called him by his given name and he called the marker bullseyes charley explained a little nervously that he had only come to the place to look on and since looking on at games of skill is not a cheap amusement for the young i suggested that charlie should go back to his mother  that was our first step toward better acquaintance he would call on me sometimes in the evenings instead of running about london with his fellow clerks and before long speaking of himself as a young man must he told me of his aspirations which were all literary he desired to make himself an undying name chiefly through verse though he was not above sending stories of love and death to the dropapennyintheslot journals it was my fate to sit still while charlie read me poems of many hundred lines and bulky fragments of plays that would surely shake the world my reward was his unreserved confidence and the selfrevelations and troubles of a young man are almost as holy as those of a maiden  charlie had never fallen in love but was anxious to do so on the first opportunity he believed in all things good and all things honorable but at the same time was curiously careful to let me see that he knew his way about the world as befitted a bank clerk on twentyfive shillings a week  he rhymed dove with love and moon with june and devoutly believed that they had never so been rhymed before the long lame gaps in his plays he filled up with hasty words of apology and description and swept on seeing all that he intended to do so clearly that he esteemed it already done and turned to me for applause  i fancy that his mother did not encourage his aspirations and i know that his writingtable at home was the edge of his washstand this he told me almost at the outset of our acquaintance when he was ravaging my bookshelves and a little before i was implored to speak the truth as to his chances of writing something really great you know maybe i encouraged him too much for one night he called on me his eyes flaming with excitement and said breathlessly  do you mindcan you let me stay here and write all this evening i wont interrupt you i wont really theres no place for me to write in at my mothers  whats the trouble i said knowing well what that trouble was  ive a notion in my head that would make the most splendid story that was ever written do let me write it out here its such a notion  there was no resisting the appeal i set him a table he hardly thanked me but plunged into the work at once for half an hour the pen scratched without stopping then charlie sighed and tugged his hair the scratching grew slower there were more erasures and at last ceased the finest story in the world would not come forth  it looks such awful rot now he said mournfully and yet it seemed so good when i was thinking about it whats wrong  i could not dishearten him by saying the truth so i answered perhaps you dont feel in the mood for writing  yes i doexcept when i look at this stuff ugh  read me what youve done i said he read and it was wondrous bad and he paused at all the specially turgid sentences expecting a little approval for he was proud of those sentences as i knew he would be  it needs compression i suggested cautiously  i hate cutting my things down i dont think you could alter a word here without spoiling the sense it reads better aloud than when i was writing it  charlie youre suffering from an alarming disease afflicting a numerous class put the thing by and tackle it again in a week  i want to do it at once what do you think of it  how can i judge from a halfwritten tale tell me the story as it lies in your head  charlie told and in the telling there was everything that his ignorance had so carefully prevented from escaping into the written word i looked at him and wondering whether it were possible that he did not know the originality the power of the notion that had come in his way it was distinctly a notion among notions men had been puffed up with pride by notions not a tithe as excellent and practicable but charlie babbled on serenely interrupting the current of pure fancy with samples of horrible sentences that he purposed to use i heard him out to the end it would be folly to allow his idea to remain in his own inept hands when i could do so much with it not all that could be done indeed but oh so much                       what do you think he said at last i fancy i shall call it the story of a ship  i think the ideas pretty good but you wont he able to handle it for ever so long now i  would it be of any use to you would you care to take it i should be proud said charlie promptly  there are few things sweeter in this world than the guileless hotheaded intemperate open admiration of a junior even a woman in her blindest devotion does not fall into the gait of the man she adores tilt her bonnet to the angle at which he wears his hat or interlard her speech with his pet oaths and charlie did all these things still it was necessary to salve my conscience before i possessed myself of charlies thoughts  lets make a bargain ill give you a fiver for the notion i said  charlie became a bankclerk at once  oh thats impossible between two pals you know if i may call you so and speaking as a man of the world i couldnt take the notion if its any use to you ive heaps more  he hadnone knew this better than ibut they were the notions of other men  look at it as a matter of businessbetween men of the world i returned five pounds will buy you any number of poetrybooks business is business and you may be sure i shouldnt give that price unless  oh if you put it that way said charlie visibly moved by the thought of the books the bargain was clinched with an agreement that he should at unstated intervals come to me with all the notions that he possessed should have a table of his own to write at and unquestioned right to inflict upon me all his poems and fragments of poems then i said now tell me how you came by this idea  it came by itself charlies eyes opened a little  yes but you told me a great deal about the hero that you must have read before somewhere  i havent any time for reading except when you let me sit here and on sundays im on my bicycle or down the river all day theres nothing wrong about the hero is there  tell me again and i shall understand clearly you say that your hero went pirating how did he live  he was on the lower deck of this shipthing that i was telling you about  what sort of ship  it was the kind rowed with oars and the sea spurts through the oarholes and the men row sitting up to their knees in water then theres a bench running down between the two lines of oars and an overseer with a whip walks up and down the bench to make the men work  how do you know that  its in the table theres a rope running overhead looped to the upper deck for the overseer to catch hold of when the ship rolls when the overseer misses the rope once and falls among the rowers remember the hero laughs at him and gets licked for it hes chained to his oar of coursethe hero  how is he chained  with an iron band round his waist fixed to the bench he sits on and a sort of handcuff on his left wrist chaining him to the oar hes on the lower deck where the worst men are sent and the only light comes from the hatchways and through the oarholes cant you imagine the sunlight just squeezing through between the handle and the hole and wobbling about as the ship moves  i can but i cant imagine your imagining it  how could it be any other way now you listen to me the long oars on the upper deck are managed by four men to each bench the lower ones by three and the lowest of all by two remember its quite dark on the lowest deck and all the men there go mad when a man dies at his oar on that deck he isnt thrown overboard but cut up in his chains and stuffed through the oarhole in little pieces  why i demanded amazed not so much at the information as the tone of command in which it was flung out  to save trouble and to frighten the others it needs two overseers to drag a mans body up to the top deck and if the men at the lower deck oars were left alone of course theyd stop rowing and try to pull up the benches by all standing up together in their chains  youve a most provident imagination where have you been reading about galleys and galleyslaves  nowhere that i remember i row a little when i get the chance but perhaps if you say so i may have read something  he went away shortly afterward to deal with booksellers and i wondered how a bank clerk aged twenty could put into my hands with a profligate abundance of detail all given with absolute assurance the story of extravagant and bloodthirsty adventure riot piracy and death in unnamed seas he had led his hero a desperate dance through revolt against the overseas to command of a ship of his own and ultimate establishment of a kingdom on an island somewhere in the sea you know and delighted with my paltry five pounds had gone out to buy the notions of other men that these might teach him how to write i had the consolation of knowing that this notion was mine by right of purchase and i thought that i could make something of it  when next he came to me he was drunkroyally drunk on many poets for the first time revealed to him his pupils were dilated his words tumbled over each other and he wrapped himself in quotations most of all was he drunk with longfellow  isnt it splendid isnt it superb he cried after hasty greetings  listen to this  wouldst thou so the helmsman answered know the secret of the sea only those who brave its dangers comprehend its mystery  by gum  only those who brave its dangers comprehend its mystery he repeated twenty times walking up and down the room and forgetting me but i can understand it too he said to himself i dont know how to thank you for that fiver and this listen  i remember the black wharves and the ships and the seatides tossing free and the spanish sailors with bearded lips and the beauty and mystery of the ships and the magic of the sea  i havent braved any dangers but i feel as if i knew all about it  you certainly seem to have a grip of the sea have you ever seen it  when i was a little chap i went to brighton once we used to live in coventry though before we came to london i never saw it  when descends on the atlantic the gigantic stormwind of the equinox  he shook me by the shoulder to make me understand the passion that was shaking himself  when that storm comes he continued i think that all the oars in the ship that i was talking about get broken and the rowers have their chests smashed in by the bucking oarheads by the way have you done anything with that notion of mine yet  no i was waiting to hear more of it from you tell me how in the world youre so certain about the fittings of the ship you know nothing of ships  i dont know its as real as anything to me until i try to write it down i was thinking about it only last night in bed after you had loaned me treasure island and i made up a whole lot of new things to go into the story  what sort of things  about the food the men ate rotten figs and black beans and wine in a skin bag passed from bench to bench  was the ship built so long ago as that  as what i dont know whether it was long ago or not its only a notion but sometimes it seems just as real as if it was true do i bother you with talking about it  not in the least did you make up anything else  yes but its nonsense charlie flushed a little  never mind lets hear about it  well i was thinking over the story and after awhile i got out of bed and wrote down on a piece of paper the sort of stuff the men might be supposed to scratch on their oars with the edges of their handcuffs it seemed to make the thing more lifelike it is so real to me yknow  have you the paper on you  yees but whats the use of showing it its only a lot of scratches all the same we might have em reproduced in the book on the front page  ill attend to those details show me what your men wrote  he pulled out of his pocket a sheet of notepaper with a single line of scratches upon it and i put this carefully away  what is it supposed to mean in english i said  oh i dont know perhaps it means im beastly tired its great nonsense he repeated but all those men in the ship seem as real people to me do do something to the notion soon i should like to see it written and printed  but all youve told me would make a long book  make it then youve only to sit down and write it out  give me a little time have you any more notions  not just now im reading all the books ive bought theyre splendid  when he had left i looked at the sheet of notepaper with the inscription upon it then i took my head tenderly between both hands to make certain that it was not coming off or turning round  thenbut there seemed to be no interval between quitting my rooms and finding myself arguing with a policeman outside a door marked private in a corridor of the british museum all i demanded as politely as possible was the greek antiquity man the policeman knew nothing except the rules of the museum and it became necessary to forage through all the houses and offices inside the gates an elderly gentleman called away from his lunch put an end to my search by holding the notepaper between finger and thumb and sniffing at it scornfully  what does this mean hmm said he so far as i can ascertain it is an attempt to write extremely corrupt greek on the parthere he glared at me with intentionof an extremely illiterateahperson he read slowly from the paper pollock erckman tauchnitz hennikerfour names familiar to me  can you tell me what the corruption is supposed to meanthe gist of the thing i asked  i have beenmany timesovercome with weariness in this particular employment that is the meaning he returned me the paper and i fled without a word of thanks explanation or apology  i might have been excused for forgetting much to me of all men had been given the chance to write the most marvelous tale in the world nothing less than the story of a greek galleyslave as told by himself small wonder that his dreaming had seemed real to charlie the fates that are so careful to shut the doors of each successive life behind us had in this case been neglectful and charlie was looking though that he did not know where never man had been permitted to look with full knowledge since time began above all he was absolutely ignorant of the knowledge sold to me for five pounds and he would retain that ignorance for bankclerks do not understand metempsychosis and a sound commercial education does not include greek he would supply mehere i capered among the dumb gods of egypt and laughed in their battered faceswith material to make my tale sureso sure that the world would hail it as an impudent and vamped fiction and ii alone would know that it was absolutely and literally true i alone held this jewel to my hand for the cutting and polishing  therefore i danced again among the gods till a policeman saw me and took steps in my direction  it remained now only to encourage charlie to talk and here there was no difficulty but i had forgotten those accursed books of poetry he came to me time after time as useless as a surcharged phonographdrunk on byron shelley or keats knowing now what the boy had been in his past lives and desperately anxious not to lose one word of his babble i could not hide from him my respect and interest he misconstrued both into respect for the present soul of charlie mears to whom life was as new as it was to adam and interest in his readings and stretched my patience to breaking point by reciting poetrynot his own now but that of others i wished every english poet blotted out of the memory of mankind i blasphemed the mightiest names of song because they had drawn charlie from the path of direct narrative and would later spur him to imitate them but i choked down my impatience until the first flood of enthusiasm should have spent itself and the boy returned to his dreams  whats the use of my telling you what i think when these chaps wrote things for the angels to read he growled one evening why dont you write something like theirs  i dont think youre treating me quite fairly i said speaking under strong restraint  ive given you the story he said shortly replunging into lara  but i want the details  the things i make up about that damned ship that you call a galley theyre quite easy you can just make em up yourself turn up the gas a little i want to go on reading  i could have broken the gas globe over his head for his amazing stupidity i could indeed make up things for myself did i only know what charlie did not know that he knew but since the doors were shut behind me i could only wait his youthful pleasure and strive to keep him in good temper one minutes want of guard might spoil a priceless revelation now and again he would toss his books asidehe kept them in my rooms for his mother would have been shocked at the waste of good money had she seen themand launched into his sea dreams again i cursed all the poets of england the plastic mind of the bank clerk had been overlaid colored and distorted by that which he had read and the result as delivered was a confused tangle of other voices most like the muttered song through a city telephone in the busiest part of the day  he talked of the galleyhis own galley had he but known itwith illustrations borrowed from the bride of abydos he pointed the experiences of his hero with quotations from the corsair and threw in deep and desperate moral reflections from cain and manfred expecting me to use them all only when the talk turned on longfellow were the jarring cross currents dumb and i knew that charlie was speaking the truth as he remembered it  what do you think of this i said one evening as soon as i understood the medium in which his memory worked best and before he could expostulate read him the whole of the saga of king olaf  he listened openmouthed flushed his hands drumming on the back of the sofa where he lay till i came to the songs of emar tamberskelver and the verse  emar then the arrow taking  from the loosened string answered that was norway breaking  neath thy hand o king  he gasped with pure delight of sound  thats better than byron a little i ventured  better why its true how could he have known  i went back and repeated   what was that said olaf standing  on the quarterdeck  something heard i like the stranding  of a shattered wreck  how could he have known how the ships crash and the oars rip out and go zzzp all along the line why only the other nightbut go back please and read the skerry of shrieks again  no im tired lets talk what happened the other night  i had an awful nightmare about that galley of ours i dreamed i was drowned in a fight you see we ran alongside another ship in harbor the water was dead still except where our oars whipped it up you know where i always sit in the galley he spoke haltingly at first under a fine english fear of being laughed at  no thats news to me i answered meekly my heart beginning to beat  on the fourth oar from the bow on the right side on the upper deck there were four of us at the oar all chained i remember watching the water and trying to get my handcuffs off before the row began then we closed up on the other ship and all their fighting men jumped over our bulwarks and my bench broke and i was pinned down with the three other fellows on top of me and the big oar jammed across our backs  well charlies eyes were alive and alight he was looking at the wall behind my chair  i dont know how we fought the men were trampling all over my back and i lay low then our rowers on the left sidetied to their oars you knowbegan to yell and back water i could hear the water sizzle and we spun round like a cockchafer and i knew lying where i was that there was a galley coming up bowon to ram us on the left side i could just lift up my head and see her sail over the bulwarks we wanted to meet her bow to bow but it was too late we could only turn a little bit because the galley on our right had hooked herself on to us and stopped our moving then by gum there was a crash our left oars began to break as the other galley the moving one yknow stuck her nose into them then the lowerdeck oars shot up through the deckplanking butt first and one of them jumped clean up into the air and came down again close to my head  how was that managed  the moving galleys bow was plunking them back through their own oarholes and i could hear the devil of a shindy in the decks below then her nose caught us nearly in the middle and we tilted sideways and the fellows in the righthand galley unhitched their hooks and ropes and threw things on to our upper deckarrows and hot pitch or something that stung and we went up and up and up on the left side and the right side dipped and i twisted my head round and saw the water stand still as it topped the right bulwarks and then it curled over and crashed down on the whole lot of us on the right side and i felt it hit my back and i woke  one minute charlie when the sea topped the bulwarks what did it look like i had my reasons for asking a man of my acquaintance had once gone down with a leaking ship in a still sea and had seen the waterlevel pause for an instant ere it fell on the deck  it looked just like a banjostring drawn tight and it seemed to stay there for years said charlie  exactly the other man had said it looked like a silver wire laid down along the bulwarks and i thought it was never going to break he had paid everything except the bare life for this little valueless piece of knowledge and i had traveled ten thousand weary miles to meet him and take his knowledge at second hand but charlie the bankclerk on twentyfive shillings a week he who had never been out of sight of a london omnibus knew it all it was no consolation to me that once in his lives he had been forced to die for his gains i also must have died scores of times but behind me because i could have used my knowledge the doors were shut  and then i said trying to put away the devil of envy  the funny thing was though in all the mess i didnt feel a bit astonished or frightened it seemed as if id been in a good many fights because i told my next man so when the row began but that cad of an overseer on my deck wouldnt unloose our chains and give us a chance he always said that wed all he set free after a battle but we never were we never were charlie shook his head mournfully  what a scoundrel  i should say he was he never gave us enough to eat and sometimes we were so thirsty that we used to drink saltwater i can taste that saltwater still  now tell me something about the harbor where the fight was fought  i didnt dream about that i know it was a harbor though because we were tied up to a ring on a white wall and all the face of the stone under water was covered with wood to prevent our ram getting chipped when the tide made us rock  thats curious our hero commanded the galley didnt he  didnt he just he stood by the bows and shouted like a good un he was the man who killed the overseer  but you were all drowned together charlie werent you  i cant make that fit quite he said with a puzzled look the galley must have gone down with all hands and yet i fancy that the hero went on living afterward perhaps he climbed into the attacking ship i wouldnt see that of course i was dead you know  he shivered slightly and protested that he could remember no more  i did not press him further but to satisfy myself that he lay in ignorance of the workings of his own mind deliberately introduced him to mortimer collinss transmigration and gave him a sketch of the plot before he opened the pages  what rot it all is he said frankly at the end of an hour i dont understand his nonsense about the red planet mars and the king and the rest of it chuck me the longfellow again  i handed him the book and wrote out as much as i could remember of his description of the seafight appealing to him from time to time for confirmation of fact or detail he would answer without raising his eyes from the book as assuredly as though all his knowledge lay before flint on the printed page i spoke under the normal key of my voice that the current might not be broken and i know that he was not aware of what he was saying for his thoughts were out on the sea with longfellow  charlie i asked when the rowers on the galleys mutinied how did they kill their overseers  tore up the benches and brained em that happened when a heavy sea was running an overseer on the lower deck slipped from the centre plank and fell among the rowers they choked him to death against the side of the ship with their chained hands quite quietly and it was too dark for the other overseer to see what had happened when he asked he was pulled down too and choked and the lower deck fought their way up deck by deck with the pieces of the broken benches banging behind em how they howled  and what happened after that  i dont know the hero went awayred hair and red beard and all that was after he had captured our galley i think  the sound of my voice irritated him and he motioned slightly with his left hand as a man does when interruption jars  you never told me he was redheaded before or that he captured your galley i said after a discreet interval  charlie did not raise his eyes  he was as red as a red bear said he abstractedly he came from the north they said so in the galley when he looked for rowersnot slaves but free men  afterwardyears and years afterwardnews came from another ship or else he came backhis lips moved in silence he was rapturously retasting some poem before him  where had he been then i was almost whispering that the sentence might come gentle to whichever section of charlies brain was working on my behalf  to the beachesthe long and wonderful beaches was the reply after a minute of silence  to furdurstrandi i asked tingling from head to foot  yes to furdurstrandi he pronounced the word in a new fashion and i too sawthe voice failed  do you know what you have said i shouted incautiously  he lifted his eyes fully roused now no he snapped i wish youd let a chap go on reading hark to this  but othere the old sea captain  he neither paused nor stirred  till the king listened and then  once more took up his pen  and wrote down every word   and to the king of the saxons  in witness of the truth  raising his noble head  he stretched his brown hand and said  behold this walrus tooth  by jove what chaps those must have been to go sailing all over the shop never knowing where theyd fetch the land hah  charlie i pleaded if youll only be sensible for a minute or two ill make our hero in our tale every inch as good as othere  umph  longfellow wrote that poem i dont care about writing things any more i want to read he was thoroughly out of tune now and raging over my own illluck i left him  conceive yourself at the door of the worlds treasurehouse guarded by a childan idle irresponsible child playing knuckleboneson whose favor depends the gift of the key and you will imagine onehalf my torment till that evening charlie had spoken nothing that might not lie within the experiences of a greek galleyslave but now or there was no virtue in books he had talked of some desperate adventure of the vikings of thorfin karlsefnes sailing to wineland which is america in the ninth or tenth century the battle in the harbor he had seen and his own death he had described but this was a much more startling plunge into the past was it possible that he had skipped half a dozen lives and was then dimly remembering some episode of a thousand years later it was a maddening jumble and the worst of it was that charlie mears in his normal condition was the last person in the world to clear it up i could only wait and watch but i went to bed that night full of the wildest imaginings there was nothing that was not possible if charlies detestable memory only held good  i might rewrite the saga of thorfin karlsefne as it had never been written before might tell the story of the first discovery of america myself the discoverer but i was entirely at charlies mercy and so long as there was a threeandsixpenny bohn volume within his reach charlie would not tell i dared not curse him openly i hardly dared jog his memory for i was dealing with the experiences of a thousand years ago told through the mouth of a boy of today and a boy of today is affected by every change of tone and gust of opinion so that he lies even when he desires to speak the truth  i saw no more of him for nearly a week when next i met him it was in gracechurch street with a billbook chained to his waist  business took him over london bridge and i accompanied him he was very full of the importance of that book and magnified it  as we passed over the thames we paused to look at a steamer unloading great slabs of white and brown marble a barge drifted under the steamers stern and a lonely cow in that barge bellowed  charlies face changed from the face of the bankclerk to that of an unknown andthough he would not have believed thisa much shrewder man he flung out his arm across the parapet of the bridge and laughing very loudly said when they heard our bulls bellow the skroelings ran away  i waited only for an instant but the barge and the cow had disappeared under the bows of the steamer before i answered  charlie what do you suppose are skroelings  never heard of em before they sound like a new kind of seagull what a chap you are for asking questions he replied i have to go to the cashier of the omnibus company yonder will you wait for me and we can lunch somewhere together ive a notion for a poem  no thanks im off youre sure you know nothing about skroelings  not unless hes been entered for the liverpool handicap he nodded and disappeared in the crowd  now it is written in the saga of eric the red or that of thorfin karlsefne that nine hundred years ago when karlsefnes galleys came to leifs booths which leif had erected in the unknown land called markland which may or may not have been rhode island the skroelingsand the lord he knows who these may or may not have beencame to trade with the vikings and ran away because they were frightened at the bellowing of the cattle which thorfin had brought with him in the ships but what in the world could a greek slave know of that affair i wandered up and down among the streets trying to unravel the mystery and the more i considered it the more baffling it grew one thing only seemed certain and that certainty took away my breath for the moment if i came to full knowledge of anything at all it would not be one life of the soul in charlie mearss body but half a dozenhalf a dozen several and separate existences spent on blue water in the morning of the world  then i walked round the situation  obviously if i used my knowledge i should stand alone and unapproachable until all men were as wise as myself that would be something but manlike i was ungrateful it seemed bitterly unfair that charlies memory should fail me when i needed it most  great powers abovei looked up at them through the fog smokedid the lords of life and death know what this meant to me nothing less than eternal fame of the best kind that comes from one and is shared by one alone i would be contentremembering clive i stood astounded at my own moderationwith the mere right to tell one story to work out one little contribution to the light literature of the day if charlie were permitted full recollection for one hourfor sixty short minutesof existences that had extended over a thousand yearsi would forego all profit and honor from all that i should make of his speech i would take no share in the commotion that would follow throughout the particular corner of the earth that calls itself the world the thing should be put forth anonymously nay i would make other men believe that they had written it they would hire bullhided selfadvertising englishmen to bellow it abroad preachers would found a fresh conduct of life upon it swearing that it was new and that they had lifted the fear of death from all mankind every orientalist in europe would patronize it discursively with sanskrit and pali texts terrible women would invent unclean variants of the mens belief for the elevation of their sisters churches and religions would war over it between the hailing and restarting of an omnibus i foresaw the scuffles that would arise among half a dozen denominations all professing the doctrine of the true metempsychosis as applied to the world and the new era and saw too the respectable english newspapers shying like frightened kine over the beautiful simplicity of the tale the mind leaped forward a hundred two hundreda thousand years i saw with sorrow that men would mutilate and garble the story that rival creeds would turn it upside down till at last the western world which clings to the dread of death more closely than the hope of life would set it aside as an interesting superstition and stampede after some faith so long forgotten that it seemed altogether new upon this i changed the terms of the bargain that i would make with the lords of life and death only let me know let me write the story with sure knowledge that i wrote the truth and i would burn the manuscript as a solemn sacrifice five minutes after the last line was written i would destroy it all but i must be allowed to write it with absolute certainty  there was no answer the flaming colors of an aquarium poster caught my eye and i wondered whether it would be wise or prudent to lure charlie into the hands of the professional mesmerist and whether if he were under his power he would speak of his past lives if he did and if people believed himbut charlie would be frightened and flustered or made conceited by the interviews in either case he would begin to lie through fear or vanity he was safest in my own hands  they are very funny fools your english said a voice at my elbow and turning round i recognized a casual acquaintance a young bengali law student called grish chunder whose father had sent him to england to become civilized the old man was a retired native official and on an income of five pounds a month contrived to allow his son two hundred pounds a year and the run of his teeth in a city where he could pretend to be the cadet of a royal house and tell stories of the brutal indian bureaucrats who ground the faces of the poor  grish chunder was a young fat fullbodied bengali dressed with scrupulous care in frock coat tall hat light trousers and tan gloves but i had known him in the days when the brutal indian government paid for his university education and he contributed cheap sedition to sachi durpan and intrigued with the wives of his schoolmates  that is very funny and very foolish he said nodding at the poster i am going down to the northbrook club will you come too  i walked with him for some time you are not well he said what is there in your mind you do not talk  grish chunder youve been too well educated to believe in a god havent vou  oah yes here but when i go home i must conciliate popular superstition and make ceremonies of purification and my women will anoint idols  and bang up tulsi and feast the purohit and take you back into caste again and make a good khuttri of you again you advanced social freethinker and youll eat desi food and like it all from the smell in the courtyard to the mustard oil over you  i shall very much like it said grish chunder unguardedly once a hindu always a hindu but i like to know what the english think they know  ill tell you something that one englishman knows its an old tale to you  i began to tell the story of charlie in english but grish chunder put a question in the vernacular and the history went forward naturally in the tongue best suited for its telling after all it could never have been told in english grish chunder heard me nodding from time to time and then came up to my rooms where i finished the tale  beshak he said philosophically lekin darwaza band hai without doubt but the door is shut i have heard of this remembering of previous existences among my people it is of course an old tale with us but to happen to an englishmana cowfed malechkan outcast by jove that is most peculiar  outcast yourself grish chunder you eat cowbeef every day lets think the thing over the boy remembers his incarnations  does he know that said grish chunder quietly swinging his legs as he sat on my table he was speaking in english now  he does not know anything would i speak to you if he did go on  there is no going on at all if you tell that to your friends they will say you are mad and put it in the papers suppose now you prosecute for libel  lets leave that out of the question entirely is there any chance of his being made to speak  there is a chance oah yess but if he spoke it would mean that all this world would end nowinstantofall down on your head these things are not allowed you know as i said the door is shut  not a ghost of a chance  how can there be you are a christian and it is forbidden to eat in your books of the tree of life or else you would never die how shall you all fear death if you all know what your friend does not know that he knows i am afraid to be kicked but i am not afraid to die because i know what i know you are not afraid to be kicked but you are afraid to die if you were not by god you english would be all over the shop in an hour upsetting the balances of power and making commotions it would not be good but no fear he will remember a little and a little less and he will call it dreams then he will forget altogether when i passed my first arts examination in calcutta that was all in the crambook on wordsworth trailing clouds of glory you know  this seems to be an exception to the rule  there are no exceptions to rules some are not so hardlooking as others but they are all the same when you touch if this friend of yours said soandso and soandso indicating that he remembered all his lost lives or one piece of a lost life he would not be in the bank another hour he would be what you called sack because he was mad and they would send him to an asylum for lunatics you can see that my friend  of course i can but i wasnt thinking of him his name need never appear in the story  ah i see that story will never be written you can try  i am going to  for your own credit and for the sake of money of course  no for the sake of writing the story on my honor that will be all  even then there is no chance you cannot play with the gods it is a very pretty story now as they say let it go on thati mean at that  be quick he will not last long  how do you mean  what i say he has never so far thought about a woman  hasnt he though i remembered some of charlies confidences  i mean no woman has thought about him when that comes bushogyaall up i know there are millions of women here housemaids for instance  i winced at the thought of my story being ruined by a housemaid  and yet nothing was more probable  grish chunder grinned  yesalso pretty girlscousins of his house and perhaps not of his house one kiss that he gives back again and remembers will cure all this nonsense or else  or else what remember he does not know that he knows  i know that or else if nothing happens he will become immersed in the trade and the financial speculations like the rest it must be so you can see that it must be so but the woman will come first i think  there was a rap at the door and charlie charged in impetuously he had been released from office and by the look in his eyes i could see that he had come over for a long talk most probably with poems in his pockets charlies poems were very wearying but sometimes they led him to talk about the galley  grish chunder looked at him keenly for a minute  i beg your pardon charlie said uneasily i didnt know you had any one with you  i am going said grish chunder  he drew me into the lobby as he departed  that is your man he said quickly i tell you he will never speak all you wish that is rotbosh but he would be most good to make to see things suppose now we pretend that it was only playi had never seen grish chunder so excitedand pour the inkpool into his hand eh what do you think i tell you that he could see anything that a man could see let me get the ink and the camphor he is a seer and he will tell us very many things  he may be all you say but im not going to trust him to your gods and devils  it will not hurt him he will only feel a little stupid and dull when he wakes up you have seen boys look into the inkpool before  that is the reason why i am not going to see it any more youd better go grish chunder  he went declaring far down the staircase that it was throwing away my only chance of looking into the future  this left me unmoved for i was concerned for the past and no peering of hypnotized boys into mirrors and inkpools would help me do that but i recognized grish chunders point of view and sympathized with it  what a big black brute that was said charlie when i returned to him well look here ive just done a poem dil it instead of playing dominoes after lunch may i read it  let me read it to myself  then you miss the proper expression besides you always make my things sound as if the rhymes were all wrong  read it aloud then youre like the rest of em  charlie mouthed me his poem and it was not much worse than the average of his verses he had been reading his book faithfully but he was not pleased when i told him that i preferred my longfellow undiluted with charlie  then we began to go through the ms line by line charlie parrying every objection and correction with yes that may be better but you dont catch what im driving at  charlie was in one way at least very like one kind of poet  there was a pencil scrawl at the back of the paper and whats that i said  oh thats not poetry t all its some rot i wrote last night before i went to bed and it was too much bother to hunt for rhymes so i made it a sort of a blank verse instead  here is charlies blank verse   we pulled for you when the wind was against us and the sails were low  will you never let us go   we ate bread and onions when you took towns or ran aboard quickly when you were beaten back by the foe   the captains walked up and down the deck in fair weather singing songs but we were below   we fainted with our chins on the oars and you did not see that we were idle for we still swung to and fro  will you never let us go   the salt made the oar handles like sharkskin our knees were cut to the bone with salt cracks our hair was stuck to our foreheads and our lips were cut to our gums and you whipped us because we could not row  will you never let us go   but in a little time we shall run out of the portholes as the water runs along the oarblade and though you tell the others to row after us you will never catch us till you catch the oarthresh and tie up the winds in the belly of the sail aho  will you never let us go  hm whats oarthresh charlie  the water washed up by the oars thats the sort of song they might sing in the galley yknow arent you ever going to finish that story and give me some of the profits  it depends on yourself if you had only told me more about your hero in the first instance it might have been finished by now youre so hazy in your notions  i only want to give you the general notion of itthe knocking about from place to place and the fighting and all that cant you fill in the rest yourself make the hero save a girl on a pirategalley and marry her or do something  youre a really helpful collaborator i suppose the hero went through some few adventures before he married  well then make him a very artful carda low sort of mana sort of political man who went about making treaties and breaking thema blackhaired chap who hid behind the mast when the fighting began  but you said the other day that he was redhaired  i couldnt have make him blackhaired of course youve no imagination  seeing that i had just discovered the entire principles upon which the half memory falsely called imagination is based i felt entitled to laugh but forbore for the sake of the tale  youre right youre the man with imagination a blackhaired chap in a decked ship i said  no an open shiplike a big boat  this was maddening  your ship has been built and designed closed and decked in you said so yourself i protested  no no not that ship that was open or half decked becauseby jove youre right you made me think of the hero as a redhaired chap of course if he were red the ship would be an open one with painted sails  surely i thought he would remember now that he had served in two galleys at leastin a threedecked greek one under the blackhaired political man and again in a vikings open seaserpent under the man red as a red bear who went to markland the devil prompted me to speak  why of course charlie said i i dont know are you making fun of me  the current was broken for the time being i took up a notebook and pretended to make many entries in it  its a pleasure to work with an imaginative chap like yourself i said after a pause the way that youve brought out the character of the hero is simply wonderful  do you think so he answered with a pleased flush i often tell myself that theres more in me than mythan people think  theres an enormous amount in you  then wont you let me send an essay on the ways of bank clerks to titbits and get the guinea prize  that wasnt exactly what i meant old fellow perhaps it would be better to wait a little and go ahead with the galleystory  ah but i shant get the credit of that titbits would publish my name and address if i win what are you grinning at they would  i know it suppose you go for a walk i want to look through my notes about our story  now this reprehensible youth who left me a little hurt and put back might for aught he or i knew have been one of the crew of the argohad been certainly slave or comrade to thorfin karlsefne therefore he was deeply interested in guinea competitions remembering what grish chunder had said i laughed aloud the lords of life and death would never allow charlie mears to speak with full knowledge of his pasts and i must even piece out what he had told me with my own poor inventions while charlie wrote of the ways of bank clerks  i got together and placed on one file all my notes and the net result was not cheering i read them a second time there was nothing that might not have been compiled at secondhand from other peoples booksexcept perhaps the story of the fight in the harbor the adventures of a viking bad been written many times before the history of a greek galleyslave was no new thing and though i wrote both who could challenge or confirm the accuracy of my details i might as well tell a tale of two thousand years hence the lords of life and death were as cunning as grish chunder had hinted they would allow nothing to escape that might trouble or make easy the minds of men though i was convinced of this yet i could not leave the tale alone exaltation followed reaction not once but twenty times in the next few weeks my moods varied with the march sunlight and flying clouds by night or in the beauty of a spring morning i perceived that i could write that tale and shift continents thereby in the wet windy afternoons i saw that the tale might indeed be written but would be nothing more than a faked falsevarnished shamrusted piece of wardour street work at the end then i blessed charlie in many ways though it was no fault of his he seemed to be busy with prize competitions and i saw less and less of him as the weeks went by and the earth cracked and grew ripe to spring and the buds swelled in their sheaths he did not care to read or talk of what he had read and there was a new ring of selfassertion in his voice i hardly cared to remind him of the galley when we met but charlie alluded to it on every occasion always as a story from which money was to be made  i think i deserve twentyfive per cent dont i at least be said with beautiful frankness i supplied all the ideas didnt i  this greediness for silver was a new side in his nature i assumed that it had been developed in the city where charlie was picking up the curious nasal drawl of the underbred city man  when the things done well talk about it i cant make anything of it at present redhaired or blackhaired hero are equally difficult  he was sitting by the fire staring at the red coals i cant understand what you find so difficult its all as clean as mud to me he replied a jet of gas puffed out between the bars took light and whistled softly suppose we take the redhaired heros adventures first from the time that he came south to my galley and captured it and sailed to the beaches  i knew better now than to interrupt charlie i was out of reach of pen and paper and dared not move to get them lest i should break the current the gasjet puffed and whinnied charlies voice dropped almost to a whisper and he told a tale of the sailing of an open galley to furdurstrandi of sunsets on the open sea seen under the curve of the one sail evening after evening when the galleys beak was notched into the centre of the sinking disc and we sailed by that for we had no other guide quoth charlie he spoke of a landing on an island and explorations in its woods where the crew killed three men whom they found asleep under the pines their ghosts charlie said followed the galley swimming and choking in the water and the crew cast lots and threw one of their number overboard as a sacrifice to the strange gods whom they had offended then they ate seaweed when their provisions failed and their legs swelled and their leader the redhaired man killed two rowers who mutinied and after a year spent among the woods they set sail for their own country and a wind that never failed carried them back so safely that they all slept at night this and much more charlie told sometimes the voice fell so low that i could not catch the words though every nerve was on the strain he spoke of their leader the redhaired man as a pagan speaks of his god for it was he who cheered them and slew them impartially as he thought best for their needs and it was he who steered them for three days among floating ice each floe crowded with strange beasts that tried to sail with us said charlie and we beat them back with the handles of the oars  the gasjet went out a burned coal gave way and the fire settled down with a tiny crash to the bottom of the grate charlie ceased speaking and i said no word  by jove he said at last shaking his head ive been staring at the fire till im dizzy what was i going to say  something about the galley  i remember now its 25 per cent of the profits isnt it  its anything you like when ive done the tale  i wanted to be sure of that i must go now ive ive an appointment and he left me  had my eyes not been held i might have known that that broken muttering over the fire was the swansong of charlie mears but i thought it the prelude to fuller revelation at last and at last i should cheat the lords of life and death  when next charlie came to me i received him with rapture he was nervous and embarrassed but his eyes were very full of light and his lips a little parted  ive done a poem he said and then quickly its the best ive ever done read it he thrust it into my hand and retreated to the window  i groaned inwardly it would be the work of half an hour to criticisethat is to say praisethe poem sufficiently to please charlie then i had good reason to groan for charlie discarding his favorite centipede metres had launched into shorter and choppier verse and verse with a motive at the back of it this is what i read  the day is most fair the cheery wind  halloos behind the hill  where bends the wood as seemeth good  and the sapling to his will  riot o wind there is that in my blood  that would not have thee still   she gave me herself o earth o sky  grey sea she is mine alonei  let the sullen boulders hear my cry  and rejoice tho they be but stone   mine i have won her o good brown earth  make merry tis bard on spring  make merry my love is doubly worth  all worship your fields can bring  let the hind that tills you feel my mirth  at the early harrowing  yes its the early harrowing past a doubt i said with a dread at my heart charlie smiled but did not answer  red cloud of the sunset tell it abroad  i am victor greet me o sun  dominant master and absolute lord  over the soul of one  well said charlie looking over my shoulder  i thought it far from well and very evil indeed when he silently laid a photograph on the paperthe photograph of a girl with a curly head and a foolish slack mouth  isnt itisnt it wonderful he whispered pink to the tips of his ears wrapped in the rosy mystery of first love i didnt know i didnt thinkit came like a thunderclap  yes it comes like a thunderclap are you very happy charlie  my godsheshe loves me he sat down repeating the last words to himself i looked at the hairless face the narrow shoulders already bowed by desk work and wondered when where and bow he had loved in his past lives  what will your mother say i asked cheerfully  i dont care a damn what she says  at twenty the things for which one does not care a damn should properly be many but one must not include mothers in the list i told him this gently and he described her even as adam must have described to the newly named beasts the glory and tenderness and beauty of eve incidentally i learned that she was a tobacconists assistant with a weakness for pretty dress and had told him four or five times already that she had never been kissed by a man before  charlie spoke on and on and on while i separated from him by thousands of years was considering the beginnings of things now i understood why the lords of life and death shut the doors so carefully behind us it is that we may not remember our first wooings were it not so our world would be without inhabitants in a hundred years  now about that galleystory i said still more cheerfully in a pause in the rush of the speech  charlie looked up as though he had been hit the galleywhat galley good heavens dont joke man this is serious you dont know how serious it is  grish chunder was right charlie had tasted the love of woman that kills remembrance and the finest story in the world would never be written                  volume iv under the deodars    the education of otis yeere   i  in the pleasant orchardcloses  god bless all our gains say we but may god bless all our losses  better suits with our degree               the lost bower   this is the history of a failure but the woman who failed said that it might be an instructive tale to put into print for the benefit of the younger generation the younger generation does not want instruction being perfectly willing to instruct if any one will listen to it none the less here begins the story where every rightminded story should begin that is to say at simla where all things begin and many come to an evil end  the mistake was due to a very clever woman making a blunder and not retrieving it men are licensed to stumble but a clever womans mistake is outside the regular course of nature and providence since all good people know that a woman is the only infallible thing in this world except government paper of the 70 issue bearing interest at four and a half per cent yet we have to remember that six consecutive days of rehearsing the leading part of the fallen age at the new gaiety theatre where the plaster is not yet properly dry might have brought about an unhingement of spirits which again might have led to eccentricities  mrs hauksbee came to the foundry to tiffin with mrs mallowe her one bosom friend for she was in no sense a womans woman and it was a womans tiffin the door shut to all the world and they both talked chiffons which is french for mysteries  ive enjoyed an interval of sanity mrs hauksbee announced after tiffin was over and the two were comfortably settled in the little writingroom that opened out of mrs mallowes bedroom  my dear girl what has he done said mrs mallowe sweetly it is noticeable that ladies of a certain age call each other dear girl just as commissioners of twentyeight years standing address their equals in the civil list as my boy  theres no he in the case who am i that an imaginary man should be always credited to me am i an apache  no dear but somebodys scalp is generally drying at your wigwamdoor soaking rather  this was an allusion to the hawley boy who was in the habit of riding all across simla in the rains to call on mrs hauksbee that lady laughed  for my sins the aide at tyrconnel last night told me off to the mussuck hsh dont laugh one of my most devoted admirers when the duff camesome one really ought to teach them to make pudding at tyrconnelthe mussuck was at liberty to attend to me  sweet soul i know his appetite said mrs mallowe did he oh did he begin his wooing  by a special mercy of providence no he explained his importance as a pillar of the empire i didnt laugh  lucy i dont believe you  ask captain sangar he was on the other side well as i was saying the mussuck dilated  i think i can see him doing it said mrs mallowe pensively scratching her foxterriers ears  i was properly impressed  most properly i yawned openly strict supervision and play them off one against the other said the mussuck shoveling down his ice by tureenfuls i assure you that mrs hauksbee is the secret of our government  mrs mallowe laughed long and merrily and what did you say  did you ever know me at loss for an answer yet i said so i have observed in my dealings with you the mussuck swelled with pride he is coming to call on me tomorrow the hawley boy is coming too  strict supervision and play them off one against the other that mrs hauksbee is the secret of our government and i dare say if we could get to the mussucks heart we should find that he considers himself a man of the world  as he is of the other two things i like the mussuck and i wont have you call him names he amuses me  he has reformed you too by what appears explain the interval of sanity and hit tim on the nose with the papercutter please that dog is too fond of sugar do you take milk in yours  no thanks polly im wearied of this life its hollow  turn religious then i always said that rome would be your fate  only exchanging half a dozen attaches in red for one and in black and if i fasted the wrinkles would come and never never go has it ever struck you dear that im getting old  thanks for your courtesy ill return it yees we are both not exactlyhow shall i put it  what we have been i feel it in my bones as mrs crossley says polly ive wasted my life  as how  never mind how i feel it i want to be a power before i die  be a power then youve wits enough for anythingand beauty  mrs hauksbee pointed a teaspoon straight at her hostess polly if you heap compliments on me like this i shall cease to believe that youre a woman tell me how i am to be a power  inform the mussuck that he is the most fascinating and slimmest man in asia and hell tell you anything and everything you please  bother the mussuck i mean an intellectual powernot a gaspower polly im going to start a salon  mrs mallowe turned lazily on the sofa and rested her head on her hand hear the words of the preacher the son of baruch she said  will you talk sensibly  i will dear for i see that you are going to make a mistake  i never made a mistake in my life at least never one that i couldnt explain away afterward  going to make a mistake went on mrs mallowe composedly it is impossible to start a salon in simla a bar would be much more to the point  perhaps but why it seems so easy  just what makes it so difficult how many clever women are there in simla  myself and yourself said mrs hauksbee without a moments hesitation  modest woman  mrs feardon would thank you for that and how many clever men  oherhundreds said mrs hauksbee vaguely  what a fatal blunder not one they are all bespoke of the government take my husband for instance jack was a clever man though i say so who shouldnt government has eaten him up all his ideas and powers of conversationhe really used to be a good talker even to his wife in the old daysare taken from him by thisthis kitchensink of a government thats the case with every man up here who is at work i dont suppose a russian convict under the knout is able to amuse the rest of his gang and all our menfolk here are gilded convicts  but there are scores  i know what youre going to say scores of idle men up on leave i admit it but they are all of two objectionable sets the civilian whod be delightful if he had the military mans knowledge of the world and style and the military man whod be adorable if lie had the civilians culture  detestable word have civilians culchaw i never studied the breed deeply  dont make fun of jacks service yes theyre like the teapots in the lakka bazargood material but not polished they cant help themselves poor dears a civilian only begins to be tolerable after he has knocked about the world for fifteen years  and a military man  when he has had the same amount of service the young of both species are horrible you would have scores of them in your salon  i would not said mrs hauksbee fiercely i would tell the bearer to darwaza band them id put their own colonels and commissioners at the door to turn them away id give them to the topsham girl to play with  the topsham girl would be grateful for the gift but to go back to the salon allowing that you had gathered all your men and women together what would you do with them make them talk they would all with one accord begin to flirt your salon would become a glorified pelitisa scandal point by lamplight  theres a certain amount of wisdom in that view  theres all the wisdom in the world in it surely twelve simla seasons ought to have taught you that you cant focus anything in india and a salon to be any good at all must be permanent in two seasons your roomful would be scattered all over asia we are only little bits of dirt on the hillsides here one day and blown down the khud the next we have lost the art of talkingat least our men have we have no cohesion  george eliot in the flesh interpolated mrs hauksbee wickedly  and collectively my dear scoffer we men and women alike have no influence  come into the veranda and look at the mall  the two looked down on the now rapidly filling road for all simla was abroad to steal a stroll between a shower and a fog  how do you propose to fix that river look theres the mussuckhead of goodness knows what he is a power in the land though he does eat like a costermonger theres colonel blone and general grucher and sir dugald delane and sir henry haughton and mr jellalatty all heads of departments and all powerful  and all my fervent admirers said mrs hauksbee piously sir henry haughton raves about me but go on  one by one these men are worth something collectively theyre just a mob of angloindians who cares for what angloindians say your salon wont weld the departments together and make you mistress of india dear and these creatures wont talk administrative shop in a crowdyour salonbecause they are so afraid of the men in the lower ranks overhearing it they have forgotten what of literature and art they ever knew and the women  cant talk about anything except the last gymkhana or the sins of their last nurse i was calling on mrs derwills this morning  you admit that they can talk to the subalterns though and the subalterns can talk to them your salon would suit their views admirably if you respected the religious prejudices of the country and provided plenty of kala juggahs  plenty of kala juggahs oh my poor little idea kala juggahs in a salon but who made you so awfully clever  perhaps ive tried myself or perhaps i know a woman who has i have preached and expounded the whole matter and the conclusion thereof  you neednt go on is vanity polly i thank you these vermin mrs hauksbee waved her hand from the veranda to two men in the crowd below who had raised their hats to herthese vermin shall not rejoice in a new scandal point or an extra pelitis i will abandon the notion of a salon it did seem so tempting though but what shall i do i must do something  why are not abana and pharphar  jack has made you nearly as bad as himself i want to of course im tired of everything and everybody from a moonlight picnic at seepee to the blandishments of the mussuck  yesthat comes too sooner or later have you nerve enough to make your bow yet  mrs hauksbees mouth shut grimly then she laughed i think i see myself doing it big pink placards on the mall mrs hauksbee positively her last appearance on any stage this is to give notice no more dances no more rides no more luncheons no more theatricals with supper to follow no more sparring with ones dearest dearest friend no more fencing with an inconvenient man who hasnt wit enough to clothe what hes pleased to call his sentiments in passable speech no more parading of the mussuck while mrs tarkass calls all round simla spreading horrible stories about me no more of anything that is thoroughly wearying abominable and detestable but all the same makes life worth the having yes i see it all dont interrupt polly im inspired a mauve and white striped cloud round my excellent shoulders a seat in the fifth row of the gaiety and both horses sold delightful vision a comfortable armchair situated in three different draughts at every ballroom and nice large sensible shoes for all the couples to stumble over as they go into the veranda then at supper cant you imagine the scene the greedy mob gone away reluctant subaltern pink all over like a newlypowdered babythey really ought to tan subalterns before they are exportedpolly sent back by the hostess to do his duty slouches up to me across the room tugging at a glove two sizes too large for himi hate a man who wears gloves like overcoatsand trying to look as if hed thought of it from the first may i ahhave the pleasure f takin you nt supper then i get up with a hungry smile just like this  lucy how can you be so absurd  and sweep out on his arm so after supper i shall go away early you know because i shall be afraid of catching cold no one will look for my rickshaw mine so please you i shall stand always with that mauve and white cloud over my head while the wet soaks into my dear old venerable feet and tom swears and shouts for the memsahibs gharri then home to bed at halfpast eleven truly excellent life helped out by the visits of the padri just fresh from burying somebody down below there she pointed through the pines toward the cemetery and continued with vigorous dramatic gesturelisten i see it all down down even to the stays such stays sixeight a pair polly with red flannelor list is itthat they put into the tops of those fearful things i can draw you a picture of them  lucy for heavens sake dont go waving your arms about in that idiotic manner recollect every one can see you from the mall  let them see theyll think i am rehearsing for the fallen angel look theres the mussuck how badly he rides there  she blew a kiss to the venerable indian administrator with infinite grace  now she continued hell be chaffed about that at the club in the delicate manner those brutes of men affect and the hawley boy will tell me all about itsoftening the details for fear of shocking me that boy is too good to live polly ive serious thoughts of recommending him to throw up his commission and go into the church in his present frame of mind he would obey me happy happy child  never again said mrs mallowe with an affectation of indignation shall you tiffin here lucindy your behavior is scandlus  all your fault retorted mrs hauksbee for suggesting such a thing as my abdication no jamaisnevaire i will act dance ride frivol talk scandal dine out and appropriate the legitimate captives of any woman i choose until i drrrop or a better woman than i puts me to shame before all simlaand its dust and ashes in my mouth while im doing it  she swept into the drawingroom mrs mallowe followed and put an arm round her waist  im not said mrs hauksbee defiantly rummaging for her handkerchief ive been dining out the last ten nights and rehearsing in the afternoon youd be tired yourself its only because im tired  mrs mallowe did not offer mrs hauksbee any pity or ask her to lie down but gave her another cup of tea and went on with the talk  ive been through that too dear she said  i remember said mrs hauksbee a gleam of fun on her face in 84 wasnt it you went out a great deal less next season  mrs mallowe smiled in a superior and sphinxlike fashion  i became an influence said she  good gracious child you didnt join the theosophists and kiss buddhas big toe did you i tried to get into their set once but they cast me out for a skepticwithout a chance of improving my poor little mind too  no i didnt theosophilander jack says  never mind jack what a husband says is known before what did you do  i made a lasting impression  so have ifor four months but that didnt console me in the least i hated the man will you stop smiling in that inscrutable way and tell me what you mean  mrs mallowe told         andyoumeantosay that it is absolutely platonic on both sides  absolutely or i should never have taken it up  and his last promotion was due to you  mrs mallowe nodded  and you warned him against the topsham girl  another nod  and told him of sir dugald delanes private memo about him  a third nod  why  what a question to ask a woman because it amused me at first i am proud of my property now if i live he shall continue to be successful yes i will put him upon the straight road to knighthood and everything else that a man values the rest depends upon himself  polly you are a most extraordinary woman  not in the least im concentrated thats all you diffuse yourself dear and though all simla knows your skill in managing a team  cant you choose a prettier word  team of half a dozen from the mussuck to the hawley boy you gain nothing by it not even amusement  and you  try my recipe take a man not a boy mind but an almost mature unattached man and be this guide philosopher and friend youll find it the most interesting occupation that you ever embarked on it can be doneyou neednt look like thatbecause ive done it  theres an element of risk about it that makes the notion attractive ill get such a man and say to him now understand that there must be no flirtation do exactly what i tell you profit by my instruction and counsels and all will yet be well as toole says is that the idea  more or less said mrs mallowe with an unfathomable smile but be sure he understands that there must be no flirtation  ii                                dribbledribbletrickletrickle what a lot of raw dust my dollies had an accident and out came all the sawdust            nursery rhyme  so mrs hauksbee in the foundry which overlooks simla mall sat at the feet of mrs mallowe and gathered wisdom the end of the conference was the great idea upon which mrs hauksbee so plumed herself  i warn you said mrs mallowe beginning to repent of her suggestion that the matter is not half so easy as it looks any womaneven the topsham girl can catch a man but very very few know how to manage him when caught  my child was the answer ive been a female st simon stylites looking down upon men for thesethese years past ask the mussuck whether i can manage them  mrs hauksbee departed humming ill go to him and say to him in manner most ironical mrs mallowe laughed to herself then she grew suddenly sober i wonder whether ive done well in advising that amusement lucys a clever woman but a thought too careless  a week later the two met at a monday pop well said mrs mallowe  ive caught him said mrs hauksbee her eyes were dancing with merriment  who is it mad woman im sorry i ever spoke to you about it  look between the pillars in the third row fourth from the end you can see his face now look  otis yeere of all the improbable and impossible people i dont believe you  hsh wait till mrs tarkass begins murdering milton wellings and ill tell you all about it ssss that womans voice always reminds me of an underground train coming into earls court with the brakes on now listen it is really otis yeere  so i see but does it follow that he is your property  he is by right of trove i found him lonely and unbefriended the very next night after our talk at the dugald delanes burrakhana i liked his eyes and i talked to him next day he called next day we went for a ride together and today hes tied to my rickshawwheels hand and foot youll see when the concerts over he doesnt know im here yet  thank goodness you havent chosen a boy what are you going to do with him assuming that youve got him  assuming indeed does a womando iever make a mistake in that sort of thing firstmrs hauksbee ticked off the items ostentatiously on her little gloved fingersfirst my dear i shall dress him properly at present his raiment is a disgrace and he wears a dress shirt like a crumpled sheet of the pioneer secondly after i have made him presentable i shall form his mannershis morals are above reproach  you seem to have discovered a great deal about him considering the shortness of your acquaintance  surely you ought to know that the first proof a man gives of his interest in a woman is by talking to her about his own sweet self if the woman listens without yawning he begins to like her if she flatters the animals vanity he ends by adoring her  in some cases  never mind the exceptions i know which one you are thinking of thirdly and lastly after he is polished and made pretty i shall as you said be his guide philosopher and friend and he shall become a successas great a success as your friend i always wondered how that man got on did the mussuck come to you with the civil list and dropping on one kneeno two knees a la gibbonhand it to you and say adorable angel choose your friends appointment  lucy your long experiences of the military department have demoralized you one doesnt do that sort of thing on the civil side  no disrespect meant to jacks service my dear i only asked for information give me three months and see what changes i shall work in my prey  go your own way since you must but im sorry that i was weak enough to suggest the amusement  i am all discretion and may be trusted to an infinite extent quoted mrs hauksbee from the fallen angel and the conversation ceased with mrs tarkasss last longdrawn warwhoop  her bitterest enemiesand she had manycould hardly accuse mrs hauksbee of wasting her time otis yeere was one of those wandering dumb characters foredoomed through life to be nobodys property ten years in her majestys bengal civil service spent for the most part in undesirable districts had given him little to be proud of and nothing to bring confidence old enough to have lost the first fine careless rapture that showers on the immature stunt imaginary commissionerships and stars and sends him into the collar with coltish earnestness and abandon too young to be yet able to look back upon the progress he had made and thank providence that under the conditions of the day he had come even so far he stood upon the deadcentre of his career and when a man stands still he feels the slightest impulse from without fortune had ruled that otis yeere should be for the first part of his service one of the rank and file who are ground up in the wheels of the administration losing heart and soul and mind and strength in the process until steam replaces manual power in the working of the empire there must always be this percentagemust always be the men who are used up expended in the mere mechanical routine for these promotion is far off and the mill grind of every day very near and instant the secretariats know them only by name they are not the picked men of the districts with the divisions and collectorates awaiting them they are simply the rank and filethe food for feversharing with the ryot and the ploughbullock the honor of being the plinth on which the state rests the older ones have lost their aspirations the younger are putting theirs aside with a sigh both learn to endure patiently until the end of the day twelve years in the rank and file men say will sap the hearts of the bravest and dull the wits of the most keen  out of this life otis yeere had fled for a few months drifting for the sake of a little masculine society into simla when his leave was over he would return to his swampy sourgreen undermanned district the native assistant the native doctor the native magistrate the steaming sweltering station the illkempt city and the undisguised insolence of the municipality that babbled away the lives of men life was cheap however the soil spawned humanity as it bred frogs in the rains and the gap of the sickness of one season was filled to overflowing by the fecundity of the next otis was unfeignedly thankful to lay down his work for a little while and escape from the seething whining weakly hive impotent to help itself but strong in its power to cripple thwart and annoy the wearyeyed man who by official irony was said to be in charge of it             i knew there were womendowdies in bengal they come up here sometimes but i didnt know that there were mendowdies too  then for the first time it occurred to otis yeere that his clothes were rather ancestral in appearance it will be seen from the above that his friendship with mrs hauksbee had made great strides  as that lady truthfully says a man is never so happy as when he is talking about himself from otis yeeres lips mrs hauksbee before long learned everything that she wished to know about the subject of her experiment learned what manner of life he had led in what she vaguely called those awful cholera districts learned too but this knowledge came later what manner of life he had purposed to lead and what dreams he had dreamed in the year of grace 77 before the reality had knocked the heart out of him very pleasant are the shady bridlepaths round prospect hill for the telling of such confidences  not yet said mrs hauksbee to mrs mallowe not yet i must wait until the man is properly dressed at least great heavens is it possible that he doesnt know what an honor it is to be taken up by me  mrs hauksbee did not reckon false modesty as one of her failings  always with mrs hauksbee murmured mrs mallowe with her sweetest smile to otis oh you men you men here are our punjabis growling because youve monopolized the nicest woman in simla theyll tear you to pieces on the mall some day mr yeere  mrs mallowe rattled downhill having satisfied herself by a glance through the fringe of her sunshade of the effect of her words  the shot went home of a surety otis yeere was somebody in this bewildering whirl of simlahad monopolized the nicest woman in it and the punjabis were growling the notion justified a mild glow of vanity he had never looked upon his acquaintance with mrs hauksbee as a matter for general interest  the knowledge of envy was a pleasant feeling to the man of no account it was intensified later in the day when a luncher at the club said spitefully well for a debilitated ditcher yeere you are going it hasnt any kind friend told you that shes the most dangerous woman in simla  yeere chuckled and passed out when oh when would his new clothes be ready he descended into the mall to inquire and mrs hauksbee coming over the church ridge in her rickshaw looked down upon him approvingly hes learning to carry himself as if he were a man instead of a piece of furniture andshe screwed up her eyes to see the better through the sunlighthe is a man when he holds himself like that oh blessed conceit what should we be without you  with the new clothes came a new stock of selfconfidence otis yeere discovered that he could enter a room without breaking into a gentle perspirationcould cross one even to talk to mrs hauksbee as though rooms were meant to be crossed he was for the first time in nine years proud of himself and contented with his life satisfied with his new clothes and rejoicing in the friendship of mrs hauksbee  conceit is what the poor fellow wants she said in confidence to mrs mallowe i believe they must use civilians to plough the fields with in lower bengal you see i have to begin from the very beginninghavent i but youll admit wont you dear that he is immensely improved since i took him in hand only give me a little more time and he wont know himself  indeed yeere was rapidly beginning to forget what he had been one of his own rank and file put the matter brutally when he asked yeere in reference to nothing and who has been making you a member of council lately you carry the side of half a dozen of em  iim awfly sorry i didnt mean it you know said yeere apologetically  therell be no holding you continued the old stager grimly climb down otisclimb down and get all that beastly affectation knocked out of you with fever three thousand a month wouldnt support it  yeere repeated the incident to mrs hauksbee he had come to look upon her as his mother confessor  and you apologized she said oh shame i hate a man who apologizes never apologize for what your friend called side never its a mans business to be insolent and overbearing until he meets with a stronger now you bad boy listen to me  simply and straightforwardly as the rickshaw loitered round jakko mrs hauksbee preached to otis yeere the great gospel of conceit illustrating it with living pictures encountered during their sunday afternoon stroll  good gracious she ended with the personal argument youll apologize next for being my attache  never said otis yeere thats another thing altogether i shall always be  whats coming thought mrs hauksbee  proud of that said otis  safe for the present she said to herself  but im afraid i have grown conceited like jeshurun you know when he waxed fat then he kicked its the having no worry on ones mind and the hill air i suppose  hill air indeed said mrs hauksbee to herself hed have been hiding in the club till the last day of his leave if i hadnt discovered him and aloudwhy shouldnt you be you have every right to  i why  oh hundreds of things im not going to waste this lovely afternoon by explaining but i know you have what was that heap of manuscript you showed me about the grammar of the aboriginalwhats their names  gullals a piece of nonsense ive far too much work to do to bother over gullals now you should see my district come down with your husband some day and ill show you round such a lovely place in the rains a sheet of water with the railwayembankment and the snakes sticking out and in the summer green flies and green squash the people would die of fear if you shook a dogwhip at em but they know youre forbidden to do that so they conspire to make your life a burden to you my districts worked by some man at darjiling on the strength of u native pleaders false reports oh its a heavenly place  otis yeere laughed bitterly  theres not the least necessity that you should stay in it why do you  because i must howm i to get out of it  how in a hundred and fifty ways if there werent so many people on the road id like to box your ears ask my dear boy ask look there is young hexarly with six years service and half your talents he asked for what he wanted and he got it see down by the convent theres mcarthurson who has come to his present position by askingsheer downright askingafter he had pushed himself out of the rank and file one man is as good as another in your servicebelieve me ive seen simla for more seasons than i care to think about do you suppose men are chosen for appointments because of their special fitness beforehand you have all passed a high testwhat do you call itin the beginning and except for the few who have gone altogether to the bad you can all work hard asking does the rest call it cheek call it insolence call it anything you like but ask men argueyes i know what men saythat a man by the mere audacity of his request must have some good in him a weak man doesnt say give me this and that he whines why havent i been given this and that if you were in the army i should say learn to spin plates or play a tambourine with your toes as it isask you belong to a service that ought to be able to command the channel fleet or set a leg at twenty minutes notice and yet you hesitate over asking to escape from a squashy green district where you admit you are not master drop the bengal government altogether even darjiling is a little outoftheway hole i was there once and the rents were extortionate assert yourself get the government of india to take you over try to get on the frontier where every man has a grand chance if he can trust himself go somewhere do something you have twice the wits and three times the presence of the men up here and and  mrs hauksbee paused for breath then continuedand in any way you look at it you ought to you who could go so far  i dont know said yeere rather taken aback by the unexpected eloquence 1 havent such a good opinion of myself  it was not strictly platonic hut it was policy mrs hauksbee laid her hand lightly upon the ungloved paw that rested on the turnedback rickshaw hood and looking the man full in the face said tenderly almost too tenderly i believe in you if you mistrust yourself is that enough my friend  it is enough answered otis very solemnly  he was silent for a long time redreaming the dreams that he had dreamed eight years ago but through them all ran as sheetlightning through golden cloud the light of mrs hauksbees violet eyes  curious and impenetrable are the mazes of simla lifethe only existence in this desolate land worth the living gradually it went abroad among men and women in the pauses between dance play and gymkhana that otis yeere the man with the newlylit light of selfconfidence in his eyes had done something decent in the wilds whence he came he had brought an erring municipality to reason appropriated the funds on his own responsibility and saved the lives of hundreds he knew more about the gullals than any living man had a vast knowledge of the aboriginal tribes was in spite of his juniority the greatest authority on the aboriginal gullals no one quite knew who or what the gullals were till the mussuck who had been calling on mrs hauksbee and prided himself upon picking peoples brains explained they were a tribe of ferocious hillmen somewhere near sikkim whose friendship even the great indian empire would find it worth her while to secure now we know that otis yeere had showed mrs hauksbee his ms notes of six years standing on the same gullals he had told her too how sick and shaken with the fever their negligence had bred crippled by the loss of his pet clerk and savagely angry at the desolation in his charge he had once damned the collective eyes of his intelligent local board for a set of haramzadas which act of brutal and tyrannous oppression won him a reprimand royal from the bengal government but in the anecdote as amended for northern consumption we find no record of this hence we are forced to conclude that mrs hauksbee edited his reminiscences before sowing them in idle ears ready as she well knew to exaggerate good or evil and otis yeere bore himself as befitted the hero of many tales  you can talk to me when you dont fall into a brown study talk now and talk your brightest and best said mrs hauksbee  otis needed no spur look to a man who has the counsel of a woman of or above the world to back him so long as he keeps his head he can meet both sexes on equal groundan advantage never intended by providence who fashioned man on one day and woman on another in sign that neither should know more than a very little of the others life such a man goes far or the counsel being withdrawn collapses suddenly while his world seeks the reason  generalled by mrs hauksbee who again had all mrs mallowes wisdom at her disposal proud of himself and in the end believing in himself because he was believed in otis yeere stood ready for any fortune that might befall certain that it would be good he would fight for his own hand and intended that this second struggle should lead to better issue than the first helpless surrender of the bewildered stunt  what might have happened it is impossible to say this lamentable thing befell bred directly by a statement of mrs hauksbee that she would spend the next season in darjiling  are you certain of that said otis yeere  quite were writing about a house now  otis yeere stopped dead as mrs hauksbee put it in discussing the relapse with mrs mallowe  he has behaved she said angrily just like captain kerringtons pony only otis is a donkeyat the last gymkhana planted his forefeet and refused to go on another step polly my mans going to disappoint me what shall i do  as a rule mrs mallowe does not approve of staring but on this occasion she opened her eyes to the utmost  you have managed cleverly so far she said speak to him and ask him what he means  i willat tonights dance  noo not at a dance said mrs mallowe cautiously men are never themselves quite at dances better wait till tomorrow morning  nonsense if hes going to revert in this insane way there isnt a day to lose are you going no then sit up for me theres a dear i shant stay longer than supper under any circumstances  mrs mallowe waited through the evening looking long and earnestly into the fire and sometimes smiling to herself      oh oh oh the mans an idiot a raving positive idiot im sorry i ever saw him  mrs hauksbee burst into mrs mallowes house at midnight almost in tears  what in the world has happened said mrs mallowe but her eyes showed that she had guessed an answer  happened everything has happened he was there i went to him and said now what does this nonsense mean dont laugh dear i cant bear it but you know what i mean i said then it was a square and i sat it out with him and wanted an explanation and he saidoh i havent patience with such idiots you know what i said about going to darjiling next year it doesnt matter to me where i go id have changed the station and lost the rent to have saved this he said in so many words that he wasnt going to try to work up any more becausebecause he would be shifted into a province away from darjiling and his own district where these creatures are is within a days journey  ahhh said mrs mallowe in a tone of one who has successfully tracked an obscure word through a large dictionary  did you ever hear of anything so madso absurd and he had the ball at his feet he had only to kick it i would have made him anything anything in the wide world he could have gone to the worlds end i would have helped him i made him didnt i polly didnt i create that man doesnt he owe everything to me and to reward me just when everything was nicely arranged by this lunacy that spoiled everything  very few men understand your devotion thoroughly  oh polly dont laugh at me i give men up from this hour i could have killed him then and there what right had this manthis thing i had picked out of his filthy paddyfieldsto make love to me  he did that did he  he did i dont remember half he said i was so angry oh but such a funny thing happened i cant help laughing at it now though i felt nearly ready to cry with rage he raved and i stormedim afraid we must have made an awful noise in our kala juggah protect my character dear if its all over simla by tomorrowand then he bobbed forward in the middle of this insanityi firmly believe the mans dementedand kissed me  morals above reproach purred mrs mallowe  so they wereso they are it was the most absurd kiss i dont believe hed ever kissed a woman in his life before i threw my head back and it was a sort of slidy pecking dab just on the end of the chinhere mrs hauksbee tapped her masculine little chin with her fan then of course i was furiously angry and told him that he was no gentleman and i was sorry id ever met him and so on he was crushed so easily that i couldnt be very angry then i came away straight to you  was this before or after supper  oh beforeoceans before isnt it perfectly disgusting  let me think i withhold judgment till tomorrow morning brings counsel  but morning brought only a servant with a dainty bouquet of annandale roses for mrs hauksbee to wear at the dance at viceregal lodge that night  he doesnt seem to be very penitent said mrs mallowe whats the billet doux in the centre  mrs hauksbee opened the neatly folded noteanother accomplishment that she had taught otisread it and groaned tragically  last wreck of a feeble intellect poetry is it his own do you think oh that i ever built my hopes on such a maudlin idiot  no its a quotation from mrs browning and in view of the facts of the case as jack says uncommonly well chosen listen  sweet thou has trod on a heart  pass theres a world full of men and women as fair as thou art  must do such things now and then  thou only hast stepped unaware  malice not one can impute and why should a heart have been there  in the way of a fair womans foot  i didnti didnti didnt  said mrs hauksbee angrily her eyes filling with tears there was no malice at all oh its too vexatious  youve misunderstood the compliment said mrs mallowe he clears you completely andahemi should think by this that he has cleared completely too my experience of men is that when they begin to quote poetry they are going to flit like swans singing before they die you know  polly you take my sorrows in a most unfeeling way  do i is it so terrible if hes hurt your vanity i should say that youve done a certain amount of damage to his heart  oh you never can tell about a man said mrs hauksbee with deep scorn           reviewing the matter as an impartial outsider it strikes me that im about the only person who has profited by the education of otis yeere it comes to twentyseven pages and bittock    at the pits mouth  men say it was a stolen tide  the lord that sent it he knows all but in mine ear will aye abide  the message that the bells let fall and awesome bells they were to me that in the dark rang enderby               jean ingelow  once upon a time there was a man and his wife and a tertium quid  all three were unwise but the wife was the unwisest the man should have looked after his wife who should have avoided the tertium quid who again should have married a wife of his own after clean and open flirtations to which nobody can possibly object round jakko or observatory hill when you see a young man with his pony in a white lather and his hat on the back of his head flying downhill at fifteen miles an hour to meet a girl who will be properly surprised to meet him you naturally approve of that young man and wish him staff appointments and take an interest in his welfare and as the proper time comes give them sugartongs or sidesaddles according to your means and generosity  the tertium quid flew downhill on horseback but it was to meet the mans wife and when he flew uphill it was for the same end the man was in the plains earning money for his wife to spend on dresses and fourhundredrupee bracelets and inexpensive luxuries of that kind he worked very hard and sent her a letter or a postcard daily she also wrote to him daily and said that she was longing for him to come up to simla the tertium quid used to lean over her shoulder and laugh as she wrote the notes then the two would ride to the post office together  now simla is a strange place and its customs are peculiar nor is any man who has not spent at least ten seasons there qualified to pass judgment on circumstantial evidence which is the most untrustworthy in the courts for these reasons and for others which need not appear i decline to state positively whether there was anything irretrievably wrong in the relations between the mans wife and the tertium quid if there was and hereon you must form your own opinion it was the mans wifes fault she was kittenish in her manners wearing generally an air of soft and fluffy innocence but she was deadly learned and evilinstructed and now and again when the mask dropped men saw this shuddered and almost drew back men are occasionally particular and the least particular men are always the most exacting  simla is eccentric in its fashion of tearing friendships certain attachments which have set and crystallized through half a dozen seasons acquire almost the sanctity of the marriage bond and are revered as such again certain attachments equally old and to all appearance equally venerable never seem to win any recognized official status while a chancesprung acquaintance now two months born steps into the place which by right belongs to the senior there is no law reducible to print which regulates these affairs  some people have a gift which secures them infinite toleration and others have not the mans wife had not if she looked over the garden wall for instance women taxed her with stealing their husbands she complained pathetically that she was not allowed to choose her own friends when she put up her big white muff to her lips and gazed over it and under her eyebrows at you as she said this thing you felt that she had been infamously misjudged and that all the other womens instincts were all wrong which was absurd she was not allowed to own the tertium quid in peace and was so strangely constructed that she would not have enjoyed peace had she been so permitted she preferred some semblance of intrigue to cloak even her most commonplace actions  after two months of riding first round jakko then elysium then summer hill then observatory hill then under jutogh and lastly up and down the cart road as far as the tara devi gap in the dusk she said to the tertium quid frank people say we are too much together and people are so horrid  the tertium quid pulled his moustache and replied that horrid people were unworthy of the consideration of nice people  but they have done more than talkthey have writtenwritten to my hubby im sure of it said the mans wife and she pulled a letter from her husband out of her saddlepocket and gave it to the tertium quid  it was an honest letter written by an honest man then stewing in the plains on two hundred rupees a month for he allowed his wife eight hundred and fifty and in a silk banian and cotton trousers it is said that perhaps she had no thought of the unwisdom of allowing her name to be so generally coupled with the tertium quids that she was too much of a child to understand the dangers of that sort of thing that he her husband was the last man in the world to interfere jealously with her little amusements and interests but that it would be better were she to drop the tertium quid quietly and for her husbands sake the letter was sweetened with many pretty little pet names and it amused the tertium quid considerably he and she laughed over it so that you fifty yards away could see their shoulders shaking while the horses slouched along side by side  their conversation was not worth reporting the upshot of it was that next day no one saw the mans wife and the tertium quid together they had both gone down to the cemetery which as a rule is only visited officially by the inhabitants of simla  a simla funeral with the clergyman riding the mourners riding and the coffin creaking as it swings between the bearers is one of the most depressing things on this earth particularly when the procession passes under the wet dank dip beneath the rockcliffe hotel where the sun is shut out and all the hill streams are wailing and weeping together as they go down the valleys  occasionally folk tend the graves but we in india shift and are transferred so often that at the end of the second year the dead have no friendsonly acquaintances who are far too busy amusing themselves up the hill to attend to old partners the idea of using a cemetery as a rendezvous is distinctly a feminine one a man would have said simply let people talk well go down the mall a woman is made differently especially if she be such a woman as the mans wife she and the tertium quid enjoyed each others society among the graves of men and women whom they had known and danced with aforetime  they used to take a big horseblanket and sit on the grass a little to the left of the lower end where there is a dip in the ground and where the occupied graves stop short and the readymade ones are not ready each well regulated india cemetery keeps half a dozen graves permanently open for contingencies and incidental wear and tear in the hills these are more usually babys size because children who come up weakened and sick from the plains often succumb to the effects of the rains in the hills or get pneumonia from their ayahs taking them through damp pinewoods after the sun has set in cantonments of course the mans size is more in request these arrangements varying with the climate and population  one day when the mans wife and the tertium quid had just arrived in the cemetery they saw some coolies breaking ground they had marked out a full size grave and the tertium quid asked them whether any sahib was sick they said that they did not know but it was an order that they should dig a sahibs grave  work away said the tertium quid and lets see how its done  the coolies worked away and the mans wife and the tertium quid watched and talked for a couple of hours while the grave was being deepened then a coolie taking the earth in blankets as it was thrown up jumped over the grave  thats queer said the tertium quid wheres my ulster  whats queer said the mans wife  i have got a chill down my back just as if a goose had walked over my grave  why do you look at the thing then said the mans wife let us go  the tertium quid stood at the head of the grave and stared without answering for a space then he said dropping a pebble down it is nasty and cold horribly cold i dont think i shall come to the cemetery any more i dont think gravedigging is cheerful  the two talked and agreed that the cemetery was depressing they also arranged for a ride next day out from the cemetery through the mashobra tunnel up to fagoo and back because all the world was going to a gardenparty at viceregal lodge and all the people of mashobra would go too  coming up the cemetery road the tertium quids horse tried to bolt up hill being tired with standing so long and managed to strain a back sinew  i shall have to take the mare tomorrow said the tertium quid and she will stand nothing heavier than a snaffle  they made their arrangements to meet in the cemetery after allowing all the mashobra people time to pass into simla that night it rained heavily and next day when the tertium quid came to the trystingplace he saw that the new grave had a foot of water in it the ground being a tough and sour clay  jove that looks beastly said the tertium quid fancy being boarded up and dropped into that well  they then started off to fagoo the mare playing with the snaffle and picking her way as though she were shod with satin and the sun shining divinely the road below mashobra to fagoo is officially styled the himalayanthibet road but in spite of its name it is not much more than six feet wide in most places and the drop into the valley below must be anything between one and two thousand feet  now were going to thibet said the mans wife merrily as the horses drew near to fagoo she was riding on the cliffside  into thibet said the tertium quid ever so far from people who say horrid things and hubbies who write stupid letters with youto the end of the world  a coolie carrying a log of wood came round a corner and the mare went wide to avoid himforefeet in and haunches out as a sensible mare should go  to the worlds end said the mans wife and looked unspeakable things over her near shoulder at the tertium quid  he was smiling but while she looked the smile froze stiff as it were on his face and changed to a nervous grinthe sort of grin men wear when they are not quite easy in their saddles the mare seemed to be sinking by the stem and her nostrils cracked while she was trying to realize what was happening the rain of the night before had rotted the dropside of the himalayanthibet road and it was giving way under her what are you doing said the mans wife the tertium quid gave no answer he grinned nervously and set his spurs into the mare who rapped with her forefeet on the road and the struggle began the mans wife screamed oh frank get off  but the tertium quid was glued to the saddlehis face blue and whiteand he looked into the mans wifes eyes then the mans wife clutched at the mares head and caught her by the nose instead of the bridle the brute threw up her head and went down with a scream the tertium quid upon her and the nervous grin still set on his face  the mans wife heard the tinkletinkle of little stones and loose earth falling off the roadway and the sliding roar of the man and horse going down then everything was quiet and she called on frank to leave his mare and walk up but frank did not answer he was underneath the mare nine hundred feet below spoiling a patch of indian corn  as the revellers came hack from viceregal lodge in the mists of the evening they met a temporarily insane woman on a temporarily mad horse swinging round the corners with her eyes and her mouth open and her head like the head of the medusa she was stopped by a man at the risk of his life and taken out of the saddle a limp heap and put on the bank to explain herself this wasted twenty minutes and then she was sent home in a ladys rickshaw still with her mouth open and her hands picking at her ridinggloves  she was in bed through the following three days which were rainy so she missed attending the funeral of the tertium quid who was lowered into eighteen inches of water instead of the twelve to which he had first objected    a wayside comedy  because to every purpose there is time and judgment therefore the misery of man is great upon him             eccles viii 6  fate and the government of india have turned the station of kashima into a prison and because there is no help for the poor souls who are now lying there in torment i write this story praying that the government of india may be moved to scatter the european population to the four winds  kashima is bound on all sides by the rocktipped circle of the dosehri hills in spring it is ablaze with roses in summer the roses die and the hot winds blow from the hills in autumn the white mists from the hills cover the place as with water and in winter the frosts nip everything young and tender to earthlevel there is but one view in kashimaa stretch of perfectly flat pasture and ploughland running up to the greyblue scrub of the dosehri hills  there are no amusements except snipe and tiger shooting but the tigers have been long since hunted from their lairs in the rockcaves and the snipe only come once a year narkarraone hundred and fortythree miles by roadis the nearest station to kashima but kashima never goes to narkarra where there are at least twelve english people it stays within the circle of the dosehri hills  all kashima acquits mrs vansuythen of any intention to do harm but all kashima knows that she and she alone brought about their pain  boulte the engineer mrs boulte and captain kurrell know this they are the english population of kashima if we except major vansuythen who is of no importance whatever and mrs vansuythen who is the most important of all  you must remember though you will not understand that all laws weaken in a small and hidden community where there is no public opinion when a man is absolutely alone in a station he runs a certain risk of falling into evil ways the risk is multiplied by every addition to the population up to twelve the jurynumber after that fear and consequent restraint begin and human action becomes less grotesquely jerky  there was deep peace in kashima till mrs vansuythen arrived she was a charming woman every one said so everywhere and she charmed every one in spite of this or perhaps because of this since fate is so perverse she cared only for one man and he was major vansuythen had she been plain or stupid this matter would have been intelligible to kashima but she was a fair woman with very still grey eyes the color of a lake just before the light of the sun touches it no man who had seen those eyes could later on explain what fashion of woman she was to look upon the eyes dazzled him her own sex said that she was not bad looking but spoiled by pretending to be so grave and yet her gravity was natural it was not her habit to smile she merely went through life looking at those who passed and the women objected while the men fell down and worshipped  she knows and is deeply sorry for the evil she has done to kashima but major vansuythen cannot understand why mrs boulte does not drop in to afternoon tea at least three times a week when there are only two women in one station they ought to see a great deal of each other says major vansuythen  long and long before ever mrs vansuythen came out of those faraway places where there is society and amusement kurrell had discovered that mrs boulte was the one woman in the world for him andyou dare not blame them kashima was as out of the world as heaven or the other place and the dosehri hills kept their secret well boulte had no concern in the matter he was in camp for a fortnight at a time he was a hard heavy man and neither mrs boulte nor kurrell pitied him they had all kashima and each other for their very very own and kashima was the garden of eden in those days when boulte returned from his wanderings he would slap kurrell between the shoulders and call him old fellow and the three would dine together kashima was happy then when the judgment of god seemed almost as distant as narkarra or the railway that ran down to the sea but the government sent major vansuythen to kashima and with him came his wife  the etiquette of kashima is much the same as that of a desert island when a stranger is cast away there all hands go down to the shore to make him welcome kashima assembled at the masonry platform close to the narkarra road and spread tea for the vansuythens  that ceremony was reckoned a formal call and made them free of the station its rights and privileges when the vansuythens were settled down they gave a tiny housewarming to all kashima and that made kashima free of their house according to the immemorial usage of the station  then the rains came when no one could go into camp and the narkarra road was washed away by the kasun river and in the cuplike pastures of kashima the cattle waded kneedeep the clouds dropped down from the dosehri hills and covered everything  at the end of the rains boultes manner toward his wife changed and became demonstratively affectionate they had been married twelve years and the change startled mrs boulte who hated her husband with the hate of a woman who has met with nothing but kindness from her mate and in the teeth of this kindness had done him a great wrong moreover she had her own trouble to fight withher watch to keep over her own property kurrell for two months the rains had hidden the dosehri hills and many other things besides but when they lifted they showed mrs boulte that her man among men her tedfor she called him ted in the old days when boulte was out of earshotwas slipping the links of the allegiance  the vansuythen woman has taken him mrs boulte said to herself and when boulte was away wept over her belief in the face of the overvehement blandishments of ted sorrow in kashima is as fortunate as love because there is nothing to weaken it save the flight of time mrs boulte had never breathed her suspicion to kurrell because she was not certain and her nature led her to be very certain before she took steps in any direction that is why she behaved as she did  boulte came into the house one evening and leaned against the doorposts of the drawingroom chewing his moustache mrs boulte was putting some flowers into a vase there is a pretence of civilization even in kashima  little woman said boulte quietly do you care for me  immensely said she with a laugh can you ask it  but im serious said boulte do you care for me  mrs boulte dropped the flowers and turned round quickly do you want an honest answer  yees ive asked for it  mrs boulte spoke in a low even voice for five minutes very distinctly that there might be no misunderstanding her meaning when samson broke the pillars of gaza he did a little thing and one not to be compared to the deliberate pulling down of a womans homestead about her own ears there was no wise female friend to advise mrs boulte the singularly cautious wife to hold her hand she struck at boultes heart because her own was sick with suspicion of kurrell and worn out with the long strain of watching alone through the rains there was no plan or purpose in her speaking the sentences made themselves and boulte listened leaning against the doorpost with his hands in his pockets when all was over and mrs boulte began to breathe through her nose before breaking out into tears he laughed and stared straight in front of him at the dosehri hills  is that all be said thanks i only wanted to know you know  what are you going to do said the woman between her sobs  do nothing what should i do kill kurrell or send you home or apply for leave to get a divorce its two days dak into narkarra he laughed again and went on ill tell you what you can do you can ask kurrell to dinner tomorrowno on thursday that will allow you time to packand you can bolt with him i give you my word i wont follow  he took up his helmet and went out of the room and mrs boulte sat till the moonlight streaked the floor thinking and thinking and thinking she had done her best upon the spur of the moment to pull the house down but it would not fall moreover she could not understand her husband and she was afraid then the folly of her useless truthfulness struck her and she was ashamed to write to kurrell saying i have gone mad and told everything my husband says that i am free to elope with you get a dak for thursday and we will fly after dinner there was a coldbloodedness about that procedure which did not appeal to her so she sat still in her own house and thought  at dinnertime boulte came back from his walk white and worn and haggard and the woman was touched at his distress as the evening wore on she muttered some expression of sorrow something approaching to contrition boulte came out of a brown study and said oh that i wasnt thinking about that by the way what does kurrell say to the elopement  i havent seen him said mrs boulte good god is that all  but boulte was not listening and her sentence ended in a gulp  the next day brought no comfort to mrs boulte for kurrell did not appear and the new life that she in the five minutes madness of the previous evening had hoped to build out of the ruins of the old seemed to be no nearer  boulte ate his breakfast advised her to see her arab pony fed in the veranda and went out the morning wore through and at midday the tension became unendurable mrs boulte could not cry she had finished her crying in the night and now she did not want to be left alone perhaps the vansuythen woman would talk to her and since talking opens the heart perhaps there might be some comfort to be found in her company she was the only other woman in the station  in kashima there are no regular callinghours every one can drop in upon every one else at pleasure mrs boulte put on a big terai hat and walked across to the vansuythenss house to borrow last weeks queen the two compounds touched and instead of going up the drive she crossed through the gap in the cactushedge entering the house from the back as she passed through the diningroom she heard behind the purdah that cloaked the drawingroom door her husbands voice sayingbut on my honor on my soul and honor i tell you she doesnt care for me she told me so last night i would have told you then if vansuythen hadnt been with you if it is for her sake that youll have nothing to say to me you can make your mind easy its kurrell  what said mrs vansuythen with an hysterical little laugh kurrell oh it cant be you two must have made some horrible mistake perhaps youyou lost your temper or misunderstood or something things cant be as wrong as you say  mrs vansuythen had shifted her defence to avoid the mans pleading and was desperately trying to keep him to a sideissue  there must be some mistake she insisted and it can be all put right again  boulte laughed grimly  it cant be captain kurrell he told me that he had never taken the least the least interest in your wife mr boulte oh do listen he said he had not he swore he had not said mrs vansuythen  the purdah rustled and the speech was cut short by the entry of a little thin woman with big rings round her eyes mrs vansuythen stood up with a gasp  what was that you said asked mrs boulte never mind that man what did ted say to you what did he say to you what did he say to you  mrs vansuythen sat down helplessly on the sofa overborne by the trouble of her questioner  he saidi cant remember exactly what he saidbut i understood him to say that isbut really mrs boulte isnt it rather a strange question  will you tell me what he said repeated mrs boulte  even a tiger will fly before a bear robbed of her whelps and mrs vansuythen was only an ordinarily good woman she began in a sort of desperation well he said that he never cared for you at all and of course there was not the least reason why he should have andandthat was all  you said he swore he had not cared for me was that true  yes said mrs vansuythen very softly  mrs boulte wavered for an instant where she stood and then fell forward fainting  what did i tell you said boulte as though the conversation had been unbroken you can see for yourself she cares for him the light began to break into his dull mind and he went onand hewhat was he saying to you  but mrs vansuythen with no heart for explanations or impassioned protestations was kneeling over mrs boulte  oh you brute she cried are all men like this help me to get her into my roomand her face is cut against the table oh will you be quiet and help me to carry her i hate you and i hate captain kurrell lift her up carefully and nowgo go away  boulte carried his wife into mrs vansuythens bedroom and departed before the storm of that ladys wrath and disgust impenitent and burning with jealousy kurrell had been making love to mrs vansuythenwould do vansuythen as great a wrong as he had done boulte who caught himself considering whether mrs vansuythen would faint if she discovered that the man she loved had foresworn her  in the middle of these meditations kurrell came cantering along the road and pulled up with a cheery good mornin been mashing mrs vansuythen as usual eh bad thing for a sober married man that what will mrs boulte say  boulte raised his head and said slowly oh you liar  kurrells face changed whats that he asked quickly  nothing much said boulte has my wife told you that you two are free to go off whenever you please she has been good enough to explain the situation to me youve been a true friend to me kurrellold manhavent you  kurrell groaned and tried to frame some sort of idiotic sentence about being willing to give satisfaction but his interest in the woman was dead had died out in the rains and mentally he was abusing her for her amazing indiscretion it would have been so easy to have broken off the thing gently and by degrees and now he was saddled withboultes voice recalled him  i dont think i should get any satisfaction from killing you and im pretty sure youd get none from killing me  then in a querulous tone ludicrously disproportioned to his wrongs boulte addedseems rather a pity that you havent the decency to keep to the woman now youve got her youve been a true friend to her too havent you  kurrell stared long and gravely the situation was getting beyond him  what do you mean he said  boulte answered more to himself than the questioner my wife came over to mrs vansuythens just now and it seems youd been telling mrs vansuythen that youd never cared for emma i suppose you lied as usual what had mrs vansuythen to do with you or you with her try to speak the truth for once in a way  kurrell took the double insult without wincing and replied by another question go on what happened  emma fainted said boulte simply but look here what had you been saying to mrs vansuythen  kurrell laughed mrs boulte had with unbridled tongue made havoc of his plans and he could at least retaliate by hurting the man in whose eyes he was humiliated and shown dishonorable  said to her what does a man tell a lie like that for i suppose i said pretty much what youve said unless im a good deal mistaken  i spoke the truth said boulte again more to himself than kurrell emma told me she hated me she has no right in me  no i suppose not youre only her husband yknow and what did mrs vansuythen say after you had laid your disengaged heart at her feet  kurrell felt almost virtuous as he put the question  i dont think that matters boulte replied and it doesnt concern you  but it does i tell you it does began kurrell shamelessly  the sentence was cut by a roar of laughter from boultes lips kurrell was silent for an instant and then he too laughedlaughed long and loudly rocking in his saddle it was an unpleasant soundthe mirthless mirth of these men on the long white line of the narkarra road  there were no strangers in kashima or they might have thought that captivity within the dosehri hills had driven half the european population mad the laughter ended abruptly and kurrell was the first to speak  well what are you going to do  boulte looked up the road and at the hills nothing said he quietly whats the use its too ghastly for anything we must let the old life go on i can only call you a hound and a liar and i cant go on calling you names forever besides which i dont feel that im much better we cant get out of this place what is there to do  kurrell looked round the ratpit of kashima and made no reply the injured husband took up the wondrous tale  ride on and speak to emma if you want to god knows i dont care what you do  he walked forward and left kurrell gazing blankly after him kurrell did not ride on either to see mrs boulte or mrs vansuythen he sat in his saddle and thought while his pony grazed by the roadside  the whir of approaching wheels roused him mrs vansuythen was driving home mrs boulte white and wan with a cut on her forehead  stop please said mrs boulte i want to speak to ted  mrs vansuythen obeyed but as mrs boulte leaned forward putting her hand upon the splashboard of the dogcart kurrell spoke  ive seen your husband mrs boulte  there was no necessity for any further explanation the mans eyes were fixed not upon mrs boulte but her companion mrs boulte saw the look  speak to him she pleaded turning to the woman at her side oh speak to him tell him what you told me just now tell him you hate him tell him you hate him  she bent forward and wept bitterly while the sais impassive went forward to hold the horse mrs vansuythen turned scarlet and dropped the reins she wished to be no party to such unholy explanations  ive nothing to do with it she began coldly but mrs boultes sobs overcame her and she addressed herself to the man i dont know what i am to say captain kurrell i dont know what i can call you i think youveyouve behaved abominably and she has cut her forehead terribly against the table  it doesnt hurt it isnt anything said mrs boulte feebly that doesnt matter tell him what you told me say you dont care for him oh ted wont you believe her  mrs boulte has made me understand that you werethat you were fond of her once upon a time went on mrs vansuythen  well said kurrell brutally it seems to me that mrs boulte had better be fond of her own husband first  stop said mrs vansuythen hear me first i dont carei dont want to know anything about you and mrs boulte but i want you to know that i hate you that i think you are a cur and that ill never never speak to you again oh i dont dare to say what i think of you youman saisgorahkojanedo  i want to speak to ted moaned mrs boulte but the dogcart rattled on and kurrell was left on the road shamed and boiling with wrath against mrs boulte  he waited till mrs vansuythen was driving back to her own house and she being freed from the embarrassment of mrs boultes presence learned for the second time her opinion of himself and his actions  in the evenings it was the wont of all kashima to meet at the platform on the narkarra road to drink tea and discuss the trivialities of the day major vansuythen and his wife found themselves alone at the gatheringplace for almost the first time in their remembrance and the cheery major in the teeth of his wifes remarkably reasonable suggestion that the rest of the station might be sick insisted upon driving round to the two bungalows and unearthing the population  sitting in the twilight said he with great indignation to the boultes thatll never do hang it all were one family here you must come out and so must kurrell  ill make him bring his banjo so great is the power of honest simplicity and a good digestion over guilty consciences that all kashima did turn out even down to the banjo and the major embraced the company in one expansive grin as he grinned mrs vansuythen raised her eyes for an instant and looked at all kashima her meaning was clear major vansuythen would never know anything he was to be the outsider in that happy family whose cage was the dosehri hills  youre singing villainously out of tune kurrell said the major truthfully pass me that banjo  and he sang in excruciatingwise till the stars came out and all kashima went to dinner        that was the beginning of the new life of kashimathe life that mrs boulte made when her tongue was loosened in the twilight  mrs vansuythen has never told the major and since be insists upon keeping up a burdensome geniality she has been compelled to break her vow of not speaking to kurrell  this speech which must of necessity preserve the semblance of politeness and interest serves admirably to keep alive the flame of jealousy and dull hatred in boultes bosom as it awakens the same passions in his wifes heart mrs boulte hates mrs vansuythen because she has taken ted from her and in some curious fashion hates her because mrs vansuythen and here the wifes eyes see far more clearly than the husbandsdetests ted and tedthat gallant captain and honorable manknows now that it is possible to hate a woman once loved to the verge of wishing to silence her forever with blows above all is he shocked that mrs boulte cannot see the error of her ways  boulte and he go out tigershooting together in all friendship boulte has put their relationship on a most satisfactory footing  youre a blackguard he says to kurrell and ive lost any selfrespect i may ever have had but when youre with me i can feel certain that you are not with mrs vansuythen or making emma miserable  kurrell endures anything that boulte may say to him sometimes they are away for three days together and then the major insists upon his wife going over to sit with mrs boulte although mrs vansuythen has repeatedly de dared that she prefers her husbands company to any in the world from the way in which she clings to him she would certainly seem to be speaking the truth  but of course as the major says in a little station we must all be friendly    the hill of illusion  what rendered vain their deep desire a god a god their severance ruled and bade between their shores to be the unplumbed salt estranging sea             matthew arnold  he tell your jhampanis not to hurry so dear they forget im fresh from the plains  she sure proof that i have not been going out with

middle of her room while her ayahno her husbandit must have been a man threw her clothes at her she then did her hair with her fingers and rubbed her bonnet in the flue under the bed i know she did as well as if i had assisted at the orgy who is she said mrs hauksbee  dont said mrs mallowe feebly you make my head ache im miserable today stay me with fondants comfort me with chocolates for i amdid you bring anything from pelitis  questions to begin with you shall have the sweets when you have answered them who and what is the creature there were at least half a dozen men round her and she appeared to be going to sleep in their midst  delville said mrs mallowe shady delville to distinguish her from mrs jim of that ilk she dances as untidily as she dresses i believe and her husband is somewhere in madras go and call if you are so interested  what have i to do with shigramitish women she merely caught my attention for a minute and i wondered at the attraction that a dowd has for a certain type of man i expected to see her walk out of her clothesuntil i looked at her eyes  hooks and eyes surely drawled mrs mallowe  dont be clever polly you make my head ache and round this hayrick stood a crowd of mena positive crowd  perhaps they also expected  polly dont be rabelaisian  mrs mallowe curled herself up comfortably on the sofa and turned her attention to the sweets she and mrs hauksbee shared the same house at simla and these things befell two seasons after the matter of otis yeere which has been already recorded  mrs hauksbee stepped into the veranda and looked down upon the mall her forehead puckered with thought  hah said mrs hauksbee shortly indeed  what is it said mrs mallowe sleepily  that dowd and the dancing masterto whom i object  why to the dancing master he is a middleaged gentleman of reprobate and romantic tendencies and tries to be a friend of mine  then make up your mind to lose him dowds cling by nature and i should imagine that this animalhow terrible her bonnet looks from aboveis specially clingsome  she is welcome to the dancing master so far as i am concerned i never could take an interest in a monotonous liar the frustrated aim of his life is to persuade people that he is a bachelor  0oh i think ive met that sort of man before and isnt he  no he confided that to me a few days ago ugh some men ought to he killed  what happened then  he posed as the horror of horrorsa misunderstood man heaven knows the femme incomprise is sad enough and had enoughbut the other thing  and so fat too i should have laughed in his face men seldom confide in me how is it they come to you  for the sake of impressing me with their careers in the past protect me from men with confidences  and yet you encourage them  what can i do they talk i listen and they vow that i am sympathetic i know i always profess astonishment even when the plot isof the most old possible  yes men are so unblushingly explicit if they are once allowed to talk whereas womens confidences are full of reservations and fibs except  when they go mad and babble of the unutterabilities after a weeks acquaintance really if you come to consider we know a great deal more of men than of our own sex  and the extraordinary thing is that men will never believe it they say we are trying to hide something  they are generally doing that on their own account alas these chocolates pall upon me and i havent eaten more than a dozen i think i shall go to sleep                                          then youll get fat dear if you took more exercise and a more intelligent interest in your neighbors you would  be as much loved as mrs hauksbee youre a darling in many ways and i like youyou are not a womans womanbut why do you trouble yourself about mere human beings  because in the absence of angels who i am sure would be horribly dull men and women are the most fascinating things in the whole wide world lazy one i am interested in the dowdi am interested in the dancing masteri am interested in the hawley boyand i am interested in you  why couple me with the hawley boy he is your property  yes and in his own guileless speech im making a good thing out of him when he is slightly more reformed and has passed his higher standard or whatever the authorities think fit to exact from him i shall select a pretty little girl the holt girl i think andhere she waved her hands airily whom mrs hauksbee bath joined together let no man put asunder thats all  and when you have yoked may holt with the most notorious detrimental in simla and earned the undying hatred of mamma holt what will you do with me dispenser of the destinies of the universe  mrs hauksbee dropped into a low chair in front of the fire and chin in band gazed long and steadfastly at mrs mallowe  i do not know she said shaking her head what i shall do with you dear its obviously impossible to marry you to some one elseyour husband would object and the experiment might not be successful after all i think i shall begin by preventing you fromwhat is itsleeping on alehouse benches and snoring in the sun  dont i dont like your quotations they are so rude go to the library and bring me new books  while you sleep no if you dont come with me i shall spread your newest frock on my rickshawbow and when any one asks me what i am doing i shall say that i am going to phelpss to get it let out i shall take care that mrs macnamara sees me put your things on theres a good girl  mrs mallowe groaned and obeyed and the two went off to the library where they found mrs delville and the man who went by the nickname of the dancing master by that time mrs mallowe was awake and eloquent  that is the creature said mrs hauksbee with the air of one pointing out a slug in the road  no said mrs mallowe the man is the creature ugh goodevening mr bent i thought you were coming to tea this evening  surely it was for tomorrow was it not answered the dancing master i understoodi fanciedim so sorryhow very unfortunate  but mrs mallowe had passed on  for the practiced equivocator you said he was murmured mrs hauksbee he strikes me as a failure now wherefore should he have preferred a walk with the dowd to tea with us elective affinities i supposeboth grubby polly id never forgive that woman as long as the world rolls  i forgive every woman everything said mrs mallowe he will be a sufficient punishment for her what a common voice she has  mrs delvilles voice was not pretty her carriage was even less lovely and her raiment was strikingly neglected all these things mrs mallowe noticed over the top of a magazine  now what is there in her said mrs hauksbee do you see what i meant about the clothes falling off if i were a man i would perish sooner than be seen with that ragbag and yet she has good eyes butoh  what is it  she doesnt know how to use them on my honor she does not look oh look untidiness i can endure but ignorance never the womans a fool  hsh shell hear you  all the women in simla are fools shell think i mean some one else now shes going out what a thoroughly objectionable couple she and the dancing master make which reminds me do you suppose theyll ever dance together  wait and see i dont envy her the conversation of the dancing master loathly man his wife ought to be up here before long  do you know anything about him  only what he told me it may be a11 a fiction he married a girl bred in the country i think and being an honorable chivalrous soul told me that he repented his bargain and sent her to her mother as often as possiblea person who has lived in the doon since the memory of man and goes to mussoorie when other people go home the wife is with her at present so he says  babies  one only but he talks of his wife in a revolting way i hated him for it he thought he was being epigrammatic and brilliant  that is a vice peculiar to men i dislike him because he is generally in the wake of some girl disappointing the eligibles he will persecute may holt no more unless i am much mistaken  no i think mrs delville may occupy his attention for a while  do you suppose she knows that he is the head of a family  not from his lips he swore me to eternal secrecy wherefore i tell you dont you know that type of man  not intimately thank goodness as a general rule when a man begins to abuse his wife to me i find that the lord gives me wherewith to answer him according to his folly and we part with a coolness between us i laugh  im different ive no sense of humor  cultivate it then it has been my mainstay for more years than i care to think about a welleducated sense of humor will save a woman when religion training and home influences fail and we may all need salvation sometimes  do you suppose that the delville woman has humor  her dress betrays her how can a thing who wears her supplement under her left arm have any notion of the fitness of thingsmuch less their folly if she discards the dancing master after having once seen him dance i may respect her otherwise  but are we not both assuming a great deal too much dear you saw the woman at pelitishalf an hour later you saw her walking with the dancing master an hour later you met her here at the library  still with the dancing master remember  still with the dancing master i admit but why on the strength of that should you imagine  i imagine nothing i have no imagination i am only convinced that the dancing master is attracted to the dowd because he is objectionable in every way and she in every other if i know the man as you have described him he holds his wife in slavery at present  she is twenty years younger than he  poor wretch and in the end after he has posed and swaggered and liedhe has a mouth under that ragged moustache simply made for lieshe will be rewarded according to his merits  i wonder what those really are said mrs mallowe  but mrs hauksbee her face close to the shelf of the new books was humming softly what shall he have who killed the deer she was a lady of unfettered speech  one month later she announced her intention of calling upon mrs delville both mrs hauksbee and mrs mallowe were in morning wrappers and there was a great peace in the land  i should go as i was said mrs mallowe it would be a delicate compliment to her style  mrs hauksbee studied herself in the glass  assuming for a moment that she ever darkened these doors i should put on this robe after all the others to show her what a morning wrapper ought to be it might enliven her as it is i shall go in the dovecoloredsweet emblem of youth and innocenceand shall put on my new gloves  if you really are going dirty tan would be too good and you know that dove color spots with the rain  i care not i may make her envious at least i shall try though one cannot expect very much from a woman who puts a lace tucker into her habit  just heavens when did she do that  yesterdayriding with the dancing master i met them at the back of jakko and the rain had made the lace lie down to complete the effect she was wearing an unclean terai with the elastic under her chin i felt almost too well content to take the trouble to despise her  the hawley boy was riding with you what did he think  does a boy ever notice these things should i like him if he did he stared in the rudest way and just when i thought he had seen the elastic he said theres something very taking about that face i rebuked him on the spot i dont approve of boys being taken by faces  other than your own i shouldnt be in the least surprised if the hawley boy immediately went to call  i forbade him let her be satisfied with the dancing master and his wife when she comes up im rather curious to see mrs bent and the delville woman together  mrs hauksbee departed and at the end of an hour returned slightly flushed  there is no limit to the treachery of youth i ordered the hawley boy as he valued my patronage not to call the first person i stumble overliterally stumble overin her poky dark little drawingroom is of course the hawley boy she kept us waiting ten minutes and then emerged as though he had been tipped out of the dirtyclothes basket you know my way dear when i am all put out i was superior crrrushingly superior lifted my eyes to heaven and had heard of nothingdropped my eyes on the carpet and really didnt know played with my cardcase and supposed so the hawley boy giggled like a girl and i had to freeze him with scowls between the sentences  and she  she sat in a heap on the edge of a couch and managed to convey the impression that she was suffering from stomachache at the very least it was all i could do not to ask after her symptoms when i rose she grunted just like a buffalo in the watertoo lazy to move                                     are you certain  am i blind polly laziness sheer laziness nothing elseor her garments were only constructed for sitting down in i stayed for a quarter of an hour trying to penetrate the gloom to guess what her surroundings were like while she stuck out her tongue  lucy  wellill withdraw the tongue though im sure if she didnt do it when i was in the room she did the minute i was outside at any rate she lay in a lump and grunted ask the hawley boy dear i believe the grunts were meant for sentences but she spoke so indistinctly that i cant swear to it  you are incorrigible simply  i am not treat me civilly give me peace with honor dont put the only available seat facing the window and a child may eat jam in my lap before church but i resent being grunted at wouldnt you do you suppose that she communicates her views on life and love to the dancing master in a set of modulated grmphs  you attach too much importance to the dancing master  he came as we went and the dowd grew almost cordial at the sight of him he smiled greasily and moved about that darkened dogkennel in a suspiciously familiar way  dont be uncharitable any sin but that ill forgive  listen to the voice of history i am only describing what i saw he entered the heap on the sofa revived slightly and the hawley boy and i came away together he is disillusioned hut i felt it my duty to lecture him severely for going there and thats all  now for pitys sake leave the wretched creature and the dancing master alone they never did you any harm  no harm to dress as an example and a stumblingblock for half simla and then to find this person who is dressed by the hand of godnot that i wish to disparage him for a moment but you know the tikkadhurzie way he attires those lilies of the fieldthis person draws the eyes of menand some of them nice men its almost enough to make one discard clothing i told the hawley boy so  and what did that sweet youth do  turned shellpink and looked across the far blue hills like a distressed cherub am i talking wildly polly let me say my say and i shall be calm otherwise i may go abroad and disturb simla with a few original reflections excepting always your own sweet self there isnt a single woman in the land who understands me when i amwhats the word  tetefelee suggested mrs mallowe  exactly and now let us have tiffin the demands of society are exhausting and as mrs delville sayshere mrs hauksbee to the horror of the khitmatgars lapsed into a series of grunts while mrs mallowe stared in lazy surprise  god gie us a gude conceit of oorselves said mrs hauksbee piously returning to her natural speech now in any other woman that would have been vulgar i am consumed with curiosity to see mrs bent i expect complications  woman of one idea said mrs mallowe shortly all complications are as old as the hills i have lived through or near allallall  and yet do not understand that men and women never behave twice alike i am old who was youngif ever i put my head in your lap you dear big sceptic you will learn that my parting is gauzebut never no never have i lost my interest in men and women polly i shall see this business out to the bitter end  i am going to sleep said mrs mallowe calmly i never interfere with men or women unless i am compelled and she retired with dignity to her own room  mrs hauksbees curiosity was not long left ungratified for mrs bent came up to simla a few days after the conversation faithfully reported above and pervaded the mall by her husbands side  behold said mrs hauksbee thoughtfully rubbing her nose that is the last link of the chain if we omit the husband of the delville whoever he may be let me consider the bents and the delvilles inhabit the same hotel and the delville is detested by the waddydo you know the waddywho is almost as big a dowd the waddy also abominates the male bent for which if her other sins do not weigh too heavily she will eventually be caught up to heaven  dont be irreverent said mrs mallowe i like mrs bents face  i am discussing the waddy returned mrs hauksbee loftily the waddy will take the female bent apart after having borrowedyeseverything that she can from hairpins to babies bottles such my dear is life in a hotel the waddy will tell the female bent facts and fictions about the dancing master and the dowd  lucy i should like you better if you were not always looking into peoples back bedrooms  anybody can look into their front drawingrooms and remember whatever i do and whatever i look i never talkas the waddy will let us hope that the dancing masters greasy smile and manner of the pedagogue will soften the heart of that cow his wife if mouths speak truth i should think that little mrs bent could get very angry on occasion  but what reason has she for being angry  what reason the dancing master in himself is a reason how does it go if in his life some trivial errors fall look in his face and youll believe them all i am prepared to credit any evil of the dancing master because i hate him so and the dowd is so disgustingly badly dressed  that she too is capable of every iniquity i always prefer to believe the best of everybody it saves so much trouble  very good i prefer to believe the worst it saves useless expenditure of sympathy and you may be quite certain that the waddy believes with me  mrs mallowe sighed and made no answer  the conversation was holden after dinner while mrs hauksbee was dressing for a dance  i am too tired to go pleaded mrs mallowe and mrs hauksbee left her in peace till two in the morning when she was aware of emphatic knocking at her door  dont be very angry dear said mrs hauksbee my idiot of an ayah has gone home and as i hope to sleep tonight there isnt a soul in the place to unlace me  oh this is too bad said mrs mallowe sulkily  cant help it im a lone lorn grasswidow dear but i will not sleep in my stays and such news too oh do unlace me theres a darling the dowd the dancing masteri and the hawley boyyou know the north veranda  how can i do anything if you spin round like this protested mrs mallowe fumbling with the knot of the laces  oh i forget i must tell my tale without the aid of your eyes do you know youve lovely eyes dear well to begin with i took the hawley boy to a kala juggah  did he want much taking  lots there was an arrangement of looseboxes in kanats and she was in the next one talking to him  which how explain  you know what i meanthe dowd and the dancing master we could hear every word and we listened shamelesslyspecially the hawley boy polly i quite love that woman  this is interesting there now turn round what happened  one moment ahh blessed relief ive been looking forward to taking them off for the last halfhourwhich is ominous at my time of life but as i was saying we listened and heard the dowd drawl worse than ever she drops her final gs like a barmaid or a blueblooded aidedecamp look heere youre gettin too fond 0 me she said and the dancing master owned it was so in language that nearly made me ill the dowd reflected for a while then we heard her say look heere mister bent why are you such an awful liar i nearly exploded while the dancing master denied the charge it seems that he never told her he was a married man  i said he wouldnt  and she had taken this to heart on personal grounds i suppose she drawled along for five minutes reproaching him with his perfidy and grew quite motherly now youve got a nice little wife of your ownyou have she said shes ten times too good for a fat old man like you and look heere you never told me a word about her and ive been thinkin about it a good deal and i think youre a liar wasnt that delicious the dancing master maundered and raved till the hawley boy suggested that he should burst in and beat him his voice runs up into an impassioned squeak when he is afraid the dowd must be an extraordinary woman she explained that had he been a bachelor she might not have objected to his devotion but since he was a married man and the father of a very nice baby she considered him a hypocrite and this she repeated twice she wound up her drawl with an im tellin you this because your wife is angry with me an i hate quarrellin with any other woman an i like your wife you know how you have behaved for the last six weeks you shouldnt have done it indeed you shouldnt youre too old an fat cant you imagine how the dancing master would wince at that now go away she said i dont want to tell you what i think of you because i think you are not nice ill stay heere till the next dance begins did you think that the creature had so much in her  i never studied her as closely as you did it sounds unnatural what happened  the dancing master attempted blandishment reproof jocularity and the style of the lord high warden and i had almost to pinch the hawley boy to make him keep quiet she grunted at the end of each sentence and in the end he went away swearing to himself quite like a man in a novel he looked more objectionable than ever i laughed i love that womanin spite of her clothes and now im going to bed what do you think of it  i shant begin to think till the morning said mrs mallowe yawning perhaps she spoke the truth they do fly into it by accident sometimes  mrs hauksbees account of her eavesdropping was an ornate one but truthful in the main for reasons best known to herself mrs shady delville had turned upon mr bent and rent him limb from limb casting him away limp and disconcerted ere she withdrew the light of her eyes from him permanently being a man of resource and anything but pleased in that he had been called both old and fat he gave mrs bent to understand that he had during her absence in the doon been the victim of unceasing persecution at the hands of mrs delville and he told the tale so often and with such eloquence that he ended in believing it while his wife marvelled at the manners and customs of some women when the situation showed signs of languishing mrs waddy was always on hand to wake the smouldering fires of suspicion in mrs bents bosom and to contribute generally to the peace and comfort of the hotel mr bents life was not a happy one for if mrs waddys story were true he was argued his wife untrustworthy to the last degree if his own statement was true his charms of manner and conversation were so great that he needed constant surveillance and he received it till he repented genuinely of his marriage and neglected his personal appearance mrs delville alone in the hotel was unchanged she removed her chair some six paces toward the head of the table and occasionally in the twilight ventured on timid overtures of friendship to mrs bent which were repulsed  she does it for my sake hinted the virtuous bent  a dangerous and designing woman purred mrs waddy  worst of all every other hotel in simla was full        polly are you afraid of diphtheria  of nothing in the world except smallpox diphtheria kills but it doesnt disfigure why do you ask  because the bent baby has got it and the whole hotel is upside down in consequence the waddy has set her five young on the rail and fled the dancing master fears for his precious throat and that miserable little woman his wife has no notion of what ought to be done she wanted to put it into a mustard bathfor croup  where did you learn all this  just now on the mall dr howlen told me the manager of the hotel is abusing the bents and the bents are abusing the manager they are a feckless couple  well whats on your mind  this and i know its a grave thing to ask would you seriously object to my bringing the child over here with its mother  on the most strict understanding that we see nothing of the dancing master  he will be only too glad to stay away polly youre an angel the woman really is at her wits end  and you know nothing about her careless and would hold her up to public scorn if it gave you a minutes amusement therefore you risk your life for the sake of her brat no loo im not the angel i shall keep to my rooms and avoid her but do as you pleaseonly tell me why you do it  mrs hauksbees eyes softened she looked out of the window and back into mrs mallowes face  i dont know said mrs hauksbee simply  you dear  pollyand for aught you knew you might have taken my fringe off never do that again without warning now well get the rooms ready i dont suppose i shall be allowed to circulate in society for a month  and i also thank goodness i shall at last get all the sleep i want  much to mrs bents surprise she and the baby were brought over to the house almost before she knew where she was bent was devoutly and undisguisedly thankful for he was afraid of the infection and also hoped that a few weeks in the hotel alone with mrs delville might lead to explanations mrs bent had thrown her jealousy to the winds in her fear for her childs life  we can give you good milk said mrs hauksbee to her and our house is much nearer to the doctors than the hotel and you wont feel as though you were living in a hostile camp where is the dear mrs waddy she seemed to be a particular friend of yours  theyve all left me said mrs bent bitterly mrs waddy went first she said i ought to be ashamed of myself for introducing diseases there and i am sure it wasnt my fault that little dora  how nice cooed mrs hauksbee the waddy is an infectious disease herself more quickly caught than the plague and the taker runs presently mad i lived next door to her at the elysium three years ago now see you wont give us the least trouble and ive ornamented all the house with sheets soaked in carbolic it smells comforting doesnt it remember im always in call and my ayahs at your service when yours goes to her meals andand if you cry ill never forgive you  dora bent occupied her mothers unprofitable attention through the day and the night the doctor called thrice in the twentyfour hours and the house reeked with the smell of the condys fluid chlorinewater and carbolic acid washes mrs mallowe kept to her own roomsshe considered that she had made sufficient concessions in the cause of humanityand mrs hauksbee was more esteemed by the doctor as a help in the sickroom than the halfdistraught mother  i know nothing of illness said mrs hauksbee to the doctor only tell me what to do and ill do it  keep that crazy woman from kissing the child and let her have as little to do with the nursing as you possibly can said the doctor id turn her out of the sickroom but that i honestly believe shed die of anxiety she is less than no good and i depend on you and the ayahs remember  mrs hauksbee accepted the responsibility though it painted olive hollows under her eyes and forced her to her oldest dresses mrs bent clung to her with more than childlike faith  i know youll make dora well wont you she said at least twenty times a day and twenty times a day mrs hauksbee answered valiantly of course i will  but dora did not improve and the doctor seemed to be always in the house  theres some danger of the thing taking a bad turn he said ill come over between three and four in the morning tomorrow  good gracious said mrs hauksbee he never told me what the turn would be my education has been horribly neglected and i have only this foolish mother woman to fall back upon  the night wore through slowly and mrs hauksbee dozed in a chair by the fire there was a dance at the viceregal lodge and she dreamed of it till she was aware of mrs bents anxious eyes staring into her own  wake up wake up do something cried mrs bent piteously doras choking to death do you mean to let her die  mrs hauksbee jumped to her feet and bent over the bed the child was fighting for breath while the mother wrung her hands despairing  oh what can i do what can you do she wont stay still i cant hold her why didnt the doctor say this was coming screamed mrs bent wont you help me shes dying  iive never seen a child die before stammered mrs hauksbee feebly and thenlet none blame her weakness after the strain of long watchingshe broke down and covered her face with her hands the ayahs on the threshold snored peacefully  there was a rattle of rickshaw wheels below the clash of an opening door a heavy step on the stairs and mrs delville entered to find mrs bent screaming for the doctor as she ran round the room mrs hauksbee her hands to her ears and her face buried in the chintz of a chair was quivering with pain at each cry from the bed and murmuring thank god i never bore a child oh thank god i never bore a child  mrs delville looked at the bed for an instant took mrs bent by the shoulders and said quietly get me some caustic be quick  the mother obeyed mechanically mrs delville had thrown herself down by the side of the child and was opening its mouth  oh youre killing her cried mrs bent wheres the doctor leave her alone  mrs delville made no reply for a minute but busied herself with the child  now the caustic and hold a lamp behind my shoulder will you do as you are told the acidbottle if you dont know what i mean she said  a second time mrs delville bent over the child mrs hauksbee her face still hidden sobbed and shivered one of the ayahs staggered sleepily into the room yawning doctor sahib come  mrs delville turned her head  youre only just in time she said it was chokin her when i came in an ive burned it  there was no sign of the membrane getting to the airpassages after the last steaming it was the general weakness i feared said the doctor half to himself and he whispered as he looked youve done what i should have been afraid to do without consultation  she was dyin said mrs delville under her breath can you do anythin what a mercy it was i went to the dance  mrs hauksbee raised her head  is it all over she gasped im uselessim worse than useless what are you doing here  she stared at mrs delville and mrs bent realizing for the first time who was the goddess from the machine stared also  then mrs delville made explanation putting on a dirty long glove and smoothing a crumpled and illfitting balldress  i was at the dance an the doctor was tellin me about your baby bein so ill so i came away early an your door was open an ii lost my boy this way six months ago an ive been tryin to forget it ever since an iiiam very sorry for intrudin an anythin that has happened  mrs bent was putting out the doctors eye with a lamp as he stooped over dora  take it away said the doctor i think the child will do thanks to you mrs delville i should have come too late but i assure youhe was addressing himself to mrs delvillei had not the faintest reason to expect this the membrane must have grown like a mushroom will one of you help me please  he had reason for the last sentence mrs hauksbee had thrown herself into mrs delvilles arms where she was weeping bitterly and mrs bent was unpicturesquely mixed up with both while from the tangle came the sound of many sobs and much promiscuous kissing  good gracious ive spoilt all your beautiful roses said mrs hauksbee lifting her head from the lump of crushed gum and calico atrocities on mrs delvilles shoulder and hurrying to the doctor  mrs delville picked up her shawl and slouched out of the room mopping her eyes with the glove that she had not put on  i always said she was more than a woman sobbed mrs hauksbee hysterically and that proves it        six weeks later mrs bent and dora had returned to the hotel mrs hauksbee had come out of the valley of humiliation had ceased to reproach herself for her collapse in an hour of need and was even beginning to direct the affairs of the world as before  so nobody died and everything went off as it should and i kissed the dowd polly i feel so old does it show in my face  kisses dont as a rule do they of course you know what the result of the dowds providential arrival has been  they ought to build her a statueonly no sculptor dare copy those skirts  ah said mrs mallowe quietly she has found another reward the dancing master has been smirking through simla giving every one to understand that she came because of her undying love for himfor himto save his child and all simla naturally believes this  but mrs bent  mrs bent believes it more than any one else she wont speak to the dowd now isnt the dancing master an angel  mrs hauksbee lifted up her voice and raged till bedtime the doors of the two rooms stood open  polly said a voice from the darkness what did that americanheiress globetrottergirl say last season when she was tipped out of her rickshaw turning a corner some absurd adjective that made the man who picked her up explode  paltry said mrs mallowe through her noselike thishaow pahltry  exactly said the voice haow pahltry it all is  which                                                         everything babies diphtheria mrs bent and the dancing master i whooping in a chair and the dowd dropping in from the clouds i wonder what the motive wasall the motives  um  what do you think  dont ask me she was a woman go to sleep                     only a subaltern   not only to enforce by command but to encourage by example the energetic discharge of duty and the steady endurance of the difficulties and privations inseparable from military service bengal army regulations   they made bobby wick pass an examination at sandhurst he was a gentleman before he was gazetted so when the empress announced that gentlemancadet robert hanna wick was posted as second lieutenant to the tyneside tail twisters at kram bokhar he became an officer and a gentleman which is an enviable thing and there was joy in the house of wick where mamma wick and all the little wicks fell upon their knees and offered incense to bobby by virtue of his achievements  papa wick had been a commissioner in his day holding authority over three millions of men in the chotabuldana division building great works for the good of the land and doing his best to make two blades of grass grow where there was but one before of course nobody knew anything about this in the little english village where he was just old mr wick and had forgotten that he was a companion of the order of the star of india  he patted bobby on the shoulder and said well done my boy  there followed while the uniform was being prepared an interval of pure delight during which bobby took brevetrank as a man at the womenswamped tennisparties and teafights of the village and i dare say had his joiningtime been extended would have fallen in love with several girls at once little country villages at home are very full of nice girls because all the young men come out to india to make their fortunes  india said papa wick is the place ive had thirty years of it and begad id like to go back again when you join the tail twisters youll be among friends if every one hasnt forgotten wick of chotabuldana and a lot of people will be kind to you for our sakes the mother will tell you more about outfit than i can but remember this stick to your regiment bobby stick to your regiment youll see men all round you going into the staff corps and doing every possible sort of duty but regimental and you may be tempted to follow suit now so long as you keep within your allowance and i havent stinted you there stick to the line the whole line and nothing but the line be careful how you back another young fools bill and if you fall in love with a woman twenty years older than yourself dont tell me about it thats all   with these counsels and many others equally valuable did papa wick fortify bobby ere that last awful night at portsmouth when the officers quarters held more inmates than were provided for by the regulations and the libertymen of the ships fell foul of the drafts for india and the battle raged from the dockyard gates even to the slums of longport while the drabs of fratton came down and scratched the faces of the queens officers  bobby wick with an ugly bruise on his freckled nose a sick and shaky detachment to manoeuvre inship and the comfort of fifty scornful females to attend to had no time to feel homesick till the malabar reached midchannel when he doubled his emotions with a little guardvisiting and a great many other matters  the tail twisters were a most particular regiment those who knew them least said that they were eaten up with side but their reserve and their internal arrangements generally were merely protective diplomacy some five years before the colonel commanding had looked into the fourteen fearless eyes of seven plump and juicy subalterns who had all applied to enter the staff corps and had asked them why the three stars should he a colonel of the line command a dashed nursery for doubledashed bottlesuckers who put on condemned tin spurs and rode qualified mokes at the hiatused heads of forsaken black regiments he was a rude man and a terrible wherefore the remnant took measures with the halfbutt as an engine of public opinion till the rumor went abroad that young men who used the tail twisters as a crutch to the staff corps had many and varied trials to endure however a regiment had just as much right to its own secrets as a woman  when bobby came up from deolali and took his place among the tail twisters it was gently hut firmly borne in upon him that the regiment was his father and his mother and his indissolubly wedded wife and that there was no crime under the canopy of heaven blacker than that of bringing shame on the regiment which was the bestshooting bestdrilled bestsetup bravest most illustrious and in all respects most desirable regiment within the compass of the seven seas he was taught the legends of the mess plate from the great grinning golden gods that had come out of the summer palace in pekin to the silvermounted markhorhorn snuffmull presented by the last c 0 he who spake to the seven subalterns and every one of those legends told him of battles fought at long odds without fear as without support of hospitality catholic as an arabs of friendships deep as the sea and steady as the fightingline of honor won by hard roads for honors sake and of instant and unquestioning devotion to the regimentthe regiment that claims the lives of all and lives forever  more than once too he came officially into contact with the regimental colors which looked like the lining of a bricklayers hat on the end of a chewed stick bobby did not kneel and worship them because british subalterns are not constructed in that manner indeed he condemned them for their weight at the very moment that they were filling with awe and other more noble sentiments  but best of all was the occasion when he moved with the tail twisters in review order at the breaking of a november day allowing for dutymen and sick the regiment was one thousand and eighty strong and bobby belonged to them for was he not a subaltern of the line the whole line and nothing but the lineas the tramp of two thousand one hundred and sixty sturdy ammunition boots attested he would not have changed places with deighton of the horse battery whirling by in a pillar of cloud to a chorus of strong right strong left or hoganyale of the white hussars leading his squadron for all it was worth with the price of horseshoes thrown in or tick boileau trying to live up to his fierce blue and gold turban while the wasps of the bengal cavalry stretched to a gallop in the wake of the long lollopping walers of the white hussars  they fought through the clear cool day and bobby felt a little thrill run down his spine when he heard the tinkletinkletinkle of the empty cartridge cases hopping from the breechblocks after the roar of the volleys for he knew that he should live to hear that sound in action the review ended in a glorious chase across the plainbatteries thundering after cavalry to the huge disgust of the white hussars and the tyneside tail twisters hunting a sikh regiment till the lean lathy singhs panted with exhaustion bobby was dusty and dripping long before noon but his enthusiasm was merely focused not diminished  he returned to sit at the feet of revere his skipper that is to say the captain of his company and to be instructed in the dark art and mystery of managing men which is a very large part of the profession of arms  if you havent a taste that way said revere between his puffs of his cheroot youll never he able to get the hang of it but remember bobby tisnt the best drill though drill is nearly everything that hauls a regiment through hell and out on the other side its the man who knows how to handle mengoatmen swinemen dogmen and so on  dormer for instance said bobby i think he comes under the head of fool men he mopes like a sick owl  thats where you make your mistake my son dormer isnt a fool yet but hes a dashed dirty soldier and his room corporal makes fun of his socks before kitinspection dormer being twothirds pure brute goes into a corner and growls  how do you know said bobby admiringly  because a company commander has to know these thingsbecause if he does not know he may have crimeay murderbrewing under his very nose and yet not see that its there dormer is being badgered out of his mindbig as he is and he hasnt intellect enough to resent it hes taken to quiet boozing and bobby when the butt of a room goes on the drink or takes to moping by himself measures are necessary to pull him out of himself  what measures man cant run round coddling his men forever  no the men would precious soon show him that he was not wanted youve got tohere the colorsergeant entered with some papers bobby reflected for a while as revere looked through the company forms  does dormer do anything sergeant bobby asked with the air of one continuing an interrupted conversation  no sir does is dooty like a hortomato said the sergeant wbo delighted in long words a dirty soldier and es under full stoppages for new kit its covered with scales sir  scales what scales  fishscales sir es always pokin in the mud by the river an acleanin them muchlyfish with is thumbs revere was still absorbed in the company papers and the sergeant who was sternly fond of bobby continuede generally goes down there when es got is skinful beggin your pardon sir an they do say that the more lush inhebriated e is the more fish e catches they call im the looney fishmonger in the compny sir  revere signed the last paper and the sergeant retreated  its a filthy amusement sighed bobby to himself then aloud to revere are you really worried about dormer  a little you see hes never mad enough to send to a hospital or drunk enough to run in but at any minute he may flare up brooding and sulking as he does he resents any interest being shown in him and the only time i took him out shooting he all but shot me by accident  i fish said bobby with a wry face i hire a countryboat and go down the river from thursday to sunday and the amiable dormer goes with meif you can spare us both  you blazing young fool said revere but his heart was full of much more pleasant words  bobby the captain of a dhoni with private dormer for mate dropped down the river on thursday morningthe private at the bow the subaltern at the helm the private glared uneasily at the subaltern who respected the reserve of the private  after six hours dormer paced to the stern saluted and saidbeg ypardon sir but was you ever on the durhm canal  no said bobby wick come and have some tiffin  they ate in silence as the evening fell private dormer broke forth speaking to himselfhi was on the durhm canal jes such a night come next week twelve month atrailin of my toes in the water he smoked and said no more till bedtime  the witchery of the dawn turned the grey riverreaches to purple gold and opal and it was as though the lumbering dhoni crept across the splendors of a new heaven  private dormer popped his head out of his blanket and gazed at the glory below and around  welldamnmyeyes said private dormer in an awed whisper this ere is like a bloomin gallantryshow for the rest of the day he was dumb but achieved an ensanguined filthiness through the cleaning of big fish  the boat returned on saturday evening dormer had been struggling with speech since noon as the lines and luggage were being disembarked he found tongue  beg ypardon sir he said but would youwould you min shakin ands with me sir  of course not said bobby and he shook accordingly dormer returned to barracks and bobby to mess  he wanted a little quiet and some fishing i think said bobby my aunt but hes a filthy sort of animal have you ever seen him clean them muchly fish with is thumbs  anyhow said revere three weeks later hes doing his best to keep his things clean  when the spring died bobby joined in the general scramble for hill leave and to his surprise and delight secured three months  as good a boy as i want said revere the admiring skipper  the best of the batch said the adjutant to the colonel keep back that young skrimshanker porkiss sir and let revere make him sit up  so bobby departed joyously to simla pahar with a tin box of gorgeous raiment  son of wickold wick of chotabuldana ask him to dinner dear said the aged men  what a nice boy said the matrons and the maids  firstclass place simla oh riippmg said bobby wick and ordered new white cord breeches on the strength of it  were in a had way wrote revere to bobby at the end of two months since you left the regiment has taken to fever and is fairly rotten with ittwo hundred in hospital about a hundred in cellsdrinking to keep off feverand the companies on parade fifteen file strong at the outside theres rather more sickness in the outvillages than i care for hut then im so blistered with pricklyheat that im ready to hang myself whats the yarn about your mashing a miss haverley up there not serious i hope youre overyoung to hang millstones round your neck and the colonel will turf you out of that in doublequick time if you attempt it  it was not the colonel that brought bobby out of simla but a much more to be respected commandant the sick ness in the outvillages spread the bazar was put out of bounds and then came the news that the tail twisters must go into camp the message flashed to the hill stationscholeraleave stopped officers recalled alas for the white gloves in the neatly soldered boxes the rides and the dances and picnics that were to he the loves half spoken and the debts unpaid without demur and without question fast as tongue could fly or pony gallop hack to their regiments and their batteries as though they were hastening to their weddings fled the subalterns  bobby received his orders on returning from a dance at viceregal lodge where he hadbut only the haverley girl knows what bobby had said or how many waltzes he had claimed for the next ball six in the morning saw bobby at the tonga office in the drenching rain the whirl of the last waltz still in his ears and an intoxication due neither to wine nor waltzing in his brain  good man shouted deighton of the horse battery through the mists whar you raise dat tonga im coming with you ow but ive had a head and a half i didnt sit out all night they say the batterys awful bad and he hummed dolorously leave the what at the whatsitsname leave the flock without shelter leave the corpse uninterred leave the bride at the altar   my faith itll be more bally corpse than bride though this journey jump in bobby get on coachman  on the umballa platform waited a detachment of officers discussing the latest news from the stricken cantonment and it was here that bobby learned the real condition of the tail twisters  they went into camp said an elderly major recalled from the whisttables at mussoorie to a sickly native regiment they went into camp with two hundred and ten sick in carts two hundred and ten fever cases only and the balance looking like so many ghosts with sore eyes a madras regiment could have walked through em  but they were as fit as bedamned when i left them said bobby  then youd better make them as fit as bedamned when you rejoin said the major brutally  bobby pressed his forehead against the rainsplashed windowpane as the train lumbered across the sodden doab and prayed for the health of the tyneside tail twisters naini tal had sent down her contingent with all speed the lathering ponies of the dalhousie road staggered into pathankot taxed to the full stretch of their strength while from cloudy darjiling the calcutta mail whirled up the last straggler of the little army that was to fight a fight in which was neither medal nor honor for the winning against an enemy none other than the sickness that destroyeth in the noonday  and as each man reported himself he said this is a bad business and went about his own forthwith for every regiment and battery in the cantonment was under canvas the sickness bearing them company  bobby fought his way through the rain to the tail twisters temporary mess and revere could have fallen on the boys neck for the joy of seeing that ugly wholesome phiz once more  keep em amused and interested said revere they went on the drink poor fools after the first two cases and there was no improvement oh its good to have you back bobby porkiss is anever mind  deighton came over from the artillery camp to attend a dreary mess dinner and contributed to the general gloom by nearly weeping over the condition of his beloved battery porkiss so far forgot himself as to insinuate that the presence of the officers could do no earthly good and that the best thing would be to send the entire regiment into hospital and let the doctors look after them porkiss was demoralized with fear nor was his peace of mind restored when revere said coldly oh the sooner you go out the better if thats your way of thinking any public school could send us fifty good men in your place but it takes time time porkiss and money and a certain amount of trouble to make a regiment spose youre the person we go into camp for eh  whereupon porkiss was overtaken with a great and chilly fear which a drenching in the rain did not allay and two days later quitted this world for another where men do fondly hope allowances are made for the weaknesses of the flesh the regimental sergeantmajor looked wearily across the sergeants mess tent when the news was announced  there goes the worst of them he said itll take the best and then please god itll stop the sergeants were silent till one said it couldnt be him and all knew of whom travis was thinking  bobby wick stormed through the tents of his company rallying rebuking mildly as is consistent with the regulations chaffing the fainthearted haling the sound into the watery sunlight when there was a break in the weather and bidding them be of good cheer for their trouble was nearly at an end scuttling on his dun pony round the outskirts of the camp and heading back men who with the innate perversity of british soldiers were always wandering into infected villages or drinking deeply from rainflooded marshes comforting the panicstricken with rude speech and more than once tending the dying who had no friendsthe men without townies organizing with banjos and burned cork singsongs which should allow the talent of the regiment full play and generally as he explained playing the giddy garden goat all round  youre worth half a dozen of us bobby said revere in a moment of enthusiasm how the devil do you keep it up  bobby made no answer but had revere looked into the breastpocket of his coat he might have seen there a sheaf of badlywritten letters which perhaps accounted for the power that possessed the boy a letter came to bobby every other day the spelling was not above reproach but the sentiments must have been most satisfactory for on receipt bobbys eyes softened marvelously and he was wont to fall into a tender abstraction for a while ere shaking his cropped head he charged into his work  by what power he drew after him the hearts of the roughest and the tail twisters counted in their ranks some rough diamonds indeed was a mystery to both skipper and c o who learned from the regimental chaplain that bobby was considerably more in request in the hospital tents than the reverend john emery  the men seem fond of you are you in the hospitals much said the colonel who did his daily round and ordered the men to get well with a hardness that did not cover his bitter grief  a little sir said bobby  shouldnt go there too often if i were you they say its not contagious but theres no use in running unnecessary risks we cant afford to have you down yknow  six days later it was with the utmost difficulty that the postrunner plashed his way out to the camp with mailbags for the rain was falling in torrents bobby received a letter bore it off to his tent and the programme for the next weeks singsong being satisfactorily disposed of sat down to answer it for an hour the unhandy pen toiled over the paper and where sentiment rose to more than normal tidelevel bobby wick stuck out his tongue and breathed heavily he was not used to letterwriting  beg ypardon sir said a voice at the tent door but dormers orrid bad sir an theyve taken him orf sir  damn private dormer and you too said bobby wick running the blotter over the halffinished letter tell him ill come in the morning  es awful bad sir said the voice hesitatingly there was an undecided squelching of heavy boots  well said bobby impatiently  excusin imself before an for takin the liberty e says it would be a comfort for to assist im sir if  tattoo lao get my pony here come in out of the rain till im ready what blasted nuisances you are thats brandy drink some you want it hang on to my stirrup and tell me if i go mo fast  strengthened by a fourfinger nip which he swallowed without a wink the hospital orderly kept up with the slipping mudstained and very disgusted pony as it shambled to the hospital tent  private dormer was certainly  orrid bad he had all but reached the stage of collapse and was not pleasant to look upon  whats this dormer said bobby bending over the man youre not going out this time youve got to come fishin with me once or twice more yet  the blue lips parted and in the ghost of a whisper saidbeg ypardon sir disturbin of you now but would you min oldin my and sir  bobby sat on the side of the bed and the icy cold hand closed on his own like a vice forcing a ladys ring which was on the little finger deep into the flesh bobby set his lips and waited the water dripping from the hem of his trousers an hour passed and the grasp of the hand did not relax nor did the expression on the drawn face change bobby with infinite craft lit himself a cheroot with the left handhis right arm was numbed to the elbowand resigned himself to a night of pain  dawn showed a very whitefaced subaltern sitting on the side of a sick mans cot and a doctor in the doorway using language unfit for publication  have you been here all night you young ass said the doctor  there or thereabouts said bobby ruefully hes frozen on to me  dormers mouth shut with a click he turned his head and sighed the clinging band opened and bobbys arm fell useless at his side  hell do said the doctor quietly it must have been a tossup all through the night think youre to be congratulated on this case  oh bosh said bobby i thought the man had gone out long agoonlyonly i didnt care to take my hand away rub my arm down theres a good chap what a grip the brute has im chilled to the marrow he passed out of the tent shivering  private dormer was allowed to celebrate his repulse of death by strong waters four days later he sat on the side of his cot and said to the patients mildly id a liken to a spoken to imso i should  but at that time bobby was reading yet another letterhe had the most persistent correspondent of any man in campand was even then about to write that the sickness had abated and in another week at the outside would be gone he did not intend to say that the chill of a sick mans hand seemed to have struck into the heart whose capacities for affection he dwelt on at such length he did intend to enclose the illustrated programme of the forthcoming singsong whereof he was not a little proud he also intended to write on many other matters which do not concern us and doubtless would have done so but for the slight feverish headache which made him dull and unresponsive at mess  you are overdoing it bobby said his skipper might give the rest of us credit of doing a little work you go on as if you were the whole mess rolled into one take it easy  i will said bobby im feeling done up somehow revere looked at him anxiously and said nothing  there was a flickering of lanterns ab3ut the camp that night and a rumor that brought men out of their cots to the tent doors a paddling of the naked feet of dooliebearers and the rush of a galloping horse  wots up asked twenty tents and through twenty tents ran the answer wick es down  they brought the news to revere and he groaned any one but bobby and i shouldnt have cared the sergeantmajor was right  not going out this journey gasped bobby as he was lifted from the doolie not going out this journey then with an air of supreme convictioni cant you see  not if i can do anything said the surgeonmajor who had hastened over from the mess where he had been dining  he and the regimental surgeon fought together with death for the life of bobby wick their work was interrupted by a hairy apparition in a bluegrey dressinggown who stared in horror at the bed and criedoh my gawd it cant be im until an indignant hospital orderly whisked him away  if care of man and desire to live could have done aught bobby would have been saved as it was he made a fight of three days and the surgeonmajors brow uncreased well save him yet he said and the surgeon who though he ranked with the captain had a very youthful heart went out upon the word and pranced joyously in the mud  not going out this journey whispered bobby wick gallantly at the end of the third day  bravo said the surgeonmajor thats the way to look at it bobby  as evening fell a grey shade gathered round bobbys mouth and he turned his face to the tent wall wearily the surgeonmajor frowned  im awfully tired said bobby very faintly whats the use of bothering me with medicine idontwantit let me alone  the desire for life had departed and bobby was content to drift away on the easy tide of death  its no good said the surgeonmajor he doesnt want to live hes meeting it poor child and he blew his nose  half a mile away the regimental band was playing the overture to the sing song for the men had been told that bobby was out of danger the clash of the brass and the wail of the horns reached bobbys ears   is there a single joy or pain  that i should never knoow  you do not love me tis in vain  bid me goodbye and go  an expression of hopeless irritation crossed the boys face and he tried to shake his head  the surgeonmajor bent downwhat is it bobby  not that waltz muttered bobby thats our ownour very ownest own mummy dear  with this he sank into the stupor that gave place to death early next morning  revere his eyes red at the rims and his nose very white went into bobbys tent to write a letter to papa wick which should bow the white head of the ex commissioner of chotabuldana in the keenest sorrow of his life bobbys little store of papers lay in confusion on the table and among them a half finished letter the last sentence ran so you see darling there is really no fear because as long as i know you care for me and i care for you nothing can touch me  revere stayed in the tent for an hour when he came out his eyes were redder than ever         private conklin sat on a turneddown bucket and listened to a not unfamiliar tune private conklin was a convalescent and should have been tenderly treated  ho said private conklin theres another bloomin orfcer dead  the bucket shot from under him and his eyes filled with a smithyful of sparks a tall man in a bluegrey bedgown was regarding him with deep disfavor  you ought to take shame for yourself conky orfcerbloomin orfcer ill learn you to misname the likes of im hangel bloomin hangel thats wot e is  and the hospital orderly was so satisfied with the justice of the punishment that he did not even order private dormer back to his cot                in the matter of a private  hurrah hurrah a soldiers life for me shout boys shout for it makes you jolly and free           the ramrod corps  people who have seen say that one of the quaintest spectacles of human frailty is an outbreak of hysterics in a girls school it starts without warning generally on a hot afternoon among the elder pupils a girl giggles till the giggle gets beyond control then she throws up her head and cries honk honk honk like a wild goose and tears mix with the laughter if the mistress be wise she will rap out something severe at this point to check matters if she be tenderhearted and send for a drink of water the chances are largely in favor of another girl laughing at the afflicted one and herself collapsing thus the trouble spreads and may end in half of what answers to the lower sixth of a boys school rocking and whooping together  given a week of warm weather two stately promenades per diem a heavy mutton and rice meal in the middle of the day a certain amount of nagging from the teachers and a few other things some amazing effects develop at least this is what folk say who have had experience  now the mother superior of a convent and the colonel of a british infantry regiment would be justly shocked at any comparison being made between their respective charges but it is a fact that under certain circumstances thomas in bulk can be worked up into dithering rippling hysteria he does not weep but he shows his trouble unmistakably and the consequences get into the newspapers and all the good people who hardly know a martini from a snider say take away the brutes ammunition  thomas isnt a brute and his business which is to look after the virtuous people demands that he shall have his ammunition to his hand he doesnt wear silk stockings and he really ought to be supplied with a new adjective to help him to express his opinions but for all that he is a great man if you call him the heroic defender of the national honor one day and a brutal and licentious soldiery the next you naturally bewilder him and he looks upon you with suspicion there is nobody to speak for thomas except people who have theories to work off on him and nobody understands thomas except thomas and he does not always know what is the matter with himself  that is the prologue this is the story  corporal slane was engaged to be married to miss jhansi mkenna whose history is well known in the regiment and elsewhere he had his colonels permission and being popular with the men every arrangement had been made to give the wedding what private ortheris called eeklar it fell in the heart of the hot weather and after the wedding slane was going up to the hills with the bride none the less slanes grievance was that the affair would he only a hiredcarriage wedding and he felt that the eeklar of that was meagre miss mkenna did not care so much the sergeants wife was helping her to make her weddingdress and she was very busy slane was just then the only moderately contented man in barracks all the rest were more or less miserable  and they had so much to make them happy too all their work was over at eight in the morning and for the rest of the day they could lie on their backs and smoke canteenplug and swear at the punkahcoolies they enjoyed a fine full flesh meal in the middle of the day and then threw themselves down on their cots and sweated and slept till it was cool enough to go out with their towny whose vocabulary contained less than six hundred words and the adjective and whose views on every conceivable question they had heard many times before  there was the canteen of course and there was the temperance room with the secondhand papers in it but a man of any profession cannot read for eight hours a day in a temperature of 96 degrees or 98 degrees in the shade running up sometimes to 103 degrees at midnight very few men even though they get a pannikin of flat stale muddy beer and hide it under their cots can continue drinking for six hours a day one man tried but he died and nearly the whole regiment went to his funeral because it gave them something to do it was too early for the excitement of fever or cholera the men could only wait and wait and wait and watch the shadow of the barrack creeping across the blinding white dust that was a gay life  they lounged about cantonmentsit was too hot for any sort of game and almost too hot for viceand fuddled themselves in the evening and filled themselves to distension with the healthy nitrogenous food provided for them and the more they stoked the less exercise they took and more explosive they grew then tempers began to wear away and men fell abrooding over insults real or imaginary for they had nothing else to think of the tone of the repartees changed and instead of saying lightheartedly ill knock your silly face in men grew laboriously polite and hinted that the cantonments were not big enough for themselves and their enemy and that there would he more space for one of the two in another place  it may have been the devil who arranged the thing but the fact of the case is that losson had for a long time been worrying simmons in an aimless way it gave him occupation the two had their cots side by side and would sometimes spend a long afternoon swearing at each other but simmons was afraid of losson and dared not challenge him to a fight he thought over the words in the hot still nights and half the hate he felt toward losson be vented on the wretched punkahcoolie  losson bought a parrot in the bazar and put it into a little cage and lowered the cage into the cool darkness of a well and sat on the wellcurb shouting bad language down to the parrot he taught it to say simmons ye sooor which means swine and several other things entirely unfit for publication he was a big gross man and he shook like a jelly when the parrot had the sentence correctly simmons however shook with rage for all the room were laughing at himthe parrot was such a disreputable puff of green feathers and it looked so human when it chattered losson used to sit swinging his fat legs on the side of the cot and ask the parrot what it thought of simmons the parrot would answer simmons ye sooor good boy losson used to say scratching the parrots head ye ear that sim  and simmons used to turn over on his stomach and make answer i ear take eed you dont ear something one of these days  in the restless nights after he had been asleep all day fits of blind rage came upon simmons and held him till he trembled all over while he thought in how many different ways he would slay losson sometimes he would picture himself trampling the life out of the man with heavy ammunitionboots and at others smashing in his face with the butt and at others jumping on his shoulders and dragging the head back till the neckbone cracked then his mouth would feel hot and fevered and he would reach out for another sup of the beer in the pannikin  but the fancy that came to him most frequently and stayed with him longest was one connected with the great roll of fat under lossons right ear he noticed it first on a moonlight night and thereafter it was always before his eyes it was a fascinating roll of fat a man could get his hand upon it and tear away one side of the neck or he could place the muzzle of a rifle on it and blow away all the head in a flash losson had no right to be sleek and contented and welltodo when he simmons was the butt of the room some day perhaps he would show those who laughed at the simmons ye sooor joke that he was as good as the rest and held a mans life in the crook of his forefinger when losson snored simmons hated him more bitterly than ever why should losson be able to sleep when simmons had to stay awake hour after hour tossing and turning on the tapes with the dull liver pain gnawing into his right side and his head throbbing and aching after canteen he thought over this for many nights and the world became unprofitable to him he even blunted his naturally fine appetite with beer and tobacco and all the while the parrot talked at and made a mock of him  the heat continued and the tempers wore away more quickly than before a sergeants wife died of heatapoplexy in the night and the rumor ran abroad that it was cholera men rejoiced openly hoping that it would spread and send them into camp but that was a false alarm  it was late on a tuesday evening and the men were waiting in the deep double verandas for last posts when simmons went to the box at the foot of his bed took out his pipe and slammed the lid down with a bang that echoed through the deserted barrack like the crack of a rifle ordinarily speaking the men would have taken no notice but their nerves were fretted to fiddle strings they jumped up and three or four clattered into the barrackroom only to find simmons kneeling by his box  owl its you is it they said and laughed foolishly  we t h o u g h t twassimmons rose slowly if the accident had so shaken his fellows what would not the reality do  you thought it wasdid you and what makes you think he said lashing himself into madness as he went on to hell with your thinking ye dirty spies  simmons ye sooor chuckled the parrot in the veranda sleepily recognizing a wellknown voice now that was absolutely all  the tension snapped simmons fell back on the armrack deliberatelythe men were at the far end of the roomand took out his rifle and packet of ammunition dont go playing the goat sim said losson put it down but there was a quaver in his voice another man stooped slipped his boot and hurled it at simmonss head the prompt answer was a shot which fired at random found its billet in lossons throat losson fell forward without a word and the others scattered  you thought it was yelled simmons youre drivin me to it i tell you youre drivin me to it get up losson an dont lie shammin thereyou an your blasted parrit that druv me to it  but there was an unaffected reality about lossons pose that showed simmons what he had done the men were still clamoring n the veranda simmons appropriated two more packets of ammunition and ran into the moonlight muttering ill make a night of it thirty rouns an the last for myself take you that you dogs  he dropped on one knee and fired into the brown of the men on the veranda but the bullet flew high and landed in the brickwork with a vicious phat that made some of the younger ones turn pale it is as musketry theorists observe one thing to fire and another to be fired at  then the instinct of the chase flared up the news spread from barrack to barrack and the men doubled out intent on the capture of simmons the wild beast who was heading for the cavalry paradeground stopping now and again to send back a shot and a curse in the direction of his pursuers  ill learn you to spy on me he shouted ill learn you to give me dorgs names come on the ole lot o you colonel john anthony deever cbhe turned toward the infantry mess and shook his rifleyou think yourself the devil of a manbut i tell you that if you put your ugly old carcass outside o that door ill make you the poorestlookin man in the army come out colonel john anthony deever cb come out and see me practiss on the rainge im the crack shot of the ole bloomin battalion in proof of which statement simmons fired at the lighted windows of the messhouse  private simmons e compny on the cavalry pradeground sir with thirty rounds said a sergeant breathlessly to the colonel shootin right and lef sir shot private losson whats to be done sir  colonel john anthony deever cb sallied out only to be saluted by s spurt of dust at his feet  pull up said the second in command i dont want my step in that way colonel hes as dangerous as a mad dog  shoot him like one then said the colonel bitterly if he wont take his chance my regiment too if it had been the towheads i could have under stood  private simmons had occupied a strong position near a well on the edge of the paradeground and was defying the regiment to come on the regiment was not anxious to comply for there is small honor in being shot by a fellowprivate only corporal slane rifle in band threw himself down on the ground and wormed his way toward the well  dont shoot said he to the men round him like as not youll hit me ill catch the beggar livin  simmons ceased shouting for a while and the noise of trapwheels could be heard across the plain major oldyn commanding the horse battery was coming back from a dinner in the civil lines was driving after his usual custom that is to say as fast as the horse could go  a orfcer a blooming spangled orfcer shrieked simmons ill make a scarecrow of that orfcer the trap stopped  whats this demanded the major of gunners you there drop your rifle  why its jerry blazes i aint got no quarrel with you jerry blazes pass frien an alls well  but jerry blazes had not the faintest intention of passing a dangerous murderer he was as his adoring battery swore long and fervently without knowledge of fear and they were surely the best judges for jerry blazes it was notorious had done his possible to kill a man each time the battery went out  he walked toward simmons with the intention of rushing him and knocking him down  dont make me do it sir said simmons i aint got nothing agin you ah you wouldthe major broke into a runtake that then  the major dropped with a bullet through his shoulder and simmons stood over him he had lost the satisfaction of killing losson in the desired way hut here was a helpless body to his hand should be slip in another cartridge and blow off the head or with the butt smash in the white face he stopped to consider and a cry went up from the far side of the paradeground hes killed jerry blazes but in the shelter of the wellpillars simmons was safe except when he stepped out to fire ill blow yer andsome ead off jerry blazes said simmons reflectively six an three is nine an one is ten an that leaves me another nineteen an one for myself he tugged at the string of the second packet of ammunition  corporal slane crawled out of the shadow of a bank into the moonlight  i see you said simmons come a bit furder on an ill do for you  im comm said corporal slane briefly youve done a bad days work sim come out ere an come back with me  come tolaughed simmons sending a cartridge home with his thumb not before ive settled you an jerry blazes  the corporal was lying at full length in the dust of the paradeground a rifle under him some of the lesscautious men in the distance shouted shoot im shoot im slane   you move and or foot slane said simmons an ill kick jerry blazes ead in and shoot you after  i aint movin said the corporal raising his head you darent it a man on is legs let go o jerry blazes an come out o that with your fistes come an it me you darent you bloomin dogshooter  i dare  you lie you mansticker you sneakin sheeny butcher you lie see there slane kicked the rifle away and stood up in the peril of his life come on now  the temptation was more than simmons could resist for the corporal in his white clothes offered a perfect mark  dont misname me shouted simmons firing as he spoke the shot missed and the shooter blind with rage threw his rifle down and rushed at slane from the protection of the well within striking distance he kicked savagely at slanes stomach but the weedy corporal knew something of simmonss weakness and knew too the deadly guard for that kick bowing forward and drawing up his right leg till the heel of the right foot was set some three inches above the inside of the left kneecap he met the blow standing on one legexactly as gonds stand when they meditateand ready for the fall that would follow there was an oath the corporal fell over his own left as shinbone met shinbone and the private collapsed his right leg broken an inch above the ankle  pity you dont know that guard sim said slane spitting out the dust as he rose then raising his voice come an take him orf ive bruk is leg this was not strictly true for the private had accomplished his own downfall since it is the special merit of that legguard that the harder the kick the greater the kickers discomfiture  slane walked to jerry blazes and hung over him with ostentatious anxiety while simmons weeping with pain was carried away  ope you aint urt badly sir said slane the major had fainted and there was an ugly ragged hole through the top of his arm slane knelt down and murmured selp me i believe es dead well if that aint my blooming luck all over  but the major was destined to lead his battery afield for many a long day with unshaken nerve he was removed and nursed and petted into convalescence while the battery discussed the wisdom of capturing simmons and blowing him from a gun they idolized their major and his reappearance on parade brought about a scene nowhere provided for in the army regulations  great too was the glory that fell to slanes share the gunners would have made him drunk thrice a day for at least a fortnight even the colonel of his own regiment complimented him upon his coolness and the local paper called him a hero these things did not puff him up when the major offered him money and thanks the virtuous corporal took the one and put aside the other but he had a request to make and prefaced it with many a beg ypardon sir could the major see his way to letting the slanemkenna wedding be adorned by the presence of four battery horses to pull a hired barouche the major could and so could the battery excessively so it was a gorgeous wedding         wot did i do it for said corporal slane for the orses 0 course jhansi aint a beauty to look at but i wasnt goin to ave a hired turnout jerry blazes if i adnt a wanted something sim might ha blowed jerry blazes blooming ead into hirish stew for aught id a cared  and they hanged private simmonshanged him as high as haman in hollow square of the regiment and the colonel said it was drink and the chaplain was sure it was the devil and simmons fancied it was both but he didnt know and only hoped his fate would be a warning to his companions and half a dozen intelligent publicists wrote six beautiful leading articles on the prevalence of crime in the army  but not a soul thought of comparing the bloodyminded simmons to the squawking gaping schoolgirl with which this story opens    the enlightenments of pagett mp  because half a dozen grasshoppers under a fern make the field ring with their importunate chink while thousands of great cattle reposed beneath the shadow of the british oak chew the cud and are silent pray do not imagine that those who make the noise are the only inhabitants of the fieldthat of course they are many in number or that after all they are other than the little shrivelled meagre hopping though loud and troublesome insects of the hour               burke reflections on the revolution in france  they were sitting in the veranda of the splendid palace of an indian pro consul surrounded by all the glory and mystery of the immemorial east in plain english it was a onestoried tenroomed whitewashed mudroofed bungalow set in a dry garden of dusty tamarisk trees and divided from the road by a low mud wall the green parrots screamed overhead as they flew in battalions to the river for their morning drink beyond the wall clouds of fine dust showed where the cattle and goats of the city were passing afield to graze the remorseless white light of the winter sunshine of northern india lay upon everything and improved nothing from the whining persianwheel by the lawntennis court to the long perspective of level road and the blue domed tombs of mohammedan saints just visible above the trees  a happy new year said orde to his guest its the first youve ever spent out of england isnt it  yes happy new year said pagett smiling at the sunshine what a divine climate you have here just think of the brown cold fog hanging over london now and he rubbed his hands  it was more than twenty years since he had last seen orde his schoolmate and their paths in the world had divided early the one had quitted college to become a cogwheel in the machinery of the great indian government the other more blessed with goods had been whirled into a similar position in the english scheme three successive elections had not affected pagetts position with a loyal constituency and he had grown insensibly to regard himself in some sort as a pillar of the empire whose real worth would be known later on after a few years of conscientious attendance at many divisions after newspaper battles innumerable and the publication of interminable correspondence and more hasty oratory than in his calmer moments he cared to think upon it occurred to him as it had occurred to many of his fellows in parliament that a tour to india would enable him to sweep a larger lyre and address himself to the problems of imperial administration with a firmer hand accepting therefore a general invitation extended to him by orde some years before pagett bad taken ship to karachi and only overnight had been received with joy by the deputycommissioner of amara they had sat late discussing the changes and chances of twenty years recalling the names of the dead and weighing the futures of the living as is the custom of men meeting after intervals of action  next morning they smoked the afterbreakfast pipe in the veranda still regarding each other curiously pagett in a light grey frockcoat and garments much too thin for the time of the year and a puggried sunhat carefully and wonderfully made orde in a shooting coat riding breeches brown cowhide boots with spurs and a battered flax helmet he had ridden some miles in the early morning to inspect a doubtful river dam the mens faces differed as much as their attire ordes worn and wrinkled around the eyes and grizzled at the temples was the harder and more square of the two and it was with something like envy that the owner looked at the comfortable outlines of pagetts blandly receptive countenance the clear skin the untroubled eye and the mobile cleanshaved lips  and this is india said pagett for the twentieth time staring long and intently at the grey feathering of the tamarisks  one portion of india only its very much like this for 300 miles in every direction by the way now that you have rested a littlei wouldnt ask the old question beforewhat dyou think of the country  tis the most pervasive country that ever yet was seen i acquired several pounds of your country coming up from karachi the air is heavy with it and for miles and miles along that distressful eternity of rail theres no horizon to show where air and earth separate  yes it isnt easy to see truly or far in india but you had a decent passage out hadnt you  very good on the whole your angloindian may be unsympathetic about ones political views but he has reduced ship life to a science  the angloindian is a political orphan and if hes wise he wont be in a hurry to be adopted by your party grandmothers but how were your companions unsympathetic  well there was a man called dawlishe a judge somewhere in this country it seems and a capital partner at whist by the way and when i wanted to talk to him about the progress of india in a political sense orde hid a grin which might or might not have been sympathetic the national congress movement and other things in which as a member of parliament im of course interested he shifted the subject and when i once cornered him he looked me calmly in the eye and said thats all tommy rot come and have a game at bull you may laugh but that isnt the way to treat a great and important question and knowing who i was well i thought it rather rude dont you know and yet dawlishe is a thoroughly good fellow  yes hes a friend of mine and one of the straightest men i know i suppose like many angloindians he felt it was hopeless to give you any just idea of any indian question without the documents before you and in this case the documents you want are the country and the people  precisely that was why i came straight to you bringing an open mind to bear on things im anxious to know what popular feeling in india is really like yknow now that it has wakened into political life the national congress in spite of dawlishe must have caused great excitement among the masses  on the contrary nothing could be more tranquil than the state of popular feeling and as to excitement the people would as soon be excited over the rule of three as over the congress  excuse me orde but do you think you are a fair judge isnt the official angloindian naturally jealous of any external influences that might move the masses and so much opposed to liberal ideas truly liberal ideas that he can scarcely be expected to regard a popular movement with fairness  what did dawlishe say about tommy rot think a moment old man you and i were brought up together taught by the same tutors read the same books lived the same life and new languages and work among new races while you more fortunate remain at home why should i change my mindour mindbecause i change my sky why should i and the few hundred englishmen in my service become unreasonable prejudiced fossils while you and your newer friends alone remain bright and openminded you surely dont fancy civilians are members of a primrose league  of course not but the mere position of an english official gives him a point of view which cannot but bias his mind on this question pagett moved his knee up and down a little uneasily as he spoke  that sounds plausible enough but like more plausible notions on indian matters i believe its a mistake youll find when you come to consult the unofficial briton that our fault as a classi speak of the civilian nowis rather to magnify the progress that has been made toward liberal institutions it is of english origin such as it is and the stress of our work since the mutinyonly thirty years agohas been in that direction no i think you will get no fairer or more dispassionate view of the congress business than such men as i can give you but i may as well say at once that those who know most of india from the inside are inclined to wonder at the noise our scarcely begun experiment makes in england  but surely the gathering together of congress delegates is of itself a new thing  theres nothing new under the sun when europe was a jungle half asia flocked to the canonical conferences of buddhism and for centuries the people have gathered at pun hurdwar trimbak and benares in immense numbers a great meeting what you call a mass meeting is really one of the oldest and most popular of indian institutions in this topsyturvy land and though they have been employed in clerical work for generations they have no practical knowledge of affairs a ships clerk is a useful person but he is scarcely the captain and an orderly room writer however smart he may be is not the colonel you see the writer class in india has never till now aspired to anything like command it wasnt allowed to the indian gentleman for thousands of years past has resembled victor hugos noble  un vrai sire chatelain laisse ecrire le vilain sa main digne quand il signe egratigne le velin  and the little egratignures he most likes to make have been scored pretty deeply by the sword  but this is childish and mediaeval nonsense  precisely and from your or rather our point of view the pen is mightier than the sword in this country its otherwise the fault lies in our indian balances not yet adjusted to civilized weights and measures  well at all events this literary class represent the natural aspirations and wishes of the people at large though it may not exactly lead them and in spite of all you say orde i defy you to find a really sound english radical who would not sympathize with those aspirations  pagett spoke with some warmth and he had scarcely ceased when a well appointed dogcart turned into the compound gates and orde rose saying here is edwards the master of the lodge i neglect so diligently come to talk about accounts i suppose  as the vehicle drove up under the porch pagett also rose saying with the trained effusion born of much practice but this is also my friend my old and valued friend edwards im delighted to see you i knew you were in india but not exactly where  then it isnt accounts mr edwards said orde cheerily  why no sir i heard mr pagett was coming and as our works were closed for the new year i thought i would drive over and see him  a very happy thought mr edwards you may not know orde was a leading member of our radical club at switchton when i was beginning political life and i owe much to his exertions theres no pleasure like meeting an old friend except perhaps making a new one i suppose mr edwards you stick to the good old cause  well you see sir things are different out here theres precious little one can find to say against the government which was the main of our talk at home and them that do say things are not the sort o people a man who respects himself would like to be mixed up with there are no politics in a manner of speaking in india its all work  surely you are mistaken my good friend why i have come all the way from england just to see the working of this great national movement  i dont know where youre going to find the nation as moves to begin with and then youll be hard put to it to find what they are moving about its like this sir said edwards who had not quite relished being called my good friend they havent got any grievancenothing to hit with dont you see sir and then theres not much to hit against because the government is more like a kind of general providence directing an oldestablished state of things than that at home where theres something new thrown down for us to fight about every three months  you are probably in your workshops full of english mechanics out of the way of learning what the masses think  i dont know so much about that there are four of us english foremen and between seven and eight hundred native fitters smiths  carpenters painters and such like  and they are full of the congress of course  never hear a word of it from years end to years end and i speak the talk too but i wanted to ask how things are going on at homeold tyler and brown and the rest  we will speak of them presently but your account of the indifference of your men surprises me almost as much as your own i fear you are a backslider from the good old doctrine edwards pagett spoke as one who mourned the death of a near relative  not a bit sir but i should be if i took up with a parcel of baboos pleaders and schoolboys as never did a days work in their lives and couldnt if they tried and if you was to poll us english railway men mechanics tradespeople and the like of that all up and down the country from peshawur to calcutta you would find us mostly in a tale together and yet youd know were the same english you pay some respect to at home at lection time and we have the pull o knowing something about it  this is very curious but you will let me come and see you and perhaps you will kindly show me the railway works and we will talk things over at leisure and about all old friends and old times added pagett detecting with quick insight a look of disappointment in the mechanics face  nodding briefly to orde edwards mounted his dogcart and drove off  its very disappointing said the member to orde who while his friend discoursed with edwards had been looking over a bundle of sketches drawn on grey paper in purple ink brought to him by a chuprassee  dont let it trouble you old chap said orde sympathetically look here a moment here are some sketches by the man who made the carved wood screen you admired so much in the diningroom and wanted a copy of and the artist himself is here too  a native said pagett  of course was the reply bishen singh is his name and he has two brothers to help him when there is an important job to do the three go into partnership but they spend most of their time and all their money in litigation over an inheritance and im afraid they are getting involved thoroughbred sikhs of the old rock obstinate touchy bigoted and cunning but good men for all that here is bishen singhshall we ask him about the congress  but bishen singh who approached with a respectful salaam had never heard of it and he listened with a puzzled face and obviously feigned interest to ordes account of its aims and objects finally shaking his vast white turban with great significance when he learned that it was promoted by certain pleaders named by orde and by educated natives he began with labored respect to explain how he was a poor man with no concern in such matters which were all under the control of god but presently broke out of urdu into familiar punjabi the mere sound of which had a rustic smack of village smokereek and ploughtail as he denounced the wearers of white coats the jugglers with words who filched his field from him the men whose backs were never bowed in honest work and poured ironical scorn on the bengali he and one of his brothers had seen calcutta and being at work there had bengali carpenters given to them as assistants  those carpenters said bishen singh black apes were more efficient workmates and as for the bengali babutchick the guttural click needed no interpretation but orde translated the rest while pagett gazed with interest at the woodcarver  he seems to have a most illiberal prejudice against the bengali said the mp  yes its very sad that for ages outside bengal there should he so bitter a prejudice pride of race which also means racehatred is the plague and curse of india and it spreads far orde pointed with his ridingwhip to the large map of india on the veranda wall  see i begin with the north said he theres the afghan and as a highlander he despises all the dwellers in hindoostanwith the exception of the sikh whom he hates as cordially as the sikh hates him the hindu loathes sikh and afghan and the rajputthats a little lower down across this yellow blot of deserthas a strong objection to put it mildly to the maratha who by the way poisonously hates the afghan lets go north a minute the sindhi hates everybody ive mentioned very good well take less warlike races the cultivator of northern india domineers over the man in the next province and the behari of the northwest ridicules the bengali they are all at one on that point im giving you merely the roughest possible outlines of the facts of course  bishen singh his clean cut nostrils still quivering watched the large sweep of the whip as it traveled from the frontier through sindh the punjab and rajputana till it rested by the valley of the jumna  hate eternal and inextinguishable hate concluded orde flicking the lash of the whip across the large map from east to west as he sat down remember cannings advice to lord granville never write or speak of indian things without looking at a map  pagett opened his eyes orde resumed and the racehatred is only a part of it whats really the matter with bishen singh is classhatred which unfortunately is even more intense and more widely spread thats one of the little drawbacks of caste which some of your recent english writers find an impeccable system  the woodcarver was glad to be recalled to the business of his craft and his eyes shone as he received instructions for a carved wooden doorway for pagett which he promised should be splendidly executed and despatched to england in six months it is an irrelevant detail but in spite of ordes reminders fourteen months elapsed before the work was finished business over bishen singh hung about reluctant to take his leave and at last joining his hands and approaching orde with bated breath and whispering humbleness said he had a petition to make ordes face suddenly lost all trace of expression speak on bishen singh said he and the carver in a whining tone explained that his case against his brothers was fixed for hearing before a native judge and here he dropped his voice still lower till he was summarily stopped by orde who sternly pointed to the gate with an emphatic begone  bishen singh showing but little sign of discomposure salaamed respectfully to the friends and departed  pagett looked inquiry orde with complete recovery of his usual urbanity replied its nothing only the old story he wants his case to be tried by an english judgethey all do thatbut when he began to hint that the other side were in improper relations with the native judge i had to shut him up gunga ram the man he wanted to make insinuations about may not be very bright but hes as honest as daylight on the bench but thats just what one cant get a native to believe  do you really mean to say these people prefer to have their cases tried by english judges  why certainly  pagett drew a long breath i didnt know that before at this point a phaeton entered the compound and orde rose with confound it theres old rasul ali khan come to pay one of his tiresome duty calls im afraid we shall never get through our little congress discussion  pagett was an almost silent spectator of the grave formalities of a visit paid by a punctilious old mahommedan gentleman to an indian official and was much impressed by the distinction of manner and fine appearance of the mohammedan landholder when the exchange of polite banalities came to a pause he expressed a wish to learn the courtly visitors opinion of the national congress  orde reluctantly interpreted and with a smile which even mohammedan politeness could not save from bitter scorn rasul ali khan intimated that he knew nothing about it and cared still less it was a kind of talk encouraged by the government for some mysterious purpose of its own and for his own part he wondered and held his peace  pagett was far from satisfied with this and wished to have the old gentlemans opinion on the propriety of managing all indian affairs on the basis of an elective system  orde did his best to explain but it was plain the visitor was bored and bewildered frankly he didnt think much of committees they had a municipal committee at lahore and had elected a menial servant an orderly as a member he had been informed of this on good authority and after that committees had ceased to interest him but all was according to the rule of government and please god it was all for the best  what an old fossil it is cried pagett as orde returned from seeing his guest to the door just like some old blueblooded hidalgo of spain what does he really think of the congress after all and of the elective system  hates it all like poison when you are sure of a majority election is a fine system but you can scarcely expect the mahommedans the most masterful and powerful minority in the country to contemplate their own extinction with joy the worst of it is that he and his coreligionists who are many and the landed proprietors also of hindu race are frightened and put out by this election business and by the importance we have bestowed on lawyers pleaders writers and the like who have up to now been in abject submission to them they say little but after all they are the most important fagots in the great bundle of communities and all the glib bunkum in the world would not pay for their estrangement they have controlled the land  but i am assured that experience of local selfgovernment in your municipalities has been most satisfactory and when once the principle is accepted in your centres dont you know it is bound to spread and these importantahpeople of yours would learn it like the rest i see no difficulty at all and the smooth lips closed with the complacent snap habitual to pagett mp the man of cheerful yesterdays and confident tomorrows  orde looked at him with a dreary smile  the privilege of election has been most reluctantly withdrawn from scores of municipalities others have had to be summarily suppressed and outside the presidency towns the actual work done has been badly performed this is of less moment perhapsit only sends up the local deathratesthan the fact that the public interest in municipal elections never very strong has waned and is waning in spite of careful nursing on the part of government servants  can you explain this lack of interest said pagett putting aside the rest of ordes remarks  you may find a ward of the key in the fact that only one in every thousand of our population can spell then they are infinitely more interested in religion and caste questions than in any sort of politics when the business of mere existence is over their minds are occupied by a series of interests pleasures rituals superstitions and the like based on centuries of tradition and usage you perhaps find it hard to conceive of people absolutely devoid of curiosity to whom the book the daily paper and the printed speech are unknown and you would describe their life as blank thats a profound mistake you are in another land another century down on the bed rock of society where the family merely and not the community is all important the average oriental cannot be brought to look beyond his clan his life too is more complete and selfsufficing and less sordid and low thoughted than you might imagine it is bovine and slow in some respects but it is never empty you and i are inclined to put the cart before the horse and to forget that it is the man that is elemental not the book the corn and the cattle are all my care and the rest is the will of god why should such folk look up from their immemorially appointed round of duty and interests to meddle with the unknown and fuss with votingpapers how would you atop of all your interests care to conduct even onetenth of your life according to the manners and customs of the papuans lets say thats what it comes to  but if they wont take the trouble to vote why do you anticipate that mohammedans proprietors and the rest would be crushed by majorities of them  again pagett disregarded the closing sentence  because though the landholders would not move a finger on any purely political question they could be raised in dangerous excitement by religious hatreds already the first note of this has been sounded by the people who are trying to get up an agitation on the cowkilling question and every year there is trouble over the mohammedan muharrum processions  but who looks after the popular rights being thus unrepresented  the government of her majesty the queen empress of india in which if the congress promoters are to be believed the people have an implicit trust for the congress circular specially prepared for rustic comprehension says the movement is for the remission of tax the advancement of hindustan and the strengthening of the british government this paper is headed in large lettersmay the prosperity of the empire of india endure  really said pagett that shows some cleverness but there are things better worth imitation in our english methods oferpolitical statement than this sort of amiable fraud  anyhow resumed orde you perceive that not a word is said about elections and the elective principle and the reticence of the congress promoters here shows they are wise in their generation  but the elective principle must triumph in the end and the little difficulties you seem to anticipate would give way on the introduction of a wellbalanced scheme capable of indefinite extension  but is it possible to devise a scheme which always assuming that the people took any interest in it without enormous expense ruinous dislocation of the administration and danger to the public peace can satisfy the aspirations of mr hume and his following and yet safeguard the interests of the mahommedans the landed and wealthy classes the conservative hindus the eurasians parsees sikhs rajputs native christians domiciled europeans and others who are each important and powerful in their way  pagetts attention however was diverted to the gate where a group of cultivators stood in apparent hesitation  here are the twelve apostles hy jovecome straight out of raffaeles cartoons said the mp with the fresh appreciation of a newcomer  orde loth to be interrupted turned impatiently toward the villagers and their leader handing his long staff to one of his companions advanced to the house  it is old jelbo the lumherdar or headman of pind sharkot and a very intelligent man for a villager  the jat farmer had removed his shoes and stood smiling on the edge of the veranda his strongly marked features glowed with russet bronze and his bright eyes gleamed under deeply set brows contracted by lifelong exposure to sunshine his beard and moustache streaked with grey swept from bold cliffs of brow and cheek in the large sweeps one sees drawn by michael angelo and strands of long black hair mingled with the irregularly piled wreaths and folds of his turban the drapery of stout blue cotton cloth thrown over his broad shoulders and girt round his narrow loins hung from his tall form in broadly sculptured folds and he would have made a superb model for an artist in search of a patriarch  orde greeted him cordially and after a polite pause the countryman started off with a long story told with impressive earnestness orde listened and smiled interrupting the speaker at times to argue and reason with him in a tone which pagett could hear was kindly and finally checking the flux of words was about to dismiss him when pagett suggested that he should be asked about the national congress  but jelbo had never heard of it he was a poor man and such things by the favor of his honor did not concern him  whats the matter with your big friend that he was so terribly in earnest asked pagett when he had left  nothing much he wants the blood of the people in the next village who have had smallpox and cattle plague pretty badly and by the help of a wizard a currier and several pigs have passed it on to his own village wants to know if they cant be run in for this awful crime it seems they made a dreadful charivari at the village boundary threw a quantity of spellbearing objects over the border a buffalos skull and other things then branded a chamur what you would call a currieron his hinder parts and drove him and a number of pigs over into jelbos village jelbo says he can bring evidence to prove that the wizard directing these proceedings who is a sansi has been guilty of theft arson cattlekilling perjury and murder but would prefer to have him punished for bewitching them and inflicting smallpox  and how on earth did you answer such a lunatic  lunaticthe old fellow is as sane as you or i and he has some ground of complaint against those sansis  i asked if he would like a native superintendent of police with some men to make inquiries but he objected on the grounds the police were rather worse than smallpox and criminal tribes put together  criminal tribeseri dont quite understand said pagett  we have in india many tribes of people who in the slack antibritish days became robbers in various kind and preyed on the people they are being restrained and reclaimed little by little and in time will become useful citizens but they still cherish hereditary traditions of crime and are a difficult lot to deal with by the way what about the political rights of these folk under your schemes the country people call them vermin but i suppose they would be electors with the rest  nonsensespecial provision would be made for them in a wellconsidered electoral scheme and they would doubtless be treated with fitting severity said pagett with a magisterial air  severity yesbut whether it would be fitting is doubtful even those poor devils have rights and after all they only practice what they have been taught  but criminals orde  yes criminals with codes and rituals of crime gods and godlings of crime and a hundred songs and sayings in praise of it puzzling isnt it  its simply dreadful they ought to be put down at once are there many of them  not more than about sixty thousand in this province for many of the tribes broadly described as criminal are really vagabond and criminal only on occasion while others are being settled and reclaimed they are of great antiquity a legacy from the past the golden glorious aryan past of max muller birdwood and the rest of your spindrift philosophers  an orderly brought a card to orde who took it with a movement of irritation at the interruption and banded it to pagett a large card with a ruled border in red ink and in the centre in schoolboy copper plate mr dma nath give salaam said the civilian and there entered in haste a slender youth clad in a closely fitting coat of grey homespun tight trousers patentleather shoes and a small black velvet cap his thin cheek twitched and his eyes wandered restlessly for the young man was evidently nervous and uncomfortable though striving to assume a free and easy air  your honor may perhaps remember me he said in english and orde scanned him keenly  i know your face somehow you belonged to the shershah district i think when i was in charge there  yes sir my father is writer at shershah and your honor gave me a prize when i was first in the middle school examination five years ago since then i have prosecuted my studies and i am now second years student in the mission college  of course you are kedar naths sonthe boy who said he liked geography better than play or sugar cakes and i didnt believe you how is your father getting on  he is well and he sends his salaam but his circumstances are depressed and he also is down on his luck  you learn english idioms at the mission college it seems  yes sir they are the best idioms and my father ordered me to ask your honor to say a word for him to the present incumbent of your honors shoes the latchet of which he is not worthy to open and who knows not joseph for things are different at shershah now and my father wants promotion  your father is a good man and i will do what i can for him  at this point a telegram was handed to orde who after glancing at it said he must leave his young friend whom he introduced to pagett a member of the english house of commons who wishes to learn about india  orde had scarcely retired with his telegram when pagett began  perhaps you can tell me something of the national congress movement  sir it is the greatest movement of modern times and one in which all educated men like us must join all our students are for the congress  excepting i suppose mahommedans and the christians said pagett quick to use his recent instruction  these are some mere exceptions to the universal rule  but the people outside the college the working classes the agriculturists your father and mother for instance  my mother said the young man with a visible effort to bring himself to pronounce the word has no ideas and my father is not agriculturist nor working class he is of the kayeth caste but he had not the advantage of a collegiate education and he does not know much of the congress it is a movement for the educated youngmanconnecting adjective and noun in a sort of vocal hyphen  ah yes said pagett feeling he was a little off the rails and what are the benefits you expect to gain by it  oh sir everything england owes its greatness to parliamentary institutions and we should at once gain the same high position in scale of nations sir we wish to have the sciences the arts the manufactures the industrial factories with steam engines and other motive powers and public meetings and debates already we have a debating club in connection with the college and elect a mr speaker sir the progress must come you also are a member of parliament and worship the great lord ripon said the youth breathlessly and his black eyes flashed as he finished his commaless sentences  well said pagett drily it has not yet occurred to me to worship his lordship although i believe he is a very worthy man and i am not sure that england owes quite all the things you name to the house of commons you see my young friend the growth of a nation like ours is slow subject to many influences and if you have read your history aright  sir i know it allall norman conquest magna charta runnymede reformation tudors stuarts mr milton and mr burke and i have read something of mr herbert spencer and gibbons decline and fall reynolds mysteries of the court and  pagett felt like one who had pulled the string of a showerbath unawares and hastened to stop the torrent with a question as to what particular grievances of the people of india the attention of an elected assembly should be first directed but young mr dma nath was slow to particularize there were many very many demanding consideration mr pagett would like to hear of one or two typical examples the repeal of the arms act was at last named and the student learned for the first time that a license was necessary before an englishman could carry a gun in england then natives of india ought to be allowed to become volunteer riflemen if they chose and the absolute equality of the oriental with his european fellowsubject in civil status should be proclaimed on principle and the indian army should be considerably reduced the student was not however prepared with answers to mr pagetts mildest questions on these points and he returned to vague generalities leaving the mp so much impressed with the crudity of his views that he was glad on ordes return to say goodbye to his very interesting young friend  what do you think of young india asked orde  curious very curiousand callow  and yet the civilian replied one can scarcely help sympathizing with him for his mere youths sake the young orators of the oxford union arrived at the same conclusions and showed doubtless just the same enthusiasm if there were any political analogy between india and england if the thousand races of this empire were one if there were any chance even of their learning to speak one language if in short india were a utopia of the debatingroom and not a real land this kind of talk might be worth listening to but it is all based on false analogy and ignorance of the facts  but he is a native and knows the facts  he is a sort of english schoolboy but married three years and the father of two weaklings and knows less than most english schoolboys you saw all he is and knows and such ideas as he has acquired are directly hostile to the most cherished convictions of the vast majority of the people  but what does he mean by saying he is a student of a mission college is he a christian  he meant just what he said and he is not a christian nor ever will he be good people in america scotland and england most of whom would never dream of collegiate education for their own sons are pinching themselves to bestow it in pure waste on indian youths their scheme is an oblique subterranean attack on heathenism the theory being that with the jam of secular education leading to a university degree the pill of moral or religious instruction may he coaxed down the heathen gullet  but does it succeed do they make converts  they make no converts for the subtle oriental swallows the jam and rejects the pill but the mere example of the sober righteous and godly lives of the principals and professors who are most excellent and devoted men must have a certain moral value yet as lord lansdowne pointed out the other day the market is dangerously overstocked with graduates of our universities who look for employment in the administration an immense number are employed but year by year the college mills grind out increasing lists of youths foredoomed to failure and disappointment and meanwhile trades manufactures and the industrial arts are neglected and in fact regarded with contempt by our new literary mandarins in posse  but our young friend said he wanted steamengines and factories said pagett  yes he would like to direct such concerns he wants to begin at the top for manual labor is held to be discreditable and he would never defile his hands by the apprenticeship which the architects engineers and manufacturers of england cheerfully undergo and he would be aghast to learn that the leading names of industrial enterprise in england belonged a generation or two since or now belong to men who wrought with their own hands and though he talks glibly of manufacturers he refuses to see that the indian manufacturer of the future will be the despised workman of the present it was proposed for example a few weeks ago that a certain municipality in this province should establish an elementary technical school for the sons of workmen the stress of the opposition to the plan came from a pleader who owed all he had to a college education bestowed on him gratis by government and missions you would have fancied some fine old crusted tory squire of the last generation was speaking these people he said want no education for they learn their trades from their fathers and to teach a workmans son the elements of mathematics and physical science would give him ideas above his business they must be kept in their place and it was idle to imagine that there was any science in wood or iron work and he carried his point but the indian workman will rise in the social scale in spite of the new literary caste  in england we have scarcely begun to realize that there is an industrial class in this country yet i suppose the example of men like edwards for instance must tell said pagett thoughtfully  that you shouldnt know much about it is natural enough for there are but few sources of information india in this as in other respects is like a badly kept ledgernot written up to date and men like edwards are in reality missionaries who by precept and example are teaching more lessons than they know only a few however of their crowds of subordinates seem to care to try to emulate them and aim at individual advancement the rest drop into the ancient indian caste groove  how do you mean asked pagett  well it is found that the new railway and factory workmen the fitter the smith the enginedriver and the rest are already forming separate hereditary castes you may notice this down at jamalpur in bengal one of the oldest railway centres and at other places and in other industries they are following the same inexorable indian law  which means queried pagett  it means that the rooted habit of the people is to gather in small self contained selfsufficing family groups with no thought or care for any interests but their owna habit which is scarcely compatible with the right acceptation of the elective principle  yet you must admit orde that though our young friend was not able to expound the faith that is in him your indian army is too big  not nearly big enough for its main purpose and as a side issue there are certain powerful minorities of fighting folk whose interests an asiatic government is bound to consider arms is as much a means of livelihood as civil employ under government and law and it would be a heavy strain on british bayonets to hold down sikhs jats bilochis rohillas rajputs bhils dogras pathans and gurkhas to abide by the decisions of a numerical majority opposed to their interests leave the numerical majority to itself without the british bayonetsa flock of sheep might as reasonably hope to manage a troop of collies  this complaint about excessive growth of the army is akin to another contention of the congress party they protest against the malversation of the whole of the moneys raised by additional taxes as a famine insurance fund to other purposes you must be aware that this special famine fund has all been spent on frontier roads and defences and strategic railway schemes as a protection against russia  but there was never a special famine fund raised by special taxation and put by as in a box no sane administrator would dream of such a thing in a time of prosperity a finance minister rejoicing in a margin proposed to annually apply a million and a half to the construction of railways and canals for the protection of districts liable to scarcity and to the reduction of the annual loans for public works but times were not always prosperous and the finance minister had to choose whether be would bang up the insurance scheme for a year or impose fresh taxation when a farmer hasnt got the little surplus he hoped to have for buying a new wagon and draining a lowlying field corner you dont accuse him of malversation if he spends what he has on the necessary work of the rest of his farm  a clatter of hoofs was heard and orde looked up with vexation but his brow cleared as a horseman halted under the porch  hello orde just looked in to ask if you are coming to polo on tuesday we want you badly to help to crumple up the krab bokhar team  orde explained that he had to go out into the district and while the visitor complained that though good men wouldnt play duffers were always keen and that his side would probably be beaten pagett rose to look at his mount a red lathered biloch mare with a curious lyrelike incurving of the ears quite a little thoroughbred in all other respects said the mp and orde presented mr reginald burke manager of the siad and sialkote bank to his friend  yes shes as good as they make em and shes all the female i possess and spoiled in consequence arent you old girl said burke patting the mares glossy neck as she backed and plunged  mr pagett said orde has been asking me about the congress what is your opinion burke turned to the m p with a frank smile  well if its all the same to you sir i should say damn the congress but then im no politician but only a business man  you find it a tiresome subject  yes its all that and worse than that for this kind of agitation is anything but wholesome for the country  how do you mean  it would be a long job to explain and sara here wont stand but you know how sensitive capital is and how timid investors are all this sort of rot is likely to frighten them and we cant afford to frighten them the passengers aboard an ocean steamer dont feel reassured when the ships way is stopped and they hear the workmens hammers tinkering at the engines down below the old arks going on all right as she is and only wants quiet and room to move thems my sentiments and those of some other people who have to do with money and business  then you are a thickandthin supporter of the government as it is  why no the indian government is much too timid with its moneylike an old maiden aunt of minealways in a funk about her investments they dont spend half enough on railways for instance and they are slow in a general way and ought to be made to sit up in all that concerns the encouragement of private enterprise and coaxing out into use the millions of capital that lie dormant in the country  the mare was dancing with impatience and burke was evidently anxious to be off so the men wished him goodbye  who is your genial friend who condemns both congress and government in a breath asked pagett with an amused smile  just now he is reggie burke keener on polo than on anything else but if you go to the sind and sialkote bank tomorrow you would find mr reginald burke a very capable man of business known and liked by an immense constituency north and south of this  do you think he is right about the governments want of enterprise  i should hesitate to say better consult the merchants and chambers of commerce in cawnpore madras bombay and calcutta but though these bodies would like as reggie puts it to make government sit up it is an elementary consideration in governing a country like india which must be administered for the benefit of the people at large that the counsels of those who resort to it for the sake of making money should be judiciously weighed and not allowed to overpower the rest they are welcome guests here as a matter of course but it has been found best to restrain their influence thus the rights of plantation laborers factory operatives and the like have been protected and the capitalist eager to get on has not always regarded government action with favor it is quite conceivable that under an elective system the commercial communities of the great towns might find means to secure majorities on labor questions and on financial matters  they would act at least with intelligence and consideration  intelligence yes but as to consideration who at the present moment most bitterly resents the tender solicitude of lancashire for the welfare and protection of the indian factory operative english and native capitalists running cotton mills and factories  but is the solicitude of lancashire in this matter entirely disinterested  it is no business of mine to say i merely indicate an example of how a powerful commercial interest might hamper a government intent in the first place on the larger interests of humanity  orde broke off to listen a moment theres dr lathrop talking to my wife in the drawingroom said he  surely not thats a ladys voice and if my ears dont deceive me an american  exactly dr eva mccreery lathrop chief of the new womens hospital here and a very good fellow forbye good morning doctor he said as a graceful figure came out on the veranda you seem to be in trouble i hope mrs orde was able to help you  your wife is real kind and good i always come to her when im in a fix but i fear its more than comforting i want  you work too hard and wear yourself out said orde kindly let me introduce my friend mr pagett just fresh from home and anxious to learn his india you could tell him something of that more important half of which a mere man knows so little  perhaps i could if id any heart to do it but im in trouble ive lost a case a case that was doing well through nothing in the world but inattention on the part of a nurse i had begun to trust and when i spoke only a small piece of my mind she collapsed in a whining heap on the floor it is hopeless  the men were silent for the blue eyes of the lady doctor were dim recovering herself she looked up with a smile half sad half humorous and i am in a whining heap too but what phase of indian life are you particularly interested in sir  mr pagett intends to study the political aspect of things and the possibility of bestowing electoral institutions on the people  wouldnt it be as much to the purpose to bestow pointlace collars on them they need many things more urgently than votes why its like giving a bread pill for a broken leg  eri dont quite follow said pagett uneasily  well whats the matter with this country is not in the least political but an all round entanglement of physical social and moral evils and corruptions all more or less due to the unnatural treatment of women you cant gather figs from thistles and so long as the system of infant marriage the prohibition of the remarriage of widows the lifelong imprisonment of wives and mothers in a worse than penal confinement and the withholding from them of any kind of education or treatment as rational beings continues the country cant advance a step half of it is morally dead and worse than dead and thats just the half from which we have a right to look for the best impulses  its right here where the trouble is and not in any political considerations whatsoever  but do they marry so early said pagett vaguely  the average age is seven but thousands are married still earlier one result is that girls of twelve and thirteen have to bear the burden of wifehood and motherhood and as might be expected the rate of mortality both for mothers and children is terrible pauperism domestic unhappiness and a low state of health are only a few of the consequences of this then when as frequently happens the boyhusband dies prematurely his widow is condemned to worse than death she may not remarry must live a secluded and despised life a life so unnatural that she sometimes prefers suicide more often she goes astray you dont know in england what such words as infantmarriage baby wife girlmother and virginwidow mean but they mean unspeakable horrors here  well but the advanced political party here will surely make it their business to advocate social reforms as well as political ones said pagett  very surely they will do no such thing said the lady doctor emphatically i wish i could make you understand why even of the funds devoted to the marchioness of dufferins organization for medical aid to the women of india it was said in print and in speech that they would be better spent on more college scholarships for men and in all the advanced parties talkgod forgive themand in all their programmes they carefully avoid all such subjects they will talk about the protection of the cow for thats an ancient superstitionthey can all understand that but the protection of the women is a new and dangerous idea she turned to pagett impulsively  you are a member of the english parliament can you do nothing the foundations of their life are rottenutterly and bestially rotten i could tell your wife things that i couldnt tell you i know the inner life that belongs to the native and i know nothing else and believe me you might as well try to grow goldenrod in a mushroompit as to make anything of a people that are born and reared as thesethese things re the men talk of their rights and privileges i have seen the women that bear these very men and againmay god forgive the men  pagetts eyes opened with a large wonder dr lathrop rose tempestuously  i must be off to lecture said she and im sorry that i cant show you my hospitals but you had better believe sir that its more necessary for india than all the elections in creation  thats a woman with a mission and no mistake said pagett after a pause  yes she believes in her work and so do i said orde ive a notion that in the end it will be found that the most helpful work done for india in this generation was wrought by lady dufferin in drawing attentionwhat work that was by the way even with her husbands great name to back it to the needs of women here in effect native habits and beliefs are an organized conspiracy against the laws of health and happy lifebut there is some dawning of hope now  how dyou account for the general indifference then  i suppose its due in part to their fatalism and their utter indifference to all human suffering how much do you imagine the great province of the punjab with over twenty million people and half a score rich towns has contributed to the maintenance of civil dispensaries last year about seven thousand rupees  thats seven hundred pounds said pagett quickly  i wish it was replied orde but anyway its an absurdly inadequate sum and shows one of the blank sides of oriental character  pagett was silent for a long time the question of direct and personal pain did not lie within his researches he preferred to discuss the weightier matters of the law and contented himself with murmuring theyll do better later on then with a rush returning to his first thought  but my dear orde if its merely a class movement of a local and temporary character how d you account for bradlaugh who is at least a man of sense taking it up  i know nothing of the champion of the new brahmins but what i see in the papers i suppose there is something tempting in being hailed by a large assemblage as the representative of the aspirations of two hundred and fifty millions of people such a man looks through all the roaring and the wreaths and does not reflect that it is a false perspective which as a matter of fact hides the real complex and manifold india from his gaze he can scarcely be expected to distinguish between the ambitions of a new oligarchy and the real wants of the people of whom he knows nothing but its strange that a professed radical should come to be the chosen advocate of a movement which has for its aim the revival of an ancient tyranny shows how even radicalism can fall into academic grooves and miss the essential truths of its own creed believe me pagett to deal with india you want firsthand knowledge and experience i wish he would come and live here for a couple of years or so  is not this rather an ad hominem style of argument  cant help it in a case like this indeed i am not sure you ought not to go further and weigh the whole character and quality and upbringing of the man you must admit that the monumental complacency with which he trotted out his ingenious little constitution for india showed a strange want of imagination and the sense of humor  no i dont quite admit it said pagett  well you know him and i dont but thats how it strikes a stranger he turned on his heel and paced the veranda thoughtfully and after all the burden of the actual daily unromantic toil falls on the shoulders of the men out here and not on his own he enjoys all the privileges of recommendation without responsibility and wewell perhaps when youve seen a little more of india youll understand to begin with our death rates five times higher than yoursi speak now for the brutal bureaucratand we work on the refuse of workedout cities and exhausted civilizations among the bones of the dead in the case of the congress meetings the only notable fact is that the priests of the altar are british not buddhist jain or brahminical and that the whole thing is a british contrivance kept alive by the efforts of messrs hume eardley norton and digby  you mean to say then its not a spontaneous movement  what movement was ever spontaneous in any true sense of the word this seems to be more factitious than usual you seem to know a great deal about it try it by the touchstone of subscriptions a coarse but fairly trustworthy criterion and there is scarcely the color of money in it the delegates write from england that they are out of pocket for working expenses railway fares and stationerythe mere pasteboard and scaffolding of their show it is in fact collapsing from mere financial inanition  but you cannot deny that the people of india who are perhaps too poor to subscribe are mentally and morally moved by the agitation pagett insisted  that is precisely what i do deny the native side of the movement is the work of a limited class a microscopic minority as lord dufferin described it when compared with the people proper but still a very interesting class seeing that it is of our own creation it is composed almost entirely of those of the literary or clerkly castes who have received an english education  surely thats a very important class its members must be the ordained leaders of popular thought  anywhere else they might be leaders but they have no social weight here  pagett laughed thats an epigrammatic way of putting it orde  is it lets see said the deputy commissioner of amara striding into the sunshine toward a halfnaked gardener potting roses he took the mans hoe and went to a rainscarped bank at the bottom of the garden  come here pagett he said and cut at the sunbaked soil after three strokes there rolled from under the blade of the hoe the half of a clanking skeleton that settled at pagetts feet in an unseemly jumble of bones the mp drew back  our houses are built on cemeteries said orde there are scores of thousands of graves within ten miles  pagett was contemplating the skull with the awed fascination of a man who has but little to do with the dead indias a very curious place said he after a pause  ah youll know all about it in three months come in to lunch said orde     volume v plain tales from the hills   lispeth  look you have cast out love what gods are these   you bid me please the three in one the one in three not so   to my own gods i go it may be they shall give me greater ease than your cold christ and tangled trinities          the convert  she was the daughter of sonoo a hillman and jadeh his wife one year their maize failed and two bears spent the night in their only poppyfield just above the sutlej valley on the kotgarh side so next season they turned christian and brought their baby to the mission to be baptized the kotgarh chaplain christened her elizabeth and lispeth is the hill or pahari pronunciation  later cholera came into the kotgarh valley and carried off sonoo and jadeh and lispeth became halfservant halfcompanion to the wife of the then chaplain of kotgarh this was after the reign of the moravian missionaries but before kotgarh had quite forgotten her title of mistress of the northern hills  whether christianity improved lispeth or whether the gods of her own people would have done as much for her under any circumstances i do not know but she grew very lovely when a hill girl grows lovely she is worth traveling fifty miles over bad ground to look upon lispeth had a greek faceone of those faces people paint so often and see so seldom she was of a pale ivory color and for her race extremely tall also she possessed eyes that were wonderful and had she not been dressed in the abominable printcloths affected by missions you would meeting her on the hillside unexpectedly have thought her the original diana of the romans going out to slay  lispeth took to christianity readily and did not abandon it when she reached womanhood as do some hill girls her own people hated her because she had they said become a memsahib and washed herself daily and the chaplains wife did not know what to do with her somehow one cannot ask a stately goddess five foot ten in her shoes to clean plates and dishes so she played with the chaplains children and took classes in the sunday school and read all the books in the house and grew more and more beautiful like the princesses in fairy tales the chaplains wife said that the girl ought to take service in simla as a nurse or something genteel but lispeth did not want to take service she was very happy where she was  when travellersthere were not many in those yearscame to kotgarh lispeth used to lock herself into her own room for fear they might take her away to simla or somewhere out into the unknown world  one day a few months after she was seventeen years old lispeth went out for a walk she did not walk in the manner of english ladiesa mile and a half out and a ride back again she covered between twenty and thirty miles in her little constitutionals all about and about between kotgarh and narkunda this time she came back at full dusk stepping down the breakneck descent into kotgarh with something heavy in her arms the chaplains wife was dozing in the drawingroom when lispeth came in breathing hard and very exhausted with her burden lispeth put it down on the sofa and said simply  this is my husband i found him on the bagi road he has hurt himself we will nurse him and when he is well your husband shall marry him to me  this was the first mention lispeth had ever made of her matrimonial views and the chaplains wife shrieked with horror however the man on the sofa needed attention first he was a young englishman and his head had been cut to the bone by something jagged lispeth said she had found him down the khud so she had brought him in  he was breathing queerly and was unconscious  he was put to bed and tended by the chaplain who knew something of medicine and lispeth waited outside the door in case she could be useful she explained to the chaplain that this was the man she meant to marry and the chaplain and his wife lectured her severely on the impropriety of her conduct lispeth listened quietly and repeated her first proposition it takes a great deal of christianity to wipe out uncivilized eastern instincts such as falling in love at first sight lispeth having found the man she worshipped did not see why she should keep silent as to her choice she had no intention of being sent away either she was going to nurse that englishman until he was well enough to marry her this was her little programme  after a fortnight of slight fever and inflammation the englishman recovered coherence and thanked the chaplain and his wife and lispethespecially lispethfor their kindness he was a traveller in the east he saidthey never talked about globetrotters in those days when the p  o fleet was young and smalland had come from dehra dun to hunt for plants and butterflies among the simla hills no one at simla therefore knew anything about him he fancied he must have fallen over the cliff while stalking a fern on a rotten treetrunk and that his coolies must have stolen his baggage and fled he thought he would go back to simla when he was a little stronger he desired no more mountaineering  he made small haste to go away and recovered his strength slowly  lispeth objected to being advised either by the chaplain or his wife so the latter spoke to the englishman and told him how matters stood in lispeths heart he laughed a good deal and said it was very pretty and romantic a perfect idyl of the himalayas but as he was engaged to a girl at home he fancied that nothing would happen certainly he would behave with discretion he did that still he found it very pleasant to talk to lispeth and walk with lispeth and say nice things to her and call her pet names while he was getting strong enough to go away it meant nothing at all to him and everything in the world to lispeth she was very happy while the fortnight lasted because she had found a man to love  being a savage by birth she took no trouble to hide her feelings and the englishman was amused when he went away lispeth walked with him up the hill as far as narkunda very troubled and very miserable the chaplains wife being a good christian and disliking anything in the shape of fuss or scandal lispeth was beyond her management entirelyhad told the englishman to tell lispeth that he was coming back to marry her she is but a child you know and i fear at heart a heathen said the chaplains wife so all the twelve miles up the hill the englishman with his arm around lispeths waist was assuring the girl that he would come back and marry her and lispeth made him promise over and over again she wept on the narkunda ridge till he had passed out of sight along the muttiani path  then she dried her tears and went in to kotgarh again and said to the chaplains wife he will come back and marry me he has gone to his own people to tell them so and the chaplains wife soothed lispeth and said he will come back at the end of two months lispeth grew impatient and was told that the englishman had gone over the seas to england she knew where england was because she had read little geography primers but of course she had no conception of the nature of the sea being a hill girl  there was an old puzzlemap of the world in the house lispeth had played with it when she was a child she unearthed it again and put it together of evenings and cried to herself and tried to imagine where her englishman was as she had no ideas of distance or steamboats her notions were somewhat erroneous it would not have made the least difference had she been perfectly correct for the englishman had no intention of coming back to marry a hill girl he forgot all about her by the time he was butterflyhunting in assam he wrote a book on the east afterwards lispeths name did not appear  at the end of three months lispeth made daily pilgrimage to narkunda to see if her englishman was coming along the road it gave her comfort and the chaplains wife finding her happier thought that she was getting over her barbarous and most indelicate folly a little later the walks ceased to help lispeth and her temper grew very bad the chaplains wife thought this a profitable time to let her know the real state of affairsthat the englishman had only promised his love to keep her quietthat he had never meant anything and that it was wrong and improper of lispeth to think of marriage with an englishman who was of a superior clay besides being promised in marriage to a girl of his own people lispeth said that all this was clearly impossible because he had said he loved her and the chaplains wife had with her own lips asserted that the englishman was coming back  how can what he and you said be untrue asked lispeth  we said it as an excuse to keep you quiet child said the chaplains wife  then you have lied to me said lispeth you and he  the chaplains wife bowed her head and said nothing lispeth was silent too for a little time then she went out down the valley and returned in the dress of a hill girlinfamously dirty but without the nose and ear rings she had her hair braided into the long pigtail helped out with black thread that hill women wear  i am going back to my own people said she you have killed lispeth there is only left old jadehs daughterthe daughter of a pahari and the servant of tarka devi you are all liars you english  by the time that the chaplains wife had recovered from the shock of the announcement that lispeth had verted to her mothers gods the girl had gone and she never came back  she took to her own unclean people savagely as if to make up the arrears of the life she had stepped out of and in a little time she married a wood cutter who beat her after the manner of paharis and her beauty faded soon  there is no law whereby you can account for the vagaries of the heathen said the chaplains wife and i believe that lispeth was always at heart an infidel seeing she had been taken into the church of england at the mature age of five weeks this statement does not do credit to the chaplains wife  lispeth was a very old woman when she died she always had a perfect command of english and when she was sufficiently drunk could sometimes be induced to tell the story of her first loveaffair  it was hard then to realize that the bleared wrinkled creature so like a wisp of charred rag could ever have been lispeth of the kotgarh mission    three andan extra  when halter and heel ropes are slipped do not give chase with sticks but with gram          punjabi proverb  after marriage arrives a reaction sometimes a big sometimes a little one but it comes sooner or later and must be tided over by both parties if they desire the rest of their lives to go with the current  in the case of the cusackbremmils this reaction did not set in till the third year after the wedding bremmil was hard to hold at the best of times but he was a beautiful husband until the baby died and mrs bremmil wore black and grew thin and mourned as if the bottom of the universe had fallen out perhaps bremmil ought to have comforted her he tried to do so i think but the more he comforted the more mrs bremmil grieved and consequently the more uncomfortable bremmil grew the fact was that they both needed a tonic and they got it mrs bremmil can afford to laugh now but it was no laughing matter to her at the time  you see mrs hauksbee appeared on the horizon and where she existed was fair chance of trouble at simla her byename was the stormy petrel she had won that title five times to my own certain knowledge she was a little brown thin almost skinny woman with big rolling violetblue eyes and the sweetest manners in the world you had only to mention her name at afternoon teas for every woman in the room to rise up and call herwellnot blessed she was clever witty brilliant and sparkling beyond most of her kind but possessed of many devils of malice and mischievousness she could be nice though even to her own sex but that is another story  bremmil went off at score after the babys death and the general discomfort that followed and mrs hauksbee annexed him she took no pleasure in hiding her captives she annexed him publicly and saw that the public saw it he rode with her and walked with her and talked with her and picnicked with her and tiffined at pelitis with her till people put up their eyebrows and said shocking mrs bremmil stayed at home turning over the dead babys frocks and crying into the empty cradle she did not care to do anything else but some eight dear affectionate ladyfriends explained the situation at length to her in case she should miss the cream of it mrs bremmil listened quietly and thanked them for their good offices she was not as clever as mrs hauksbee but she was no fool she kept her own counsel and did not speak to bremmil of what she had heard this is worth remembering speaking to or crying over a husband never did any good yet  when bremmil was at home which was not often he was more affectionate than usual and that showed his hand the affection was forced partly to soothe his own conscience and partly to soothe mrs bremmil it failed in both regards  then the adc in waiting was commanded by their excellencies lord and lady lytton to invite mr and mrs cusackbremmil to peterhoff on july 26th at 930 p mdancing in the bottomlefthand corner  i cant go said mrs bremmil it is too soon after poor little florrie but it need not stop you tom  she meant what she said then and bremmil said that he would go just to put in an appearance here he spoke the thing which was not and mrs bremmil knew it she guesseda womans guess is much more accurate than a mans certainty that he had meant to go from the first and with mrs hauksbee she sat down to think and the outcome of her thoughts was that the memory of a dead child was worth considerably less than the affections of a living husband  she made her plan and staked her all upon it in that hour she discovered that she knew tom bremmil thoroughly and this knowledge she acted on  tom said she i shall be dining out at the longmores on the evening of the 26th youd better dine at the club  this saved bremmil from making an excuse to get away and dine with mrs hauksbee so he was grateful and felt small and mean at the same timewhich was wholesome bremmil left the house at five for a ride about halfpast five in the evening a large leathercovered basket came in from phelps for mrs bremmil she was a woman who knew how to dress and she had not spent a week on designing that dress and having it gored and hemmed and herringboned and tucked and rucked or whatever the terms are for nothing it was a gorgeous dressslight mourning i cant describe it but it was what the queen calls a creationa thing that hit you straight between the eyes and made you gasp she had not much heart for what she was going to do but as she glanced at the long mirror she had the satisfaction of knowing that she had never looked so well in her life she was a large blonde and when she chose carried herself superbly  after the dinner at the longmores she went on to the dancea little late and encountered bremmil with mrs hauksbee on his arm  that made her flush and as the men crowded round her for dances she looked magnificent she filled up all her dances except three and those she left blank mrs hauksbee caught her eye once and she knew it was warreal war between them she started handicapped in the struggle for she had ordered bremmil about just the least little bit in the world too much and he was beginning to resent it moreover he had never seen his wife look so lovely  he stared at her from doorways and glared at her from passages as she went about with her partners and the more he stared the more taken was he he could scarcely believe that this was the woman with the red eyes and the black stuff gown who used to weep over the eggs at breakfast  mrs hauksbee did her best to hold him in play but after two dances he crossed over to his wife and asked for a dance  im afraid youve come too late mister bremmil she said with her eyes twinkling  then he begged her to give him a dance and as a great favor she allowed him the fifth waltz luckily it stood vacant on his programme they danced it together and there was a little flutter round the room bremmil had a sort of notion that his wife could dance but he never knew she danced so divinely at the end of that waltz he asked for anotheras a favor not as a right and mrs bremmil said show me your programme dear he showed it as a naughty little schoolboy hands up contraband sweets to a master  there was a fair sprinkling of h on it besides h at supper  mrs bremmil said nothing but she smiled contemptuously ran her pencil through 7 and 9two hsand returned the card with her own name written abovea pet name that only she and her husband used then she shook her finger at him and said laughing oh you silly silly boy  mrs hauksbee heard that andshe owned as muchfelt that she had the worst of it bremmil accepted 7 and 9 gratefully they danced 7 and sat out 9 in one of the little tents what bremmil said and what mrs bremmil said is no concern of any ones  when the band struck up the roast beef of old england the two went out into the verandah and bremmil began looking for his wifes dandy this was before rickshaw days while she went into the cloakroom mrs hauksbee came up and said you take me in to supper i think mr bremmil bremmil turned red and looked foolish ahhm im going home with my wife mrs hauksbee i think there has been a little mistake being a man he spoke as though mrs hauksbee were entirely responsible  mrs bremmil came out of the cloakroom in a swansdown cloak with a white cloud round her head she looked radiant and she had a right to  the couple went off in the darkness together bremmil riding very close to the dandy  then says mrs hauksbee to meshe looked a trifle faded and jaded in the lamplight take my word for it the silliest woman can manage a clever man but it needs a very clever woman to manage a fool  then we went in to supper    thrown away  and some are sulky while some will plunge   so ho steady stand still you some you must gentle and some you must lunge   there there who wants to kill you somethere are losses in every trade   will break their hearts ere bitted and made   will fight like fiends as the rope cuts hard and die dumbmad in the breakingyard        toolungala stockyard chorus  to rear a boy under what parents call the sheltered life system is if the boy must go into the world and fend for himself not wise unless he be one in a thousand he has certainly to pass through many unnecessary troubles and may possibly come to extreme grief simply from ignorance of the proper proportions of things  let a puppy eat the soap in the bathroom or chew a newlyblacked boot he chews and chuckles until by and by he finds out that blacking and old brown windsor make him very sick so he argues that soap and boots are not wholesome any old dog about the house will soon show him the unwisdom of biting big dogs ears being young he remembers and goes abroad at six months a wellmannered little beast with a chastened appetite if he had been kept away from boots and soap and big dogs till he came to the trinity full grown and with developed teeth just consider how fearfully sick and thrashed he would be apply that motion to the sheltered life and see how it works it does not sound pretty but it is the better of two evils  there was a boy once who had been brought up under the sheltered life theory and the theory killed him dead he stayed with his people all his days from the hour he was born till the hour he went into sandhurst nearly at the top of the list he was beautifully taught in all that wins marks by a private tutor and carried the extra weight of never having given his parents an hours anxiety in his life what he learnt at sandhurst beyond the regular routine is of no great consequence he looked about him and he found soap and blacking so to speak very good he ate a little and came out of sandhurst not so high as he went in  them there was an interval and a scene with his people who expected much from him next a year of living unspotted from the world in a thirdrate depot battalion where all the juniors were children and all the seniors old women and lastly he came out to india where he was cut off from the support of his parents and had no one to fall back on in time of trouble except himself  now india is a place beyond all others where one must not take things too seriouslythe midday sun always excepted too much work and too much energy kill a man just as effectively as too much assorted vice or too much drink flirtation does not matter because every one is being transferred and either you or she leave the station and never return good work does not matter because a man is judged by his worst output and another man takes all the credit of his best as a rule bad work does not matter because other men do worse and incompetents hang on longer in india than anywhere else amusements do not matter because you must repeat them as soon as you have accomplished them once and most amusements only mean trying to win another persons money  sickness does not matter because its all in the days work and if you die another man takes over your place and your office in the eight hours between death and burial nothing matters except home furlough and acting allowances and these only because they are scarce this is a slack kutcha country where all men work with imperfect instruments and the wisest thing is to take no one and nothing in earnest but to escape as soon as ever you can to some place where amusement is amusement and a reputation worth the having  but this boythe tale is as old as the hillscame out and took all things seriously he was pretty and was petted he took the pettings seriously and fretted over women not worth saddling a pony to call upon he found his new free life in india very good  it does look attractive in the beginning from a subalterns point of view all ponies partners dancing and so on he tasted it as the puppy tastes the soap only he came late to the eating with a growing set of teeth he had no sense of balancejust like the puppyand could not understand why he was not treated with the consideration he received under his fathers roof this hurt his feelings  he quarrelled with other boys and being sensitive to the marrow remembered these quarrels and they excited him he found whist and gymkhanas and things of that kind meant to amuse one after office good but he took them seriously too just as he took the head that followed after drink he lost his money over whist and gymkhanas because they were new to him  he took his losses seriously and wasted as much energy and interest over a twogoldmohur race for maiden ekkaponies with their manes hogged as if it had been the derby onehalf of this came from inexperiencemuch as the puppy squabbles with the corner of the hearthrugand the other half from the dizziness bred by stumbling out of his quiet life into the glare and excitement of a livelier one no one told him about the soap and the blacking because an average man takes it for granted that an average man is ordinarily careful in regard to them it was pitiful to watch the boy knocking himself to pieces as an overhandled colt falls down and cuts himself when he gets away from the groom  this unbridled license in amusements not worth the trouble of breaking line for much less rioting over endured for six monthsall through one cold weatherand then we thought that the heat and the knowledge of having lost his money and health and lamed his horses would sober the boy down and he would stand steady in ninetynine cases out of a hundred this would have happened you can see the principle working in any indian station but this particular case fell through because the boy was sensitive and took things seriouslyas i may have said some seven times before of course we couldnt tell how his excesses struck him personally  they were nothing very heartbreaking or above the average he might be crippled for life financially and want a little nursing  still the memory of his performances would wither away in one hot weather and the shroff would help him to tide over the money troubles but he must have taken another view altogether and have believed himself ruined beyond redemption his colonel talked to him severely when the cold weather ended that made him more wretched than ever and it was only an ordinary colonels wigging  what follows is a curious instance of the fashion in which we are all linked together and made responsible for one another the thing that kicked the beam in the boys mind was a remark that a woman made when he was talking to her there is no use in repeating it for it was only a cruel little sentence rapped out before thinking that made him flush to the roots of his hair he kept himself to himself for three days and then put in for two days leave to go shooting near a canal engineers rest house about thirty miles out he got his leave and that night at mess was noisier and more offensive than ever he said that he was going to shoot big game and left at halfpast ten oclock in an ekka  partridgewhich was the only thing a man could get near the rest houseis not big game so every one laughed  next morning one of the majors came in from short leave and heard that the boy had gone out to shoot big game the major had taken an interest in the boy and had more than once tried to check him in the cold weather the major put up his eyebrows when he heard of the expedition and went to the boys room where he rummaged  presently he came out and found me leaving cards on the mess  there was no one else in the anteroom  he said the boy has gone out shooting does a man shoot  tetur with a revolver and a writingcase  i said nonsense major for i saw what was in his mind  he said nonsense or nonsense im going to the canal nowat once i dont feel easy  then he thought for a minute and said can you lie  you know best i answered its my profession  very well said the major you must come out with me nowat oncein an ekka to the canal to shoot blackbuck go and put on shikarkitquickand drive here with a gun  the major was a masterful man and i knew that he would not give orders for nothing so i obeyed and on return found the major packed up in an ekkagun cases and food slung belowall ready for a shootingtrip  he dismissed the driver and drove himself we jogged along quietly while in the station but as soon as we got to the dusty road across the plains he made that pony fly a countrybred can do nearly anything at a pinch we covered the thirty miles in under three hours but the poor brute was nearly dead  once i said whats the blazing hurry major  he said quietly the boy has been alone by himself forone two five fourteen hours now i tell you i dont feel easy  this uneasiness spread itself to me and i helped to beat the pony  when we came to the canal engineers rest house the major called for the boys servant but there was no answer then we went up to the house calling for the boy by name but there was no answer  oh hes out shooting said i  just then i saw through one of the windows a little hurricanelamp burning this was at four in the afternoon we both stopped dead in the verandah holding our breath to catch every sound and we heard inside the room the brrbrrbrr of a multitude of flies the major said nothing but he took off his helmet and we entered very softly  the boy was dead on the charpoy in the centre of the bare lime washed room he had shot his head nearly to pieces with his revolver the guncases were still strapped so was the bedding and on the table lay the boys writing case with photographs he had gone away to die like a poisoned rat  the major said to himself softly poor boy poor poor devil then he turned away from the bed and said i want your help in this business  knowing the boy was dead by his own hand i saw exactly what that help would be so i passed over to the table took a chair lit a cheroot and began to go through the writingcase the major looking over my shoulder and repeating to himself we came too latelike a rat in a holepoor poor devil  the boy must have spent half the night in writing to his people and to his colonel and to a girl at home and as soon as he had finished must have shot himself for he had been dead a long time when we came in  i read all that he had written and passed over each sheet to the major as i finished it  we saw from his accounts how very seriously he had taken everything he wrote about disgrace which he was unable to bearindelible shamecriminal follywasted life and so on besides a lot of private things to his father and mother too much too sacred to put into print the letter to the girl at home was the most pitiful of all and i choked as i read it the major made no attempt to keep dryeyed i respected him for that he read and rocked himself to and fro and simply cried like a woman without caring to hide it the letters were so dreary and hopeless and touching we forgot all about the boys follies and only thought of the poor thing on the charpoy and the scrawled sheets in our hands it was utterly impossible to let the letters go home  they would have broken his fathers heart and killed his mother after killing her belief in her son  at last the major dried his eyes openly and said nice sort of thing to spring on an english family what shall we do  i said knowing what the major had brought me but for the boy died of cholera we were with him at the time we cant commit ourselves to half measures come along  then began one of the most grimy comic scenes i have ever taken part inthe concoction of a big written lie bolstered with evidence to soothe the boys people at home i began the rough draft of a letter the major throwing in hints here and there while he gathered up all the stuff that the boy had written and burnt it in the fireplace it was a hot still evening when we began and the lamp burned very badly in due course i got the draft to my satisfaction setting forth how the boy was the pattern of all virtues beloved by his regiment with every promise of a great career before him and so on how we had helped him through the sicknessit was no time for little lies you will understandand how he had died without pain i choked while i was putting down these things and thinking of the poor people who would read them  then i laughed at the grotesqueness of the affair and the laughter mixed itself up with the chokeand the major said that we both wanted drinks  i am afraid to say how much whiskey we drank before the letter was finished it had not the least effect on us then we took off the boys watch locket and rings  lastly the major said we must send a lock of hair too a woman values that  but there were reasons why we could not find a lock fit to send  the boy was blackhaired and so was the major luckily i cut off a piece of the majors hair above the temple with a knife and put it into the packet we were making the laughingfit and the chokes got hold of me again and i had to stop the major was nearly as bad and we both knew that the worst part of the work was to come  we sealed up the packet photographs locket seals ring letter and lock of hair with the boys sealingwax and the boys seal  then the major said for gods sake lets get outsideaway from the room and think  we went outside and walked on the banks of the canal for an hour eating and drinking what we had with us until the moon rose i know now exactly how a murderer feels finally we forced ourselves back to the room with the lamp and the other thing in it and began to take up the next piece of work i am not going to write about this it was too horrible we burned the bedstead and dropped the ashes into the canal we took up the matting of the room and treated that in the same way i went off to a village and borrowed two big hoesi did not want the villagers to helpwhile the major arrangedthe other matters it took us four hours hard work to make the grave as we worked we argued out whether it was right to say as much as we remembered of the burial of the dead  we compromised things by saying the lords prayer with a private unofficial prayer for the peace of the soul of the boy then we filled in the grave and went into the verandahnot the houseto lie down to sleep we were dead tired  when we woke the major said wearily we cant go back till tomorrow we must give him a decent time to die in he died early this morning remember that seems more natural so the major must have been lying awake all the time thinking  i said then why didnt we bring the body back to the cantonments  the major thought for a minutebecause the people bolted when they heard of the cholera and the ekka has gone  that was strictly true we had forgotten all about the ekkapony and he had gone home  so we were left there alone all that stifling day in the canal rest house testing and retesting our story of the boys death to see if it was weak at any point a native turned up in the afternoon but we said that a sahib was dead of cholera and he ran away as the dusk gathered the major told me all his fears about the boy and awful stories of suicide or nearlycarriedout suicidetales that made ones hair crisp he said that he himself had once gone into the same valley of the shadow as the boy when he was young and new to the country so he understood how things fought together in the boys poor jumbled head he also said that youngsters in their repentant moments consider their sins much more serious and ineffaceable than they really are we talked together all through the evening and rehearsed the story of the death of the boy as soon as the moon was up and the boy theoretically just buried we struck across country for the station we walked from eight till six oclock in the morning but though we were deadtired we did not forget to go to the boys room and put away his revolver with the proper amount of cartridges in the pouch also to set his writingcase on the table we found the colonel and reported the death feeling more like murderers than ever then we went to bed and slept the clock round for there was no more in us  the tale had credence as long as was necessary for every one forgot about the boy before a fortnight was over many people however found time to say that the major had behaved scandalously in not bringing in the body for a regimental funeral the saddest thing of all was a letter from the boys mother to the major and mewith big inky blisters all over the sheet she wrote the sweetest possible things about our great kindness and the obligation she would be under to us as long as she lived  all things considered she was under an obligation but not exactly as she meant    miss youghals sais  when man and woman are agreed what can the kazi do       mahomedan proverb  some people say that there is no romance in india those people are wrong our lives hold quite as much romance as is good for us  sometimes more  strickland was in the police and people did not understand him so they said he was a doubtful sort of man and passed by on the other side strickland had himself to thank for this he held the extraordinary theory that a policeman in india should try to know as much about the natives as the natives themselves now in the whole of upper india there is only one man who can pass for hindu or mohammedan chamar or faquir as he pleases he is feared and respected by the natives from the ghor kathri to the jamma musjid and he is supposed to have the gift of invisibility and executive control over many devils but what good has this done him with the government none in the world he has never got simla for his charge and his name is almost unknown to englishmen  strickland was foolish enough to take that man for his model and following out his absurd theory dabbled in unsavory places no respectable man would think of exploringall among the native riffraff he educated himself in this peculiar way for seven years and people could not appreciate it he was perpetually going fantee among the natives which of course no man with any sense believes in he was initiated into the sat bhai at allahabad once when he was on leave he knew the lizardsong of the sansis and the halli hukk dance which is a religious cancan of a startling kind when a man knows who dances the hallihukk and how and when and where he knows something to be proud of he has gone deeper than the skin but strickland was not proud though he had helped once at jagadhri at the painting of the death bull which no englishman must even look upon had mastered the thievespatter of the changars had taken a eusufzai horsethief alone near attock and had stood under the mimbarboard of a border mosque and conducted service in the manner of a sunni mollah  his crowning achievement was spending eleven days as a faquir in the gardens of baba atal at amritsar and there picking up the threads of the great nasiban murder case but people said justly enough why on earth cant strickland sit in his office and write up his diary and recruit and keep quiet instead of showing up the incapacity of his seniors so the nasiban murder case did him no good departmentally but after his first feeling of wrath he returned to his outlandish custom of prying into native life by the way when a man once acquires a taste for this particular amusement it abides with him all his days it is the most fascinating thing in the world love not excepted where other men took ten days to the hills strickland took leave for what he called shikar put on the disguise that appealed to him at the time stepped down into the brown crowd and was swallowed up for a while he was a quiet dark young fellowspare blackeyesand when he was not thinking of something else a very interesting companion strickland on native progress as he had seen it was worth hearing natives hated strickland but they were afraid of him he knew too much  when the youghals came into the station stricklandvery gravely as he did everythingfell in love with miss youghal and she after a while fell in love with him because she could not understand him then strickland told the parents but mrs youghal said she was not going to throw her daughter into the worst paid department in the empire and old youghal said in so many words that he mistrusted stricklands ways and works and would thank him not to speak or write to his daughter any more very well said strickland for he did not wish to make his ladyloves life a burden after one long talk with miss youghal he dropped the business entirely  the youghals went up to simla in april  in july strickland secured three months leave on urgent private affairs he locked up his housethough not a native in the providence would wittingly have touched estreekin sahibs gear for the worldand went down to see a friend of his an old dyer at tarn taran  here all trace of him was lost until a sais met me on the simla mall with this extraordinary note  dear old man  please give bearer a box of cherootssupers no i for preference they are freshest at the club ill repay when i reappear but at present im out of society  yours  e strickland  i ordered two boxes and handed them over to the sais with my love  that sais was strickland and he was in old youghals employ attached to miss youghals arab the poor fellow was suffering for an english smoke and knew that whatever happened i should hold my tongue till the business was over  later on mrs youghal who was wrapped up in her servants began talking at houses where she called of her paragon among saisesthe man who was never too busy to get up in the morning and pick flowers for the breakfasttable and who blackedactually blackedthe hoofs of his horse like a london coachman the turnout of miss youghals arab was a wonder and a delight strickland dulloo i meanfound his reward in the pretty things that miss youghal said to him when she went out riding her parents were pleased to find she had forgotten all her foolishness for young strickland and said she was a good girl  strickland vows that the two months of his service were the most rigid mental discipline he has ever gone through quite apart from the little fact that the wife of one of his fellowsaises fell in love with him and then tried to poison him with arsenic because he would have nothing to do with her he had to school himself into keeping quiet when miss youghal went out riding with some man who tried to flirt with her and he was forced to trot behind carrying the blanket and hearing every word also he had to keep his temper when he was slanged in benmore porch by a policemanespecially once when he was abused by a naik he had himself recruited from isser jang villageor worse still when a young subaltern called him a pig for not making way quickly enough  but the life had its compensations he obtained great insight into the ways and thefts of saisesenough he says to have summarily convicted half the chamar population of the punjab if he had been on business he became one of the leading players at knucklebones which all jhampanis and many saises play while they are waiting outside the government house or the gaiety theatre of nights he learned to smoke tobacco that was threefourths cowdung and he heard the wisdom of the grizzled jemadar of the government house saises whose words are valuable he saw many things which amused him and he states on honor that no man can appreciate simla properly till he has seen it from the saiss point of view  he also says that if he chose to write all he saw his head would be broken in several places  stricklands account of the agony he endured on wet nights hearing the music and seeing the lights in benmore with his toes tingling for a waltz and his head in a horseblanket is rather amusing one of these days strickland is going to write a little book on his experiences that book will be worth buying and even more worth suppressing  thus he served faithfully as jacob served for rachel and his leave was nearly at an end when the explosion came he had really done his best to keep his temper in the hearing of the flirtations i have mentioned but he broke down at last an old and very distinguished general took miss youghal for a ride and began that specially offensive youreonlyalittlegirl sort of flirtationmost difficult for a woman to turn aside deftly and most maddening to listen to miss youghal was shaking with fear at the things he said in the hearing of her sais dulloostricklandstood it as long as he could then he caught hold of the generals bridle and in most fluent english invited him to step off and be heaved over the cliff next minute miss youghal began crying and strickland saw that he had hopelessly given himself away and everything was over  the general nearly had a fit while miss youghal was sobbing out the story of the disguise and the engagement that wasnt recognized by the parents strickland was furiously angry with himself and more angry with the general for forcing his hand so he said nothing but held the horses head and prepared to thrash the general as some sort of satisfaction but when the general had thoroughly grasped the story and knew who strickland was he began to puff and blow in the saddle and nearly rolled off with laughing he said strickland deserved a v c if it were only for putting on a saiss blanket then he called himself names and vowed that he deserved a thrashing but he was too old to take it from strickland then he complimented miss youghal on her lover  the scandal of the business never struck him for he was a nice old man with a weakness for flirtations then he laughed again and said that old youghal was a fool strickland let go of the cobs head and suggested that the general had better help them if that was his opinion strickland knew youghals weakness for men with titles and letters after their names and high official position  its rather like a fortyminute farce said the general but begad i will help if its only to escape that tremendous thrashing i deserved go along to your home my saispoliceman and change into decent kit and ill attack mr youghal miss youghal may i ask you to canter home and wait                              about seven minutes later there was a wild hurroosh at the club  a sais with a blanket and headrope was asking all the men he knew for heavens sake lend me decent clothes as the men did not recognize him there were some peculiar scenes before strickland could get a hot bath with soda in it in one room a shirt here a collar there a pair of trousers elsewhere and so on he galloped off with half the club wardrobe on his back and an utter strangers pony under him to the house of old youghal  the general arrayed in purple and fine linen was before him  what the general had said strickland never knew but youghal received strickland with moderate civility and mrs youghal touched by the devotion of the transformed dulloo was almost kind  the general beamed and chuckled and miss youghal came in and almost before old youghal knew where he was the parental consent had been wrenched out and strickland had departed with miss youghal to the telegraph office to wire for his kit the final embarrassment was when an utter stranger attacked him on the mall and asked for the stolen pony  so in the end strickland and miss youghal were married on the strict understanding that strickland should drop his old ways and stick to departmental routine which pays best and leads to simla  strickland was far too fond of his wife just then to break his word but it was a sore trial to him for the streets and the bazars and the sounds in them were full of meaning to strickland and these called to him to come back and take up his wanderings and his discoveries some day i will tell you how he broke his promise to help a friend that was long since and he has by this time been nearly spoilt for what he would call shikar he is forgetting the slang and the beggars cant and the marks and the signs and the drift of the undercurrents which if a man would master he must always continue to learn  but he fills in his departmental returns beautifully   yoked with an unbeliever  i am dying for you and you are dying for another       punjabi proverb  when the gravesend tender left the p  0 steamer for bombay and went back to catch the train to town there were many people in it crying but the one who wept most and most openly was miss agnes laiter she had reason to cry because the only man she ever lovedor ever could love so she saidwas going out to india and india as every one knows is divided equally between jungle tigers cobras cholera and sepoys  phil garron leaning over the side of the steamer in the rain felt very unhappy too but he did not cry he was sent out to tea what tea meant he had not the vaguest idea but fancied that he would have to ride on a prancing horse over hills covered with teavines and draw a sumptuous salary for doing so and he was very grateful to his uncle for getting him the berth he was really going to reform all his slack shiftless ways save a large proportion of his magnificent salary yearly and in a very short time return to marry agnes laiter phil garron had been lying loose on his friends hands for three years and as he had nothing to do he naturally fell in love he was very nice but he was not strong in his views and opinions and principles and though he never came to actual grief his friends were thankful when he said goodbye and went out to this mysterious tea business near darjiling they saidgod bless you dear boy let us never see your face againor at least that was what phil was given to understand  when he sailed he was very full of a great plan to prove himself several hundred times better than any one had given him credit forto work like a horse and triumphantly marry agnes laiter he had many good points besides his good looks his only fault being that he was weak the least little bit in the world weak he had as much notion of economy as the morning sun and yet you could not lay your hand on any one item and say herein phil garron is extravagant or reckless nor could you point out any particular vice in his character but he was unsatisfactory and as workable as putty  agnes laiter went about her duties at homeher family objected to the engagementwith red eyes while phil was sailing to darjilinga port on the bengal ocean as his mother used to tell her friends he was popular enough on board ship made many acquaintances and a moderately large liquor bill and sent off huge letters to agnes laiter at each port then he fell to work on this plantation somewhere between darjiling and kangra and though the salary and the horse and the work were not quite all he had fancied he succeeded fairly well and gave himself much unnecessary credit for his perseverance  in the course of time as he settled more into collar and his work grew fixed before him the face of agnes laiter went out of his mind and only came when he was at leisure which was not often he would forget all about her for a fortnight and remember her with a start like a schoolboy who has forgotten to learn his lesson  she did not forget phil because she was of the kind that never forgets only another mana really desirable young manpresented himself before mrs laiter and the chance of a marriage with phil was as far off as ever and his letters were so unsatisfactory and there was a certain amount of domestic pressure brought to bear on the girl and the young man really was an eligible person as incomes go and the end of all things was that agnes married him and wrote a tempestuous whirlwind of a letter to phil in the wilds of darjiling and said she should never know a happy moment all the rest of her life which was a true prophecy  phil got that letter and held himself illtreated this was two years after he had come out but by dint of thinking fixedly of agnes laiter and looking at her photograph and patting himself on the back for being one of the most constant lovers in history and warming to the work as he went on he really fancied that he had been very hardly used he sat down and wrote one final lettera really pathetic world without end amen epistle explaining how he would be true to eternity and that all women were very much alike and he would hide his broken heart etc etc but if at any future time etc etc he could afford to wait etc etc unchanged affections etc etc return to her old love etc etc for eight closelywritten pages from an artistic point of view it was very neat work but an ordinary philistine who knew the state of phils real feelingsnot the ones he rose to as he went on writingwould have called it the thoroughly mean and selfish work of a thoroughly mean and selfish weak man but this verdict would have been incorrect phil paid for the postage and felt every word he had written for at least two days and a half  it was the last flicker before the light went out  that letter made agnes laiter very unhappy and she cried and put it away in her desk and became mrs somebody else for the good of her family which is the first duty of every christian maid  phil went his ways and thought no more of his letter except as an artist thinks of a neatly touchedin sketch his ways were not bad but they were not altogether good until they brought him across dunmaya the daughter of a rajput exsubadarmajor of our native army the girl had a strain of hill blood in her and like the hill women was not a purdah nashin where phil met her or how he heard of her does not matter she was a good girl and handsome and in her way very clever and shrewd though of course a little hard it is to be remembered that phil was living very comfortably denying himself no small luxury never putting by an anna very satisfied with himself and his good intentions was dropping all his english correspondents one by one and beginning more and more to look upon this land as his home some men fall this way and they are of no use afterwards the climate where he was stationed was good and it really did not seem to him that there was anything to go home for  he did what many planters have done before himthat is to say he made up his mind to marry a hill girl and settle down he was seven and twenty then with a long life before him but no spirit to go through with it so he married dunmaya by the forms of the english church and some fellowplanters said he was a fool and some said he was a wise man dunmaya was a thoroughly honest girl and in spite of her reverence for an englishman had a reasonable estimate of her husbands weaknesses she managed him tenderly and became in less than a year a very passable imitation of an english lady in dress and carriage it is curious to think that a hill man after a lifetimes education is a hill man still but a hill woman can in six months master most of the ways of her english sisters there was a coolie woman once but that is another story dunmaya dressed by preference in black and yellow and looked well  meantime the letter lay in agness desk and now and again she would think of poor resolute hardworking phil among the cobras and tigers of darjiling toiling in the vain hope that she might come back to him her husband was worth ten phils except that he had rheumatism of the heart three years after he was marriedand after he had tried nice and algeria for his complainthe went to bombay where he died and set agnes free being a devout woman she looked on his death and the place of it as a direct interposition of providence and when she had recovered from the shock she took out and reread phils letter with the etc etc and the big dashes and the little dashes and kissed it several times no one knew her in bombay she had her husbands income which was a large one and phil was close at hand it was wrong and improper of course but she decided as heroines do in novels to find her old lover to offer him her hand and her gold and with him spend the rest of her life in some spot far from unsympathetic souls she sat for two months alone in watsons hotel elaborating this decision and the picture was a pretty one then she set out in search of phil garron assistant on a tea plantation with a more than usually unpronounceable name                              she found him she spent a month over it for his plantation was not in the darjiling district at all but nearer kangra phil was very little altered and dunmaya was very nice to her  now the particular sin and shame of the whole business is that phil who really is not worth thinking of twice was and is loved by dunmaya and more than loved by agnes the whole of whose life he seems to have spoilt  worst of all dunmaya is making a decent man of him and he will be ultimately saved from perdition through her training  which is manifestly unfair    false dawn  tonight god knows what thing shall tide   the earth is racked and faint expectant sleepless openeyed and we who from the earth were made   thrill with our mothers pain              in durance  no man will ever know the exact truth of this story though women may sometimes whisper it to one another after a dance when they are putting up their hair for the night and comparing lists of victims a man of course cannot assist at these functions so the tale must be told from the outside in the darkall wrong  never praise a sister to a sister in the hope of your compliments reaching the proper ears and so preparing the way for you later on sisters are women first and sisters afterwards and you will find that you do yourself harm  saumarez knew this when he made up his mind to propose to the elder miss copleigh saumarez was a strange man with few merits so far as men could see though he was popular with women and carried enough conceit to stock a viceroys council and leave a little over for the commanderinchiefs staff he was a civilian very many women took an interest in saumarez perhaps because his manner to them was offensive if you hit a pony over the nose at the outset of your acquaintance he may not love you but he will take a deep interest in your movements ever afterwards the elder miss copleigh was nice plump winning and pretty the younger was not so pretty and from men disregarding the hint set forth above her style was repellant and unattractive both girls had practically the same figure and there was a strong likeness between them in look and voice though no one could doubt for an instant which was the nicer of the two  saumarez made up his mind as soon as they came into the station from behar to marry the elder one at least we all made sure that he would which comes to the same thing she was two and twenty and he was thirtythree with pay and allowances of nearly fourteen hundred rupees a month so the match as we arranged it was in every way a good one saumarez was his name and summary was his nature as a man once said having drafted his resolution he formed a select committee of one to sit upon it and resolved to take his time in our unpleasant slang the copleigh girls hunted in couples that is to say you could do nothing with one without the other they were very loving sisters but their mutual affection was sometimes inconvenient saumarez held the balancehair true between them and none but himself could have said to which side his heart inclined though every one guessed he rode with them a good deal and danced with them but he never succeeded in detaching them from each other for any length of time  women said that the two girls kept together through deep mistrust each fearing that the other would steal a march on her but that has nothing to do with a man saumarez was silent for good or bad and as  businesslikely attentive as he could be having due regard to his work and his polo beyond doubt both girls were fond of him  as the hot weather drew nearer and saumarez made no sign women said that you could see their trouble in the eyes of the girlsthat they were looking strained anxious and irritable men are quite blind in these matters unless they have more of the woman than the man in their composition in which case it does not matter what they say or think i maintain it was the hot april days that took the color out of the copleigh girls cheeks they should have been sent to the hills early no oneman or womanfeels an angel when the hot weather is approaching the younger sister grew more cynicalnot to say acidin her ways and the winningness of the elder wore thin there was more effort in it  now the station wherein all these things happened was though not a little one off the line of rail and suffered through want of attention there were no gardens or bands or amusements worth speaking of and it was nearly a days journey to come into lahore for a dance people were grateful for small things to interest them  about the beginning of may and just before the final exodus of hillgoers when the weather was very hot and there were not more than twenty people in the station saumarez gave a moonlight ridingpicnic at an old tomb six miles away near the bed of the river it was a noahs ark picnic and there was to be the usual arrangement of quartermile intervals between each couple on account of the dust six couples came altogether including chaperons moonlight picnics are useful just at the very end of the season before all the girls go away to the hills they lead to understandings and should be encouraged by chaperones especially those whose girls look sweetish in riding habits i knew a case once but that is another story that picnic was called the great pop picnic because every one knew saumarez would propose then to the eldest miss copleigh and beside his affair there was another which might possibly come to happiness  the social atmosphere was heavily charged and wanted clearing  we met at the paradeground at ten the night was fearfully hot  the horses sweated even at walkingpace but anything was better than sitting still in our own dark houses when we moved off under the full moon we were four couples one triplet and mr saumarez rode with the copleigh girls and i loitered at the tail of the procession wondering with whom saumarez would ride home every one was happy and contented but we all felt that things were going to happen we rode slowly and it was nearly midnight before we reached the old tomb facing the ruined tank in the decayed gardens where we were going to eat and drink i was late in coming up and before i went into the garden i saw that the horizon to the north carried a faint duncolored feather but no one would have thanked me for spoiling so wellmanaged an entertainment as this picnicand a duststorm more or less does no great harm  we gathered by the tank some one had brought out a banjowhich is a most sentimental instrumentand three or four of us sang  you must not laugh at this our amusements in outoftheway stations are very few indeed then we talked in groups or together lying under the trees with the sunbaked roses dropping their petals on our feet until supper was ready it was a beautiful supper as cold and as iced as you could wish and we stayed long over it  i had felt that the air was growing hotter and hotter but nobody seemed to notice it until the moon went out and a burning hot wind began lashing the orangetrees with a sound like the noise of the sea before we knew where we were the duststorm was on us and everything was roaring whirling darkness the suppertable was blown bodily into the tank we were afraid of staying anywhere near the old tomb for fear it might be blown down so we felt our way to the orangetrees where the horses were picketed and waited for the storm to blow over then the little light that was left vanished and you could not see your hand before your face the air was heavy with dust and sand from the bed of the river that filled boots and pockets and drifted down necks and coated eyebrows and moustaches it was one of the worst duststorms of the year  we were all huddled together close to the trembling horses with the thunder clattering overhead and the lightning spurting like water from a sluice all ways at once there was no danger of course unless the horses broke loose i was standing with my head downward and my hands over my mouth hearing the trees thrashing each other i could not see who was next me till the flashes came  then i found that i was packed near saumarez and the eldest miss copleigh with my own horse just in front of me i recognized the eldest miss copleigh because she had a pagri round her helmet and the younger had not all the electricity in the air had gone into my body and i was quivering and tingling from head to footexactly as a corn shoots and tingles before rain it was a grand storm  the wind seemed to be picking up the earth and pitching it to leeward in great heaps and the heat beat up from the ground like the heat of the day of judgment  the storm lulled slightly after the first halfhour and i heard a despairing little voice close to my ear saying to itself quietly and softly as if some lost soul were flying about with the wind o my god then the younger miss copleigh stumbled into my arms saying where is my horse get my horse i want to go home i want to go home take me home  i thought that the lightning and the black darkness had frightened her so i said there was no danger but she must wait till the storm blew over she answered it is not that it is not that i want to go home o take me away from here  i said that she could not go till the light came but i felt her brush past me and go away it was too dark to see where then the whole sky was split open with one tremendous flash as if the end of the world were coming and all the women shrieked  almost directly after this i felt a mans hand on my shoulder and heard saumarez bellowing in my ear through the rattling of the trees and howling of the wind i did not catch his words at once but at last i heard him say ive proposed to the wrong one what shall i do saumarez had no occasion to make this confidence to me i was never a friend of his nor am i now but i fancy neither of us were ourselves just then he was shaking as he stood with excitement and i was feeling queer all over with the electricity  i could not think of anything to say exceptmore fool you for proposing in a duststorm but i did not see how that would improve the mistake  then he shouted wheres edithedith copleigh edith was the youngest sister i answered out of my astonishmentwhat do you want with her would you believe it for the next two minutes he and i were shouting at each other like maniacshe vowing that it was the youngest sister he had meant to propose to all along and i telling him till my throat was hoarse that he must have made a mistake i cant account for this except again by the fact that we were neither of us ourselves everything seemed to me like a bad dream from the stamping of the horses in the darkness to saumarez telling me the story of his loving edith copleigh since the first he was still clawing my shoulder and begging me to tell him where edith copleigh was when another lull came and brought light with it and we saw the dustcloud forming on the plain in front of us so we knew the worst was over the moon was low down and there was just the glimmer of the false dawn that comes about an hour before the real one but the light was very faint and the dun cloud roared like a bull i wondered where edith copleigh had gone and as i was wondering i saw three things together first maud copleighs face come smiling out of the darkness and move towards saumarez who was standing by me i heard the girl whisper george and slide her arm through the arm that was not clawing my shoulder and i saw that look on her face which only comes once or twice in a lifetimewhen a woman is perfectly happy and the air is full of trumpets and gorgeouscolored fire and the earth turns into cloud because she loves and is loved at the same time i saw saumarezs face as he heard maud copleighs voice and fifty yards away from the clump of orangetrees i saw a brown holland habit getting upon a horse  it must have been my state of overexcitement that made me so quick to meddle with what did not concern me saumarez was moving off to the habit but i pushed him back and saidstop here and explain ill fetch her back and i ran out to get at my own horse i had a perfectly unnecessary notion that everything must be done decently and in order and that saumarezs first care was to wipe the happy look out of maud copleighs face all the time i was linking up the curbchain i wondered how he would do it  i cantered after edith copleigh thinking to bring her back slowly on some pretence or another but she galloped away as soon as she saw me and i was forced to ride after her in earnest she called back over her shouldergo away im going home oh go away two or three times but my business was to catch her first and argue later the ride just fitted in with the rest of the evil dream the ground was very bad and now and again we rushed through the whirling choking dustdevils in the skirts of the flying storm there was a burning hot wind blowing that brought up a stench of stale brickkilns with it and through the half light and through the dustdevils across that desolate plain flickered the brown holland habit on the gray horse she headed for the station at first then she wheeled round and set off for the river through beds of burnt down junglegrass bad even to ride a pig over in cold blood i should never have dreamed of going over such a country at night but it seemed quite right and natural with the lightning crackling overhead and a reek like the smell of the pit in my nostrils i rode and shouted and she bent forward and lashed her horse and the aftermath of the duststorm came up and caught us both and drove us downwind like pieces of paper  i dont know how far we rode but the drumming of the horsehoofs and the roar of the wind and the race of the faint bloodred moon through the yellow mist seemed to have gone on for years and years and i was literally drenched with sweat from my helmet to my gaiters when the gray stumbled recovered himself and pulled up dead lame my brute was used up altogether edith copleigh was in a sad state plastered with dust her helmet off and crying bitterly why cant you let me alone she said i only wanted to get away and go home oh please let me go  you have got to come back with me miss copleigh saumarez has something to say to you  it was a foolish way of putting it but i hardly knew miss copleigh and though i was playing providence at the cost of my horse i could not tell her in as many words what saumarez had told me i thought he could do that better himself all her pretence about being tired and wanting to go home broke down and she rocked herself to and fro in the saddle as she sobbed and the hot wind blew her black hair to leeward i am not going to repeat what she said because she was utterly unstrung  this if you please was the cynical miss copleigh here was i almost an utter stranger to her trying to tell her that saumarez loved her and she was to come back to hear him say so i believe i made myself understood for she gathered the gray together and made him hobble somehow and we set off for the tomb while the storm went thundering down to umballa and a few big drops of warm rain fell i found out that she had been standing close to saumarez when he proposed to her sister and had wanted to go home and cry in peace as an english girl should she dabbled her eyes with her pockethandkerchief as we went along and babbled to me out of sheer lightness of heart and hysteria that was perfectly unnatural and yet it seemed all right at the time and in the place all the world was only the two copleigh girls saumarez and i ringed in with the lightning and the dark and the guidance of this misguided world seemed to lie in my hands  when we returned to the tomb in the deep dead stillness that followed the storm the dawn was just breaking and nobody had gone away they were waiting for our return saumarez most of all  his face was white and drawn as miss copleigh and i limped up he came forward to meet us and when he helped her down from her saddle he kissed her before all the picnic it was like a scene in a theatre and the likeness was heightened by all the dustwhite ghostlylooking men and women under the orangetrees clapping their hands as if they were watching a playat saumarezs choice i never knew anything so unenglish in my life  lastly saumarez said we must all go home or the station would come out to look for us and would i be good enough to ride home with maud copleigh nothing would give me greater pleasure i said  so we formed up six couples in all and went back two by two saumarez walking at the side of edith copleigh who was riding his horse  the air was cleared and little by little as the sun rose i felt we were all dropping back again into ordinary men and women and that the great pop picnic was a thing altogether apart and out of the worldnever to happen again it had gone with the duststorm and the tingle in the hot air  i felt tired and limp and a good deal ashamed of myself as i went in for a bath and some sleep  there is a womans version of this story but it will never be written     unless maud copleigh cares to try   the rescue of pluffles  thus for a season they fought it fair   she and his cousin may tactful talented debonnaire   decorous foes were they but never can battle of man compare   with merciless feminine fray            two and one  mrs hauksbee was sometimes nice to her own sex here is a story to prove this and you can believe just as much as ever you please  pluffles was a subaltern in the unmentionables he was callow even for a subaltern he was callow all overlike a canary that had not finished fledging itself the worst of it was he had three times as much money as was good for him pluffles papa being a rich man and pluffles being the only son pluffles mamma adored him she was only a little less callow than pluffles and she believed everything he said  pluffles weakness was not believing what people said he preferred what he called trusting to his own judgment he had as much judgment as he had seat or hands and this preference tumbled him into trouble once or twice but the biggest trouble pluffles ever manufactured came about at simlasome years ago when he was fourandtwenty  he began by trusting to his own judgment as usual and the result was that after a time he was bound hand and foot to mrs reivers rickshaw wheels  there was nothing good about mrs reiver unless it was her dress  she was bad from her hairwhich started life on a brittanys girls headto her bootheels which were two and threeeighth inches high she was not honestly mischievous like mrs hauksbee she was wicked in a businesslike way  there was never any scandalshe had not generous impulses enough for that she was the exception which proved the rule that angloindian ladies are in every way as nice as their sisters at home  she spent her life in proving that rule  mrs hauksbee and she hated each other fervently they heard far too much to clash but the things they said of each other were startlingnot to say original mrs hauksbee was honesthonest as her own front teethand but for her love of mischief would have been a womans woman there was no honesty about mrs reiver nothing but selfishness and at the beginning of the season poor little pluffles fell a prey to her she laid herself out to that end and who was pluffles to resist he went on trusting to his judgment and he got judged  i have seen hayes argue with a tough horsei have seen a tongadriver coerce a stubborn ponyi have seen a riotous setter broken to gun by a hard keeper but the breakingin of pluffles of the unmentionables was beyond all these he learned to fetch and carry like a dog and to wait like one too for a word from mrs reiver he learned to keep appointments which mrs reiver had no intention of keeping he learned to take thankfully dances which mrs reiver had no intention of giving him he learned to shiver for an hour and a quarter on the windward side of elysium while mrs reiver was making up her mind to come for a ride he learned to hunt for a rickshaw in a light dress suit under a pelting rain and to walk by the side of that rickshaw when he had found it he learned what it was to be spoken to like a coolie and ordered about like a cook he learned all this and many other things besides and he paid for his schooling  perhaps in some hazy way he fancied that it was fine and impressive that it gave him a status among men and was altogether the thing to do it was nobodys business to warn pluffles that he was unwise the pace that season was too good to inquire and meddling with another mans folly is always thankless work  pluffles colonel should have ordered him back to his regiment when he heard how things were going but pluffles had got himself engaged to a girl in england the last time he went home and if there was one thing more than another which the colonel detested it was a married subaltern he chuckled when he heard of the education of pluffles and said it was good training for the boy but it was not good training in the least it led him into spending money beyond his means which were good above that the education spoilt an average boy and made it a tenthrate man of an objectionable kind he wandered into a bad set and his little bill at hamiltons was a thing to wonder at  then mrs hauksbee rose to the occasion she played her game alone knowing what people would say of her and she played it for the sake of a girl she had never seen pluffles fiancee was to come out under the chaperonage of an aunt in october to be married to pluffles  at the beginning of august mrs hauksbee discovered that it was time to interfere a man who rides much knows exactly what a horse is going to do next before he does it in the same way a woman of mrs hauksbees experience knows accurately how a boy will behave under certain circumstancesnotably when he is infatuated with one of mrs reivers stamp she said that sooner or later little pluffles would break off that engagement for nothing at all simply to gratify mrs reiver who in return would keep him at her feet and in her service just so long as she found it worth her while  she said she knew the signs of these things if she did not no one else could  then she went forth to capture pluffles under the guns of the enemy just as mrs cusackbremmil carried away bremmil under mrs hauksbees eyes  this particular engagement lasted seven weekswe called it the seven weeks warand was fought out inch by inch on both sides a detailed account would fill a book and would be incomplete then  any one who knows about these things can fit in the details for himself it was a superb fightthere will never be another like it as long as jakko standsand pluffles was the prize of victory  people said shameful things about mrs hauksbee they did not know what she was playing for mrs reiver fought partly because pluffles was useful to her but mainly because she hated mrs hauksbee and the matter was a trial of strength between them no one knows what pluffles thought he had not many ideas at the best of times and the few he possessed made him conceited mrs hauksbee saidthe boy must be caught and the only way of catching him is by treating him well  so she treated him as a man of the world and of experience so long as the issue was doubtful little by little pluffles fell away from his old allegiance and came over to the enemy by whom he was made much of he was never sent on outpost duty after rickshaws any more nor was he given dances which never came off nor were the drains on his purse continued mrs hauksbee held him on the snaffle and after his treatment at mrs reivers hands he appreciated the change  mrs reiver had broken him of talking about himself and made him talk about her own merits mrs hauksbee acted otherwise and won his confidence till he mentioned his engagement to the girl at home speaking of it in a high and mighty way as a piece of boyish folly this was when he was taking tea with her one afternoon and discoursing in what he considered a gay and fascinating style  mrs hauksbee had seen an earlier generation of his stamp bud and blossom and decay into fat captains and tubby majors  at a moderate estimate there were about three and twenty sides to that ladys character some men say more she began to talk to pluffles after the manner of a mother and as if there had been three hundred years instead of fifteen between them she spoke with a sort of throaty quaver in her voice which had a soothing effect though what she said was anything but soothing she pointed out the exceeding folly not to say meanness of pluffles conduct and the smallness of his views then he stammered something about trusting to his own judgment as a man of the world and this paved the way for what she wanted to say next it would have withered up pluffles had it come from any other woman but in the soft cooing style in which mrs hauksbee put it it only made him feel limp and repentantas if he had been in some superior kind of church little by little very softly and pleasantly she began taking the conceit out of pluffles as you take the ribs out of an umbrella before recovering it she told him what she thought of him and his judgment and his knowledge of the world and how his performances had made him ridiculous to other people and how it was his intention to make love to herself if she gave him the chance then she said that marriage would be the making of him and drew a pretty little pictureall rose and opalof the mrs pluffles of the future going through life relying on the judgment and knowledge of the world of a husband who had nothing to reproach himself with how she reconciled these two statements she alone knew but they did not strike pluffles as conflicting  hers was a perfect little homilymuch better than any clergyman could have givenand it ended with touching allusions to pluffles mamma and papa and the wisdom of taking his bride home  then she sent pluffles out for a walk to think over what she had said pluffles left blowing his nose very hard and holding himself very straight mrs hauksbee laughed  what pluffles had intended to do in the matter of the engagement only mrs reiver knew and she kept her own counsel to her death she would have liked it spoiled as a compliment i fancy  pluffles enjoyed many talks with mrs hauksbee during the next few days they were all to the same end and they helped pluffles in the path of virtue  mrs hauksbee wanted to keep him under her wing to the last  therefore she discountenanced his going down to bombay to get married goodness only knows what might happen by the way she said pluffles is cursed with the curse of reuben and india is no fit place for him  in the end the fiancee arrived with her aunt and pluffles having reduced his affairs to some sort of orderhere again mrs hauksbee helped himwas married  mrs hauksbee gave a sigh of relief when both the i wills had been said and went her way  pluffles took her advice about going home he left the service and is now raising speckled cattle inside green painted fences somewhere at home i believe he does this very judiciously he would have come to extreme grief out here  for these reasons if any one says anything more than usually nasty about mrs hauksbee tell him the story of the rescue of pluffles    cupids arrows  pit where the buffalo cooled his hide by the hot sun emptied and blistered and dried log in the rehgrass hidden and alone bund where the earthrats mounds are strown cave in the bank where the sly stream steals aloe that stabs at the belly and heels jump if you dare on a steed untried safer it is to go widego wide hark from in front where the best men ride pull to the off boys wide go wide              the peora hunt  once upon a time there lived at simla a very pretty girl the daughter of a poor but honest district and sessions judge she was a good girl but could not help knowing her power and using it  her mamma was very anxious about her daughters future as all good mammas should be  when a man is a commissioner and a bachelor and has the right of wearing open work jamtart jewels in gold and enamel on his clothes and of going through a door before every one except a member of council a lieutenantgovernor or a viceroy he is worth marrying at least that is what ladies say there was a commissioner in simla in those days who was and wore and did all i have said he was a plain manan ugly manthe ugliest man in asia with two exceptions his was a face to dream about and try to carve on a pipehead afterwards his name was saggottbarrsaggottanthony barrsaggott and six letters to follow  departmentally he was one of the best men the government of india owned socially he was like a blandishing gorilla  when he turned his attentions to miss beighton i believe that mrs  beighton wept with delight at the reward providence had sent her in her old age  mr beighton held his tongue he was an easygoing man  now a commissioner is very rich his pay is beyond the dreams of avariceis so enormous that he can afford to save and scrape in a way that would almost discredit a member of council most commissioners are mean but barrsaggott was an exception he entertained royally he horsed himself well he gave dances he was a power in the land and he behaved as such  consider that everything i am writing of took place in an almost prehistoric era in the history of british india some folk may remember the years before lawntennis was born when we all played croquet there were seasons before that if you will believe me when even croquet had not been invented and archerywhich was revived in england in 1844was as great a pest as lawn tennis is now people talked learnedly about holding and loosing steles reflexed bows 56pound bows backed or selfyew bows as we talk about rallies volleys smashes returns and 16ounce rackets  miss beighton shot divinely over ladies distance60 yards that isand was acknowledged the best lady archer in simla men called her diana of tara devi  barrsaggott paid her great attention and as i have said the heart of her mother was uplifted in consequence kitty beighton took matters more calmly it was pleasant to be singled out by a commissioner with letters after his name and to fill the hearts of other girls with bad feelings but there was no denying the fact that barrsaggott was phenomenally ugly and all his attempts to adorn himself only made him more grotesque he was not christened the langurwhich means gray apefor nothing it was pleasant kitty thought to have him at her feet but it was better to escape from him and ride with the graceless cubbonthe man in a dragoon regiment at umballathe boy with a handsome face and no prospects kitty liked cubbon more than a little he never pretended for a moment the he was anything less than head over heels in love with her for he was an honest boy so kitty fled now and again from the stately wooings of barrsaggott to the company of young cubbon and was scolded by her mamma in consequence but mother she said mr saggott is suchsuch ais so fearfully ugly you know  my dear said mrs beighton piously we cannot be other than an allruling providence has made us besides you will take precedence of your own mother you know think of that and be reasonable  then kitty put up her little chin and said irreverent things about precedence and commissioners and matrimony mr beighton rubbed the top of his head for he was an easygoing man  late in the season when he judged that the time was ripe barrsaggott developed a plan which did great credit to his administrative powers he arranged an archery tournament for ladies with a most sumptuous diamond studded bracelet as prize  he drew up his terms skilfully and every one saw that the bracelet was a gift to miss beighton the acceptance carrying with it the hand and the heart of commissioner barrsaggott the terms were a st leonards roundthirtysix shots at sixty yardsunder the rules of the simla toxophilite society  all simla was invited there were beautifully arranged teatables under the deodars at annandale where the grand stand is now and alone in its glory winking in the sun sat the diamond bracelet in a blue velvet case miss beighton was anxiousalmost too anxious to compete on the appointed afternoon all simla rode down to annandale to witness the judgment of paris turned upside down  kitty rode with young cubbon and it was easy to see that the boy was troubled in his mind he must be held innocent of everything that followed kitty was pale and nervous and looked long at the bracelet barrsaggott was gorgeously dressed even more nervous than kitty and more hideous than ever  mrs beighton smiled condescendingly as befitted the mother of a potential commissioneress and the shooting began all the world standing in a semicircle as the ladies came out one after the other  nothing is so tedious as an archery competition they shot and they shot and they kept on shooting till the sun left the valley and little breezes got up in the deodars and people waited for miss beighton to shoot and win cubbon was at one horn of the semicircle round the shooters and barrsaggott at the other miss beighton was last on the list the scoring had been weak and the bracelet plus commissioner barrsaggott was hers to a certainty  the commissioner strung her bow with his own sacred hands she stepped forward looked at the bracelet and her first arrow went true to a hairfull into the heart of the goldcounting nine points  young cubbon on the left turned white and his devil prompted barrsaggott to smile now horses used to shy when barrsaggott smiled  kitty saw that smile she looked to her leftfront gave an almost imperceptible nod to cubbon and went on shooting  i wish i could describe the scene that followed it was out of the ordinary and most improper miss kitty fitted her arrows with immense deliberation so that every one might see what she was doing she was a perfect shot and her 46pound bow suited her to a nicety she pinned the wooden legs of the target with great care four successive times she pinned the wooden top of the target once and all the ladies looked at each other then she began some fancy shooting at the white which if you hit it counts exactly one point she put five arrows into the white it was wonderful archery but seeing that her business was to make golds and win the bracelet barrsaggott turned a delicate green like young watergrass next she shot over the target twice then wide to the left twicealways with the same deliberationwhile a chilly hush fell over the company and mrs beighton took out her handkerchief then kitty shot at the ground in front of the target and split several arrows then she made a redor seven pointsjust to show what she could do if she liked and finished up her amazing performance with some more fancy shooting at the targetsupports here is her score as it was picked off  gold red blue black white total hits  total score miss beighton  1      1    0     0      5        7                  21  barrsaggott looked as if the last few arrowheads had been driven into his legs instead of the targets and the deep stillness was broken by a little snubby mottled halfgrown girl saying in a shrill voice of triumph then ive won  mrs beighton did her best to bear up but she wept in the presence of the people no training could help her through such a disappointment kitty unstrung her bow with a vicious jerk and went back to her place while barr saggott was trying to pretend that he enjoyed snapping the bracelet on the snubby girls raw red wrist it was an awkward scenemost awkward every one tried to depart in a body and leave kitty to the mercy of her mamma  but cubbon took her away instead andthe rest isnt worth printing    his chance in life  then a pile of heads be laid   thirty thousand heaped on high all to please the kafir maid   where the oxus ripples by    grimly spake atulla khan   love hath made this thing a man           oattas story  if you go straight away from levees and government house lists past trades ballsfar beyond everything and everybody you ever knew in your respectable lifeyou cross in time the border line where the last drop of white blood ends and the full tide of black sets in it would be easier to talk to a new made duchess on the spur of the moment than to the borderline folk without violating some of their conventions or hurting their feelings the black and the white mix very quaintly in their ways sometimes the white shows in spurts of fierce childish pridewhich is pride of race run crookedand sometimes the black in still fiercer abasement and humility half heathenish customs and strange unaccountable impulses to crime one of these days this people understand they are far lower than the class whence derozio the man who imitated byron sprungwill turn out a writer or a poet and then we shall know how they live and what they feel in the meantime any stories about them cannot be absolutely correct in fact or inference  miss vezzis came from across the borderline to look after some children who belonged to a lady until a regularly ordained nurse could come out the lady said miss vezzis was a bad dirty nurse and inattentive it never struck her that miss vezzis had her own life to lead and her own affairs to worry over and that these affairs were the most important things in the world to miss vezzis  very few mistresses admit this sort of reasoning miss vezzis was as black as a boot and to our standard of taste hideously ugly  she wore cottonprint gowns and bulged shoes and when she lost her temper with the children she abused them in the language of the borderlinewhich is part english part portuguese and part native she was not attractive but she had her pride and she preferred being called miss vezzis  every sunday she dressed herself wonderfully and went to see her mamma who lived for the most part on an old cane chair in a greasy tussursilk dressinggown and a big rabbitwarren of a house full of vezzises pereiras ribieras lisboas and gansalveses and a floating population of loafers besides fragments of the days bazar garlic stale incense clothes thrown on the floor petticoats hung on strings for screens old bottles pewter crucifixes dried immortelles pariah puppies plaster images of the virgin and hats without crowns miss vezzis drew twenty rupees a month for acting as nurse and she squabbled weekly with her mamma as to the percentage to be given towards housekeeping  when the quarrel was over michele dcruze used to shamble across the low mud wall of the compound and make love to miss vezzis after the fashion of the borderline which is hedged about with much ceremony michele was a poor sickly weed and very black but he had his pride he would not be seen smoking a huqa for anything and he looked down on natives as only a man with seven eighths native blood in his veins can the vezzis family had their pride too they traced their descent from a mythical platelayer who had worked on the sone bridge when railways were new in india and they valued their english origin michele was a telegraph signaller on rs 35 a month the fact that he was in government employ made mrs vezzis lenient to the shortcomings of his ancestors  there was a compromising legenddom anna the tailor brought it from poonani that a black jew of cochin had once married into the dcruze family while it was an open secret that an uncle of mrs dcruze was at that very time doing menial work connected with cooking for a club in southern india he sent mrs dcruze seven rupees eight annas a month but she felt the disgrace to the family very keenly all the same  however in the course of a few sundays mrs vezzis brought herself to overlook these blemishes and gave her consent to the marriage of her daughter with michele on condition that michele should have at least fifty rupees a month to start married life upon this wonderful prudence must have been a lingering touch of the mythical platelayers yorkshire blood for across the borderline people take a pride in marrying when they pleasenot when they can  having regard to his departmental prospects miss vezzis might as well have asked michele to go away and come back with the moon in his pocket but michele was deeply in love with miss vezzis and that helped him to endure he accompanied miss vezzis to mass one sunday and after mass walking home through the hot stale dust with her hand in his he swore by several saints whose names would not interest you never to forget miss vezzis and she swore by her honor and the saintsthe oath runs rather curiously in nomine sanctissimae whatever the name of the shesaint is and so forth ending with a kiss on the forehead a kiss on the left cheek and a kiss on the mouthnever to forget michele  next week michele was transferred and miss vezzis dropped tears upon the windowsash of the intermediate compartment as he left the station  if you look at the telegraphmap of india you will see a long line skirting the coast from backergunge to madras michele was ordered to tibasu a little suboffice onethird down this line to send messages on from berhampur to chicacola and to think of miss vezzis and his chances of getting fifty rupees a month out of office hours he had the noise of the bay of bengal and a bengali babu for company nothing more he sent foolish letters with crosses tucked inside the flaps of the envelopes to miss vezzis  when he had been at tibasu for nearly three weeks his chance came  never forget that unless the outward and visible signs of our authority are always before a native he is as incapable as a child of understanding what authority means or where is the danger of disobeying it tibasu was a forgotten little place with a few orissa mohamedans in it these hearing nothing of the collectorsahib for some time and heartily despising the hindu subjudge arranged to start a little mohurrum riot of their own but the hindus turned out and broke their heads when finding lawlessness pleasant hindus and mahomedans together raised an aimless sort of donnybrook just to see how far they could go they looted each others shops and paid off private grudges in the regular way it was a nasty little riot but not worth putting in the newspapers  michele was working in his office when he heard the sound that a man never forgets all his lifethe ahyah of an angry crowd  when that sound drops about three tones and changes to a thick droning ut the man who hears it had better go away if he is alone the native police inspector ran in and told michele that the town was in an uproar and coming to wreck the telegraph office  the babu put on his cap and quietly dropped out of the window while the police inspector afraid but obeying the old raceinstinct which recognizes a drop of white blood as far as it can be diluted saidwhat orders does the sahib give  the sahib decided michele though horribly frightened he felt that for the hour he the man with the cochin jew and the menial uncle in his pedigree was the only representative of english authority in the place then he thought of miss vezzis and the fifty rupees and took the situation on himself there were seven native policemen in tibasu and four crazy smoothbore muskets among them all the men were gray with fear but not beyond leading michele dropped the key of the telegraph instrument and went out at the head of his army to meet the mob as the shouting crew came round a corner of the road he dropped and fired the men behind him loosing instinctively at the same time  the whole crowdcurs to the backboneyelled and ran leaving one man dead and another dying in the road michele was sweating with fear but he kept his weakness under and went down into the town past the house where the sub judge had barricaded himself the streets were empty tibasu was more frightened than michele for the mob had been taken at the right time  michele returned to the telegraphoffice and sent a message to chicacola asking for help before an answer came he received a deputation of the elders of tibasu telling him that the subjudge said his actions generally were unconstitional and trying to bully him but the heart of michele dcruze was big and white in his breast because of his love for miss vezzis the nursegirl and because he had tasted for the first time responsibility and success those two make an intoxicating drink and have ruined more men than ever has whiskey michele answered that the subjudge might say what he pleased but until the assistant collector came the telegraph signaller was the government of india in tibasu and the elders of the town would be held accountable for further rioting then they bowed their heads and said show mercy or words to that effect and went back in great fear each accusing the other of having begun the rioting  early in the dawn after a nights patrol with his seven policemen michele went down the road musket in hand to meet the assistant collector who had ridden in to quell tibasu but in the presence of this young englishman michele felt himself slipping back more and more into the native and the tale of the tibasu riots ended with the strain on the teller in an hysterical outburst of tears bred by sorrow that he had killed a man shame that he could not feel as uplifted as he had felt through the night and childish anger that his tongue could not do justice to his great deeds it was the white drop in micheles veins dying out though he did not know it  but the englishman understood and after he had schooled those men of tibasu and had conferred with the subjudge till that excellent official turned green he found time to draught an official letter describing the conduct of michele which letter filtered through the proper channels and ended in the transfer of michele upcountry once more on the imperial salary of sixtysix rupees a month  so he and miss vezzis were married with great state and ancientry and now there are several little dcruzes sprawling about the verandahs of the central telegraph office  but if the whole revenue of the department he serves were to be his reward michele could never never repeat what he did at tibasu for the sake of miss vezzis the nursegirl  which proves that when a man does good work out of all proportion to his pay in seven cases out of nine there is a woman at the back of the virtue  the two exceptions must have suffered from sunstroke    watches of the night  what is in the brahmins books that is in the brahmins heart neither you nor i knew there was so much evil in the world         hindu proverb  this began in a practical joke but it has gone far enough now and is getting serious  platte the subaltern being poor had a waterbury watch and a plain leather guard  the colonel had a waterbury watch also and for guard the lipstrap of a curbchain lipstraps make the best watch guards  they are strong and short between a lipstrap and an ordinary leather guard there is no great difference between one waterbury watch and another there is none at all every one in the station knew the colonels lipstrap he was not a horsey man but he liked people to believe he had been one once and he wove fantastic stories of the huntingbridle to which this particular lipstrap had belonged otherwise he was painfully religious  platte and the colonel were dressing at the clubboth late for their engagements and both in a hurry that was kismet the two watches were on a shelf below the lookingglassguards hanging down that was carelessness platte changed first snatched a watch looked in the glass settled his tie and ran forty seconds later the colonel did exactly the same thing each man taking the others watch  you may have noticed that many religious people are deeply suspicious they seemfor purely religious purposes of courseto know more about iniquity than the unregenerate perhaps they were specially bad before they became converted at any rate in the imputation of things evil and in putting the worst construction on things innocent a certain type of good people may be trusted to surpass all others the colonel and his wife were of that type but the colonels wife was the worst she manufactured the station scandal and talked to her ayah nothing more need be said the colonels wife broke up the laplacess home the colonels wife stopped the ferrishaughtrey engagement the colonels wife induced young buxton to keep his wife down in the plains through the first year of the marriage whereby little mrs  buxton died and the baby with her these things will be remembered against the colonels wife so long as there is a regiment in the country  but to come back to the colonel and platte they went their several ways from the dressingroom the colonel dined with two chaplains while platte went to a bachelorparty and whist to follow  mark how things happen if plattes sais had put the new saddlepad on the mare the butts of the terrets would not have worked through the worn leather and the old pad into the mares withers when she was coming home at two oclock in the morning she would not have reared bolted fallen into a ditch upset the cart and sent platte flying over an aloehedge on to mrs larkyns wellkept lawn and this tale would never have been written but the mare did all these things and while platte was rolling over and over on the turf like a shot rabbit the watch and guard flew from his waistcoatas an infantry majors sword hops out of the scabbard when they are firing a feu de joieand rolled and rolled in the moonlight till it stopped under a window  platte stuffed his handkerchief under the pad put the cart straight and went home  mark again how kismet works this would not happen once in a hundred years towards the end of his dinner with the two chaplains the colonel let out his waistcoat and leaned over the table to look at some mission reports the bar of the watchguard worked through the buttonhole and the watchplattes watchslid quietly on to the carpet where the bearer found it next morning and kept it  then the colonel went home to the wife of his bosom but the driver of the carriage was drunk and lost his way so the colonel returned at an unseemly hour and his excuses were not accepted if the colonels wife had been an ordinary vessel of wrath appointed for destruction she would have known that when a man stays away on purpose his excuse is always sound and original the very baldness of the colonels explanation proved its truth  see once more the workings of kismet the colonels watch which came with platte hurriedly on to mrs larkyns lawn chose to stop just under mrs larkyns window where she saw it early in the morning recognized it and picked it up she had heard the crash of plattes cart at two oclock that morning and his voice calling the mare names she knew platte and liked him that day she showed him the watch and heard his story he put his head on one side winked and saidhow disgusting shocking old man with his religious training too i should send the watch to the colonels wife and ask for explanations  mrs larkyn thought for a minute of the laplaceswhom she had known when laplace and his wife believed in each otherand answeredi will send it i think it will do her good but remember we must never tell her the truth  platte guessed that his own watch was in the colonels possession and thought that the return of the lipstrapped waterbury with a soothing note from mrs larkyn would merely create a small trouble for a few minutes mrs larkyn knew better she knew that any poison dropped would find good holdingground in the heart of the colonels wife  the packet and a note containing a few remarks on the colonels calling hours were sent over to the colonels wife who wept in her own room and took counsel with herself  if there was one woman under heaven whom the colonels wife hated with holy fervor it was mrs larkyn mrs larkyn was a frivolous lady and called the colonels wife old cat the colonels wife said that somebody in revelations was remarkably like mrs larkyn  she mentioned other scripture people as well from the old testament but the colonels wife was the only person who cared or dared to say anything against mrs larkyn every one else accepted her as an amusing honest little body wherefore to believe that her husband had been shedding watches under that things window at ungodly hours coupled with the fact of his late arrival on the previous night was       at this point she rose up and sought her husband he denied everything except the ownership of the watch she besought him for his souls sake to speak the truth he denied afresh with two bad words then a stony silence held the colonels wife while a man could draw his breath five times  the speech that followed is no affair of mine or yours it was made up of wifely and womanly jealousy knowledge of old age and sunken cheeks deep mistrust born of the text that says even little babies hearts are as bad as they make them rancorous hatred of mrs larkyn and the tenets of the creed of the colonels wifes upbringing  over and above all was the damning lipstrapped waterbury ticking away in the palm of her shaking withered hand at that hour i think the colonels wife realized a little of the restless suspicions she had injected into old laplaces mind a little of poor miss haughtreys misery and some of the canker that ate into buxtons heart as he watched his wife dying before his eyes the colonel stammered and tried to explain then he remembered that his watch had disappeared and the mystery grew greater the colonels wife talked and prayed by turns till she was tired and went away to devise means for chastening the stubborn heart of her husband which translated means in our slang tailtwisting  you see being deeply impressed with the doctrine of original sin she could not believe in the face of appearances she knew too much and jumped to the wildest conclusions  but it was good for her it spoilt her life as she had spoilt the life of the laplaces she had lost her faith in the colonel andhere the creed suspicion came inhe might she argued have erred many times before a merciful providence at the hands of so unworthy an instrument as mrs larkyn had established his guilt  he was a bad wicked grayhaired profligate this may sound too sudden a revulsion for a longwedded wife but it is a venerable fact that if a man or woman makes a practice of and takes a delight in believing and spreading evil of people indifferent to him or her he or she will end in believing evil of folk very near and dear you may think also that the mere incident of the watch was too small and trivial to raise this misunderstanding it is another aged fact that in life as well as racing all the worst accidents happen at little ditches and cutdown fences in the same way you sometimes see a woman who would have made a joan of arc in another century and climate threshing herself to pieces over all the mean worry of housekeeping but that is another story  her belief only made the colonels wife more wretched because it insisted so strongly on the villainy of men remembering what she had done it was pleasant to watch her unhappiness and the pennyfarthing attempts she made to hide it from the station but the station knew and laughed heartlessly for they had heard the story of the watch with much dramatic gesture from mrs larkyns lips  once or twice platte said to mrs larkyn seeing that the colonel had not cleared himselfthis thing has gone far enough i move we tell the colonels wife how it happened mrs larkyn shut her lips and shook her head and vowed that the colonels wife must bear her punishment as best she could now mrs larkyn was a frivolous woman in whom none would have suspected deep hate so platte took no action and came to believe gradually from the colonels silence that the colonel must have run off the line somewhere that night and therefore preferred to stand sentence on the lesser count of rambling into other peoples compounds out of calling hours platte forgot about the watch business after a while and moved downcountry with his regiment mrs larkyn went home when her husbands tour of indian service expired she never forgot  but platte was quite right when he said that the joke had gone too far the mistrust and the tragedy of itwhich we outsiders cannot see and do not believe inare killing the colonels wife and are making the colonel wretched if either of them read this story they can depend upon its being a fairly true account of the case and can kiss and make friends  shakespeare alludes to the pleasure of watching an engineer being shelled by his own battery now this shows that poets should not write about what they do not understand any one could have told him that sappers and gunners are perfectly different branches of the service but if you correct the sentence and substitute gunner for sapper the moral comes just the same    the other man  when the earth was sick and the skies were gray   and the woods were rotted with rain the dead man rode through the autumn day   to visit his love again           old ballad  far back in the seventies before they had built any public offices at simla and the broad road round jakko lived in a pigeonhole in the p w d hovels her parents made miss gaurey marry colonel schreiderling he could not have been much more than thirtyfive years her senior and as he lived on two hundred rupees a month and had money of his own he was well off he belonged to good people and suffered in the cold weather from lung complaints in the hot weather he dangled on the brink of heatapoplexy but it never quite killed him  understand i do not blame schreiderling he was a good husband according to his lights and his temper only failed him when he was being nursed which was some seventeen days in each month he was almost generous to his wife about money matters and that for him was a concession still mrs schreiderling was not happy they married her when she was this side of twenty and had given all her poor little heart to another man i have forgotten his name but we will call him the other man he had no money and no prospects  he was not even goodlooking and i think he was in the commissariat or transport but in spite of all these things she loved him very madly and there was some sort of an engagement between the two when schreiderling appeared and told mrs gaurey that he wished to marry her daughter then the other engagement was broken offwashed away by mrs gaureys tears for that lady governed her house by weeping over disobedience to her authority and the lack of reverence she received in her old age the daughter did not take after her mother she never cried not even at the wedding  the other man bore his loss quietly and was transferred to as bad a station as he could find perhaps the climate consoled him he suffered from intermittent fever and that may have distracted him from his other trouble he was weak about the heart also both ways one of the valves was affected and the fever made it worse  this showed itself later on  then many months passed and mrs schreiderling took to being ill  she did not pine away like people in story books but she seemed to pick up every form of illness that went about a station from simple fever upwards she was never more than ordinarily pretty at the best of times and the illness made her ugly schreiderling said so he prided himself on speaking his mind  when she ceased being pretty he left her to her own devices and went back to the lairs of his bachelordom she used to trot up and down simla mall in a forlorn sort of way with a gray terai hat well on the back of her head and a shocking bad saddle under her  schreiderlings generosity stopped at the horse he said that any saddle would do for a woman as nervous as mrs schreiderling she never was asked to dance because she did not dance well and she was so dull and uninteresting that her box very seldom had any cards in it schreiderling said that if he had known that she was going to be such a scarecrow after her marriage he would never have married her he always prided himself on speaking his mind did schreiderling  he left her at simla one august and went down to his regiment  then she revived a little but she never recovered her looks i found out at the club that the other man is coming up sickvery sickon an off chance of recovery the fever and the heartvalves had nearly killed him she knew that too and she knewwhat i had no interest in knowingwhen he was coming up i suppose he wrote to tell her they had not seen each other since a month before the wedding and here comes the unpleasant part of the story  a late call kept me down at the dovedell hotel till dusk one evening mrs schreidlerling had been flitting up and down the mall all the afternoon in the rain coming up along the cartroad a tonga passed me and my pony tired with standing so long set off at a canter just by the road down to the tonga office mrs schreiderling dripping from head to foot was waiting for the tonga i turned uphill as the tonga was no affair of mine and just then she began to shriek i went back at once and saw under the tonga office lamps mrs schreiderling kneeling in the wet road by the back seat of the newly arrived tonga screaming hideously  then she fell face down in the dirt as i came up  sitting in the back seat very square and firm with one hand on the awning stanchion and the wet pouring off his hat and moustache was the other man dead the sixtymile uphill jolt had been too much for his valve i suppose the tongadriver saidthe sahib died two stages out of solon therefore i tied him with a rope lest he should fall out by the way and so came to simla will the sahib give me bukshish it pointing to the other man should have given one rupee  the other man sat with a grin on his face as if he enjoyed the joke of his arrival and mrs schreiderling in the mud began to groan there was no one except us four in the office and it was raining heavily the first thing was to take mrs schreiderling home and the second was to prevent her name from being mixed up with the affair the tongadriver received five rupees to find a bazar rickshaw for mrs schreiderling he was to tell the tonga babu afterwards of the other man and the babu was to make such arrangements as seemed best  mrs schreiderling was carried into the shed out of the rain and for three quarters of an hour we two waited for the rickshaw the other man was left exactly as he had arrived mrs schreiderling would do everything but cry which might have helped her she tried to scream as soon as her senses came back and then she began praying for the other mans soul had she not been as honest as the day she would have prayed for her own soul too i waited to hear her do this but she did not then i tried to get some of the mud off her habit lastly the rickshaw came and i got her awaypartly by force it was a terrible business from beginning to end but most of all when the rickshaw had to squeeze between the wall and the tonga and she saw by the lamplight that thin yellow hand grasping the awningstanchion  she was taken home just as every one was going to a dance at viceregal lodge peterhoff it was thenand the doctor found that she had fallen from her horse that i had picked her up at the back of jakko and really deserved great credit for the prompt manner in which i had secured medical aid she did not diemen of schreiderlings stamp marry women who dont die easily they live and grow ugly  she never told of her one meeting since her marriage with the other man and when the chill and cough following the exposure of that evening allowed her abroad she never by word or sign alluded to having met me by the tonga office perhaps she never knew  she used to trot up and down the mall on that shocking bad saddle looking as if she expected to meet some one round the corner every minute two years afterward she went home and diedat bournemouth i think  schreiderling when he grew maudlin at mess used to talk about my poor dear wife he always set great store on speaking his mind did schreiderling    consequences  rosicrucian subtleties in the orient had rise ye may find their teachers still under jacatalas hill  seek ye bombast paracelsus read what flood the seeker tells us of the dominant that runs through the cycles of the suns read my story last and see luna at her apogee  there are yearly appointments and twoyearly appointments and fiveyearly appointments at simla and there are or used to be permanent appointments whereon you stayed up for the term of your natural life and secured red cheeks and a nice income of course you could descend in the cold weather for simla is rather dull then  tarrion came from goodness knows whereall away and away in some forsaken part of central india where they call pachmari a sanitarium and drive behind trotting bullocks i believe he belonged to a regiment but what he really wanted to do was to escape from his regiment and live in simla forever and ever he had no preference for anything in particular beyond a good horse and a nice partner he thought he could do everything well which is a beautiful belief when you hold it with all your heart he was clever in many ways and good to look at and always made people round him comfortableeven in central india  so he went up to simla and because he was clever and amusing he gravitated naturally to mrs hauksbee who could forgive everything but stupidity once he did her great service by changing the date on an invitationcard for a big dance which mrs hauksbee wished to attend but couldnt because she had quarrelled with the adc who took care being a mean man to invite her to a small dance on the 6th instead of the big ball of the 26th it was a very clever piece of forgery and when mrs hauksbee showed the adc her invitationcard and chaffed him mildly for not better managing his vendettas he really thought he had made a mistake andwhich was wiserealized that it was no use to fight with mrs hauksbee she was grateful to tarrion and asked what she could do for him he said simply im a freelance up here on leave and on the lookout for what i can loot i havent a square inch of interest in all simla my name isnt known to any man with an appointment in his gift and i want an appointmenta good sound pukka one i believe you can do anything you turn yourself to do will you help me mrs hauksbee thought for a minute and passed the last of her ridingwhip through her lips as was her custom when thinking  then her eyes sparkled and she saidi will and she shook hands on it tarrion having perfect confidence in this great woman took no further thought of the business at all except to wonder what sort of an appointment he would win  mrs hauksbee began calculating the prices of all the heads of departments and members of council she knew and the more she thought the more she laughed because her heart was in the game and it amused her then she took a civil list and ran over a few of the appointments there are some beautiful appointments in the civil list eventually she decided that though tarrion was too good for the political department she had better begin by trying to get him in there what were her own plans to this end does not matter in the least for luck or fate played into her hands and she had nothing to do but to watch the course of events and take the credit of them  all viceroys when they first come out pass through the diplomatic secrecy craze it wears off in time but they all catch it in the beginning because they are new to the country  the particular viceroy who was suffering from the complaint just thenthis was a long time ago before lord dufferin ever came from canada or lord ripon from the bosom of the english churchhad it very badly and the result was that men who were new to keeping official secrets went about looking unhappy and the viceroy plumed himself on the way in which he had instilled notions of reticence into his staff  now the supreme government have a careless custom of committing what they do to printed papers these papers deal with all sorts of thingsfrom the payment of rs 200 to a secret service native up to rebukes administered to vakils and motamids of native states and rather brusque letters to native princes telling them to put their houses in order to refrain from kidnapping women or filling offenders with pounded red pepper and eccentricities of that kind of course these things could never be made public because native princes never err officially and their states are officially as well administered as our territories also the private allowances to various queer people are not exactly matters to put into newspapers though they give quaint reading sometimes  when the supreme government is at simla these papers are prepared there and go round to the people who ought to see them in officeboxes or by post the principle of secrecy was to that viceroy quite as important as the practice and he held that a benevolent despotism like ours should never allow even little things such as appointments of subordinate clerks to leak out till the proper time he was always remarkable for his principles  there was a very important batch of papers in preparation at that time it had to travel from one end of simla to the other by hand  it was not put into an official envelope but a large square palepink one the matter being in ms on soft crinkly paper it was addressed to the head clerk etc etc now between the head clerk etc etc and mrs hauksbee and a flourish is no very great difference if the address be written in a very bad hand as this was the chaprassi who took the envelope was not more of an idiot than most chaprassis he merely forgot where this most unofficial cover was to be delivered and so asked the first englishman he met who happened to be a man riding down to annandale in a great hurry the englishman hardly looked said hauksbee sahib ki mem and went on so did the chaprassi because that letter was the last in stock and he wanted to get his work over there was no book to sign he thrust the letter into mrs hauksbees bearers hands and went off to smoke with a friend  mrs hauksbee was expecting some cutout pattern things in flimsy paper from a friend as soon as she got the big square packet therefore she said oh the dear creature and tore it open with a paperknife and all the ms enclosures tumbled out on the floor  mrs hauksbee began reading i have said the batch was rather important that is quite enough for you to know it referred to some correspondence two measures a peremptory order to a native chief and two dozen other things mrs hauksbee gasped as she read for the first glimpse of the naked machinery of the great indian government stripped of its casings and lacquer and paint and guardrails impresses even the most stupid man and mrs hauksbee was a clever woman she was a little afraid at first and felt as if she had laid hold of a lightningflash by the tail and did not quite know what to do with it there were remarks and initials at the side of the papers and some of the remarks were rather more severe than the papers the initials belonged to men who are all dead or gone now but they were great in their day  mrs hauksbee read on and thought calmly as she read then the value of her trove struck her and she cast about for the best method of using it then tarrion dropped in and they read through all the papers together and tarrion not knowing how she had come by them vowed that mrs hauksbee was the greatest woman on earth  which i believe was true or nearly so  the honest course is always the best said tarrion after an hour and a half of study and conversation all things considered the intelligence branch is about my form either that or the foreign office i go to lay siege to the high gods in their temples  he did not seek a little man or a little big man or a weak head of a strong department but he called on the biggest and strongest man that the government owned and explained that he wanted an appointment at simla on a good salary the compound insolence of this amused the strong man and as he had nothing to do for the moment he listened to the proposals of the audacious tarrion  you have i presume some special qualifications besides the gift of self assertion for the claims you put forwards said the strong man that sir said tarrion is for you to judge then he began for he had a good memory quoting a few of the more important notes in the papersslowly and one by one as a man drops chlorodyne into a glass when he had reached the peremptory orderand it was a peremptory orderthe strong man was troubled  tarrion wound upand i fancy that special knowledge of this kind is at least as valuable for let us say a berth in the foreign office as the fact of being the nephew of a distinguished officers wife that hit the strong man hard for the last appointment to the foreign office had been by black favor and he knew it ill see what i can do for you said the strong man many thanks said tarrion then he left and the strong man departed to see how the appointment was to be blocked                             followed a pause of eleven days with thunders and lightnings and much telegraphing the appointment was not a very important one carrying only between rs 500 and rs 700 a month but as the viceroy said it was the principle of diplomatic secrecy that had to be maintained and it was more than likely that a boy so well supplied with special information would be worth translating so they translated him they must have suspected him though he protested that his information was due to singular talents of his own now much of this story including the afterhistory of the missing envelope you must fill in for yourself because there are reasons why it cannot be written if you do not know about things up above you wont understand how to fill it in and you will say it is impossible  what the viceroy said when tarrion was introduced to him wasso this is the boy who rusked the government of india is it recollect sir that is not done twice so he must have known something  what tarrion said when he saw his appointment gazetted wasif mrs hauksbee were twenty years younger and i her husband i should be viceroy of india in twenty years  what mrs hauksbee said when tarrion thanked her almost with tears in his eyes was firsti told you so and next to herselfwhat fools men are    the conversion of aurelian mcgoggin  ride with an idle whip ride with an unused heel but once in a way there will come a day when the colt must be taught to feel the lash that falls and the curb that galls and the sting of the rowelled steel                lifes handicap  this is not a tale exactly it is a tract and i am immensely proud of it making a tract is a feat  every man is entitled to his own religious opinions but no manleast of all a juniorhas a right to thrust these down other mens throats the government sends out weird civilians now and again but mcgoggin was the queerest exported for a long time he was cleverbrilliantly cleverbut his cleverness worked the wrong way instead of keeping to the study of the vernaculars he had read some books written by a man called comte i think and a man called spencer and a professor clifford you will find these books in the library they deal with peoples insides from the point of view of men who have no stomachs there was no order against his reading them but his mamma should have smacked him  they fermented in his head and he came out to india with a rarefied religion over and above his work it was not much of a creed it only proved that men had no souls and there was no god and no hereafter and that you must worry along somehow for the good of humanity  one of its minor tenets seemed to be that the one thing more sinful than giving an order was obeying it at least that was what mcgoggin said but i suspect he had misread his primers  i do not say a word against this creed it was made up in town where there is nothing but machinery and asphalt and buildingall shut in by the fog naturally a man grows to think that there is no one higher than himself and that the metropolitan board of works made everything but in this country where you really see humanityraw brown naked humanitywith nothing between it and the blazing sky and only the usedup overhandled earth underfoot the notion somehow dies away and most folk come back to simpler theories life in india is not long enough to waste in proving that there is no one in particular at the head of affairs  for this reason the deputy is above the assistant the commissioner above the deputy the lieutenantgovernor above the commissioner and the viceroy above all four under the orders of the secretary of state who is responsible to the empress if the empress be not responsible to her makerif there is no maker for her to be responsible tothe entire system of our administration must be wrong which is manifestly impossible at home men are to be excused they are stalled up a good deal and get intellectually beany when you take a gross beany horse to exercise he slavers and slobbers over the bit till you cant see the horns  but the bit is there just the same men do not get beany in india the climate and the work are against playing bricks with words  if mcgoggin had kept his creed with the capital letters and the endings in isms to himself no one would have cared but his grandfathers on both sides had been wesleyan preachers and the preaching strain came out in his mind he wanted every one at the club to see that they had no souls too and to help him to eliminate his creator as a good many men told him he undoubtedly had no soul because he was so young but it did not follow that his seniors were equally undeveloped and whether there was another world or not a man still wanted to read his papers in this but that is not the pointthat is not the point aurelian used to say then men threw sofa cushions at him and told him to go to any particular place he might believe in they christened him the blastodermhe said he came from a family of that name somewhere in the prehistoric agesand by insult and laughter strove to choke him dumb for he was an unmitigated nuisance at the club besides being an offence to the older men his deputy commissioner who was working on the frontier when aurelian was rolling on a bedquilt told him that for a clever boy aurelian was a very big idiot and you know if he had gone on with his work he would have been caught up to the secretariat in a few years he was just the type that goes thereall head no physique and a hundred theories not a soul was interested in mcgoggins soul he might have had two or none or somebodys elses his business was to obey orders and keep abreast of his files instead of devastating the club with isms  he worked brilliantly but he could not accept any order without trying to better it that was the fault of his creed it made men too responsible and left too much to their honor you can sometimes ride an old horse in a halter but never a colt  mcgoggin took more trouble over his cases than any of the men of his year he may have fancied that thirtypage judgments on fiftyrupee casesboth sides perjured to the gulletadvanced the cause of humanity at any rate he worked too much and worried and fretted over the rebukes he received and lectured away on his ridiculous creed out of office till the doctor had to warn him that he was overdoing it no man can toil eighteen annas in the rupee in june without suffering but mcgoggin was still intellectually beany and proud of himself and his powers and he would take no hint he worked nine hours a day steadily  very well said the doctor youll break down because you are overengined for your beam mcgoggin was a little chap  one day the collapse cameas dramatically as if it had been meant to embellish a tract  it was just before the rains we were sitting in the verandah in the dead hot close air gasping and praying that the blackblue clouds would let down and bring the cool very very far away there was a faint whisper which was the roar of the rains breaking over the river one of the men heard it got out of his chair listened and said naturally enoughthank god  then the blastoderm turned in his place and saidwhy i assure you its only the result of perfectly natural causesatmospheric phenomena of the simplest kind why you should therefore return thanks to a being who never did existwho is only a figment  blastoderm grunted the man in the next chair dry up and throw me over the pioneer we know all about your figments the blastoderm reached out to the table took up one paper and jumped as if something had stung him then he handed the paper over  as i was saying he went on slowly and with an effortdue to perfectly natural causesperfectly natural causes i mean  hi blastoderm youve given me the calcutta mercantile advertiser  the dust got up in little whorls while the treetops rocked and the kites whistled but no one was looking at the coming of the rains  we were all staring at the blastoderm who had risen from his chair and was fighting with his speech then he said still more slowly  perfectly conceivabledictionaryred oakamenablecauseretaining shuttlecockalone  blastoderms drunk said one man but the blastoderm was not drunk he looked at us in a dazed sort of way and began motioning with his hands in the half light as the clouds closed overhead  thenwith a scream  what is itcantreserveattainablemarketobscure  but his speech seemed to freeze in him andjust as the lightning shot two tongues that cut the whole sky into three pieces and the rain fell in quivering sheetsthe blastoderm was struck dumb he stood pawing and champing like a hardheld horse and his eyes were full of terror  the doctor came over in three minutes and heard the story its aphasia he said take him to his room i knew the smash would come we carried the blastoderm across in the pouring rain to his quarters and the doctor gave him bromide of potassium to make him sleep  then the doctor came back to us and told us that aphasia was like all the arrears of punjab head falling in a lump and that only once beforein the case of a sepoyhad he met with so complete a case i myself have seen mild aphasia in an overworked man but this sudden dumbness was uncannythough as the blastoderm himself might have said due to perfectly natural causes  hell have to take leave after this said the doctor he wont be fit for work for another three months no it isnt insanity or anything like it its only complete loss of control over the speech and memory i fancy it will keep the blastoderm quiet though  two days later the blastoderm found his tongue again the first question he asked was what was it the doctor enlightened him  but i cant understand it said the blastoderm im quite sane but i cant be sure of my mind it seemsmy own memorycan i  go up into the hills for three months and dont think about it said the doctor  but i cant understand it repeated the blastoderm it was my own mind and memory  i cant help it said the doctor there are a good many things you cant understand and by the time you have put in my length of service youll know exactly how much a man dare call his own in this world  the stroke cowed the blastoderm he could not understand it he went into the hills in fear and trembling wondering whether he would be permitted to reach the end of any sentence he began  this gave him a wholesome feeling of mistrust the legitimate explanation that he had been overworking himself failed to satisfy him something had wiped his lips of speech as a mother wipes the milky lips of her child and he was afraidhorribly afraid  so the club had rest when he returned and if ever you come across aurelian mcgoggin laying down the law on things humanhe doesnt seem to know as much as he used to about things divineput your forefinger on your lip for a moment and see what happens  dont blame me if he throws a glass at your head    a germ destroyer  pleasant it is for the little tin gods   when great jove nods but little tin gods make their little mistakes   in missing the hour when great jove wakes  as a general rule it is inexpedient to meddle with questions of state in a land where men are highly paid to work them out for you  this tale is a justifiable exception  once in every five years as you know we indent for a new viceroy and each viceroy imports with the rest of his baggage a private secretary who may or may not be the real viceroy just as fate ordains fate looks after the indian empire because it is so big and so helpless  there was a viceroy once who brought out with him a turbulent private secretarya hard man with a soft manner and a morbid passion for work this secretary was called wonderjohn fennil wonder the viceroy possessed no namenothing but a string of counties and twothirds of the alphabet after them he said in confidence that he was the electroplated figurehead of a golden administration and he watched in a dreamy amused way wonders attempts to draw matters which were entirely outside his province into his own hands when we are all cherubims together said his excellency once my dear good friend wonder will head the conspiracy for plucking out gabriels tailfeathers or stealing peters keys then i shall report him  but though the viceroy did nothing to check wonders officiousness other people said unpleasant things maybe the members of council began it but finally all simla agreed that there was too much wonder and too little viceroy in that regime wonder was always quoting his excellency it was his excellency this his excellency that in the opinion of his excellency and so on the viceroy smiled but he did not heed  he said that so long as his old men squabbled with his dear good wonder they might be induced to leave the immemorial east in peace  no wise man has a policy said the viceroy a policy is the blackmail levied on the fool by the unforeseen i am not the former and i do not believe in the latter  i do not quite see what this means unless it refers to an insurance policy perhaps it was the viceroys way of sayinglie low  that season came up to simla one of these crazy people with only a single idea these are the men who make things move but they are not nice to talk to this mans name was mellish and he had lived for fifteen years on land of his own in lower bengal studying cholera he held that cholera was a germ that propagated itself as it flew through a muggy atmosphere and stuck in the branches of trees like a woolflake the germ could be rendered sterile he said by mellishs own invincible fumigatorya heavy violetblack powder the result of fifteen years scientific investigation sir  inventors seem very much alike as a caste they talk loudly especially about conspiracies of monopolists they beat upon the table with their fists and they secrete fragments of their inventions about their persons  mellish said that there was a medical ring at simla headed by the surgeon general who was in league apparently with all the hospital assistants in the empire i forget exactly how he proved it but it had something to do with skulking up to the hills and what mellish wanted was the independent evidence of the viceroysteward of our most gracious majesty the queen sir so mellish went up to simla with eightyfour pounds of fumigatory in his trunk to speak to the viceroy and to show him the merits of the invention  but it is easier to see a viceroy than to talk to him unless you chance to be as important as mellishe of madras he was a sixthousandrupee man so great that his daughters never married they contracted alliances he himself was not paid he received emoluments and his journeys about the country were tours of observation his business was to stir up the people in madras with a long poleas you stir up stench in a pondand the people had to come up out of their comfortable old ways and gaspthis is enlightenment and progress isnt it fine then they gave mellishe statues and jasmine garlands in the hope of getting rid of him  mellishe came up to simla to confer with the viceroy that was one of his perquisites the viceroy knew nothing of mellishe except that he was one of those middleclass deities who seem necessary to the spiritual comfort of this paradise of the middleclasses and that in all probability he had suggested designed founded and endowed all the public institutions in madras which proves that his excellency though dreamy had experience of the ways of sixthousandrupee men  mellishes name was e mellishe and mellishs was e s mellish and they were both staying at the same hotel and the fate that looks after the indian empire ordained that wonder should blunder and drop the final e that the chaprassi should help him and that the note which ran dear mr mellish can you set aside your other engagements and lunch with us at two tomorrow his excellency has an hour at your disposal then should be given to mellish with the fumigatory he nearly wept with pride and delight and at the appointed hour cantered off to peterhoff a big paperbag full of the fumigatory in his coattail pockets he had his chance and he meant to make the most of it mellishe of madras had been so portentously solemn about his conference that wonder had arranged for a private tiffinno adcs no wonder no one but the viceroy who said plaintively that he feared being left alone with unmuzzled autocrats like the great mellishe of madras  but his guest did not bore the viceroy on the contrary he amused him mellish was nervously anxious to go straight to his fumigatory and talked at random until tiffin was over and his excellency asked him to smoke the viceroy was pleased with mellish because he did not talk shop  as soon as the cheroots were lit mellish spoke like a man beginning with his choleratheory reviewing his fifteen years scientific labors the machinations of the simla ring and the excellence of his fumigatory while the viceroy watched him between halfshut eyes and thought evidently this is the wrong tiger but it is an original animal mellishs hair was standing on end with excitement and he stammered he began groping in his coattails and before the viceroy knew what was about to happen he had tipped a bagful of his powder into the big silver ashtray  jjjudge for yourself sir said mellish y excellency shall judge for yourself absolutely infallible on my honor  he plunged the lighted end of his cigar into the powder which began to smoke like a volcano and send up fat greasy wreaths of coppercolored smoke in five seconds the room was filled with a most pungent and sickening stencha reek that took fierce hold of the trap of your windpipe and shut it the powder then hissed and fizzed and sent out blue and green sparks and the smoke rose till you could neither see nor breathe nor gasp mellish however was used to it  nitrate of strontia he shouted baryta bonemeal etcetera thousand cubic feet smoke per cubic inch not a germ could livenot a germ y excellency  but his excellency had fled and was coughing at the foot of the stairs while all peterhoff hummed like a hive red lancers came in and the head chaprassi who speaks english came in and macebearers came in and ladies ran downstairs screaming fire for the smoke was drifting through the house and oozing out of the windows and bellying along the verandahs and wreathing and writhing across the gardens no one could enter the room where mellish was lecturing on his fumigatory till that unspeakable powder had burned itself out  then an aidedecamp who desired the v c rushed through the rolling clouds and hauled mellish into the hall the viceroy was prostrate with laughter and could only waggle his hands feebly at mellish who was shaking a fresh bagful of powder at him  glorious glorious sobbed his excellency not a germ as you justly observe could exist i can swear it a magnificent success  then he laughed till the tears came and wonder who had caught the real mellishe snorting on the mall entered and was deeply shocked at the scene but the viceroy was delighted because he saw that wonder would presently depart mellish with the fumigatory was also pleased for he felt that he had smashed the simla medical ring                              few men could tell a story like his excellency when he took the trouble and the account of my dear good wonders friend with the powder went the round of simla and flippant folk made wonder unhappy by their remarks  but his excellency told the tale once too oftenfor wonder as he meant to do it was at a seepee picnic wonder was sitting just behind the viceroy  and i really thought for a moment wound up his excellency that my dear good wonder had hired an assassin to clear his way to the throne  every one laughed but there was a delicate subtinkle in the viceroys tone which wonder understood he found that his health was giving way and the viceroy allowed him to go and presented him with a flaming character for use at home among big people  my fault entirely said his excellency in after seasons with a twinkling in his eye my inconsistency must always have been distasteful to such a masterly man    kidnapped  there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken any way you please is bad and strands them in forsaken guts and creeks no decent soul would think of visiting  you cannot stop the tide but now and then you may arrest some rash adventurer whohmwill hardly thank you for your pains              vibarts moralities  we are a highcaste and enlightened race and infantmarriage is very shocking and the consequences are sometimes peculiar but nevertheless the hindu notionwhich is the continental notionwhich is the aboriginal notionof arranging marriages irrespective of the personal inclinations of the married is sound think for a minute and you will see that it must be so unless of course you believe in affinities in which case you had better not read this tale how can a man who has never married who cannot be trusted to pick up at sight a moderately sound horse whose head is hot and upset with visions of domestic felicity go about the choosing of a wife he cannot see straight or think straight if he tries and the same disadvantages exist in the case of a girls fancies but when mature married and discreet people arrange a match between a boy and a girl they do it sensibly with a view to the future and the young couple live happily ever afterwards as everybody knows  properly speaking government should establish a matrimonial department efficiently officered with a jury of matrons a judge of the chief court a senior chaplain and an awful warning in the shape of a lovematch that has gone wrong chained to the trees in the courtyard all marriages should be made through the department which might be subordinate to the educational department under the same penalty as that attaching to the transfer of land without a stamped document but government wont take suggestions it pretends that it is too busy however i will put my notion on record and explain the example that illustrates the theory  once upon a time there was a good young mana firstclass officer in his own departmenta man with a career before him and possibly a k c g e at the end of it all his superiors spoke well of him because he knew how to hold his tongue and his pen at the proper times there are today only eleven men in india who possess this secret and they have all with one exception attained great honor and enormous incomes  this good young man was quiet and selfcontainedtoo old for his years by far which always carries its own punishment had a subaltern or a tea planters assistant or anybody who enjoys life and has no care for tomorrow done what he tried to do not a soul would have cared but when peythroppethe estimable virtuous economical quiet hardworking young peythroppefell there was a flutter through five departments  the manner of his fall was in this way he met a miss castriesdcastries it was originally but the family dropped the d for administrative reasonsand he fell in love with her even more energetically than he worked understand clearly that there was not a breath of a word to be said against miss castriesnot a shadow of a breath she was good and very lovelypossessed what innocent people at home call a spanish complexion with thick blue black hair growing low down on her forehead into a widows peak and big violet eyes under eyebrows as black and as straight as the borders of a gazette extraordinary when a big man dies butbutbut well she was a very sweet girl and very pious but for many reasons she was impossible quite so all good mammas know what impossible means it was obviously absurd that peythroppe should marry her the little opaltinted onyx at the base of her fingernails said this as plainly as print further marriage with miss castries meant marriage with several other castrieshonorary lieutenant castries her papa mrs eulalie castries her mamma and all the ramifications of the castries family on incomes ranging from rs 175 to rs 470 a month and their wives and connections again  it would have been cheaper for peythroppe to have assaulted a commissioner with a dogwhip or to have burned the records of a deputy commissioners office than to have contracted an alliance with the castries it would have weighted his aftercareer lesseven under a government which never forgets and never forgives  everybody saw this but peythroppe he was going to marry miss castries he wasbeing of age and drawing a good incomeand woe betide the house that would not afterwards receive mrs virginie saulez peythroppe with the deference due to her husbands rank  that was peythroppes ultimatum and any remonstrance drove him frantic  these sudden madnesses most afflict the sanest men there was a case oncebut i will tell you of that later on you cannot account for the mania except under a theory directly contradicting the one about the place wherein marriages are made peythroppe was burningly anxious to put a millstone round his neck at the outset of his career and argument had not the least effect on him he was going to marry miss castries and the business was his own business  he would thank you to keep your advice to yourself with a man in this condition mere words only fix him in his purpose of course he cannot see that marriage out here does not concern the individual but the government he serves  do you remember mrs hauksbeethe most wonderful woman in india she saved pluffles from mrs reiver won tarrion his appointment in the foreign office and was defeated in open field by mrs cusackbremmil she heard of the lamentable condition of peythroppe and her brain struck out the plan that saved him she had the wisdom of the serpent the logical coherence of the man the fearlessness of the child and the triple intuition of the woman neverno neveras long as a tonga buckets down the solon dip or the couples go ariding at the back of summer hill will there be such a genius as mrs hauksbee she attended the consultation of three men on peythroppes case and she stood up with the lash of her ridingwhip between her lips and spake                              three weeks later peythroppe dined with the three men and the gazette of india came in peythroppe found to his surprise that he had been gazetted a months leave dont ask me how this was managed i believe firmly that if mrs hauksbee gave the order the whole great indian administration would stand on its head  the three men had also a months leave each peythroppe put the gazette down and said bad words then there came from the compound the soft padpad of camelsthieves camels the bikaneer breed that dont bubble and howl when they sit down and get up  after that i dont know what happened this much is certain  peythroppe disappearedvanished like smokeand the long footrest chair in the house of the three men was broken to splinters also a bedstead departed from one of the bedrooms  mrs hauksbee said that mr peythroppe was shooting in rajputana with the three men so we were compelled to believe her  at the end of the month peythroppe was gazetted twenty days extension of leave but there was wrath and lamentation in the house of castries the marriageday had been fixed but the bridegroom never came and the dsilvas pereiras and ducketts lifted their voices and mocked honorary lieutenant castries as one who had been basely imposed upon mrs hauksbee went to the wedding and was much astonished when peythroppe did not appear after seven weeks peythroppe and the three men returned from rajputana peythroppe was in hard tough condition rather white and more selfcontained than ever  one of the three men had a cut on his nose cause by the kick of a gun twelvebores kick rather curiously  then came honorary lieutenant castries seeking for the blood of his perfidious soninlaw to be he said thingsvulgar and impossible things which showed the raw rough ranker below the honorary and i fancy peythroppes eyes were opened anyhow he held his peace till the end when he spoke briefly honorary lieutenant castries asked for a peg before he went away to die or bring a suit for breach of promise  miss castries was a very good girl she said that she would have no breach of promise suits she said that if she was not a lady she was refined enough to know that ladies kept their broken hearts to themselves and as she ruled her parents nothing happened later on she married a most respectable and gentlemanly person he travelled for an enterprising firm in calcutta and was all that a good husband should be  so peythroppe came to his right mind again and did much good work and was honored by all who knew him one of these days he will marry but he will marry a sweet pinkandwhite maiden on the government house list with a little money and some influential connections as every wise man should and he will never all his life tell her what happened during the seven weeks of his shootingtour in rajputana  but just think how much trouble and expensefor camel hire is not cheap and those bikaneer brutes had to be fed like humansmight have been saved by a properly conducted matrimonial department under the control of the director general of education but corresponding direct with the viceroy    the arrest of lieutenant golightly  ive forgotten the countersign sez e  oh

more than another it was looking like an officer and a gentleman he said it was for the honor of the service that he attired himself so elaborately but those who knew him best said that it was just personal vanity there was no harm about golightly not an ounce  he recognized a horse when he saw one and could do more than fill a cantle he played a very fair game at billiards and was a sound man at the whist table everyone liked him and nobody ever dreamed of seeing him handcuffed on a station platform as a deserter but this sad thing happened  he was going down from dalhousie at the end of his leaveriding down he had cut his leave as fine as he dared and wanted to come down in a hurry  it was fairly warm at dalhousie and knowing what to expect below he descended in a new khaki suittight fittingof a delicate olivegreen a peacockblue tie white collar and a snowy white solah helmet he prided himself on looking neat even when he was riding post he did look neat and he was so deeply concerned about his appearance before he started that he quite forgot to take anything but some small change with him he left all his notes at the hotel his servants had gone down the road before him to be ready in waiting at pathankote with a change of gear that was what he called travelling in light marchingorder he was proud of his faculty of organizationwhat we call bundobust  twentytwo miles out of dalhousie it began to rainnot a mere hillshower but a good tepid monsoonish downpour golightly bustled on wishing that he had brought an umbrella the dust on the roads turned into mud and the pony mired a good deal so did golightlys khaki gaiters but he kept on steadily and tried to think how pleasant the coolth was  his next pony was rather a brute at starting and golightlys hands being slippery with the rain contrived to get rid of golightly at a corner he chased the animal caught it and went ahead briskly  the spill had not improved his clothes or his temper and he had lost one spur he kept the other one employed by the time that stage was ended the pony had had as much exercise as he wanted and in spite of the rain golightly was sweating freely at the end of another miserable halfhour golightly found the world disappear before his eyes in clammy pulp the rain had turned the pith of his huge and snowy solahtopee into an evilsmelling dough and it had closed on his head like a halfopened mushroom also the green lining was beginning to run  golightly did not say anything worth recording here he tore off and squeezed up as much of the brim as was in his eyes and ploughed on the back of the helmet was flapping on his neck and the sides stuck to his ears but the leather band and green lining kept things roughly together so that the hat did not actually melt away where it flapped  presently the pulp and the green stuff made a sort of slimy mildew which ran over golightly in several directionsdown his back and bosom for choice the khaki color ran tooit was really shockingly bad dyeand sections of golightly were brown and patches were violet and contours were ochre and streaks were ruddy red and blotches were nearly white according to the nature and peculiarities of the dye when he took out his handkerchief to wipe his face and the green of the hatlining and the purple stuff that had soaked through on to his neck from the tie became thoroughly mixed the effect was amazing  near dhar the rain stopped and the evening sun came out and dried him up slightly it fixed the colors too three miles from pathankote the last pony fell dead lame and golightly was forced to walk he pushed on into pathankote to find his servants he did not know then that his khitmatgar had stopped by the roadside to get drunk and would come on the next day saying that he had sprained his ankle when he got into pathankote he couldnt find his servants his boots were stiff and ropy with mud and there were large quantities of dirt about his body the blue tie had run as much as the khaki so he took it off with the collar and threw it away then he said something about servants generally and tried to get a peg he paid eight annas for the drink and this revealed to him that he had only six annas more in his pocket or in the world as he stood at that hour  he went to the stationmaster to negotiate for a firstclass ticket to khasa where he was stationed the bookingclerk said something to the station master the stationmaster said something to the telegraph clerk and the three looked at him with curiosity they asked him to wait for halfanhour while they telegraphed to umritsar for authority so he waited and four constables came and grouped themselves picturesquely round him just as he was preparing to ask them to go away the stationmaster said that he would give the sahib a ticket to umritsar if the sahib would kindly come inside the bookingoffice golightly stepped inside and the next thing he knew was that a constable was attached to each of his legs and arms while the station master was trying to cram a mailbag over his head  there was a very fair scuffle all round the bookingoffice and golightly received a nasty cut over his eye through falling against a table but the constables were too much for him and they and the stationmaster handcuffed him securely as soon as the mailbag was slipped he began expressing his opinions and the headconstable saidwithout doubt this is the soldier englishman we required listen to the abuse then golightly asked the stationmaster what the this and the that the proceedings meant the station master told him he was private john binkle of theregiment 5 ft 9 in fair hair gray eyes and a dissipated appearance no marks on the body who had deserted a fortnight ago golightly began explaining at great length and the more he explained the less the stationmaster believed him he said that no lieutenant could look such a ruffian as did golightly and that his instructions were to send his capture under proper escort to umritsar golightly was feeling very damp and uncomfortable and the language he used was not fit for publication even in an expurgated form the four constables saw him safe to umritsar in an intermediate compartment and he spent the fourhour journey in abusing them as fluently as his knowledge of the vernaculars allowed  at umritsar he was bundled out on the platform into the arms of a corporal and two men of theregiment golightly drew himself up and tried to carry off matters jauntily he did not feel too jaunty in handcuffs with four constables behind him and the blood from the cut on his forehead stiffening on his left cheek the corporal was not jocular either golightly got as far asthis is a very absurd mistake my men when the corporal told him to stow his lip and come along golightly did not want to come along he desired to stop and explain he explained very well indeed until the corporal cut in withyou a orficer its the like o you as brings disgrace on the likes of us bloomin fine orficer you are i know your regiment the rogues march is the quickstep where you come from youre a black shame to the service  golightly kept his temper and began explaining all over again from the beginning then he was marched out of the rain into the refreshmentroom and told not to make a qualified fool of himself  the men were going to run him up to fort govindghar and running up is a performance almost as undignified as the frog march  golightly was nearly hysterical with rage and the chill and the mistake and the handcuffs and the headache that the cut on his forehead had given him he really laid himself out to express what was in his mind when he had quite finished and his throat was feeling dry one of the men saidive eard a few beggars in the click blind stiff and crack on a bit but ive never eard any one to touch this ere orficer they were not angry with him they rather admired him they had some beer at the refreshmentroom and offered golightly some too because he had swore wonerful they asked him to tell them all about the adventures of private john binkle while he was loose on the countryside and that made golightly wilder than ever if he had kept his wits about him he would have kept quiet until an officer came but he attempted to run  now the butt of a martini in the small of your back hurts a great deal and rotten rainsoaked khaki tears easily when two men are jerking at your collar  golightly rose from the floor feeling very sick and giddy with his shirt ripped open all down his breast and nearly all down his back  he yielded to his luck and at that point the downtrain from lahore came in carrying one of golightlys majors  this is the majors evidence in full  there was the sound of a scuffle in the secondclass refreshmentroom so i went in and saw the most villainous loafer that i ever set eyes on his boots and breeches were plastered with mud and beerstains he wore a muddywhite dunghill sort of thing on his head and it hung down in slips on his shoulders which were a good deal scratched he was half in and half out of a shirt as nearly in two pieces as it could be and he was begging the guard to look at the name on the tail of it as he had rucked the shirt all over his head i couldnt at first see who he was but i fancied that he was a man in the first stage of d t from the way he swore while he wrestled with his rags when he turned round and i had made allowance for a lump as big as a porkpie over one eye and some green warpaint on the face and some violet stripes round the neck i saw that it was golightly he was very glad to see me said the major and he hoped i would not tell the mess about it i didnt but you can if you like now that golightly has gone home  golightly spent the greater part of that summer in trying to get the corporal and the two soldiers tried by courtmartial for arresting an officer and a gentleman they were of course very sorry for their error but the tale leaked into the regimental canteen and thence ran about the province    the house of suddhoo  a stones throw out on either hand from that wellordered road we tread   and all the world is wild and strange churel and ghoul and djinn and sprite shall bear us company tonight for we have reached the oldest land   wherein the powers of darkness range       from the dusk to the dawn  the house of suddhoo near the taksali gate is twostoried with four carved windows of old brown wood and a flat roof you may recognize it by five red handprints arranged like the five of diamonds on the whitewash between the upper windows bhagwan dass the bunnia and a man who says he gets his living by sealcutting live in the lower story with a troop of wives servants friends and retainers the two upper rooms used to be occupied by janoo and azizun and a little blackandtan terrier that was stolen from an englishmans house and given to janoo by a soldier today only janoo lives in the upper rooms suddhoo sleeps on the roof generally except when he sleeps in the street he used to go to peshawar in the cold weather to visit his son who sells curiosities near the edwardes gate and then he slept under a real mud roof  suddhoo is a great friend of mine because his cousin had a son who secured thanks to my recommendation the post of headmessenger to a big firm in the station suddhoo says that god will make me a lieutenantgovernor one of these days i daresay his prophecy will come true he is very very old with white hair and no teeth worth showing and he has outlived his witsoutlived nearly everything except his fondness for his son at peshawar janoo and azizun are kashmiris ladies of the city and theirs was an ancient and more or less honorable profession but azizun has since married a medical student from the northwest and has settled down to a most respectable life somewhere near bareilly bhagwan dass is an extortionate and an adulterator he is very rich the man who is supposed to get his living by sealcutting pretends to be very poor  this lets you know as much as is necessary of the four principal tenants in the house of suddhoo then there is me of course but i am only the chorus that comes in at the end to explain things so i do not count  suddhoo was not clever the man who pretended to cut seals was the cleverest of them allbhagwan dass only knew how to lieexcept janoo she was also beautiful but that was her own affair  suddhoos son at peshawar was attacked by pleurisy and old suddhoo was troubled the sealcutter man heard of suddhoos anxiety and made capital out of it he was abreast of the times he got a friend in peshawar to telegraph daily accounts of the sons health  and here the story begins  suddhoos cousins son told me one evening that suddhoo wanted to see me that he was too old and feeble to come personally and that i should be conferring an everlasting honor on the house of suddhoo if i went to him i went but i think seeing how welloff suddhoo was then that he might have sent something better than an ekka which jolted fearfully to haul out a future lieutenantgovernor to the city on a muggy april evening the ekka did not run quickly  it was full dark when we pulled up opposite the door of ranjit singhs tomb near the main gate of the fort here was suddhoo and he said that by reason of my condescension it was absolutely certain that i should become a lieutenantgovernor while my hair was yet black then we talked about the weather and the state of my health and the wheat crops for fifteen minutes in the huzuri bagh under the stars  suddhoo came to the point at last he said that janoo had told him that there was an order of the sirkar against magic because it was feared that magic might one day kill the empress of india i didnt know anything about the state of the law but i fancied that something interesting was going to happen i said that so far from magic being discouraged by the government it was highly commended  the greatest officials of the state practiced it themselves if the financial statement isnt magic i dont know what is then to encourage him further i said that if there was any jadoo afoot i had not the least objection to giving it my countenance and sanction and to seeing that it was clean jadoo white magic as distinguished from the unclean jadoo which kills folk it took a long time before suddhoo admitted that this was just what he had asked me to come for then he told me in jerks and quavers that the man who said he cut seals was a sorcerer of the cleanest kind that every day he gave suddhoo news of the sick son in peshawar more quickly than the lightning could fly and that this news was always corroborated by the letters further that he had told suddhoo how a great danger was threatening his son which could be removed by clean jadoo and of course heavy payment i began to see how the land lay and told suddhoo that i also understood a little jadoo in the western line and would go to his house to see that everything was done decently and in order we set off together and on the way suddhoo told me he had paid the sealcutter between one hundred and two hundred rupees already and the jadoo of that night would cost two hundred more which was cheap he said considering the greatness of his sons danger but i do not think he meant it  the lights were all cloaked in the front of the house when we arrived i could hear awful noises from behind the sealcutters shopfront as if some one were groaning his soul out suddhoo shook all over and while we groped our way upstairs told me that the jadoo had begun janoo and azizun met us at the stairhead and told us that the jadoowork was coming off in their rooms because there was more space there janoo is a lady of a freethinking turn of mind she whispered that the jadoo was an invention to get money out of suddhoo and that the sealcutter would go to a hot place when he died suddhoo was nearly crying with fear and old age he kept walking up and down the room in the half light repeating his sons name over and over again and asking azizun if the sealcutter ought not to make a reduction in the case of his own landlord  janoo pulled me over to the shadow in the recess of the carved bowwindows the boards were up and the rooms were only lit by one tiny lamp there was no chance of my being seen if i stayed still  presently the groans below ceased and we heard steps on the staircase that was the sealcutter he stopped outside the door as the terrier barked and azizun fumbled at the chain and he told suddhoo to blow out the lamp this left the place in jet darkness except for the red glow from the two huqas that belonged to janoo and azizun the sealcutter came in and i heard suddhoo throw himself down on the floor and groan azizun caught her breath and janoo backed to one of the beds with a shudder there was a clink of something metallic and then shot up a pale bluegreen flame near the ground the light was just enough to show azizun pressed against one corner of the room with the terrier between her knees janoo with her hands clasped leaning forward as she sat on the bed suddhoo face down quivering and the sealcutter  i hope i may never see another man like that sealcutter he was stripped to the waist with a wreath of white jasmine as thick as my wrist round his forehead a salmoncolored loincloth round his middle and a steel bangle on each ankle this was not aweinspiring it was the face of the man that turned me cold it was bluegray in the first place in the second the eyes were rolled back till you could only see the whites of them and in the third the face was the face of a demona ghoulanything you please except of the sleek oily old ruffian who sat in the daytime over his turninglathe downstairs he was lying on his stomach with his arms turned and crossed behind him as if he had been thrown down pinioned his head and neck were the only parts of him off the floor they were nearly at right angles to the body like the head of a cobra at spring it was ghastly in the centre of the room on the bare earth floor stood a big deep brass basin with a pale blue green light floating in the centre like a nightlight round that basin the man on the floor wriggled himself three times how he did it i do not know i could see the muscles ripple along his spine and fall smooth again but i could not see any other motion  the head seemed the only thing alive about him except that slow curl and uncurl of the laboring backmuscles janoo from the bed was breathing seventy to the minute azizun held her hands before her eyes and old suddhoo fingering at the dirt that had got into his white beard was crying to himself the horror of it was that the creeping crawly thing made no sound only crawled and remember this lasted for ten minutes while the terrier whined and azizun shuddered and janoo gasped and suddhoo cried  i felt the hair lift at the back of my head and my heart thump like a thermantidote paddle luckily the sealcutter betrayed himself by his most impressive trick and made me calm again after he had finished that unspeakable triple crawl he stretched his head away from the floor as high as he could and sent out a jet of fire from his nostrils now i knew how fire spouting is donei can do it myselfso i felt at ease the business was a fraud if he had only kept to that crawl without trying to raise the effect goodness knows what i might not have thought both the girls shrieked at the jet of fire and the head dropped chin down on the floor with a thud the whole body lying then like a corpse with its arms trussed  there was a pause of five full minutes after this and the bluegreen flame died down janoo stooped to settle one of her anklets while azizun turned her face to the wall and took the terrier in her arms suddhoo put out an arm mechanically to janoos huqa and she slid it across the floor with her foot directly above the body and on the wall were a couple of flaming portraits in stamped paper frames of the queen and the prince of wales they looked down on the performance and to my thinking seemed to heighten the grotesqueness of it all  just when the silence was getting unendurable the body turned over and rolled away from the basin to the side of the room where it lay stomach up there was a faint plop from the basinexactly like the noise a fish makes when it takes a flyand the green light in the centre revived  i looked at the basin and saw bobbing in the water the dried shrivelled black head of a native babyopen eyes open mouth and shaved scalp it was worse being so very sudden than the crawling exhibition we had no time to say anything before it began to speak  read poes account of the voice that came from the mesmerized dying man and you will realize less than onehalf of the horror of that heads voice  there was an interval of a second or two between each word and a sort of ring ring ring in the note of the voice like the timbre of a bell it pealed slowly as if talking to itself for several minutes before i got rid of my cold sweat then the blessed solution struck me i looked at the body lying near the doorway and saw just where the hollow of the throat joins on the shoulders a muscle that had nothing to do with any mans regular breathing twitching away steadily the whole thing was a careful reproduction of the egyptian teraphin that one read about sometimes and the voice was as clever and as appalling a piece of ventriloquism as one could wish to hear all this time the head was lipliplapping against the side of the basin and speaking it told suddhoo on his face again whining of his sons illness and of the state of the illness up to the evening of that very night i always shall respect the sealcutter for keeping so faithfully to the time of the peshawar telegrams it went on to say that skilled doctors were night and day watching over the mans life and that he would eventually recover if the fee to the potent sorcerer whose servant was the head in the basin were doubled  here the mistake from the artistic point of view came in to ask for twice your stipulated fee in a voice that lazarus might have used when he rose from the dead is absurd janoo who is really a woman of masculine intellect saw this as quickly as i did i heard her say asli nahin fareib scornfully under her breath and just as she said so the light in the basin died out the head stopped talking and we heard the room door creak on its hinges then janoo struck a match lit the lamp and we saw that head basin and seal cutter were gone suddhoo was wringing his hands and explaining to any one who cared to listen that if his chances of eternal salvation depended on it he could not raise another two hundred rupees azizun was nearly in hysterics in the corner while janoo sat down composedly on one of the beds to discuss the probabilities of the whole thing being a bunao or makeup  i explained as much as i knew of the sealcutters way of jadoo but her argument was much more simplethe magic that is always demanding gifts is no true magic said she my mother told me that the only potent lovespells are those which are told you for love this sealcutter man is a liar and a devil i dare not tell do anything or get anything done because i am in debt to bhagwan dass the bunnia for two gold rings and a heavy anklet i must get my food from his shop the sealcutter is the friend of bhagwan dass and he would poison my food a fools jadoo has been going on for ten days and has cost suddhoo many rupees each night the sealcutter used black hens and lemons and mantras before he never showed us anything like this till tonight azizun is a fool and will be a purdah nashin soon suddhoo has lost his strength and his wits see now i had hoped to get from suddhoo many rupees while he lived and many more after his death and behold he is spending everything on that offspring of a devil and a sheass the seal cutter  here i saidbut what induced suddhoo to drag me into the business of course i can speak to the sealcutter and he shall refund the whole thing is childs talkshameand senseless  suddhoo is an old child said janoo he has lived on the roofs these seventy years and is as senseless as a milchgoat he brought you here to assure himself that he was not breaking any law of the sirkar whose salt he ate many years ago he worships the dust off the feet of the sealcutter and that cowdevourer has forbidden him to go and see his son what does suddhoo know of your laws or the lightningpost i have to watch his money going day by day to that lying beast below  janoo stamped her foot on the floor and nearly cried with vexation while suddhoo was whimpering under a blanket in the corner and azizun was trying to guide the pipestem to his foolish old mouth                              now the case stands thus unthinkingly i have laid myself open to the charge of aiding and abetting the sealcutter in obtaining money under false pretences which is forbidden by section 420 of the indian penal code i am helpless in the matter for these reasons i cannot inform the police what witnesses would support my statements janoo refuses flatly azizun is a veiled woman somewhere near bareillylost in this big india of ours i cannot again take the law into my own hands and speak to the sealcutter for certain am i that not only would suddhoo disbelieve me but this step would end in the poisoning of janoo who is bound hand and foot by her debt to the bunnia suddhoo is an old dotard and whenever we meet mumbles my idiotic joke that the sirkar rather patronizes the black art than otherwise his son is well now but suddhoo is completely under the influence of the sealcutter by whose advice he regulates the affairs of his life janoo watches daily the money that she hoped to wheedle out of suddhoo taken by the sealcutter and becomes daily more furious and sullen  she will never tell because she dare not but unless something happens to prevent her i am afraid that the sealcutter will die of cholerathe white arsenic kindabout the middle of may and thus i shall have to be privy to a murder in the house of suddhoo    his wedded wife  cry murder in the marketplace and each will turn upon his neighbor anxious eyes that askart thou the man we hunted cain some centuries ago across the world that bred the fear our own misdeeds maintain today            vibarts moralities  shakespeare says something about worms or it may be giants or beetles turning if you tread on them too severely the safest plan is never to tread on a wormnot even on the last new subaltern from home with his buttons hardly out of their tissue paper and the red of sappy english beef in his cheeks this is the story of the worm that turned for the sake of brevity we will call henry augustus ramsay faizanne the worm although he really was an exceedingly pretty boy without a hair on his face and with a waist like a girls when he came out to the second shikarris and was made unhappy in several ways the shikarris are a highcaste regiment and you must be able to do things wellplay a banjo or ride more than a little or sing or act to get on with them  the worm did nothing except fall off his pony and knock chips out of gate posts with his trap even that became monotonous after a time he objected to whist cut the cloth at billiards sang out of tune kept very much to himself and wrote to his mamma and sisters at home four of these five things were vices which the shikarris objected to and set themselves to eradicate every one knows how subalterns are by brother subalterns softened and not permitted to be ferocious it is good and wholesome and does no one any harm unless tempers are lost and then there is trouble there was a man oncebut that is another story  the shikarris shikarred the worm very much and he bore everything without winking he was so good and so anxious to learn and flushed so pink that his education was cut short and he was left to his own devices by every one except the senior subaltern who continued to make life a burden to the worm the senior subaltern meant no harm but his chaff was coarse and he didnt quite understand where to stop he had been waiting too long for his company and that always sours a man also he was in love which made him worse  one day after he had borrowed the worms trap for a lady who never existed had used it himself all the afternoon had sent a note to the worm purporting to come from the lady and was telling the mess all about it the worm rose in his place and said in his quiet ladylike voice that was a very pretty sell but ill lay you a months pay to a months pay when you get your step that i work a sell on you that youll remember for the rest of your days and the regiment after you when youre dead or broke the worm wasnt angry in the least and the rest of the mess shouted then the senior subaltern looked at the worm from the boots upwards and down again and said done baby the worm took the rest of the mess to witness that the bet had been taken and retired into a book with a sweet smile  two months passed and the senior subaltern still educated the worm who began to move about a little more as the hot weather came on i have said that the senior subaltern was in love the curious thing is that a girl was in love with the senior subaltern though the colonel said awful things and the majors snorted and married captains looked unutterable wisdom and the juniors scoffed those two were engaged  the senior subaltern was so pleased with getting his company and his acceptance at the same time that he forgot to bother the worm the girl was a pretty girl and had money of her own she does not come into this story at all  one night at the beginning of the hot weather all the mess except the worm who had gone to his own room to write home letters were sitting on the platform outside the mess house the band had finished playing but no one wanted to go in and the captains wives were there also the folly of a man in love is unlimited  the senior subaltern had been holding forth on the merits of the girl he was engaged to and the ladies were purring approval while the men yawned when there was a rustle of skirts in the dark and a tired faint voice lifted itself  wheres my husband  i do not wish in the least to reflect on the morality of the shikarris but it is on record that four men jumped up as if they had been shot three of them were married men perhaps they were afraid that their wives had come from home unbeknownst the fourth said that he had acted on the impulse of the moment he explained this afterwards  then the voice criedoh lionel lionel was the senior subalterns name a woman came into the little circle of light by the candles on the pegtables stretching out her hands to the dark where the senior subaltern was and sobbing we rose to our feet feeling that things were going to happen and ready to believe the worst in this bad small world of ours one knows so little of the life of the next manwhich after all is entirely his own concernthat one is not surprised when a crash comes anything might turn up any day for any one perhaps the senior subaltern had been trapped in his youth men are crippled that way occasionally we didnt know we wanted to hear and the captains wives were as anxious as we if he had been trapped he was to be excused for the woman from nowhere in the dusty shoes and gray travelling dress was very lovely with black hair and great eyes full of tears she was tall with a fine figure and her voice had a running sob in it pitiful to hear as soon as the senior subaltern stood up she threw her arms round his neck and called him my darling and said she could not bear waiting alone in england and his letters were so short and cold and she was his to the end of the world and would he forgive her this did not sound quite like a ladys way of speaking it was too demonstrative  things seemed black indeed and the captains wives peered under their eyebrows at the senior subaltern and the colonels face set like the day of judgment framed in gray bristles and no one spoke for a while  next the colonel said very shortlywell sir and the woman sobbed afresh the senior subaltern was half choked with the arms round his neck but he gasped outits a dd lie i never had a wife in my life dont swear said the colonel come into the mess we must sift this clear somehow and he sighed to himself for he believed in his shikarris did the colonel  we trooped into the anteroom under the full lights and there we saw how beautiful the woman was she stood up in the middle of us all sometimes choking with crying then hard and proud and then holding out her arms to the senior subaltern it was like the fourth act of a tragedy she told us how the senior subaltern had married her when he was home on leave eighteen months before and she seemed to know all that we knew and more too of his people and his past life he was white and ashy gray trying now and again to break into the torrent of her words and we noting how lovely she was and what a criminal he looked esteemed him a beast of the worst kind we felt sorry for him though  i shall never forget the indictment of the senior subaltern by his wife nor will he it was so sudden rushing out of the dark unannounced into our dull lives the captains wives stood back but their eyes were alight and you could see that they had already convicted and sentenced the senior subaltern the colonel seemed five years older one major was shading his eyes with his hand and watching the woman from underneath it another was chewing his moustache and smiling quietly as if he were witnessing a play full in the open space in the centre by the whisttables the senior subalterns terrier was hunting for fleas i remember all this as clearly as though a photograph were in my hand i remember the look of horror on the senior subalterns face it was rather like seeing a man hanged but much more interesting finally the woman wound up by saying that the senior subaltern carried a double f m in tattoo on his left shoulder we all knew that and to our innocent minds it seemed to clinch the matter but one of the bachelor majors said very politelyi presume that your marriage certificate would be more to the purpose  that roused the woman she stood up and sneered at the senior subaltern for a cur and abused the major and the colonel and all the rest then she wept and then she pulled a paper from her breast saying imperiallytake that and let my husbandmy lawfully wedded husbandread it aloudif he dare  there was a hush and the men looked into each others eyes as the senior subaltern came forward in a dazed and dizzy way and took the paper we were wondering as we stared whether there was anything against any one of us that might turn up later on the senior subalterns throat was dry but as he ran his eye over the paper he broke out into a hoarse cackle of relief and said to the womanyou young blackguard  but the woman had fled through a door and on the paper was writtenthis is to certify that i the worm have paid in full my debts to the senior subaltern and further that the senior subaltern is my debtor by agreement on the 23d of february as by the mess attested to the extent of one months captains pay in the lawful currency of the india empire                                                              then a deputation set off for the worms quarters and found him betwixt and between unlacing his stays with the hat wig serge dress etc on the bed he came over as he was and the shikarris shouted till the gunners mess sent over to know if they might have a share of the fun i think we were all except the colonel and the senior subaltern a little disappointed that the scandal had come to nothing but that is human nature there could be no two words about the worms acting it leaned as near to a nasty tragedy as anything this side of a joke can when most of the subalterns sat upon him with sofacushions to find out why he had not said that acting was his strong point he answered very quietlyi dont think you ever asked me i used to act at home with my sisters but no acting with girls could account for the worms display that night personally i think it was in bad taste  besides being dangerous there is no sort of use in playing with fire even for fun  the shikarris made him president of the regimental dramatic club and when the senior subaltern paid up his debt which he did at once the worm sank the money in scenery and dresses he was a good worm and the shikarris are proud of him the only drawback is that he has been christened mrs senior subaltern and as there are now two mrs senior subalterns in the station this is sometimes confusing to strangers  later on i will tell you of a case something like this but with all the jest left out and nothing in it but real trouble    the broken link

and the gins temper shackles was that horse two miles was his own particular distance he trained himself ran himself and rode himself and if his jockey insulted him by giving him hints he shut up at once and bucked the boy off he objected to dictation two or three of his owners did not understand this and lost money in consequence at last he was bought by a man who discovered that if a race was to be won shackles and shackles only would win it in his own way so long as his jockey sat still  this man had a ridingboy called brunta lad from perth west australiaand he taught brunt with a trainers whip the hardest thing a jock can learnto sit still to sit still and to keep on sitting still when brunt fairly grasped this truth shackles devastated the country no weight could stop him at his own distance and the fame of shackles spread from ajmir in the south to chedputter in the north there was no horse like shackles so long as he was allowed to do his work in his own way but he was beaten in the end and the story of his fall is enough to make angels weep  at the lower end of the chedputter racecourse just before the turn into the straight the track passes close to a couple of old brick mounds enclosing a funnelshaped hollow the big end of the funnel is not six feet from the railings on the offside the astounding peculiarity of the course is that if you stand at one particular place about half a mile away inside the course and speak at an ordinary pitch your voice just hits the funnel of the brick mounds and makes a curious whining echo there a man discovered this one morning by accident while out training with a friend he marked the place to stand and speak from with a couple of bricks and he kept his knowledge to himself every peculiarity of a course is worth remembering in a country where rats play the mischief with the elephantlitter and stewards build jumps to suit their own stables  this man ran a very fairish countrybred a long racking high mare with the temper of a fiend and the paces of an airy wandering serapha drifty glidy stretch the mare was as a delicate tribute to mrs reiver called the lady regula baddunor for short regula baddun  shackles jockey brunt was a quiet wellbehaved boy but his nerves had been shaken he began his career by riding jumpraces in melbourne where a few stewards want lynching and was one of the jockeys who came through the awful butcheryperhaps you will recollect itof the maribyrnong plate the walls were colonial rampartslogs of jarrak spiked into masonrywith wings as strong as church buttresses once in his stride a horse had to jump or fall he couldnt run out in the maribyrnong plate twelve horses were jammed at the second wall red hat leading fell this side and threw out the glen and the ruck came up behind and the space between wing and wing was one struggling screaming kicking shambles four jockeys were taken out dead three were very badly hurt and brunt was among the three he told the story of the maribyrnong plate sometimes and when he described how whalley on red hat said as the mare fell under himgod ha mercy im done for and how next instant sithee there and white otter had crushed the life out of poor whalley and the dust hid a small hell of men and horses no one marvelled that brunt had dropped jumpraces and australia together regula badduns owner knew that story by heart brunt never varied it in the telling he had no education  shackles came to the chedputter autumn races one year and his owner walked about insulting the sportsmen of chedputter generally till they went to the honorary secretary in a body and saidappoint handicappers and arrange a race which shall break shackles and humble the pride of his owner the districts rose against shackles and sent up of their best ousel who was supposed to be able to do his mile in 153 petard the studbred trained by a cavalry regiment who knew how to train gringalet the ewelamb of the 75th bobolink the pride of peshawar and many others  they called that race the brokenlink handicap because it was to smash shackles and the handicappers piled on the weights and the fund gave eight hundred rupees and the distance was round the course for all horses shackles owner saidyou can arrange the race with regard to shackles only so long as you dont bury him under weightcloths i dont mind regula badduns owner saidi throw in my mare to fret ousel six furlongs is regulas distance and she will then lie down and die so also will ousel for his jockey doesnt understand a waiting race now this was a lie for regula had been in work for two months at dehra and her chances were good always supposing that shackles broke a bloodvesselor brunt moved on him  the plunging in the lotteries was fine they filled eight thousand rupee lotteries on the broken link handicap and the account in the pioneer said that favoritism was divided in plain english the various contingents were wild on their respective horses for the handicappers had done their work well the honorary secretary shouted himself hoarse through the din and the smoke of the cheroots was like the smoke and the rattling of the diceboxes like the rattle of smallarm fire  ten horses startedvery leveland regula badduns owner cantered out on his back to a place inside the circle of the course where two bricks had been thrown he faced towards the brickmounds at the lower end of the course and waited   the story of the running is in the pioneer at the end of the first mile shackles crept out of the ruck well on the outside ready to get round the turn lay hold of the bit and spin up the straight before the others knew he had got away brunt was sitting still perfectly happy listening to the drum drum drum of the hoofs behind and knowing that in about twenty strides shackles would draw one deep breath and go up the last halfmile like the flying dutchman as shackles went short to take the turn and came abreast of the brickmound brunt heard above the noise of the wind in his ears a whining wailing voice on the offside sayinggod ha mercy im done for in one stride brunt saw the whole seething smash of the maribyrnong plate before him started in his saddle and gave a yell of terror the start brought the heels into shackles side and the scream hurt shackles feelings he couldnt stop dead but he put out his feet and slid along for fifty yards and then very gravely and judicially bucked off brunta shaking terrorstricken lump while regula baddun made a neckandneck race with bobolink up the straight and won by a short headpetard a bad third shackles owner in the stand tried to think that his fieldglasses had gone wrong regula badduns owner waiting by the two bricks gave one deep sigh of relief and cantered back to the stand he had won in lotteries and bets about fifteen thousand  it was a brokenlink handicap with a vengeance it broke nearly all the men concerned and nearly broke the heart of shackles owner  he went down to interview brunt the boy lay livid and gasping with fright where he had tumbled off the sin of losing the race never seemed to strike him all he knew was that whalley had called him that the call was a warning and were he cut in two for it he would never get up again his nerve had gone altogether and he only asked his master to give him a good thrashing and let him go he was fit for nothing he said he got his dismissal and crept up to the paddock white as chalk with blue lips his knees giving way under him people said nasty things in the paddock but brunt never heeded he changed into tweeds took his stick and went down the road still shaking with fright and muttering over and over againgod ha mercy im done for to the best of my knowledge and belief he spoke the truth  so now you know how the brokenlink handicap was run and won of course you dont believe it you would credit anything about russias designs on india or the recommendations of the currency commission but a little bit of sober fact is more than you can stand    beyond the pale  love heeds not caste nor sleep a broken bed i went in search of love and lost myself hindu proverb  a man should whatever happens keep to his own caste race and breed let the white go to the white and the black to the black  then whatever trouble falls is in the ordinary course of thingsneither sudden alien nor unexpected  this is the story of a man who wilfully stepped beyond the safe limits of decent everyday society and paid for it heavily  he knew too much in the first instance and he saw too much in the second he took too deep an interest in native life but he will never do so again  deep away in the heart of the city behind jitha megjis bustee lies amir naths gully which ends in a deadwall pierced by one grated window at the head of the gully is a big cowbyre and the walls on either side of the gully are without windows neither suchet singh nor gaur chand approved of their womenfolk looking into the world if durga charan had been of their opinion he would have been a happier man today and little bisesa would have been able to knead her own bread her room looked out through the grated window into the narrow dark gully where the sun never came and where the buffaloes wallowed in the blue slime she was a widow about fifteen years old and she prayed the gods day and night to send her a lover for she did not approve of living alone  one day the mantrejago his name wascame into amir naths gully on an aimless wandering and after he had passed the buffaloes stumbled over a big heap of cattle food  then he saw that the gully ended in a trap and heard a little laugh from behind the grated window it was a pretty little laugh and trejago knowing that for all practical purposes the old arabian nights are good guides went forward to the window and whispered that verse of the love song of har dyal which begins    can a man stand upright in the face of the naked sun     or a lover in the presence of his beloved   if my feet fail me o heart of my heart am i to blame     being blinded by the glimpse of your beauty  there came the faint tchinks of a womans bracelets from behind the grating and a little voice went on with the song at the fifth verse    alas alas can the moon tell the lotus of her love when the    gate of heaven is shut and the clouds gather for the rains   they have taken my beloved and driven her with the packhorses     to the north   there are iron chains on the feet that were set on my heart   call to the bowman to make ready  the voice stopped suddenly and trejago walked out of amir naths gully wondering who in the world could have capped the love song of har dyal so neatly  next morning as he was driving to the office an old woman threw a packet into his dogcart in the packet was the half of a broken glass bangle one flower of the blood red dhak a pinch of bhusa or cattlefood and eleven cardamoms that packet was a letternot a clumsy compromising letter but an innocent unintelligible lovers epistle  trejago knew far too much about these things as i have said no englishman should be able to translate objectletters but trejago spread all the trifles on the lid of his officebox and began to puzzle them out  a broken glassbangle stands for a hindu widow all india over because when her husband dies a womans bracelets are broken on her wrists trejago saw the meaning of the little bit of the glass  the flower of the dhak means diversely desire come write or danger according to the other things with it one cardamom means jealousy but when any article is duplicated in an objectletter it loses its symbolic meaning and stands merely for one of a number indicating time or if incense curds or saffron be sent also place the message ran thena widow dhak flower and bhusaat eleven oclock the pinch of bhusa enlightened trejago he saw this kind of letter leaves much to instinctive knowledgethat the bhusa referred to the big heap of cattlefood over which he had fallen in amir naths gully and that the message must come from the person behind the grating she being a widow so the message ran thena widow in the gully in which is the heap of bhusa desires you to come at eleven oclock  trejago threw all the rubbish into the fireplace and laughed he knew that men in the east do not make love under windows at eleven in the forenoon nor do women fix appointments a week in advance  so he went that very night at eleven into amir naths gully clad in a boorka which cloaks a man as well as a woman directly the gongs in the city made the hour the little voice behind the grating took up the love song of har dyal at the verse where the panthan girl calls upon har dyal to return the song is really pretty in the vernacular in english you miss the wail of it it runs something like this      alone upon the housetops to the north      i turn and watch the lightning in the sky     the glamour of thy footsteps in the north      come back to me beloved or i die      below my feet the still bazar is laid      far far below the weary camels lie     the camels and the captives of thy raid      come back to me beloved or i die      my fathers wife is old and harsh with years      and drudge of all my fathers house am i     my bread is sorrow and my drink is tears      come back to me beloved or i die  as the song stopped trejago stepped up under the grating and whisperedi am here  bisesa was good to look upon  that night was the beginning of many strange things and of a double life so wild that trejago today sometimes wonders if it were not all a dream bisesa or her old handmaiden who had thrown the objectletter had detached the heavy grating from the brickwork of the wall so that the window slid inside leaving only a square of raw masonry into which an active man might climb  in the daytime trejago drove through his routine of officework or put on his callingclothes and called on the ladies of the station wondering how long they would know him if they knew of poor little bisesa at night when all the city was still came the walk under the evilsmelling boorka the patrol through jitha megjis bustee the quick turn into amir naths gully between the sleeping cattle and the dead walls and then last of all bisesa and the deep even breathing of the old woman who slept outside the door of the bare little room that durga charan allotted to his sisters daughter who or what durga charan was trejago never inquired and why in the world he was not discovered and knifed never occurred to him till his madness was over and bisesa    but this comes later  bisesa was an endless delight to trejago she was as ignorant as a bird and her distorted versions of the rumors from the outside world that had reached her in her room amused trejago almost as much as her lisping attempts to pronounce his namechristopher the first syllable was always more than she could manage and she made funny little gestures with her roseleaf hands as one throwing the name away and then kneeling before trejago asked him exactly as an englishwoman would do if he were sure he loved her trejago swore that he loved her more than any one else in the world which was true  after a month of this folly the exigencies of his other life compelled trejago to be especially attentive to a lady of his acquaintance you may take it for a fact that anything of this kind is not only noticed and discussed by a mans own race but by some hundred and fifty natives as well trejago had to walk with this lady and talk to her at the bandstand and once or twice to drive with her never for an instant dreaming that this would affect his dearer outoftheway life but the news flew in the usual mysterious fashion from mouth to mouth till bisesas duenna heard of it and told bisesa the child was so troubled that she did the household work evilly and was beaten by durga charans wife in consequence  a week later bisesa taxed trejago with the flirtation she understood no gradations and spoke openly trejago laughed and bisesa stamped her little feetlittle feet light as marigold flowers that could lie in the palm of a mans one hand  much that is written about oriental passion and impulsiveness is exaggerated and compiled at secondhand but a little of it is true and when an englishman finds that little it is quite as startling as any passion in his own proper life bisesa raged and stormed and finally threatened to kill herself if trejago did not at once drop the alien memsahib who had come between them trejago tried to explain and to show her that she did not understand these things from a western standpoint bisesa drew herself up and said simply  i do not i know only thisit is not good that i should have made you dearer than my own heart to me sahib you are an englishman  i am only a black girlshe was fairer than bargold in the mintand the widow of a black man  then she sobbed and said but on my soul and my mothers soul i love you there shall no harm come to you whatever happens to me  trejago argued with the child and tried to soothe her but she seemed quite unreasonably disturbed nothing would satisfy her save that all relations between them should end he was to go away at once and he went as he dropped out at the window she kissed his forehead twice and he walked away wondering  a week and then three weeks passed without a sign from bisesa  trejago thinking that the rupture had lasted quite long enough went down to amir naths gully for the fifth time in the three weeks hoping that his rap at the sill of the shifting grating would be answered he was not disappointed  there was a young moon and one stream of light fell down into amir naths gully and struck the grating which was drawn away as he knocked from the black dark bisesa held out her arms into the moonlight both hands had been cut off at the wrists and the stumps were nearly healed  then as bisesa bowed her head between her arms and sobbed some one in the room grunted like a wild beast and something sharpknife sword or spear thrust at trejago in his boorka the stroke missed his body but cut into one of the muscles of the groin and he limped slightly from the wound for the rest of his days  the grating went into its place there was no sign whatever from inside the housenothing but the moonlight strip on the high wall and the blackness of amir naths gully behind  the next thing trejago remembers after raging and shouting like a madman between those pitiless walls is that he found himself near the river as the dawn was breaking threw away his boorka and went home bareheaded  what the tragedy waswhether bisesa had in a fit of causeless despair told everything or the intrigue had been discovered and she tortured to tell whether durga charan knew his name and what became of bisesatrejago does not know to this day something horrible had happened and the thought of what it must have been comes upon trejago in the night now and again and keeps him company till the morning one special feature of the case is that he does not know where lies the front of durga charans house it may open on to a courtyard common to two or more houses or it may lie behind any one of the gates of jitha megjis bustee trejago cannot tell  he cannot get bisesapoor little bisesaback again he has lost her in the city where each mans house is as guarded and as unknowable as the grave and the grating that opens into amir naths gully has been walled up  but trejago pays his calls regularly and is reckoned a very decent sort of man  there is nothing peculiar about him except a slight stiffness caused by a ridingstrain in the right leg     in error   they burnt a corpse upon the sand    the light shone out afar  it guided home the plunging boats    that beat from zanzibar   spirit of fire whereer thy altars rise  thou art light of guidance to our eyes             salsette boatsong  there is hope for a man who gets publicly and riotously drunk more often that he ought to do but there is no hope for the man who drinks secretly and alone in his own housethe man who is never seen to drink  this is a rule so there must be an exception to prove it  moriartys case was that exception  he was a civil engineer and the government very kindly put him quite by himself in an outdistrict with nobody but natives to talk to and a great deal of work to do he did his work well in the four years he was utterly alone but he picked up the vice of secret and solitary drinking and came up out of the wilderness more old and worn and haggard than the deadalive life had any right to make him  you know the saying that a man who has been alone in the jungle for more than a year is never quite sane all his life after people credited moriartys queerness of manner and moody ways to the solitude and said it showed how government spoilt the futures of its best men moriarty had built himself the plinth of a very god reputation in the bridgedamgirder line but he knew every night of the week that he was taking steps to undermine that reputation with l l l and christopher and little nips of liqueurs and filth of that kind he had a sound constitution and a great brain or else he would have broken down and died like a sick camel in the district as better men have done before him  government ordered him to simla after he had come out of the desert and he went up meaning to try for a post then vacant that season mrs reiver perhaps you will remember herwas in the height of her power and many men lay under her yoke everything bad that could be said has already been said about mrs reiver in another tale  moriarty was heavilybuilt and handsome very quiet and nervously anxious to please his neighbors when he wasnt sunk in a brown study he started a good deal at sudden noises or if spoken to without warning and when you watched him drinking his glass of water at dinner you could see the hand shake a little but all this was put down to nervousness and the quiet steady sip sipsip fill and sipsipsip again that went on in his own room when he was by himself was never known which was miraculous seeing how everything in a mans private life is public property out here  moriarty was drawn not into mrs reivers set because they were not his sort but into the power of mrs reiver and he fell down in front of her and made a goddess of her this was due to his coming fresh out of the jungle to a big town he could not scale things properly or see who was what  because mrs reiver was cold and hard he said she was stately and dignified because she had no brains and could not talk cleverly he said she was reserved and shy mrs reiver shy because she was unworthy of honor or reverence from any one he reverenced her from a distance and dowered her with all the virtues in the bible and most of those in shakespeare  this big dark abstracted man who was so nervous when a pony cantered behind him used to moon in the train of mrs reiver blushing with pleasure when she threw a word or two his way his admiration was strictly platonic even other women saw and admitted this he did not move out in simla so he heard nothing against his idol which was satisfactory mrs reiver took no special notice of him beyond seeing that he was added to her list of admirers and going for a walk with him now and then just to show that he was her property claimable as such moriarty must have done most of the talking for mrs reiver couldnt talk much to a man of his stamp and the little she said could not have been profitable what moriarty believed in as he had good reason to was mrs reivers influence over him and in that belief set himself seriously to try to do away with the vice that only he himself knew of  his experiences while he was fighting with it must have been peculiar but he never described them sometimes he would hold off from everything except water for a week then on a rainy night when no one had asked him out to dinner and there was a big fire in his room and everything comfortable he would sit down and make a big night of it by adding little nip to little nip planning big schemes of reformation meanwhile until he threw himself on his bed hopelessly drunk he suffered next morning  one night the big crash came he was troubled in his own mind over his attempts to make himself worthy of the friendship of mrs reiver the past ten days had been very bad ones and the end of it all was that he received the arrears of two and threequarter years of sipping in one attack of delirium tremens of the subdued kind beginning with suicidal depression going on to fits and starts and hysteria and ending with downright raving as he sat in a chair in front of the fire or walked up and down the room picking a handkerchief to pieces you heard what poor moriarty really thought of mrs reiver for he raved about her and his own fall for the most part though he ravelled some p w d accounts into the same skein of thought he talked and talked and talked in a low dry whisper to himself and there was no stopping him he seemed to know that there was something wrong and twice tried to pull himself together and confer rationally with the doctor but his mind ran out of control at once and he fell back to a whisper and the story of his troubles it is terrible to hear a big man babbling like a child of all that a man usually locks up and puts away in the deep of his heart moriarty read out his very soul for the benefit of any one who was in the room between ten thirty that night and twofortyfive next morning  from what he said one gathered how immense an influence mrs reiver held over him and how thoroughly he felt for his own lapse his whisperings cannot of course be put down here but they were very instructive as showing the errors of his estimates                              when the trouble was over and his few acquaintances were pitying him for the bad attack of junglefever that had so pulled him down moriarty swore a big oath to himself and went abroad again with mrs reiver till the end of the season adoring her in a quiet and deferential way as an angel from heaven later on he took to ridingnot hacking but honest ridingwhich was good proof that he was improving and you could slam doors behind him without his jumping to his feet with a gasp that again was hopeful  how he kept his oath and what it cost him in the beginning nobody knows he certainly managed to compass the hardest thing that a man who has drank heavily can do he took his peg and wine at dinner but he never drank alone and never let what he drank have the least hold on him  once he told a bosomfriend the story of his great trouble and how the influence of a pure honest woman and an angel as well had saved him when the manstartled at anything good being laid to mrs reivers doorlaughed it cost him moriartys friendship  moriarty who is married now to a woman ten thousand times better than mrs reivera woman who believes that there is no man on earth as good and clever as her husbandwill go down to his grave vowing and protesting that mrs reiver saved him from ruin in both worlds  that she knew anything of moriartys weakness nobody believed for a moment that she would have cut him dead thrown him over and acquainted all her friends with her discovery if she had known of it nobody who knew her doubted for an instant   moriarty thought her something she never was and in that belief saved himself which was just as good as though she had been everything that he had imagined  but the question is what claim will mrs reiver have to the credit of moriartys salvation when her day of reckoning comes    a bank fraud  he drank strong waters and his speech was coarse   he purchased raiment and forebore to pay he struck a trusting junior with a horse   and won gymkhanas in a doubtful way  then twixt a vice and folly turned aside   to do good deeds and straight to cloak them lied           the mess room   if reggie burke were in india now he would resent this tale being told but as he is in hongkong and wont see it the telling is safe he was the man who worked the big fraud on the sind and sialkote bank he was manager of an upcountry branch and a sound practical man with a large experience of native loan and insurance work he could combine the frivolities of ordinary life with his work and yet do well reggie burke rode anything that would let him get up danced as neatly as he rode and was wanted for every sort of amusement in the station   as he said himself and as many men found out rather to their surprise there were two burkes both very much at your service   reggie burke between four and ten ready for anything from a hotweather gymkhana to a ridingpicnic and between ten and four mr  reginald burke manager of the sind and sialkote branch bank you might play polo with him one afternoon and hear him express his opinions when a man crossed and you might call on him next morning to raise a twothousand rupee loan on a five hundred pound insurancepolicy eighty pounds paid in premiums he would recognize you but you would have some trouble in recognizing him  the directors of the bankit had its headquarters in calcutta and its general managers word carried weight with the governmentpicked their men well they had tested reggie up to a fairly severe breakingstrain they trusted him just as much as directors ever trust managers you must see for yourself whether their trust was misplaced  reggies branch was in a big station and worked with the usual staffone manager one accountant both english a cashier and a horde of native clerks besides the police patrol at nights outside  the bulk of its work for it was in a thriving district was hoondi and accommodation of all kinds a fool has no grip of this sort of business and a clever man who does not go about among his clients and know more than a little of their affairs is worse than a fool  reggie was younglooking cleanshaved with a twinkle in his eye and a head that nothing short of a gallon of the gunners madeira could make any impression on  one day at a big dinner he announced casually that the directors had shifted on to him a natural curiosity from england in the accountant line he was perfectly correct mr silas riley accountant was a most curious animala long gawky rawboned yorkshireman full of the savage selfconceit that blossoms only in the best county in england arrogance was a mild word for the mental attitude of mr s riley he had worked himself up after seven years to a cashiers position in a huddersfield bank and all his experience lay among the factories of the north perhaps he would have done better on the bombay side where they are happy with onehalf per cent profits and money is cheap he was useless for upper india and a wheat province where a man wants a large head and a touch of imagination if he is to turn out a satisfactory balancesheet  he was wonderfully narrowminded in business and being new to the country had no notion that indian banking is totally distinct from home work like most clever selfmade men he had much simplicity in his nature and somehow or other had construed the ordinarily polite terms of his letter of engagement into a belief that the directors had chosen him on account of his special and brilliant talents and that they set great store by him this notion grew and crystallized thus adding to his natural northcountry conceit  further he was delicate suffered from some trouble in his chest and was short in his temper  you will admit that reggie had reason to call his new accountant a natural curiosity the two men failed to hit it off at all riley considered reggie a wild featherheaded idiot given to heaven only knew what dissipation in low places called messes and totally unfit for the serious and solemn vocation of banking he could never get over reggies look of youth and youbedamned air and he couldnt understand reggies friendscleanbuilt careless men in the armywho rode over to big sunday breakfasts at the bank and told sultry stories till riley got up and left the room riley was always showing reggie how the business ought to be conducted and reggie had more than once to remind him that seven years limited experience between huddersfield and beverly did not qualify a man to steer a big upcountry business then riley sulked and referred to himself as a pillar of the bank and a cherished friend of the directors and reggie tore his hair if a mans english subordinates fail him in this country he comes to a hard time indeed for native help has strict limitations in the winter riley went sick for weeks at a time with his lung complaint and this threw more work on reggie but he preferred it to the everlasting friction when riley was well  one of the travelling inspectors of the bank discovered these collapses and reported them to the directors now riley had been foisted on the bank by an m p who wanted the support of rileys father who again was anxious to get his son out to a warmer climate because of those lungs the m p had an interest in the bank but one of the directors wanted to advance a nominee of his own and after rileys father had died he made the rest of the board see that an accountant who was sick for half the year had better give place to a healthy man if riley had known the real story of his appointment he might have behaved better but knowing nothing his stretches of sickness alternated with restless persistent meddling irritation of reggie and all the hundred ways in which conceit in a subordinate situation can find play reggie used to call him striking and haircurling names behind his back as a relief to his own feelings but he never abused him to his face because he said riley is such a frail beast that half of his loathsome conceit is due to pains in the chest  late one april riley went very sick indeed the doctor punched him and thumped him and told him he would be better before long then the doctor went to reggie and saiddo you know how sick your accountant is no said reggiethe worse the better confound him hes a clacking nuisance when hes well ill let you take away the bank safe if you can drug him silent for this hotweather  but the doctor did not laughman im not joking he said ill give him another three months in his bed and a week or so more to die in on my honor and reputation thats all the grace he has in this world consumption has hold of him to the marrow  reggies face changed at once into the face of mr reginald burke and he answeredwhat can i do  nothing said the doctor for all practical purposes the man is dead already keep him quiet and cheerful and tell him hes going to recover thats all ill look after him to the end of course  the doctor went away and reggie sat down to open the evening mail  his first letter was one from the directors intimating for his information that mr riley was to resign under a months notice by the terms of his agreement telling reggie that their letter to riley would follow and advising reggie of the coming of a new accountant a man whom reggie knew and liked  reggie lit a cheroot and before he had finished smoking he had sketched the outline of a fraud he put awayburkedthe directors letter and went in to talk to riley who was as ungracious as usual and fretting himself over the way the bank would run during his illness he never thought of the extra work on reggies shoulders but solely of the damage to his own prospects of advancement then reggie assured him that everything would be well and that he reggie would confer with riley daily on the management of the bank riley was a little soothed but he hinted in as many words that he did not think much of reggies business capacity  reggie was humble and he had letters in his desk from the directors that a gilbarte or a hardie might have been proud of  the days passed in the big darkened house and the directors letter of dismissal to riley came and was put away by reggie who every evening brought the books to rileys room and showed him what had been going forward while riley snarled reggie did his best to make statements pleasing to riley but the accountant was sure that the bank was going to rack and ruin without him in june as the lying in bed told on his spirit he asked whether his absence had been noted by the directors and reggie said that they had written most sympathetic letters hoping that he would be able to resume his valuable services before long he showed riley the letters and riley said that the directors ought to have written to him direct  a few days later reggie opened rileys mail in the halflight of the room and gave him the sheetnot the envelopeof a letter to riley from the directors riley said he would thank reggie not to interfere with his private papers specially as reggie knew he was too weak to open his own letters reggie apologized  then rileys mood changed and he lectured reggie on his evil ways his horses and his bad friends of course lying here on my back mr burke i cant keep you straight but when im well i do hope youll pay some heed to my words reggie who had dropped polo and dinners and tennis and all to attend to riley said that he was penitent and settled rileys head on the pillow and heard him fret and contradict in hard dry hacking whispers without a sign of impatience this at the end of a heavy days office work doing double duty in the latter half of june  when the new accountant came reggie told him the facts of the case and announced to riley that he had a guest staying with him riley said that he might have had more consideration than to entertain his doubtful friends at such a time reggie made carron the new accountant sleep at the club in consequence carrons arrival took some of the heavy work off his shoulders and he had time to attend to rileys exactionsto explain soothe invent and settle and resettle the poor wretch in bed and to forge complimentary letters from calcutta at the end of the first month riley wished to send some money home to his mother reggie sent the draft at the end of the second month rileys salary came in just the same reggie paid it out of his own pocket and with it wrote riley a beautiful letter from the directors  riley was very ill indeed but the flame of his life burnt unsteadily now and then he would be cheerful and confident about the future sketching plans for going home and seeing his mother  reggie listened patiently when the office work was over and encouraged him  at other times riley insisted on reggies reading the bible and grim methody tracts to him out of these tracts he pointed morals directed at his manager but he always found time to worry reggie about the working of the bank and to show him where the weak points lay  this indoor sickroom life and constant strains wore reggie down a good deal and shook his nerves and lowered his billiardplay by forty points but the business of the bank and the business of the sickroom had to go on though the glass was 116 degrees in the shade  at the end of the third month riley was sinking fast and had begun to realize that he was very sick but the conceit that made him worry reggie kept him from believing the worst he wants some sort of mental stimulant if he is to drag on said the doctor  keep him interested in life if you care about his living so riley contrary to all the laws of business and the finance received a 25percent rise of salary from the directors the mental stimulant succeeded beautifully riley was happy and cheerful and as is often the case in consumption healthiest in mind when the body was weakest he lingered for a full month snarling and fretting about the bank talking of the future hearing the bible read lecturing reggie on sin and wondering when he would be able to move abroad  but at the end of september one mercilessly hot evening he rose up in his bed with a little gasp and said quickly to reggiemr burke i am going to die i know it in myself my chest is all hollow inside and theres nothing to breathe with to the best of my knowledge i have done nowthe was returning to the talk of his boyhoodto lie heavy on my conscience god be thanked i have been preserved from the grosser forms of sin and i counsel you mr burke      here his voice died down and reggie stooped over him  send my salary for september to my mother    done great things with the bank if i had been spared     mistaken policy     no fault of mine  then he turned his face to the wall and died  reggie drew the sheet over its face and went out into the verandah with his last mental stimulanta letter of condolence and sympathy from the directorsunused in his pocket  if id been only ten minutes earlier thought reggie i might have heartened him up to pull through another day    tods amendment  the world hath set its heavy yoke upon the old whitebearded folk   who strive to please the king  gods mercy is upon the young gods wisdom in the baby tongue   that fears not anything       the parable of chajju bhagat  now tods mamma was a singularly charming woman and every one in simla knew tods most men had saved him from death on occasions  he was beyond his ayahs control altogether and perilled his life daily to find out what would happen if you pulled a mountain battery mules tail he was an utterly fearless young pagan about six years old and the only baby who ever broke the holy calm of the supreme legislative council  it happened this way tods pet kid got loose and fled up the hill off the boileaugunge road tods after it until it burst into the viceregal lodge lawn then attached to peterhoff the council were sitting at the time and the windows were open because it was warm the red lancer in the porch told tods to go away but tods knew the red lancer and most of the members of council personally  moreover he had firm hold of the kids collar and was being dragged all across the flowerbeds give my salaam to the long councillor sahib and ask him to help me take moti back gasped tods the council heard the noise through the open windows and after an interval was seen the shocking spectacle of a legal member and a lieutenantgovernor helping under the direct patronage of a commanderinchief and a viceroy one small and very dirty boy in a sailors suit and a tangle of brown hair to coerce a lively and rebellious kid they headed it off down the path to the mall and tods went home in triumph and told his mamma that all the councillor sahibs had been helping him to catch moti whereat his mamma smacked tods for interfering with the administration of the empire but tods met the legal member the next day and told him in confidence that if the legal member ever wanted to catch a goat he tods would give him all the help in his power thank you tods said the legal member  tods was the idol of some eighty jhampanis and half as many saises  he saluted them all as o brother it never entered his head that any living human being could disobey his orders and he was the buffer between the servants and his mammas wrath the working of that household turned on tods who was adored by every one from the dhoby to the dogboy even futteh khan the villainous loafer khit from mussoorie shirked risking tods displeasure for fear his comates should look down on him  so tods had honor in the land from boileaugunge to chota simla and ruled justly according to his lights of course he spoke urdu but he had also mastered many queer sidespeeches like the chotee bolee of the women and held grave converse with shopkeepers and hillcoolies alike he was precocious for his age and his mixing with natives had taught him some of the more bitter truths of life the meanness and the sordidness of it he used over his bread and milk to deliver solemn and serious aphorisms translated from the vernacular into the english that made his mamma jump and vow that tods must go home next hot weather  just when tods was in the bloom of his power the supreme legislature were hacking out a bill for the submontane tracts a revision of the then act smaller than the punjab land bill but affecting a few hundred thousand people none the less the legal member had built and bolstered and embroidered and amended that bill till it looked beautiful on paper then the council began to settle what they called the minor details as if any englishman legislating for natives knows enough to know which are the minor and which are the major points from the native point of view of any measure that bill was a triumph of safeguarding the interests of the tenant one clause provided that land should not be leased on longer terms than five years at a stretch because if the landlord had a tenant bound down for say twenty years he would squeeze the very life out of him the notion was to keep up a stream of independent cultivators in the submontane tracts and ethnologically and politically the notion was correct the only drawback was that it was altogether wrong a natives life in india implies the life of his son wherefore you cannot legislate for one generation at a time you must consider the next from the native point of view curiously enough the native now and then and in northern india more particularly hates being over protected against himself there was a naga village once where they lived on dead and buried commissariat mules     but that is another story  for many reasons to be explained later the people concerned objected to the bill the native member in council knew as much about punjabis as he knew about charing cross he had said in calcutta that the bill was entirely in accord with the desires of that large and important class the cultivators and so on and so on the legal members knowledge of natives was limited to englishspeaking durbaris and his own red chaprassis the submontane tracts concerned no one in particular the deputy commissioners were a good deal too driven to make representations and the measure was one which dealt with small landholders only nevertheless the legal member prayed that it might be correct for he was a nervously conscientious man he did not know that no man can tell what natives think unless he mixes with them with the varnish off and not always then but he did the best he knew and the measure came up to the supreme council for the final touches while tods patrolled the burra simla bazar in his morning rides and played with the monkey belonging to ditta mull the bunnia and listened as a child listens to all the stray talk about this new freak of the lat sahibs  one day there was a dinnerparty at the house of tods mamma and the legal member came tods was in bed but he kept awake till he heard the bursts of laughter from the men over the coffee then he paddled out in his little red flannel dressinggown and his nightsuit and took refuge by the side of his father knowing that he would not be sent back see the miseries of having a family said tods father giving tods three prunes some water in a glass that had been used for claret and telling him to sit still tods sucked the prunes slowly knowing that he would have to go when they were finished and sipped the pink water like a man of the world as he listened to the conversation presently the legal member talking shop to the head of a department mentioned his bill by its full namethe submontane tracts ryotwari revised enactment tods caught the one native word and lifting up his small voice saidoh i know all about that has it been murramutted yet councillor sahib  how much said the legal member  murramuttedmendedput theek you knowmade nice to please ditta mull  the legal member left his place and moved up next to tods  what do you know about ryotwari little man he said  im not a little man im tods and i know all about it ditta mull and choga lall and amir nath andoh lakhs of my friends tell me about it in the bazars when i talk to them  oh they dodo they what do they say tods  tods tucked his feet under his red flannel dressinggown and saidi must fink  the legal member waited patiently then tods with infinite compassion  you dont speak my talk do you councillor sahib  no i am sorry to say i do not said the legal member  very well said tods i must fink in english  he spent a minute putting his ideas in order and began very slowly translating in his mind from the vernacular to english as many angloindian children do you must remember that the legal member helped him on by questions when he halted for tods was not equal to the sustained flight of oratory that follows  ditta mull saysthis thing is the talk of a child and was made up by fools but i dont think you are a fool councillor sahib said tods hastily you caught my goat this is what ditta mull saysi am not a fool and why should the sirkar say i am a child i can see if the land is good and if the landlord is good if i am a fool the sin is upon my own head for five years i take my ground for which i have saved money and a wife i take too and a little son is born ditta mull has one daughter now but he says he will have a son soon and he says at the end of five years by this new bundobust i must go if i do not go i must get fresh seals and takkusstamps on the papers perhaps in the middle of the harvest and to go to the law courts once is wisdom but to go twice is jehannum that is quite true explained tods gravely all my friends say so and ditta mull saysalways fresh takkus and paying money to vakils and chaprassis and lawcourts every five years or else the landlord makes me go why do i want to go am i fool if i am a fool and do not know after forty years good land when i see it let me die but if the new bundobust says for fifteen years then it is good and wise my little son is a man and i am burnt and he takes the ground or another ground paying only once for the takkusstamps on the papers and his little son is born and at the end of fifteen years is a man too but what profit is there in five years and fresh papers nothing but dikh trouble dikh we are not young men who take these lands but old onesnot jais but tradesmen with a little moneyand for fifteen years we shall have peace nor are we children that the sirkar should treat us so  here tods stopped short for the whole table were listening the legal member said to tods is that all  all i can remember said tods but you should see ditta mulls big monkey its just like a councillor sahib  tods go to bed said his father  tods gathered up his dressinggown tail and departed  the legal member brought his hand down on the table with a crashby jove said the legal member i believe the boy is right the short tenure is the weak point  he left early thinking over what tods had said now it was obviously impossible for the legal member to play with a bunnias monkey by way of getting understanding but he did better he made inquiries always bearing in mind the fact that the real nativenot the hybrid universitytrained muleis as timid as a colt and little by little he coaxed some of the men whom the measure concerned most intimately to give in their views which squared very closely with tods evidence  so the bill was amended in that clause and the legal member was filled with an uneasy suspicion that native members represent very little except the orders they carry on their bosoms but he put the thought from him as illiberal he was a most liberal man  after a time the news spread through the bazars that tods had got the bill recast in the tenure clause and if tods mamma had not interfered tods would have made himself sick on the baskets of fruit and pistachio nuts and cabuli grapes and almonds that crowded the verandah till he went home tods ranked some few degrees before the viceroy in popular estimation but for the little life of him tods could not understand why  in the legal members privatepaperbox still lies the rough draft of the sub montane tracts ryotwari revised enactment and opposite the twentysecond clause pencilled in blue chalk and signed by the legal member are the words tods amendment    in the pride of his youth  stopped in the straight when the race was his own look at him cutting itcur to the bone ask ere the youngster be rated and chidden what did he carry and how was he ridden maybe they used him too much at the start maybe fates weightcloths are breaking his heart          lifes handicap  when i was telling you of the joke that the worm played off on the senior subaltern i promised a somewhat similar tale but with all the jest left out this is that tale  dicky hatt was kidnapped in his early early youthneither by landladys daughter housemaid barmaid nor cook but by a girl so nearly of his own caste that only a woman could have said she was just the least little bit in the world below it this happened a month before he came out to india and five days after his oneandtwentieth birthday the girl was nineteensix years older than dicky in the things of this world that is to sayand for the time twice as foolish as he  excepting always falling off a horse there is nothing more fatally easy than marriage before the registrar the ceremony costs less than fifty shillings and is remarkably like walking into a pawnshop after the declarations of residence have been put in four minutes will cover the rest of the proceedingsfees attestation and all then the registrar slides the blottingpad over the names and says grimly with his pen between his teeth now youre man and wife and the couple walk out into the street feeling as if something were horribly illegal somewhere  but that ceremony holds and can drag a man to his undoing just as thoroughly as the long as ye both shall live curse from the altarrails with the bridesmaids giggling behind and the voice that breathed oer eden lifting the roof off in this manner was dicky hatt kidnapped and he considered it vastly fine for he had received an appointment in india which carried a magnificent salary from the home point of view the marriage was to be kept secret for a year then mrs dicky hatt was to come out and the rest of life was to be a glorious golden mist that was how they sketched it under the addison road station lamps and after one short month came gravesend and dicky steaming out to his new life and the girl crying in a thirtyshillings a week bedandliving room in a back street off montpelier square near the knightsbridge barracks  but the country that dicky came to was a hard land where men of twentyone were reckoned very small boys indeed and life was expensive the salary that loomed so large six thousand miles away did not go far particularly when dicky divided it by two and remitted more than the fair half at 16 to montpelier square one hundred and thirtyfive rupees out of three hundred and thirty is not much to live on but it was absurd to suppose that mrs hatt could exist forever on the 20 pounds held back by dicky from his outfit allowance dicky saw this and remitted at once always remembering that rs 700 were to be paid twelve months later for a firstclass passage out for a lady when you add to these trifling details the natural instincts of a boy beginning a new life in a new country and longing to go about and enjoy himself and the necessity for grappling with strange workwhich properly speaking should take up a boys undivided attentionyou will see that dicky started handicapped he saw it himself for a breath or two but he did not guess the full beauty of his future  as the hot weather began the shackles settled on him and ate into his flesh first would come lettersbig crossed seven sheet lettersfrom his wife telling him how she longed to see him and what a heaven upon earth would be their property when they met  then some boy of the chummery wherein dicky lodged would pound on the door of his bare little room and tell him to come out and look at a ponythe very thing to suit him dicky could not afford ponies he had to explain this dicky could not afford living in the chummery modest as it was he had to explain this before he moved to a single room next the office where he worked all day he kept house on a green oilcloth tablecover one chair one charpoy one photograph one toothglass very strong and thick a sevenrupee eightanna filter and messing by contract at thirtyseven rupees a month which last item was extortion he had no punkah for a punkah costs fifteen rupees a month but he slept on the roof of the office with all his wifes letters under his pillow now and again he was asked out to dinner where he got both a punkah and an iced drink but this was seldom for people objected to recognizing a boy who had evidently the instincts of a scotch tallowchandler and who lived in such a nasty fashion dicky could not subscribe to any amusement so he found no amusement except the pleasure of turning over his bankbook and reading what it said about loans on approved security that cost nothing he remitted through a bombay bank by the way and the station knew nothing of his private affairs  every month he sent home all he could possibly spare for his wifeand for another reason which was expected to explain itself shortly and would require more money  about this time dicky was overtaken with the nervous haunting fear that besets married men when they are out of sorts he had no pension to look to what if he should die suddenly and leave his wife unprovided for the thought used to lay hold of him in the still hot nights on the roof till the shaking of his heart made him think that he was going to die then and there of heart disease  now this is a frame of mind which no boy has a right to know it is a strong mans trouble but coming when it did it nearly drove poor punkahless perspiring dicky hatt mad he could tell no one about it  a certain amount of screw is as necessary for a man as for a billiardball it makes them both do wonderful things dicky needed money badly and he worked for it like a horse but naturally the men who owned him knew that a boy can live very comfortably on a certain incomepay in india is a matter of age not merit you see and if their particular boy wished to work like two boys business forbid that they should stop him but business forbid that they should give him an increase of pay at his present ridiculously immature age so dicky won certain rises of salaryample for a boynot enough for a wife and child certainly too little for the sevenhundredrupee passage that he and mrs hatt had discussed so lightly once upon a time and with this he was forced to be content  somehow all his money seemed to fade away in home drafts and the crushing exchange and the tone of the home letters changed and grew querulous why wouldnt dicky have his wife and the baby out surely he had a salarya fine salaryand it was too bad of him to enjoy himself in india but would he could hemake the next draft a little more elastic here followed a list of babys kit as long as a parsees bill then dicky whose heart yearned to his wife and the little son he had never seenwhich again is a feeling no boy is entitled toenlarged the draft and wrote queer halfboy half man letters saying that life was not so enjoyable after all and would the little wife wait yet a little longer but the little wife however much she approved of money objected to waiting and there was a strange hard sort of ring in her letters that dicky didnt understand how could he poor boy  later on stilljust as dicky had been toldapropos of another youngster who had made a fool of himself as the saying isthat matrimony would not only ruin his further chances of advancement but would lose him his present appointmentcame the news that the baby his own little little son had died and behind this forty lines of an angry womans scrawl saying that death might have been averted if certain things all costing money had been done or if the mother and the baby had been with dicky the letter struck at dickys naked heart but not being officially entitled to a baby he could show no sign of trouble  how dicky won through the next four months and what hope he kept alight to force him into his work no one dare say he pounded on the sevenhundred rupee passage as far away as ever and his style of living unchanged except when he launched into a new filter  there was the strain of his officework and the strain of his remittances and the knowledge of his boys death which touched the boy more perhaps than it would have touched a man and beyond all the enduring strain of his daily life grayheaded seniors who approved of his thrift and his fashion of denying himself everything pleasant reminded him of the old saw that says     if a youth would be distinguished in his art art art     he must keep the girls away from his heart heart heart  and dicky who fancied he had been through every trouble that a man is permitted to know had to laugh and agree with the last line of his balanced bankbook jingling in his head day and night  but he had one more sorrow to digest before the end there arrived a letter from the little wifethe natural sequence of the others if dicky had only known itand the burden of that letter was gone with a handsomer man than you it was a rather curious production without stops something like this she was not going to wait forever and the baby was dead and dicky was only a boy and he would never set eyes on her again and why hadnt he waved his handkerchief to her when he left gravesend and god was her judge she was a wicked woman but dicky was worse enjoying himself in india and this other man loved the ground she trod on and would dicky ever forgive her for she would never forgive dicky and there was no address to write to  instead of thanking his lucky stars that he was free dicky discovered exactly how an injured husband feelsagain not at all the knowledge to which a boy is entitledfor his mind went back to his wife as he remembered her in the thirtyshilling suite in montpelier square when the dawn of his last morning in england was breaking and she was crying in the bed whereat he rolled about on his bed and bit his fingers he never stopped to think whether if he had met mrs hatt after those two years he would have discovered that he and she had grown quite different and new persons this theoretically he ought to have done he spent the night after the english mail came in rather severe pain  next morning dicky hatt felt disinclined to work he argued that he had missed the pleasure of youth he was tired and he had tasted all the sorrow in life before threeandtwenty his honor was gonethat was the man and now he too would go to the devilthat was the boy in him so he put his head down on the green oilcloth tablecover and wept before resigning his post and all it offered  but the reward of his services came he was given three days to reconsider himself and the head of the establishment after some telegraphings said that it was a most unusual step but in view of the ability that mr hatt had displayed at such and such a time at such and such junctures he was in a position to offer him an infinitely superior postfirst on probation and later in the natural course of things on confirmation and how much does the post carry said dicky six hundred and fifty rupees said the head slowly expecting to see the young man sink with gratitude and joy  and it came then the seven hundred rupee passage and enough to have saved the wife and the little son and to have allowed of assured and open marriage came then dicky burst into a roar of laughterlaughter he could not check nasty jangling merriment that seemed as if it would go on forever when he had recovered himself he said quite seriouslyim tired of work im an old man now its about time i retired and i will  the boys mad said the head  i think he was right but dicky hatt never reappeared to settle the question     pig  go stalk the red deer oer the heather   ride follow the fox if you can but for pleasure and profit together   allow me the hunting of man the chase of the human the search for the soul   to its ruinthe hunting of man              the old shikarri  i believe the difference began in the matter of a horse with a twist in his temper whom pinecoffin sold to nafferton and by whom nafferton was nearly slain there may have been other causes of offence the horse was the official stalkinghorse nafferton was very angry but pinecoffin laughed and said that he had never guaranteed the beasts manners nafferton laughed too though he vowed that he would write off his fall against pinecoffin if he waited five years now a dalesman from beyond skipton will forgive an injury when the strid lets a man live but a south devon man is as soft as a dartmoor bog you can see from their names that nafferton had the raceadvantage of pinecoffin he was a peculiar man and his notions of humor were cruel he taught me a new and fascinating form of shikar he hounded pinecoffin from mithankot to jagadri and from gurgaon to abbottabad up and across the punjab a large province and in places remarkably dry he said that he had no intention of allowing assistant commissioners to sell him pups in the shape of ramping screaming countrybreds without making their lives a burden to them  most assistant commissioners develop a bent for some special work after their first hot weather in the country the boys with digestions hope to write their names large on the frontier and struggle for dreary places like bannu and kohat the bilious ones climb into the secretariat which is very bad for the liver  others are bitten with a mania for district work ghuznivide coins or persian poetry while some who come of farmers stock find that the smell of the earth after the rains gets into their blood and calls them to develop the resources of the province these men are enthusiasts pinecoffin belonged to their class he knew a great many facts bearing on the cost of bullocks and temporary wells and opiumscrapers and what happens if you burn too much rubbish on a field in the hope of enriching usedup soil all the pinecoffins come of a landholding breed and so the land only took back her own again unfortunatelymost unfortunately for pinecoffinhe was a civilian as well as a farmer nafferton watched him and thought about the horse nafferton said see me chase that boy till he drops i saidyou cant get your knife into an assistant commissioner nafferton told me that i did not understand the administration of the province  our government is rather peculiar it gushes on the agricultural and general information side and will supply a moderately respectable man with all sorts of economic statistics if he speaks to it prettily for instance you are interested in goldwashing in the sands of the sutlej you pull the string and find that it wakes up half a dozen departments and finally communicates say with a friend of yours in the telegraph who once wrote some notes on the customs of the goldwashers when he was on constructionwork in their part of the empire he may or may not be pleased at being ordered to write out everything he knows for your benefit this depends on his temperament the bigger man you are the more information and the greater trouble can you raise  nafferton was not a big man but he had the reputation of being very earnest an earnest man can do much with a government there was an earnest man who once nearly wrecked    but all india knows that story i am not sure what real earnestness is a very fair imitation can be manufactured by neglecting to dress decently by mooning about in a dreamy misty sort of way by taking officework home after staying in office till seven and by receiving crowds of native gentlemen on sundays that is one sort of earnestness  nafferton cast about for a peg whereon to hang his earnestness and for a string that would communicate with pinecoffin he found both  they were pig nafferton became an earnest inquirer after pig he informed the government that he had a scheme whereby a very large percentage of the british army in india could be fed at a very large saving on pig then he hinted that pinecoffin might supply him with the varied information necessary to the proper inception of the scheme so the government wrote on the back of the letterinstruct mr pinecoffin to furnish mr nafferton with any information in his power government is very prone to writing things on the backs of letters which later lead to trouble and confusion  nafferton had not the faintest interest in pig but he knew that pinecoffin would flounce into the trap pinecoffin was delighted at being consulted about pig the indian pig is not exactly an important factor in agricultural life but nafferton explained to pinecoffin that there was room for improvement and corresponded direct with that young man  you may think that there is not much to be evolved from pig it all depends how you set to work pinecoffin being a civilian and wishing to do things thoroughly began with an essay on the primitive pig the mythology of the pig and the dravidian pig  nafferton filed that informationtwentyseven foolscap sheetsand wanted to know about the distribution of the pig in the punjab and how it stood the plains in the hot weather from this point onwards remember that i am giving you only the barest outlines of the affairthe guyropes as it were of the web that nafferton spun round pinecoffin  pinecoffin made a colored pigpopulation map and collected observations on the comparative longevity of the pig a in the submontane tracts of the himalayas and b in the rechna doab  nafferton filed that and asked what sort of people looked after pig this started an ethnological excursus on swineherds and drew from pinecoffin long tables showing the proportion per thousand of the caste in the derajat nafferton filed that bundle and explained that the figures which he wanted referred to the cissutlej states where he understood that pigs were very fine and large and where he proposed to start a piggery by this time government had quite forgotten their instructions to mr pinecoffin  they were like the gentlemen in keats poem who turned welloiled wheels to skin other people but pinecoffin was just entering into the spirit of the pig hunt as nafferton well knew he would do he had a fair amount of work of his own to clear away but he sat up of nights reducing pig to five places of decimals for the honor of his service he was not going to appear ignorant of so easy a subject as pig  then government sent him on special duty to kohat to inquire into the big sevenfoot ironshod spades of that district people had been killing each other with those peaceful tools and government wished to know whether a modified form of agricultural implement could not tentatively and as a temporary measure be introduced among the agricultural population without needlessly or unduly exasperating the existing religious sentiments of the peasantry  between those spades and naffertons pig pinecoffin was rather heavily burdened   nafferton now began to take up a the foodsupply of the indigenous pig with a view to the improvement of its capacities as a fleshformer b the acclimatization of the exotic pig maintaining its distinctive peculiarities pinecoffin replied exhaustively that the exotic pig would become merged in the indigenous type and quoted horsebreeding statistics to prove this  the sideissue was debated at great length on pinecoffins side till nafferton owned that he had been in the wrong and moved the previous question when pinecoffin had quite written himself out about fleshformers and fibrins and glucose and the nitrogenous constituents of maize and lucerne nafferton raised the question of expense by this time pinecoffin who had been transferred from kohat had developed a pig theory of his own which he stated in thirtythree folio pagesall carefully filed by nafferton who asked for more  these things took ten months and pinecoffins interest in the potential piggery seemed to die down after he had stated his own views but nafferton bombarded him with letters on the imperial aspect of the scheme as tending to officialize the sale of pork and thereby calculated to give offence to the mahomedan population of upper india he guessed that pinecoffin would want some broad freehand work after his niggling stippling decimal details  pinecoffin handled the latest development of the case in masterly style and proved that no popular ebullition of excitement was to be apprehended nafferton said that there was nothing like civilian insight in matters of this kind and lured him up a byepaththe possible profits to accrue to the government from the sale of hogbristles there is an extensive literature of hogbristles and the shoe brush and colormans trades recognize more varieties of bristles than you would think possible after pinecoffin had wondered a little at naffertons rage for information he sent back a monograph fiftyone pages on products of the pig this led him under naffertons tender handling straight to the cawnpore factories the trade in hogskin for saddlesand thence to the tanners pinecoffin wrote that pomegranateseed was the best cure for hogskin and suggestedfor the past fourteen months had wearied himthat nafferton should raise his pigs before he tanned them  nafferton went back to the second section of his fifth question  how could the exotic pig be brought to give as much pork as it did in the west and yet assume the essentially hirsute characteristics of its oriental congener pinecoffin felt dazed for he had forgotten what he had written sixteen months before and fancied that he was about to reopen the entire question he was too far involved in the hideous tangle to retreat and in a weak moment he wroteconsult my first letter which related to the dravidian pig as a matter of fact pinecoffin had still to reach the acclimatization stage having gone off on a sideissue on the merging of types  then nafferton really unmasked his batteries he complained to the government in stately language of the paucity of help accorded to me in my earnest attempts to start a potentially remunerative industry and the flippancy with which my requests for information are treated by a gentleman whose pseudo scholarly attainments should at lest have taught him the primary differences between the dravidian and the berkshire variety of the genus sus if i am to understand that the letter to which he refers me contains his serious views on the acclimatization of a valuable though possibly uncleanly animal i am reluctantly compelled to believe etc etc  there was a new man at the head of the department of castigation  the wretched pinecoffin was told that the service was made for the country and not the country for the service and that he had better begin to supply information about pigs  pinecoffin answered insanely that he had written everything that could be written about pig and that some furlough was due to him  nafferton got a copy of that letter and sent it with the essay on the dravidian pig to a downcountry paper which printed both in full the essay was rather highflown but if the editor had seen the stacks of paper in pinecoffins handwriting on naffertons table he would not have been so sarcastic about the nebulous discursiveness and blatant selfsufficiency of the modern competitionwallah and his utter inability to grasp the practical issues of a practical question many friends cut out these remarks and sent them to pinecoffin  i have already stated that pinecoffin came of a soft stock this last stroke frightened and shook him he could not understand it but he felt he had been somehow shamelessly betrayed by nafferton  he realized that he had wrapped himself up in the pigskin without need and that he could not well set himself right with his government all his acquaintances asked after his nebulous discursiveness or his blatant self sufficiency and this made him miserable  he took a train and went to nafferton whom he had not seen since the pig business began he also took the cutting from the paper and blustered feebly and called nafferton names and then died down to a watery weak protest of the isayitstoobadyouknow order  nafferton was very sympathetic  im afraid ive given you a good deal of trouble havent i said he  trouble whimpered pinecoffin i dont mind the trouble so much though that was bad enough but what i resent is this showing up in print it will stick to me like a burr all through my service and i did do my best for your interminable swine its too bad of you on my soul it is  i dont know said nafferton have you ever been stuck with a horse it isnt the money i mind though that is bad enough but what i resent is the chaff that follows especially from the boy who stuck me but i think well cry quite now  pinecoffin found nothing to say save bad words and nafferton smiled ever so sweetly and asked him to dinner    the rout of the white hussars  it was not in the open fight   we threw away the sword but in the lonely watching   in the darkness by the ford  the waters lapped the nightwind blew fullarmed the fear was born and grew and we were flying ere we knew   from panic in the night           beoni bar  some people hold that an english cavalry regiment cannot run this is a mistake i have seen four hundred and thirtyseven sabres flying over the face of the country in abject terrorhave seen the best regiment that ever drew bridle wiped off the army list for the space of two hours if you repeat this tale to the white hussars they will in all probability treat you severely they are not proud of the incident  you may know the white hussars by their side which is greater than that of all the cavalry regiments on the roster if this is not a sufficient mark you may know them by their old brandy it has been sixty years in the mess and is worth going far to taste  ask for the mcgaire old brandy and see that you get it if the mess sergeant thinks that you are uneducated and that the genuine article will be lost on you he will treat you accordingly he is a good man but when you are at mess you must never talk to your hosts about forced marches or longdistance rides the mess are very sensitive and if they think that you are laughing at them will tell you so  as the white hussars say it was all the colonels fault he was a new man and he ought never to have taken the command he said that the regiment was not smart enough this to the white hussars who knew they could walk round any horse and through any guns and over any foot on the face of the earth that insult was the first cause of offence  then the colonel cast the drumhorsethe drumhorse of the white hussars perhaps you do not see what an unspeakable crime he had committed i will try to make it clear the soul of the regiment lives in the drumhorse who carries the silver kettledrums he is nearly always a big piebald waler that is a point of honor and a regiment will spend anything you please on a piebald he is beyond the ordinary laws of casting his work is very light and he only manoeuvres at a footpace wherefore so long as he can step out and look handsome his wellbeing is assured he knows more about the regiment than the adjutant and could not make a mistake if he tried  the drumhorse of the white hussars was only eighteen years old and perfectly equal to his duties he had at least six years more work in him and carried himself with all the pomp and dignity of a drummajor of the guards the regiment had paid rs 1200 for him  but the colonel said that he must go and he was cast in due form and replaced by a washy bay beast as ugly as a mule with a eweneck rattail and cow hocks the drummer detested that animal and the best of the bandhorses put back their ears and showed the whites of their eyes at the very sight of him they knew him for an upstart and no gentleman i fancy that the colonels ideas of smartness extended to the band and that he wanted to make it take part in the regular parade movements a cavalry band is a sacred thing it only turns out for commanding officers parades and the band master is one degree more important than the colonel he is a high priest and the keel row is his holy song the keel row is the cavalry trot and the man who has never heard that tune rising high and shrill above the rattle of the regiment going past the salutingbase has something yet to hear and understand  when the colonel cast the drumhorse of the white hussars there was nearly a mutiny  the officers were angry the regiment were furious and the bandsman swore like troopers the drumhorse was going to be put up to auctionpublic auctionto be bought perhaps by a parsee and put into a cart it was worse than exposing the inner life of the regiment to the whole world or selling the mess plate to a jewa black jew  the colonel was a mean man and a bully he knew what the regiment thought about his action and when the troopers offered to buy the drumhorse he said that their offer was mutinous and forbidden by the regulations  but one of the subalternshoganyale an irishmanbought the drumhorse for rs 160 at the sale and the colonel was wroth yale professed repentancehe was unnaturally submissiveand said that as he had only made the purchase to save the horse from possible illtreatment and starvation he would now shoot him and end the business this appeared to soothe the colonel for he wanted the drumhorse disposed of he felt that he had made a mistake and could not of course acknowledge it meantime the presence of the drumhorse was an annoyance to him  yale took to himself a glass of the old brandy three cheroots and his friend martyn and they all left the mess together yale and martyn conferred for two hours in yales quarters but only the bullterrier who keeps watch over yales boottrees knows what they said a horse hooded and sheeted to his ears left yales stables and was taken very unwillingly into the civil lines yales groom went with him two men broke into the regimental theatre and took several paintpots and some large scenery brushes then night fell over the cantonments and there was a noise as of a horse kicking his loosebox to pieces in yales stables yale had a big old white waler traphorse  the next day was a thursday and the men hearing that yale was going to shoot the drumhorse in the evening determined to give the beast a regular regimental funerala finer one than they would have given the colonel had he died just then they got a bullockcart and some sacking and mounds and mounds of roses and the body under sacking was carried out to the place where the anthrax cases were cremated twothirds of the regiment followed there was no band but they all sang the place where the old horse died as something respectful and appropriate to the occasion when the corpse was dumped into the grave and the men began throwing down armfuls of roses to cover it the farriersergeant ripped out an oath and said aloudwhy it aint the drum horse any more than its me the troopsergeantmajors asked him whether he had left his head in the canteen the farriersergeant said that he knew the drumhorses feet as well as he knew his own but he was silenced when he saw the regimental number burnt in on the poor stiff upturned nearfore  thus was the drumhorse of the white hussars buried the farriersergeant grumbling the sacking that covered the corpse was smeared in places with black paint and the farriersergeant drew attention to this fact but the troop sergeantmajor of e troop kicked him severely on the shin and told him that he was undoubtedly drunk  on the monday following the burial the colonel sought revenge on the white hussars unfortunately being at that time temporarily in command of the station he ordered a brigade fieldday he said that he wished to make the regiment sweat for their damned insolence and he carried out his notion thoroughly that monday was one of the hardest days in the memory of the white hussars  they were thrown against a skeletonenemy and pushed forward and withdrawn and dismounted and scientifically handled in every possible fashion over dusty country till they sweated profusely  their only amusement came late in the day when they fell upon the battery of horse artillery and chased it for two miles this was a personal question and most of the troopers had money on the event the gunners saying openly that they had the legs of the white hussars they were wrong a marchpast concluded the campaign and when the regiment got back to their lines the men were coated with dirt from spur to chinstrap  the white hussars have one great and peculiar privilege they won it at fontenoy i think  many regiments possess special rights such as wearing collars with undress uniform or a bow of ribbon between the shoulders or red and white roses in their helmets on certain days of the year some rights are connected with regimental saints and some with regimental successes all are valued highly but none so highly as the right of the white hussars to have the band playing when their horses are being watered in the lines only one tune is played and that tune never varies i dont know its real name but the white hussars call ittake me to london again it sounds very pretty the regiment would sooner be struck off the roster than forego their distinction  after the dismiss was sounded the officers rode off home to prepare for stables and the men filed into the lines riding easy  that is to say they opened their tight buttons shifted their helmets and began to joke or to swear as the humor took them the more careful slipping off and easing girths and curbs a good trooper values his mount exactly as much as he values himself and believes or should believe that the two together are irresistible where women or men girls or guns are concerned  then the orderlyofficer gave the orderwater horses and the regiment loafed off to the squadrontroughs which were in rear of the stables and between these and the barracks there were four huge troughs one for each squadron arranged en echelon so that the whole regiment could water in ten minutes if it liked but it lingered for seventeen as a rule while the band played  the band struck up as the squadrons filed off the troughs and the men slipped their feet out of the stirrups and chaffed each other  the sun was just setting in a big hot bed of red cloud and the road to the civil lines seemed to run straight into the suns eye  there was a little dot on the road it grew and grew till it showed as a horse with a sort of gridiron thing on his back the red cloud glared through the bars of the gridiron some of the troopers shaded their eyes with their hands and saidwhat the mischief as that there orse got on im  in another minute they heard a neigh that every soulhorse and manin the regiment knew and saw heading straight towards the band the dead drumhorse of the white hussars  on his withers banged and bumped the kettledrums draped in crape and on his back very stiff and soldierly sat a bareheaded skeleton  the band stopped playing and for a moment there was a hush  then some one in e troopmen said it was the troopsergeantmajorswung his horse round and yelled no one can account exactly for what happened afterwards but it seems that at least one man in each troop set an example of panic and the rest followed like sheep the horses that had barely put their muzzles into the troughs reared and capered but as soon as the band broke which it did when the ghost of the drumhorse was about a furlong distant all hooves followed suit and the clatter of the stampedequite different from the orderly throb and roar of a movement on parade or the rough horseplay of watering in campmade them only more terrified they felt that the men on their backs were afraid of something when horses once know that all is over except the butchery  troop after troop turned from the troughs and rananywhere and everywhere like spilt quicksilver it was a most extraordinary spectacle for men and horses were in all stages of easiness and the carbinebuckets flopping against their sides urged the horses on men were shouting and cursing and trying to pull clear of the band which was being chased by the drumhorse whose rider had fallen forward and seemed to be spurring for a wager  the colonel had gone over to the mess for a drink most of the officers were with him and the subaltern of the day was preparing to go down to the lines and receive the watering reports from the troopsergeant majors when take me to london again stopped after twenty bars every one in the mess saidwhat on earth has happened a minute later they heard unmilitary noises and saw far across the plain the white hussars scattered and broken and flying  the colonel was speechless with rage for he thought that the regiment had risen against him or was unanimously drunk the band a disorganized mob tore past and at its heels labored the drumhorsethe dead and buried drumhorse with the jolting clattering skeleton hoganyale whispered softly to martyn no wire will stand that treatment and the band which had doubled like a hare came back again but the rest of the regiment was gone was rioting all over the province for the dusk had shut in and each man was howling to his neighbor that the drumhorse was on his flank  troophorses are far too tenderly treated as a rule they can on emergencies do a great deal even with seventeen stone on their backs as the troopers found out  how long this panic lasted i cannot say i believe that when the moon rose the men saw they had nothing to fear and by twos and threes and halftroops crept back into cantonments very much ashamed of themselves meantime the drumhorse disgusted at his treatment by old friends pulled up wheeled round and trotted up to the mess verandahsteps for bread no one liked to run but no one cared to go forward till the colonel made a movement and laid hold of the skeletons foot the band had halted some distance away and now came back slowly the colonel called it individually and collectively every evil name that occurred to him at the time for he had set his hand on the bosom of the drumhorse and found flesh and blood then he beat the kettle drums with his clenched fist and discovered that they were but made of silvered paper and bamboo next still swearing he tried to drag the skeleton out of the saddle but found that it had been wired into the cantle the sight of the colonel with his arms round the skeletons pelvis and his knee in the old drumhorses stomach was striking not to say amusing he worried the thing off in a minute or two and threw it down on the ground saying to the bandhere you curs thats what youre afraid of the skeleton did not look pretty in the twilight the bandsergeant seemed to recognize it for he began to chuckle and choke shall i take it away sir said the band sergeant yes said the colonel take it to hell and ride there yourselves  the bandsergeant saluted hoisted the skeleton across his saddlebow and led off to the stables then the colonel began to make inquiries for the rest of the regiment and the language he used was wonderful he would disband the regimenthe would courtmartial every soul in ithe would not command such a set of rabble and so on and so on as the men dropped in his language grew wilder until at last it exceeded the utmost limits of free speech allowed even to a colonel of horse  martyn took hoganyale aside and suggested compulsory retirement from the service as a necessity when all was discovered martyn was the weaker man of the two hoganyale put up his eyebrows and remarked firstly that he was the son of a lord and secondly that he was as innocent as the babe unborn of the theatrical resurrection of the drumhorse  my instructions said yale with a singularly sweet smile were that the drumhorse should be sent back as impressively as possible  i ask you am i responsible if a muleheaded friend sends him back in such a manner as to disturb the peace of mind of a regiment of her majestys cavalry  martyn saidyou are a great man and will in time become a general but id give my chance of a troop to be safe out of this affair  providence saved martyn and hoganyale the secondincommand led the colonel away to the little curtained alcove wherein the subalterns of the white hussars were accustomed to play poker of nights and there after many oaths on the colonels part they talked together in low tones i fancy that the secondin command must have represented the scare as the work of some trooper whom it would be hopeless to detect and i know that he dwelt upon the sin and the shame of making a public laughingstock of the scare  they will call us said the secondincommand who had really a fine imagination they will call us the flybynights they will call us the ghost hunters they will nickname us from one end of the army list to the other all the explanations in the world wont make outsiders understand that the officers were away when the panic began for the honor of the regiment and for your own sake keep this thing quiet  the colonel was so exhausted with anger that soothing him down was not so difficult as might be imagined he was made to see gently and by degrees that it was obviously impossible to courtmartial the whole regiment and equally impossible to proceed against any subaltern who in his belief had any concern in the hoax  but the beasts alive hes never been shot at all shouted the colonel its flat flagrant disobedience ive known a man broke for less dd sight less theyre mocking me i tell you mutman theyre mocking me  once more the secondincommand set himself to sooth the colonel and wrestled with him for halfanhour at the end of that time the regimental sergeant major reported himself the situation was rather novel tell to him but he was not a man to be put out by circumstances he saluted and said regiment all come back sir then to propitiate the colonelan none of the horses any the worse sir  the colonel only snorted and answeredyoud better tuck the men into their cots then and see that they dont wake up and cry in the night the sergeant withdrew  his little stroke of humor pleased the colonel and further he felt slightly ashamed of the language he had been using the secondincommand worried him again and the two sat talking far into the night  next day but one there was a commanding officers parade and the colonel harangued the white hussars vigorously the pith of his speech was that since the drumhorse in his old age had proved himself capable of cutting up the whole regiment he should return to his post of pride at the head of the band but the regiment were a set of ruffians with bad consciences  the white hussars shouted and threw everything movable about them into the air and when the parade was over they cheered the colonel till they couldnt speak no cheers were put up for lieutenant hoganyale who smiled very sweetly in the background  said the secondincommand to the colonel unofficiallythese little things ensure popularity and do not the least affect discipline  but i went back on my word said the colonel  never mind said the secondincommand the white hussars will follow you anywhere from today regiments are just like women they will do anything for trinketry  a week later hoganyale received an extraordinary letter from some one who signed himself secretary charity and zeal 3709 e c and asked for the return of our skeleton which we have reason to believe is in your possession  who the deuce is this lunatic who trades in bones said hoganyale  beg your pardon sir said the bandsergeant but the skeleton is with me an ill return it if youll pay the carriage into the civil lines theres a coffin with it sir  hoganyale smiled and handed two rupees to the bandsergeant sayingwrite the date on the skull will you  if you doubt this story and know where to go you can see the date on the skeleton but dont mention the matter to the white hussars  i happen to know something about it because i prepared the drumhorse for his resurrection he did not take kindly to the skeleton at all    the bronckhorst divorcecase   in the daytime when she moved about me   in the night when she was sleeping at my side  i was wearied i was wearied of her presence   day by day and night by night i grew to hate her   would to god that she or i had died              confessions  there was a man called bronckhorsta threecornered middleaged man in the armygray as a badger and some people said with a touch of countryblood in him that however cannot be proved  mrs bronckhorst was not exactly young though fifteen years younger than her husband she was a large pale quiet woman with heavy eyelids over weak eyes and hair that turned red or yellow as the lights fell on it  bronckhorst was not nice in any way he had no respect for the pretty public and private lies that make life a little less nasty than it is his manner towards his wife was coarse there are many thingsincluding actual assault with the clenched fistthat a wife will endure but seldom a wife can bearas mrs bronckhorst borewith a long course of brutal hard chaff making light of her weaknesses her headaches her small fits of gaiety her dresses her queer little attempts to make herself attractive to her husband when she knows that she is not what she has been andworst of allthe love that she spends on her children that particular sort of heavyhanded jest was specially dear to bronckhorst i suppose that he had first slipped into it meaning no harm in the honeymoon when folk find their ordinary stock of endearments run short and so go to the other extreme to express their feelings a similar impulse makes a man sayhutt you old beast when a favorite horse nuzzles his coatfront unluckily when the reaction of marriage sets in the form of speech remains and the tenderness having died out hurts the wife more than she cares to say but mrs bronckhorst was devoted to her teddy as she called him  perhaps that was why he objected to her perhapsthis is only a theory to account for his infamous behavior later onhe gave way to the queer savage feeling that sometimes takes by the throat a husband twenty years married when he sees across the table the same face of his wedded wife and knows that as he has sat facing it so must he continue to sit until day of its death or his own  most men and all women know the spasm it only lasts for three breaths as a rule must be a throwback to times when men and women were rather worse than they are now and is too unpleasant to be discussed  dinner at the bronckhorsts was an infliction few men cared to undergo bronckhorst took a pleasure in saying things that made his wife wince when their little boy came in at dessert bronckhorst used to give him half a glass of wine and naturally enough the poor little mite got first riotous next miserable and was removed screaming bronckhorst asked if that was the way teddy usually behaved and whether mrs bronckhorst could not spare some of her time to teach the little beggar decency mrs bronckhorst who loved the boy more than her own life tried not to cryher spirit seemed to have been broken by her marriage lastly bronckhorst used to saythere thatll do thatll do for gods sake try to behave like a rational woman go into the drawing room mrs bronckhorst would go trying to carry it all off with a smile and the guest of the evening would feel angry and uncomfortable  after three years of this cheerful lifefor mrs bronckhorst had no woman friends to talk tothe station was startled by the news that bronckhorst had instituted proceedings on the criminal count against a man called biel who certainly had been rather attentive to mrs bronckhorst whenever she had appeared in public the utter want of reserve with which bronckhorst treated his own dishonor helped us to know that the evidence against biel would be entirely circumstantial and native there were no letters but bronckhorst said openly that he would rack heaven and earth until he saw biel superintending the manufacture of carpets in the central jail mrs bronckhorst kept entirely to her house and let charitable folks say what they pleased opinions were divided some twothirds of the station jumped at once to the conclusion that biel was guilty but a dozen men who knew and liked him held by him biel was furious and surprised he denied the whole thing and vowed that he would thrash bronckhorst within an inch of his life no jury we knew could convict a man on the criminal count on native evidence in a land where you can buy a murdercharge including the corpse all complete for fiftyfour rupees but biel did not care to scrape through by the benefit of a doubt he wanted the whole thing cleared but as he said one nighthe can prove anything with servants evidence and ive only my bare word this was about a month before the case came on and beyond agreeing with biel we could do little all that we could be sure of was that the native evidence would be bad enough to blast biels character for the rest of his service for when a native begins perjury he perjures himself thoroughly he does not boggle over details  some genius at the end of the table whereat the affair was being talked over saidlook here i dont believe lawyers are any good get a man to wire to strickland and beg him to come down and pull us through  strickland was about a hundred and eighty miles up the line he had not long been married to miss youghal but he scented in the telegram a chance of return to the old detective work that his soul lusted after and next night he came in and heard our story he finished his pipe and said oracularlywe must get at the evidence oorya bearer mussalman khit and methraniayah i suppose are the pillars of the charge i am on in this piece but im afraid im getting rusty in my talk  he rose and went into biels bedroom where his trunk had been put and shut the door an hour later we heard him sayi hadnt the heart to part with my old makeups when i married will this do there was a lothely faquir salaaming in the doorway  now lend me fifty rupees said strickland and give me your words of honor that you wont tell my wife  he got all that he asked for and left the house while the table drank his health what he did only he himself knows a faquir hung about bronckhorsts compound for twelve days then a mehter appeared and when biel heard of him he said that strickland was an angel fullfledged whether the mehter made love to janki mrs bronckhorsts ayah is a question which concerns strickland exclusively  he came back at the end of three weeks and said quietlyyou spoke the truth biel the whole business is put up from beginning to end jove it almost astonishes me that bronckhorstbeast isnt fit to live  there was uproar and shouting and biel saidhow are you going to prove it you cant say that youve been trespassing on bronckhorsts compound in disguise  no said strickland tell your lawyerfool whoever he is to get up something strong about inherent improbabilities and discrepancies of evidence he wont have to speak but it will make him happy im going to run this business  biel held his tongue and the other men waited to see what would happen they trusted strickland as men trust quiet men when the case came off the court was crowded strickland hung about in the verandah of the court till he met the mohammedan khitmatgar then he murmured a faquirs blessing in his ear and asked him how his second wife did the man spun round and as he looked into the eyes of estreeken sahib his jaw dropped you must remember that before strickland was married he was as i have told you already a power among natives strickland whispered a rather coarse vernacular proverb to the effect that he was abreast of all that was going on and went into the court armed with a gut trainerswhip  the mohammedan was the first witness and strickland beamed upon him from the back of the court the man moistened his lips with his tongue and in his abject fear of estreeken sahib the faquir went back on every detail of his evidencesaid he was a poor man and god was his witness that he had forgotten every thing that bronckhorst sahib had told him to say between his terror of strickland the judge and bronckhorst he collapsed weeping  then began the panic among the witnesses janki the ayah leering chastely behind her veil turned gray and the bearer left the court he said that his mamma was dying and that it was not wholesome for any man to lie unthriftily in the presence of estreeken sahib  biel said politely to bronckhorstyour witnesses dont seem to work havent you any forged letters to produce but bronckhorst was swaying to and fro in his chair and there was a dead pause after biel had been called to order  bronckhorsts counsel saw the look on his clients face and without more ado pitched his papers on the little green baize table and mumbled something about having been misinformed the whole court applauded wildly like soldiers at a theatre and the judge began to say what he thought                              biel came out of the place and strickland dropped a gut trainerswhip in the verandah ten minutes later biel was cutting bronckhorst into ribbons behind the old court cells quietly and without scandal what was left of bronckhorst was sent home in a carriage and his wife wept over it and nursed it into a man again  later on after biel had managed to hush up the countercharge against bronckhorst of fabricating false evidence mrs bronckhorst with her faint watery smile said that there had been a mistake but it wasnt her teddys fault altogether she would wait till her teddy came back to her perhaps he had grown tired of her or she had tried his patience and perhaps we wouldnt cut her any more and perhaps the mothers would let their children play with little teddy again he was so lonely then the station invited mrs bronckhorst everywhere until bronckhorst was fit to appear in public when he went home and took his wife with him according to the latest advices her teddy did come back to her and they are moderately happy though of course he can never forgive her the thrashing that she was the indirect means of getting for him                              what biel wants to know iswhy didnt i press home the charge against the bronckhorstbrute and have him run in  what mrs strickland wants to know ishow did my husband bring such a lovely lovely waler from your station i know all his moneyaffairs and im certain he didnt buy it  what i want to know ishow do women like mrs bronckhorst come to marry men like bronckhorst  and my conundrum is the most unanswerable of the three    venus annodomini   and the years went on as the years must do  but our great diana was always new  fresh and blooming and blonde and fair  with azure eyes and with aureate hair  and all the folk as they came or went  offered her praise to her hearts content             diana of ephesus  she had nothing to do with number eighteen in the braccio nuovo of the vatican between viscontis ceres and the god of the nile she was purely an indian deityan angloindian deity that is to sayand we called her the venus annodomini to distinguish her from other annodominis of the same everlasting order there was a legend among the hills that she had once been young but no living man was prepared to come forward and say boldly that the legend was true  men rode up to simla and stayed and went away and made their name and did their lifes work and returned again to find the venus annodomini exactly as they had left her she was as immutable as the hills but not quite so green all that a girl of eighteen could do in the way of riding walking dancing picnicking and overexertion generally the venus annodomini did and showed no sign of fatigue or trace of weariness besides perpetual youth she had discovered men said the secret of perpetual health and her fame spread about the land from a mere woman she grew to be an institution insomuch that no young man could be said to be properly formed who had not at some time or another worshipped at the shrine of the venus annodomini there was no one like her though there were many imitations six years in her eyes were no more than six months to ordinary women and ten made less visible impression on her than does a weeks fever on an ordinary woman every one adored her and in return she was pleasant and courteous to nearly every one youth had been a habit of hers for so long that she could not part with itnever realized in fact the necessity of parting with itand took for her more chosen associates young people  among the worshippers of the venus annodomini was young gayerson  very young gayerson he was called to distinguish him from his father young gayerson a bengal civilian who affected the customsas he had the heartof youth very young gayerson was not content to worship placidly and for forms sake as the other young men did or to accept a ride or a dance or a talk from the venus annodomini in a properly humble and thankful spirit he was exacting and therefore the venus annodomini repressed him he worried himself nearly sick in a futile sort of way over her and his devotion and earnestness made him appear either shy or boisterous or rude as his mood might vary by the side of the older men who with him bowed before the venus annodomini she was sorry for him he reminded her of a lad who threeand twenty years ago had professed a boundless devotion for her and for whom in return she had felt something more than a weeks weakness but that lad had fallen away and married another woman less than a year after he had worshipped her and the venus annodomini had almostnot quiteforgotten his name very young gayerson had the same big blue eyes and the same way of pouting his underlip when he was excited or troubled but the venus annodomini checked him sternly none the less too much zeal was a thing that she did not approve of preferring instead a tempered and sober tenderness  very young gayerson was miserable and took no trouble to conceal his wretchedness he was in the armya line regiment i think but am not certain and since his face was a lookingglass and his forehead an open book by reason of his innocence his brothers in arms made his life a burden to him and embittered his naturally sweet disposition no one except very young gayerson and he never told his views knew how old very young gayerson believed the venus annodomini to be perhaps he thought her five and twenty or perhaps she told him that she was this age very young gayerson would have forded the gugger in flood to carry her lightest word and had implicit faith in her every one liked him and every one was sorry when they saw him so bound a slave of the venus annodomini every one too admitted that it was not her fault for the venus annodomini differed from mrs hauksbee and mrs reiver in this particularshe never moved a finger to attract any one but like ninon de lenclos all men were attracted to her one could admire and respect mrs hauksbee despise and avoid mrs reiver but one was forced to adore the venus annodomini  very young gayersons papa held a division or a collectorate or something administrative in a particularly unpleasant part of bengalfull of babus who edited newspapers proving that young gayerson was a nero and a scylla and a charybdis and in addition to the babus there was a good deal of dysentery and cholera abroad for nine months of the year young gayersonhe was about five and fortyrather liked babus they amused him but he objects to dysentery and when he could get away went to darjiling for the most part this particular season he fancied that he would come up to simla and see his boy the boy was not altogether pleased he told the venus annodomini that his father was coming up and she flushed a little and said that she should be delighted to make his acquaintance then she looked long and thoughtfully at very young gayerson because she was very very sorry for him and he was a very very big idiot  my daughter is coming out in a fortnight mr gayerson she said  your what said he  daughter said the venus annodomini shes been out for a year at home already and i want her to see a little of india she is nineteen and a very sensible nice girl i believe  very young gayerson who was a short twentytwo years old nearly fell out of his chair with astonishment for he had persisted in believing against all belief in the youth of the venus annodomini   she with her back to the curtained window watched the effect of her sentences and smiled  very young gayersons papa came up twelve days later and had not been in simla four and twenty hours before two men old acquaintances of his had told him how very young gayerson had been conducting himself  young gayerson laughed a good deal and inquired who the venus annodomini might be which proves that he had been living in bengal where nobody knows anything except the rate of exchange then he said boys will be boys and spoke to his son about the matter  very young gayerson said that he felt wretched and unhappy and young gayerson said that he repented of having helped to bring a fool into the world he suggested that his son had better cut his leave short and go down to his duties this led to an unfilial answer and relations were strained until young gayerson demanded that they should call on the venus annodomini very young gayerson went with his papa feeling somehow uncomfortable and small  the venus annodomini received them graciously and young gayerson saidby jove its kitty very young gayerson would have listened for an explanation if his time had not been taken up with trying to talk to a large handsome quiet welldressed girlintroduced to him by the venus annodomini as her daughter she was far older in manners style and repose than very young gayerson and as he realized this thing he felt sick  presently he heard the venus annodomini sayingdo you know that your son is one of my most devoted admirers  i dont wonder said young gayerson here he raised his voicehe follows his fathers footsteps didnt i worship the ground you trod on ever so long ago kittyand you havent changed since then how strange it all seems  very young gayerson said nothing his conversation with the daughter of the venus annodomini was through the rest of the call fragmentary and disjointed                              at five tomorrow then said the venus annodomini and mind you are punctual  at five punctual said young gayerson you can lend your old father a horse i dare say youngster cant you im going for a ride tomorrow afternoon  certainly said very young gayerson i am going down tomorrow morning my ponies are at your service sir  the venus annodomini looked at him across the halflight of the room and her big gray eyes filled with moisture she rose and shook hands with him  goodbye tom whispered the venus annodomini     the bisara of pooree   little blind fish thou art marvellous wise  little blind fish who put out thy eyes  open thine ears while i whisper my wish  bring me a lover thou little blind fish         the charm of the bisara  some natives say that it came from the other side of kulu where the eleven inch temple sapphire is others that it was made at the devilshrine of ao chung in thibet was stolen by a kafir from him by a gurkha from him again by a lahouli from him by a khitmatgar and by this latter sold to an englishman so all its virtue was lost because to work properly the bisara of pooree must be stolenwith bloodshed if possible but at any rate stolen  these stories of the coming into india are all false it was made at pooree ages sincethe manner of its making would fill a small bookwas stolen by one of the temple dancinggirls there for her own purposes and then passed on from hand to hand steadily northward till it reached hanla always bearing the same namethe bisara of pooree in shape it is a tiny square box of silver studded outside with eight small balasrubies inside the box which opens with a spring is a little eyeless fish carved from some sort of dark shiny nut and wrapped in a shred of faded goldcloth that is the bisara of pooree and it were better for a man to take a king cobra in his hand than to touch the bisara of pooree  all kinds of magic are out of date and done away with except in india where nothing changes in spite of the shiny toyscum stuff that people call civilization any man who knows about the bisara of pooree will tell you what its powers arealways supposing that it has been honestly stolen it is the only regularly working trustworthy lovecharm in the country with one exception  the other charm is in the hands of a trooper of the nizams horse at a place called tuprani due north of hyderabad this can be depended upon for a fact some one else may explain it  if the bisara be not stolen but given or bought or found it turns against its owner in three years and leads to ruin or death this is another fact which you may explain when you have time  meanwhile you can laugh at it at present the bisara is safe on an ekka ponys neck inside the blue beadnecklace that keeps off the evileye if the ekkadriver ever finds it and wears it or gives it to his wife i am sorry for him  a very dirty hillcooly woman with goitre owned it at theog in 1884 it came into simla from the north before churtons khitmatgar bought it and sold it for three times its silvervalue to churton who collected curiosities the servant knew no more what he had bought than the master but a man looking over churtons collection of curiositieschurton was an assistant commissioner by the waysaw and held his tongue he was an englishman but knew how to believe which shows that he was different from most englishmen he knew that it was dangerous to have any share in the little box when working or dormant for unsought love is a terrible gift  packgrubby pack as we used to call himwas in every way a nasty little man who must have crawled into the army by mistake he was three inches taller than his sword but not half so strong and the sword was a fiftyshilling tailormade one nobody liked him and i suppose it was his wizenedness and worthlessness that made him fall so hopelessly in love with miss hollis who was good and sweet and five foot seven in her tennis shoes he was not content with falling in love quietly but brought all the strength of his miserable little nature into the business if he had not been so objectionable one might have pitied him he vapored and fretted and fumed and trotted up and down and tried to make himself pleasing in miss holliss big quiet gray eyes and failed it was one of the cases that you sometimes meet even in this country where we marry by code of a really blind attachment all on one side without the faintest possibility of return miss hollis looked on pack as some sort of vermin running about the road he had no prospects beyond captains pay and no wits to help that out by one anna in a largesized man love like his would have been touching  in a good man it would have been grand he being what he was it was only a nuisance  you will believe this much what you will not believe is what follows churton and the man who knew that the bisara was were lunching at the simla club together churton was complaining of life in general his best mare had rolled out of stable down the hill and had broken her back his decisions were being reversed by the upper courts more than an assistant commissioner of eight years standing has a right to expect he knew liver and fever and for weeks past had felt out of sorts altogether he was disgusted and disheartened  simla club diningroom is built as all the world knows in two sections with an archarrangement dividing them come in turn to your own left take the table under the window and you cannot see any one who has come in turning to the right and taken a table on the right side of the arch curiously enough every word that you say can be heard not only by the other diner but by the servants beyond the screen through which they bring dinner this is worth knowing an echoingroom is a trap to be forewarned against  half in fun and half hoping to be believed the man who knew told churton the story of the bisara of pooree at rather greater length than i have told it to you in this place winding up with the suggestion that churton might as well throw the little box down the hill and see whether all his troubles would go with it in ordinary ears english ears the tale was only an interesting bit of folklore churton laughed said that he felt better for his tiffin and went out pack had been tiffining by himself to the right of the arch and had heard everything he was nearly mad with his absurd infatuation for miss hollis that all simla had been laughing about  it is a curious thing that when a man hates or loves beyond reason he is ready to go beyond reason to gratify his feelings which he would not do for money or power merely depend upon it solomon would never have built altars to ashtaroth and all those ladies with queer names if there had not been trouble of some kind in his zenana and nowhere else but this is beside the story the facts of the case are these pack called on churton next day when churton was out left his card and stole the bisara of pooree from its place under the clock on the mantelpiece stole it like the thief he was by nature three days later all simla was electrified by the news that miss hollis had accepted packthe shrivelled rat pack do you desire clearer evidence than this the bisara of pooree had been stolen and it worked as it had always done when won by foul means  there are three or four times in a mans life when he is justified in meddling with other peoples affairs to play providence  the man who knew felt that he was justified but believing and acting on a belief are quite different things the insolent satisfaction of pack as he ambled by the side of miss hollis and churtons striking release from liver as soon as the bisara of pooree had gone decided the man he explained to churton and churton laughed because he was not brought up to believe that men on the government house list stealat least little things but the miraculous acceptance by miss hollis of that tailor pack decided him to take steps on suspicion he vowed that he only wanted to find out where his rubystudded silver box had vanished to you cannot accuse a man on the government house list of stealing and if you rifle his room you are a thief yourself churton prompted by the man who knew decided on burglary if he found nothing in packs room     but it is not nice to think of what would have happened in that case  pack went to a dance at benmorebenmore was benmore in those days and not an officeand danced fifteen waltzes out of twentytwo with miss hollis churton and the man took all the keys that they could lay hands on and went to packs room in the hotel certain that his servants would be away pack was a cheap soul he had not purchased a decent cashbox to keep his papers in but one of those native imitations that you buy for ten rupees it opened to any sort of key and there at the bottom under packs insurance policy lay the bisara of pooree  churton called pack names put the bisara of pooree in his pocket and went to the dance with the man at least he came in time for supper and saw the beginning of the end in miss holliss eyes she was hysterical after supper and was taken away by her mamma  at the dance with the abominable bisara in his pocket churton twisted his foot on one of the steps leading down to the old rink and had to be sent home in a rickshaw grumbling he did not believe in the bisara of pooree any the more for this manifestation but he sought out pack and called him some ugly names and thief was the mildest of them pack took the names with the nervous smile of a little man who wants both soul and body to resent an insult and went his way there was no public scandal  a week later pack got his definite dismissal from miss hollis  there had been a mistake in the placing of her affections she said  so he went away to madras where he can do no great harm even if he lives to be a colonel  churton insisted upon the man who knew taking the bisara of pooree as a gift the man took it went down to the cart road at once found an ekka pony with a blue headnecklace fastened the bisara of pooree inside the necklace with a piece of shoestring and thanked heaven that he was rid of a danger remember in case you ever find it that you must not destroy the bisara of pooree i have not time to explain why just now but the power lies in the little wooden fish mister gubernatis or max muller could tell you more about it than i  you will say that all this story is made up very well if ever you come across a little silver rubystudded box seveneighths of an inch long by three quarters wide with a darkbrown wooden fish wrapped in gold cloth inside it keep it keep it for three years and then you will discover for yourself whether my story is true or false  better still steal it as pack did and you will be sorry that you had not killed yourself in the beginning    the gate of a hundred sorrows   if i can attain heaven for a pice why should you be envious           opium smokers proverb  this is no work of mine my friend gabral misquitta the halfcaste spoke it all between moonset and morning six weeks before he died and i took it down from his mouth as he answered my questions so  it lies between the coppersmiths gully and the pipestem sellers quarter within a hundred yards too as the crow flies of the mosque of wazir khan i dont mind telling any one this much but i defy him to find the gate however well he may think he knows the city you might even go through the very gully it stands in a hundred times and be none the wiser we used to call the gully the gully of the black smoke but its native name is altogether different of course a loaded donkey couldnt pass between the walls and at one point just before you reach the gate a bulged housefront makes people go along all sideways  it isnt really a gate though its a house old fungtching had it first five years ago he was a bootmaker in calcutta they say that he murdered his wife there when he was drunk that was why he dropped bazarrum and took to the black smoke instead later on he came up north and opened the gate as a house where you could get your smoke in peace and quiet mind you it was a pukka respectable opiumhouse and not one of those stifling sweltering chandoo khanas that you can find all over the city no the old man knew his business thoroughly and he was most clean for a chinaman he was a oneeyed little chap not much more than five feet high and both his middle fingers were gone all the same he was the handiest man at rolling black pills i have ever seen never seemed to be touched by the smoke either and what he took day and night night and day was a caution ive been at it five years and i can do my fair share of the smoke with any one but i was a child to fungtching that way all the same the old man was keen on his money very keen and thats what i cant understand i heard he saved a good deal before he died but his nephew has got all that now and the old mans gone back to china to be buried  he kept the big upper room where his best customers gathered as neat as a new pin in one corner used to stand fungtchings jossalmost as ugly as fung tchingand there were always sticks burning under his nose but you never smelt em when the pipes were going thick opposite the joss was fungtchings coffin he had spent a good deal of his savings on that and whenever a new man came to the gate he was always introduced to it it was lacquered black with red and gold writings on it and ive heard that fungtching brought it out all the way from china i dont know whether thats true or not but i know that if i came first in the evening i used to spread my mat just at the foot of it it was a quiet corner you see and a sort of breeze from the gully came in at the window now and then besides the mats there was no other furniture in the roomonly the coffin and the old joss all green and blue and purple with age and polish  fungtching never told us why he called the place the gate of a hundred sorrows he was the only chinaman i know who used badsounding fancy names most of them are flowery as youll see in calcutta we used to find that out for ourselves nothing grows on you so much if youre white as the black smoke a yellow man is made different opium doesnt tell on him scarcely at all but white and black suffer a good deal of course there are some people that the smoke doesnt touch any more than tobacco would at first they just doze a bit as one would fall asleep naturally and next morning they are almost fit for work now i was one of that sort when i began but ive been at it for five years pretty steadily and its different now there was an old aunt of mine down agra way and she left me a little at her death about sixty rupees a month secured sixty isnt much i can recollect a time seems hundreds and hundreds of years ago that i was getting my three hundred a month and pickings when i was working on a big timber contract in calcutta  i didnt stick to that work for long the black smoke does not allow of much other business and even though i am very little affected by it as men go i couldnt do a days work now to save my life after all sixty rupees is what i want when old fungtching was alive he used to draw the money for me give me about half of it to live on i eat very little and the rest he kept himself i was free of the gate at any time of the day and night and could smoke and sleep there when i liked so i didnt care i know the old man made a good thing out of it but thats no matter nothing matters much to me and besides the money always came fresh and fresh each month  there was ten of us met at the gate when the place was first opened me and two baboos from a government office somewhere in anarkulli but they got the sack and couldnt pay no man who has to work in the daylight can do the black smoke for any length of time straight on a chinaman that was fungtchings nephew a bazarwoman that had got a lot of money somehow an english loafer macsomebody i think but i have forgottenthat smoked heaps but never seemed to pay anything they said he had saved fungtchings life at some trial in calcutta when he was a barrister another eurasian like myself from madras a halfcaste woman and a couple of men who said they had come from the north i think they must have been persians or afghans or something there are not more than five of us living now but we come regular i dont know what happened to the baboos but the bazarwoman she died after six months of the gate and i think fungtching took her bangles and nosering for himself but im not certain the englishman he drank as well as smoked and he dropped off one of the persians got killed in a row at night by the big well near the mosque a long time ago and the police shut up the well because they said it was full of foul air  they found him dead at the bottom of it so you see there is only me the chinaman the halfcaste woman that we call the memsahib she used to live with fungtching the other eurasian and one of the persians the memsahib looks very old now i think she was a young woman when the gate was opened but we are all old for the matter of that hundreds and hundreds of years old it is very hard to keep count of time in the gate and besides time doesnt matter to me i draw my sixty rupees fresh and fresh every month  a very very long while ago when i used to be getting three hundred and fifty rupees a month and pickings on a big timbercontract at calcutta i had a wife of sorts but shes dead now people said that i killed her by taking to the black smoke perhaps i did but its so long since it doesnt matter sometimes when i first came to the gate i used to feel sorry for it but thats all over and done with long ago and i draw my sixty rupees fresh and fresh every month and am quite happy not drunk happy you know but always quiet and soothed and contented  how did i take to it it began at calcutta i used to try it in my own house just to see what it was like i never went very far but i think my wife must have died then anyhow i found myself here and got to know fungtching i dont remember rightly how that came about but he told me of the gate and i used to go there and somehow i have never got away from it since mind you though the gate was a respectable place in fungtchings time where you could be comfortable and not at all like the chandookhanas where the niggers go no it was clean and quiet and not crowded of course there were others beside us ten and the man but we always had a mat apiece with a wadded woollen headpiece all covered with black and red dragons and things just like a coffin in the corner  at the end of ones third pipe the dragons used to move about and fight ive watched em many and many a night through i used to regulate my smoke that way and now it takes a dozen pipes to make em stir besides they are all torn and dirty like the mats and old fungtching is dead he died a couple of years ago and gave me the pipe i always use nowa silver one with queer beasts crawling up and down the receiverbottle below the cup before that i think i used a big bamboo stem with a copper cup a very small one and a green jade mouthpiece it was a little thicker than a walkingstick stem and smoked sweet very sweet the bamboo seemed to suck up the smoke silver doesnt and ive got to clean it out now and then thats a great deal of trouble but i smoke it for the old mans sake he must have made a good thing out of me but he always gave me clean mats and pillows and the best stuff you could get anywhere  when he died his nephew tsinling took up the gate and he called it the temple of the three possessions but we old ones speak of it as the hundred sorrows all the same the nephew does things very shabbily and i think the memsahib must help him she lives with him same as she used to do with the old man the two let in all sorts of low people niggers and all and the black smoke isnt as good as it used to be ive found burnt bran in my pipe over and over again the old man would have died if that had happened in his time besides the room is never cleaned and all the mats are torn and cut at the edges the coffin has gonegone to china againwith the old man and two ounces of smoke inside it in case he should want em on the way  the joss doesnt get so many sticks burnt under his nose as he used to thats a sign of illluck as sure as death hes all brown too and no one ever attends to him thats the memsahibs work i know because when tsinling tried to burn gilt paper before him she said it was a waste of money and if he kept a stick burning very slowly the joss wouldnt know the difference so now weve got the sticks mixed with a lot of glue and they take halfanhour longer to burn and smell stinky let alone the smell of the room by itself no business can get on if they try that sort of thing  the joss doesnt like it i can see that late at night sometimes he turns all sorts of queer colorsblue and green and redjust as he used to do when old fungtching was alive and he rolls his eyes and stamps his feet like a devil  i dont know why i dont leave the place and smoke quietly in a little room of my own in the bazar most like tsinling would kill me if i went awayhe draws my sixty rupees nowand besides its so much trouble and ive grown to be very fond of the gate its not much to look at not what it was in the old mans time but i couldnt leave it ive seen so many come in and out and ive seen so many die here on the mats that i should be afraid of dying in the open now ive seen some things that people would call strange enough but nothing is strange when youre on the black smoke except the black smoke and if it was it wouldnt matter  fungtching used to be very particular about his people and never got in any one whod give trouble by dying messy and such but the nephew isnt half so careful he tells everywhere that he keeps a firstchop house never tries to get men in quietly and make them comfortable like fungtching did thats why the gate is getting a little bit more known than it used to be among the niggers of course the nephew darent get a white or for matter of that a mixed skin into the place he has to keep us three of courseme and the memsahib and the other eurasian were fixtures  but he wouldnt give us credit for a pipefulnot for anything  one of these days i hope i shall die in the gate the persian and the madras man are terrible shaky now theyve got a boy to light their pipes for them i always do that myself most like i shall see them carried out before me i dont think i shall ever outlive the memsahib or tsinling women last longer than men at the blacksmoke and tsinling has a deal of the old mans blood in him though he does smoke cheap stuff the bazarwoman knew when she was going two days before her time and she died on a clean mat with a nicely wadded pillow and the old man hung up her pipe just above the joss he was always fond of her i fancy but he took her bangles just the same  i should like to die like the bazarwomanon a clean cool mat with a pipe of good stuff between my lips when i feel im going i shall ask tsinling for them and he can draw my sixty rupees a month fresh and fresh as long as he pleases and watch the black and red dragons have their last big fight together and then      well it doesnt matter nothing matters much to meonly i wished tsinling wouldnt put bran into the black smoke    the story of muhammad din   who is the happy man he that sees in his own house at home little children crowned with dust leaping and falling and crying            munichandra translated by professor peterson  the poloball was an old one scarred chipped and dinted it stood on the mantelpiece among the pipestems which imam din khitmatgar was cleaning for me  does the heavenborn want this ball said imam din deferentially  the heavenborn set no particular store by it but of what use was a poloball to a khitmatgar  by your honors favor i have a little son he has seen this ball and desires it to play with i do not want it for myself  no one would for an instant accuse portly old imam din of wanting to play with poloballs he carried out the battered thing into the verandah and there followed a hurricane of joyful squeaks a patter of small feet and the thud thudthud of the ball rolling along the ground evidently the little son had been waiting outside the door to secure his treasure but how had he managed to see that poloball  next day coming back from office half an hour earlier than usual i was aware of a small figure in the diningrooma tiny plump figure in a ridiculously inadequate shirt which came perhaps halfway down the tubby stomach it wandered round the room thumb in mouth crooning to itself as it took stock of the pictures undoubtedly this was the little son  he had no business in my room of course but was so deeply absorbed in his discoveries that he never noticed me in the doorway i stepped into the room and startled him nearly into a fit he sat down on the ground with a gasp his eyes opened and his mouth followed suit i knew what was coming and fled followed by a long dry howl which reached the servants quarters far more quickly than any command of mine had ever done in ten seconds imam din was in the diningroom then despairing sobs arose and i returned to find imam din admonishing the small sinner who was using most of his shirt as a handkerchief  this boy said imam din judicially is a budmash a big budmash he will without doubt go to the jailkhana for his behavior renewed yells from the penitent and an elaborate apology to myself from imam din  tell the baby said i that the sahib is not angry and take him away imam din conveyed my forgiveness to the offender who had now gathered all his shirt round his neck stringwise and the yell subsided into a sob the two set off for the door his name said imam din as though the name were part of the crime is muhammad din and he is a budmash freed from present danger muhammad din turned round in his fathers arms and said gravelyit is true that my name is muhammad din tahib but i am not a budmash i am a man  from that day dated my acquaintance with muhammad din never again did he come into my diningroom but on the neutral ground of the compound we greeted each other with much state though our conversation was confined to talaam tahib from his side and salaam muhammad din from mine daily on my return from office the little white shirt and the fat little body used to rise from the shade of the creepercovered trellis where they had been hid and daily i checked my horse here that my salutation might not be slurred over or given unseemly  muhammad din never had any companions he used to trot about the compound in and out of the castoroil bushes on mysterious errands of his own one day i stumbled upon some of his handiwork far down the ground he had half buried the poloball in dust and stuck six shrivelled old marigold flowers in a circle round it outside that circle again was a rude square traced out in bits of red brick alternating with fragments of broken china the whole bounded by a little bank of dust the bhistie from the wellcurb put in a plea for the small architect saying that it was only the play of a baby and did not much disfigure my garden  heaven knows that i had no intention of touching the childs work then or later but that evening a stroll through the garden brought me unawares full on it so that i trampled before i knew marigoldheads dustbank and fragments of broken soapdish into confusion past all hope of mending next morning i came upon muhammad din crying softly to himself over the ruin i had wrought  some one had cruelly told him that the sahib was very angry with him for spoiling the garden and had scattered his rubbish using bad language the while muhammad din labored for an hour at effacing every trace of the dust bank and pottery fragments and it was with a tearful apologetic face that he said talaam tahib when i came home from the office a hasty inquiry resulted in imam din informing muhammad din that by my singular favor he was permitted to disport himself as he pleased whereat the child took heart and fell to tracing the groundplan of an edifice which was to eclipse the marigoldpoloball creation  for some months the chubby little eccentricity revolved in his humble orbit among the castoroil bushes and in the dust always fashioning magnificent palaces from stale flowers thrown away by the bearer smooth waterworn pebbles bits of broken glass and feathers pulled i fancy from my fowls always alone and always crooning to himself  a gaylyspotted seashell was dropped one day close to the last of his little buildings and i looked that muhammad din should build something more than ordinarily splendid on the strength of it nor was i disappointed he meditated for the better part of an hour and his crooning rose to a jubilant song then he began tracing in dust it would certainly be a wondrous palace this one for it was two yards long and a yard broad in groundplan but the palace was never completed  next day there was no muhammad din at the head of the carriage drive and no talaam tahib to welcome my return i had grown accustomed to the greeting and its omission troubled me next day imam din told me that the child was suffering slightly from fever and needed quinine he got the medicine and an english doctor  they have no stamina these brats said the doctor as he left imam dins quarters  a week later though i would have given much to have avoided it i met on the road to the mussulman buryingground imam din accompanied by one other friend carrying in his arms wrapped in a white cloth all that was left of little muhammad din    on the strength of a likeness   if your mirror be broken look into still water but have a care that you do not fall in                   hindu proverb  next to a requited attachment one of the most convenient things that a young man can carry about with him at the beginning of his career is an unrequited attachment it makes him feel important and businesslike and blase and cynical and whenever he has a touch of liver or suffers from want of exercise he can mourn over his lost love and be very happy in a tender twilight fashion  hannasydes affair of the heart had been a godsend to him it was four years old and the girl had long since given up thinking of it  she had married and had many cares of her own in the beginning she had told hannasyde that while she could never be anything more than a sister to him she would always take the deepest interest in his welfare this startlingly new and original remark gave hannasyde something to think over for two years and his own vanity filled in the other twentyfour months hannasyde was quite different from phil garron but none the less had several points in common with that far too lucky man  he kept his unrequited attachment by him as men keep a wellsmoked pipefor comforts sake and because it had grown dear in the using it brought him happily through the simla season hannasyde was not lovely there was a crudity in his manners and a roughness in the way in which he helped a lady on to her horse that did not attract the other sex to him even if he had cast about for their favor which he did not he kept his wounded heart all to himself for a while  then trouble came to him all who go to simla know the slope from the telegraph to the public works office hannasyde was loafing up the hill one september morning between calling hours when a rickshaw came down in a hurry and in the rickshaw sat the living breathing image of the girl who had made him so happily unhappy  hannasyde leaned against the railing and gasped he wanted to run downhill after the rickshaw but that was impossible so he went forward with most of his blood in his temples it was impossible for many reasons that the woman in the rickshaw could be the girl he had known she was he discovered later the wife of a man from dindigul or coimbatore or some outoftheway place and she had come up to simla early in the season for the good of her health  she was going back to dindigul or wherever it was at the end of the season and in all likelihood would never return to simla again her proper hill station being ootacamund that night hannasyde raw and savage from the raking up of all old feelings took counsel with himself for one measured hour what he decided upon was this and you must decide for yourself how much genuine affection for the old love and how much a very natural inclination to go abroad and enjoy himself affected the decision mrs landyshaggert would never in all human likelihood cross his path again so whatever he did didnt much matter she was marvellously like the girl who took a deep interest and the rest of the formula all things considered it would be pleasant to make the acquaintance of mrs landyshaggert and for a little timeonly a very little timeto make believe that he was with alice chisane again every one is more or less mad on one point hannasydes particular monomania was his old love alice chisane  he made it his business to get introduced to mrs haggert and the introduction prospered he also made it his business to see as much as he could of that lady when a man is in earnest as to interviews the facilities which simla offers are startling there are gardenparties and tennisparties and picnics and luncheons at annandale and riflematches and dinners and balls besides rides and walks which are matters of private arrangement  hannasyde had started with the intention of seeing a likeness and he ended by doing much more he wanted to be deceived he meant to be deceived and he deceived himself very thoroughly not only were the face and figure the face and figure of alice chisane but the voice and lower tones were exactly the same and so were the turns of speech and the little mannerisms that every woman has of gait and gesticulation were absolutely and identically the same the turn of the head was the same the tired look in the eyes at the end of a long walk was the same the sloop and wrench over the saddle to hold in a pulling horse was the same and once most marvellous of all mrs landys haggert singing to herself in the next room while hannasyde was waiting to take her for a ride hummed note for note with a throaty quiver of the voice in the second linepoor wandering one exactly as alice chisane had hummed it for hannasyde in the dusk of an english drawingroom in the actual woman herselfin the soul of herthere was not the least likeness she and alice chisane being cast in different moulds but all that hannasyde wanted to know and see and think about was this maddening and perplexing likeness of face and voice and manner he was bent on making a fool of himself that way and he was in no sort disappointed  open and obvious devotion from any sort of man is always pleasant to any sort of woman but mrs landyshaggert being a woman of the world could make nothing of hannasydes admiration  he would take any amount of troublehe was a selfish man habituallyto meet and forestall if possible her wishes  anything she told him to do was law and he was there could be no doubting it fond of her company so long as she talked to him and kept on talking about trivialities but when she launched into expression of her personal views and her wrongs those small social differences that make the spice of simla life hannasyde was neither pleased nor interested he didnt want to know anything about mrs landyshaggert or her experiences in the pastshe had travelled nearly all over the world and could talk cleverlyhe wanted the likeness of alice chisane before his eyes and her voice in his ears  anything outside that reminding him of another personality jarred and he showed that it did  under the new post office one evening mrs landyshaggert turned on him and spoke her mind shortly and without warning mr hannasyde said she will you be good enough to explain why you have appointed yourself my special cavalier servente i dont understand it but i am perfectly certain somehow or other that you dont care the least little bit in the world for me this seems to support by the way the theory that no man can act or tell lies to a woman without being found out hannasyde was taken off his guard his defence never was a strong one because he was always thinking of himself and he blurted out before he knew what he was saying this inexpedient answerno more i do  the queerness of the situation and the reply made mrs haggert laugh then it all came out and at the end of hannasydes lucid explanation mrs haggert said with the least little touch of scorn in her voiceso im to act as the layfigure for you to hang the rags of your tattered affections on am i  hannasyde didnt see what answer was required and he devoted himself generally and vaguely to the praise of alice chisane which was unsatisfactory now it is to be thoroughly made clear that mrs haggert had not the shadow of a ghost of an interest in hannasyde  onlyonly no woman likes being made love through instead of tospecially on behalf of a musty divinity of four years standing  hannasyde did not see that he had made any very particular exhibition of himself he was glad to find a sympathetic soul in the arid wastes of simla  when the season ended hannasyde went down to his own place and mrs haggert to hers it was like making love to a ghost said hannasyde to himself and it doesnt matter and now ill get to my work but he found himself thinking steadily of the haggertchisane ghost and he could not be certain whether it was haggert or chisane that made up the greater part of the pretty phantom                              he got understanding a month later  a peculiar point of this peculiar country is the way in which a heartless government transfers men from one end of the empire to the other you can never be sure of getting rid of a friend or an enemy till he or she dies there was a case oncebut thats another story  haggerts department ordered him up from dindigul to the frontier at two days notice and he went through losing money at every step from dindigul to his station he dropped mrs haggert at lucknow to stay with some friends there to take part in a big ball at the chutter munzil and to come on when he had made the new home a little comfortable lucknow was hannasydes station and mrs haggert stayed a week there hannasyde went to meet her and the train came in he discovered which he had been thinking of for the past month the unwisdom of his conduct also struck him the lucknow week with two dances and an unlimited quantity of rides together clinched matters and hannasyde found himself pacing this circle of thoughthe adored alice chisaneat least he had adored her and he admired mrs landyshaggert because she was like alice chisane but mrs landyshaggert was not in the least like alice chisane being a thousand times more adorable now alice chisane was the bride of another and so was mrs landyshaggert and a good and honest wife too therefore he hannasyde was     here he called himself several hard names and wished that he had been wise in the beginning  whether mrs landyshaggert saw what was going on in his mind she alone knows he seemed to take an unqualified interest in everything connected with herself as distinguished from the alicechisane likeness and he said one or two things which if alice chisane had been still betrothed to him could scarcely have been excused even on the grounds of the likeness but mrs haggert turned the remarks aside and spent a long time in making hannasyde see what a comfort and a pleasure she had been to him because of her strange resemblance to his old love hannasyde groaned in his saddle and said yes indeed and busied himself with preparations for her departure to the frontier feeling very small and miserable  the last day of her stay at lucknow came and hannasyde saw her off at the railway station she was very grateful for his kindness and the trouble he had taken and smiled pleasantly and sympathetically as one who knew the alice chisane reason of that kindness and hannasyde abused the coolies with the luggage and hustled the people on the platform and prayed that the roof might fall in and slay him  as the train went out slowly mrs landyshaggert leaned out of the window to say goodbyeon second thoughts au revoir mr hannasyde i go home in the spring and perhaps i may meet you in town  hannasyde shook hands and said very earnestly and adoringlyi hope to heaven i shall never see your face again  nd mrs haggert understood   wressley of the foreign office   i closed and drew for my loves sake   that now is false to me  and i slew the riever of tarrant moss   and set dumeny free   and ever they give me praise and gold   and ever i moan my loss  for i struck the blow for my false loves sake   and not for the men at the moss                tarrant moss  one of the many curses of our life out here is the want of atmosphere in the painters sense there are no halftints worth noticing men stand out all crude and raw with nothing to tone them down and nothing to scale them against they do their work and grow to think that there is nothing but their work and nothing like their work and that they are the real pivots on which the administration turns here is an instance of this feeling a halfcaste clerk was ruling forms in a pay office he said to medo you know what would happen if i added or took away one single line on this sheet then with the air of a conspiratorit would disorganize the whole of the treasury payments throughout the whole of the presidency circle think of that  if men had not this delusion as to the ultraimportance of their own particular employments i suppose that they would sit down and kill themselves but their weakness is wearisome particularly when the listener knows that he himself commits exactly the same sin  even the secretariat believes that it does good when it asks an overdriven executive officer to take census of wheatweevils through a district of five thousand square miles  there was a man once in the foreign officea man who had grown middleaged in the department and was commonly said by irreverent juniors to be able to repeat aitchisons treaties and sunnuds backwards in his sleep what he did with his stored knowledge only the secretary knew and he naturally would not publish the news abroad this mans name was wressley and it was the shibboleth in those days to saywressley knows more about the central indian states than any living man if you did not say this you were considered one of mean understanding  nowadays the man who says that he knows the ravel of the intertribal complications across the border is of more use but in wressleys time much attention was paid to the central indian states they were called foci and factors and all manner of imposing names  and here the curse of angloindian life fell heavily when wressley lifted up his voice and spoke about suchandsuch a succession to suchandsuch a throne the foreign office were silent and heads of departments repeated the last two or three words of wressleys sentences and tacked yes yes on them and knew that they were assisting the empire to grapple with seriouspolitical contingencies in most big undertakings one or two men do the work while the rest sit near and talk till the ripe decorations begin to fall  wressley was the workingmember of the foreign office firm and to keep him up to his duties when he showed signs of flagging he was made much of by his superiors and told what a fine fellow he was  he did not require coaxing because he was of tough build but what he received confirmed him in the belief that there was no one quite so absolutely and imperatively necessary to the stability of india as wressley of the foreign office there might be other good men but the known honored and trusted man among men was wressley of the foreign office we had a viceroy in those days who knew exactly when to gentle a fractious big man and to hearten up a collargalled little one and so keep all his team level he conveyed to wressley the impression which i have just set down and even tough men are apt to be disorganized by a viceroys praise there was a case oncebut that is another story  all india knew wressleys name and officeit was in thacker and spinks directorybut who he was personally or what he did or what his special merits were not fifty men knew or cared his work filled all his time and he found no leisure to cultivate acquaintances beyond those of dead rajput chiefs with ahir blots in their scutcheons wressley would have made a very good clerk in the heralds college had he not been a bengal civilian  upon a day between office and office great trouble came to wressley overwhelmed him knocked him down and left him gasping as though he had been a little schoolboy without reason against prudence and at a moments notice he fell in love with a frivolous goldenhaired girl who used to tear about simla mall on a high rough waler with a blue velvet jockeycap crammed over her eyes her name was vennertillie vennerand she was delightful  she took wressleys heart at a handgallop and wressley found that it was not good for man to live alone even with half the foreign office records in his presses  then simla laughed for wressley in love was slightly ridiculous  he did his best to interest the girl in himselfthat is to say his workand she after the manner of women did her best to appear interested in what behind his back she called mr wressleys wajahs for she lisped very prettily she did not understand one little thing about them but she acted as if she did men have married on that sort of error before now  providence however had care of wressley he was immensely struck with miss venners intelligence he would have been more impressed had he heard her private and confidential accounts of his calls he held peculiar notions as to the wooing of girls he said that the best work of a mans career should be laid reverently at their feet  ruskin writes something like this somewhere i think but in ordinary life a few kisses are better and save time  about a month after he had lost his heart to miss venner and had been doing his work vilely in consequence the first idea of his native rule in central india struck wressley and filled him with joy it was as he sketched it a great thingthe work of his lifea really comprehensive survey of a most fascinating subjectto be written with all the special and laboriously acquired knowledge of wressley of the foreign officea gift fit for an empress  he told miss venner that he was going to take leave and hoped on his return to bring her a present worthy of her acceptance would she wait certainly she would wressley drew seventeen hundred rupees a month she would wait a year for that her mamma would help her to wait  so wressley took one years leave and all the available documents about a truckload that he could lay hands on and went down to central india with his notion hot in his head he began his book in the land he was writing of too much official correspondence had made him a frigid workman and he must have guessed that he needed the white light of local color on his palette this is a dangerous paint for amateurs to play with  heavens how that man worked he caught his rajahs analyzed his rajahs and traced them up into the mists of time and beyond with their queens and their concubines he dated and crossdated pedigreed and triplepedigreed compared noted connoted wove strung sorted selected inferred calendared and countercalendared for ten hours a day and because this sudden and new light of love was upon him he turned those dry bones of history and dirty records of misdeeds into things to weep or to laugh over as he pleased his heart and soul were at the end of his pen and they got into the ink he was dowered with sympathy insight humor and style for two hundred and thirty days and nights and his book was a book he had his vast special knowledge with him so to speak but the spirit the wovenin human touch the poetry and the power of the output were beyond all special knowledge but i doubt whether he knew the gift that was in him then and thus he may have lost some happiness he was toiling for tillie venner not for himself  men often do their best work blind for some one elses sake  also though this has nothing to do with the story in india where every one knows every one else you can watch men being driven by the women who govern them out of the rankandfile and sent to take up points alone a good man once started goes forward but an average man so soon as the woman loses interest in his success as a tribute to her power comes back to the battalion and is no more heard of  wressley bore the first copy of his book to simla and blushing and stammering presented it to miss venner she read a little of it  i give her review verbatimoh your book its all about those howwid wajahs i didnt understand it                              wressley of the foreign office was broken smashedi am not exaggeratingby this one frivolous little girl all that he could say feebly wasbut but its my magnum opus the work of my life miss venner did not know what magnum opus meant but she knew that captain kerrington had won three races at the last gymkhana wressley didnt press her to wait for him any longer he had sense enough for that  then came the reaction after the years strain and wressley went back to the foreign office and his wajahs a compiling gazetteering reportwriting hack who would have been dear at three hundred rupees a month he abided by miss venners review which proves that the inspiration in the book was purely temporary and unconnected with himself nevertheless he had no right to sink in a hilltarn five packingcases brought up at enormous expense from bombay of the best book of indian history ever written  when he sold off before retiring some years later i was turning over his shelves and came across the only existing copy of native rule in central indiathe copy that miss venner could not understand i read it sitting on his muletrucks as long as the light lasted and offered him his own price for it he looked over my shoulder for a few pages and said to himself drearily now how in the world did i come to write such damned good stuff as that then to metake it and keep it write one of your pennyfarthing yarns about its birth perhapsperhapsthe whole business may have been ordained to that end  which knowing what wressley of the foreign office was once struck me as about the bitterest thing that i had ever heard a man say of his own work     by word of mouth   not though you die tonight o sweet and wail   a spectre at my door  shall mortal fear make love immortal fail   i shall but love you more  who from deaths house returning give me still   one moments comfort in my matchless ill                     shadow houses  this tale may be explained by those who know how souls are made and where the bounds of the possible are put down i have lived long enough in this country to know that it is best to know nothing and can only write the story as it happened  dumoise was our civil surgeon at meridki and we called him dormouse because he was a round little sleepy little man he was a good doctor and never quarrelled with any one not even with our deputy commissioner who had the manners of a bargee and the tact of a horse he married a girl as round and as sleepylooking as himself she was a miss hillardyce daughter of squash hillardyce of the berars who married his chiefs daughter by mistake but that is another story  a honeymoon in india is seldom more than a week long but there is nothing to hinder a couple from extending it over two or three years this is a delightful country for married folk who are wrapped up in one another they can live absolutely alone and without interruptionjust as the dormice did these two little people retired from the world after their marriage and were very happy they were forced of course to give occasional dinners but they made no friends hereby and the station went its own way and forgot them only saying occasionally that dormouse was the best of good fellows though dull a civil surgeon who never quarrels is a rarity appreciated as such  few people can afford to play robinson crusoe anywhereleast of all in india where we are few in the land and very much dependent on each others kind offices dumoise was wrong in shutting himself from the world for a year and he discovered his mistake when an epidemic of typhoid broke out in the station in the heart of the cold weather and his wife went down he was a shy little man and five days were wasted before he realized that mrs dumoise was burning with something worse than simple fever and three days more passed before he ventured to call on mrs shute the engineers wife and timidly speak about his trouble nearly every household in india knows that doctors are very helpless in typhoid the battle must be fought out between death and the nurses minute by minute and degree by degree mrs shute almost boxed dumoises ears for what she called his criminal delay and went off at once to look after the poor girl we had seven cases of typhoid in the station that winter and as the average of death is about one in every five cases we felt certain that we should have to lose somebody but all did their best the women sat up nursing the women and the men turned to and tended the bachelors who were down and we wrestled with those typhoid cases for fiftysix days and brought them through the valley of the shadow in triumph but just when we thought all was over and were going to give a dance to celebrate the victory little mrs dumoise got a relapse and died in a week and the station went to the funeral dumoise broke down utterly at the brink of the grave and had to be taken away  after the death dumoise crept into his own house and refused to be comforted he did his duties perfectly but we all felt that he should go on leave and the other men of his own service told him so dumoise was very thankful for the suggestionhe was thankful for anything in those daysand went to chini on a walkingtour  chini is some twenty marches from simla in the heart of the hills and the scenery is good if you are in trouble you pass through big still deodar forests and under big still cliffs and over big still grassdowns swelling like a womans breasts and the wind across the grass and the rain among the deodars sayshushhushhush so little dumoise was packed off to chini to wear down his grief with a fullplate camera and a rifle he took also a useless bearer because the man had been his wifes favorite servant he was idle and a thief but dumoise trusted everything to him  on his way back from chini dumoise turned aside to bagi through the forest reserve which is on the spur of mount huttoo some men who have travelled more than a little say that the march from kotegarh to bagi is one of the finest in creation it runs through dark wet forest and ends suddenly in bleak nipped hillside and black rocks bagi dakbungalow is open to all the winds and is bitterly cold few people go to bagi perhaps that was the reason why dumoise went there he halted at seven in the evening and his bearer went down the hillside to the village to engage coolies for the next days march the sun had set and the nightwinds were beginning to croon among the rocks dumoise leaned on the railing of the verandah waiting for his bearer to return the man came back almost immediately after he had disappeared and at such a rate that dumoise fancied he must have crossed a bear he was running as hard as he could up the face of the hill  but there was no bear to account for his terror he raced to the verandah and fell down the blood spurting from his nose and his face irongray then he gurgledi have seen the memsahib i have seen the memsahib  where said dumoise  down there walking on the road to the village she was in a blue dress and she lifted the veil of her bonnet and saidram dass give my salaams to the sahib and tell him that i shall meet him next month at nuddea then i ran away because i was afraid  what dumoise said or did i do not know ram dass declares that he said nothing but walked up and down the verandah all the cold night waiting for the memsahib to come up the hill and stretching out his arms into the dark like a madman but no memsahib came and next day he went on to simla cross questioning the bearer every hour  ram dass could only say that he had met mrs dumoise and that she had lifted up her veil and given him the message which he had faithfully repeated to dumoise to this statement ram dass adhered  he did not know where nuddea was had no friends at nuddea and would most certainly never go to nuddea even though his pay were doubled  nuddea is in bengal and has nothing whatever to do with a doctor serving in the punjab it must be more than twelve hundred miles from meridki  dumoise went through simla without halting and returned to meridki there to take over charge from the man who had been officiating for him during his tour there were some dispensary accounts to be explained and some recent orders of the surgeongeneral to be noted and altogether the takingover was a full days work in the evening dumoise told his locum tenens who was an old friend of his bachelor days what had happened at bagi and the man said that ram dass might as well have chosen tuticorin while he was about it  at that moment a telegraphpeon came in with a telegram from simla ordering dumoise not to take over charge at meridki but to go at once to nuddea on special duty there was a nasty outbreak of cholera at nuddea and the bengal government being shorthanded as usual had borrowed a surgeon from the punjab  dumoise threw the telegram across the table and saidwell  the other doctor said nothing it was all that he could say  then he remembered that dumoise had passed through simla on his way from bagi and thus might possibly have heard the first news of the impending transfer  he tried to put the question and the implied suspicion into words but dumoise stopped him withif i had desired that i should never have come back from chini i was shooting there i wish to live for i have things to do     but i shall not be sorry  the other man bowed his head and helped in the twilight to pack up dumoises just opened trunks ram dass entered with the lamps  where is the sahib going he asked  to nuddea said dumoise softly  ram dass clawed dumoises knees and boots and begged him not to go  ram dass wept and howled till he was turned out of the room then he wrapped up all his belongings and came back to ask for a character he was not going to nuddea to see his sahib die and perhaps to die himself  so dumoise gave the man his wages and went down to nuddea alone the other doctor bidding him goodbye as one under sentence of death  eleven days later he had joined his memsahib and the bengal government had to borrow a fresh doctor to cope with that epidemic at nuddea the first importation lay dead in chooadanga dakbungalow     to be held for reference   by the hoof of the wild goat uptossed  from the cliff where she lay in the sun      fell the stone to the tarn where the daylight is lost  so she fell from the light of the sun      and alone   now the fall was ordained from the first  with the goat and the cliff and the tarn      but the stone knows only her life is accursed  as she sinks in the depths of the tarn      and alone   oh thou who has builded the world  oh thou who hast lighted the sun  oh thou who hast darkened the tarn     judge thou the sin of the stone that was hurled  by the goat from the light of the sun  as she sinks in the mire of the tarn     even noweven noweven now       from the unpublished papers of mcintosh jellaludin     say is it dawn is it dusk in thy bower     thou whom i long for who longest for me     oh be it nightbe it  here he fell over a little camelcolt that was sleeping in the serai where the horsetraders and the best of the blackguards from central asia live and because he was very drunk indeed and the night was dark he could not rise again till i helped him that was the beginning of my acquaintance with mcintosh jellaludin when a loafer and drunk sings the song of the bower he must be worth cultivating he got off the camels back and said rather thicklyiiim a bit screwed but a dip in loggerhead will put me right again and i say have you spoken to symonds about the mares knees  now loggerhead was six thousand weary miles away from us close to mesopotamia where you mustnt fish and poaching is impossible and charley symonds stable a half mile further across the paddocks it was strange to hear all the old names on a may night among the horses and camels of the sultan caravanserai then the man seemed to remember himself and sober down at the same time he leaned against the camel and pointed to a corner of the serai where a lamp was burning  i live there said he and i should be extremely obliged if you would be good enough to help my mutinous feet thither for i am more than usually drunk mostmost phenomenally tight but not in respect to my head my brain cries out againsthow does it go but my head rides on therolls on the dunghill i should have said and controls the qualm  i helped him through the gangs of tethered horses and he collapsed on the edge of the verandah in front of the line of native quarters  thanksa thousand thanks o moon and little little stars to think that a man should so shamelessly     infamous liquor too ovid in exile drank no worse better it was frozen alas i had no ice good night i would introduce you to my wife were i soberor she civilized  a native woman came out of the darkness of the room and began calling the man names so i went away he was the most interesting loafer that i had the pleasure of knowing for a long time and later on he became a friend of mine he was a tall wellbuilt fair man fearfully shaken with drink and he looked nearer fifty than the thirtyfive which he said was his real age when a man begins to sink in india and is not sent home by his friends as soon as may be he falls very low from a respectable point of view by the time that he changes his creed as did mcintosh he is past redemption  in most big cities natives will tell you of two or three sahibs generally lowcaste who have turned hindu or mussulman and who live more or less as such but it is not often that you can get to know them as mcintosh himself used to sayif i change my religion for my stomachs sake i do not seek to become a martyr to missionaries nor am i anxious for notoriety  at the outset of acquaintance mcintosh warned me remember this i am not an object for charity i require neither your money your food nor your castoff raiment i am that rare animal a selfsupporting drunkard if you choose i will smoke with you for the tobacco of the bazars does not i admit suit my palate and i will borrow any books which you may not specially value it is more than likely that i shall sell them for bottles of excessively filthy countryliquors in return you shall share such hospitality as my house affords here is a charpoy on which two can sit and it is possible that there may from time to time be food in that platter drink unfortunately you will find on the premises at any hour and thus i make you welcome to all my poor establishments  i was admitted to the mcintosh householdi and my good tobacco  but nothing else unluckily one cannot visit a loafer in the serai by day friends buying horses would not understand it  consequently i was obliged to see mcintosh after dark he laughed at this and said simplyyou are perfectly right when i enjoyed a position in society rather higher than yours i should have done exactly the same thing good heavens i was oncehe spoke as though he had fallen from the command of a regimentan oxford man this accounted for the reference to charley symonds stable  you said mcintosh slowly have not had that advantage but to outward appearance you do not seem possessed of a craving for strong drinks on the whole i fancy that you are the luckier of the two yet i am not certain you areforgive my saying so even while i am smoking your excellent tobacco painfully ignorant of many things  we were sitting together on the edge of his bedstead for he owned no chairs watching the horses being watered for the night while the native woman was preparing dinner i did not like being patronized by a loafer but i was his guest for the time being though he owned only one very torn alpacacoat and a pair of trousers made out of gunnybags he took the pipe out of his mouth and went on judiciallyall things considered i doubt whether you are the luckier i do not refer to your extremely limited classical attainments or your excruciating quantities but to your gross ignorance of matters more immediately under your notice that for instancehe pointed to a woman cleaning a samovar near the well in the centre of the serai she was flicking the water out of the spout in regular cadenced jerks  there are ways and ways of cleaning samovars if you knew why she was doing her work in that particular fashion you would know what the spanish monk meant when he said     i the trinity illustrate      drinking watered orangepulp    in three sips the aryan frustrate      while he drains his at one gulp  and many other things which now are hidden from your eyes however mrs mcintosh has prepared dinner let us come and eat after the fashion of the people of the countryof whom by the way you know nothing  the native woman dipped her hand in the dish with us this was wrong the wife should always wait until the husband has eaten  mcintosh jellaludin apologized saying  it is an english prejudice which i have not been able to overcome and she loves me why i have never been able to understand i foregathered with her at jullundur three years ago and she has remained with me ever since i believe her to be moral and know her to be skilled in cookery  he patted the womans head as he spoke and she cooed softly she was not pretty to look at  mcintosh never told me what position he had held before his fall  he was when sober a scholar and a gentleman when drunk he was rather more of the first than the second he used to get drunk about once a week for two days on those occasions the native woman tended him while he raved in all tongues except his own one day indeed he began reciting atalanta in calydon and went through it to the end beating time to the swing of the verse with a bedsteadleg but he did most of his ravings in greek or german the mans mind was a perfect ragbag of useless things once when he was beginning to get sober he told me that i was the only rational being in the inferno into which he had descendeda virgil in the shades he saidand that in return for my tobacco he would before he died give me the materials of a new inferno that should make me greater than dante then he fell asleep on a horseblanket and woke up quite calm  man said he when you have reached the uttermost depths of degradation little incidents which would vex a higher life are to you of no consequence last night my soul was among the gods but i make no doubt that my bestial body was writhing down here in the garbage  you were abominably drunk if thats what you mean i said  i was drunkfilthy drunk i who am the son of a man with whom you have no concerni who was once fellow of a college whose buttery hatch you have not seen i was loathsomely drunk but consider how lightly i am touched it is nothing to me less than nothing for i do not even feel the headache which should be my portion now in a higher life how ghastly would have been my punishment how bitter my repentance believe me my friend with the neglected education the highest is as the lowestalways supposing each degree extreme  he turned round on the blanket put his head between his fists and continued  on the soul which i have lost and on the conscience which i have killed i tell you that i cannot feel i am as the gods knowing good and evil but untouched by either is this enviable or is it not  when a man has lost the warning of next mornings head he must be in a bad state i answered looking at mcintosh on the blanket with his hair over his eyes and his lips bluewhite that i did not think the insensibility good enough  for pitys sake dont say that i tell you it is good and most enviable think of my consolations  have you so many then mcintosh  certainly your attempts at sarcasm which is essentially the weapon of a cultured man are crude first my attainments my classical and literary knowledge blurred perhaps by immoderate drinkingwhich reminds me that before my soul went to the gods last night i sold the pickering horace you so kindly lent me ditta mull the clothesman has it it fetched ten annas and may be redeemed for a rupeebut still infinitely superior to yours secondly the abiding affection of mrs mcintosh best of wives thirdly a monument more enduring than brass which i have built up in the seven years of my degradation  he stopped here and crawled across the room for a drink of water  he was very shaky and sick  he referred several times to his treasuresome great possession that he ownedbut i held this to be the raving of drink he was as poor and as proud as he could be his manner was not pleasant but he knew enough about the natives among whom seven years of his life had been spent to make his acquaintance worth having he used actually to laugh at strickland as an ignorant manignorant west and easthe said his boast was first that he was an oxford man of rare and shining parts which may or may not have been truei did not know enough to check his statementsand secondly that he had his hand on the pulse of native lifewhich was a fact as an oxford man he struck me as a prig he was always throwing his education about as a mahommedan faquiras mcintosh jellaludinhe was all that i wanted for my own ends he smoked several pounds of my tobacco and taught me several ounces of things worth knowing but he would never accept any gifts not even when the cold weather came and gripped the poor thin chest under the poor thin alpaca coat he grew very angry and said that i had insulted him and that he was not going into hospital he had lived like a beast and he would die rationally like a man  as a matter of fact he died of pneumonia and on the night of his death sent over a grubby note asking me to come and help him to die  the native woman was weeping by the side of the bed mcintosh wrapped in a cotton cloth was too weak to resent a fur coat being thrown over him he was very active as far as his mind was concerned and his eyes were blazing when he had abused the doctor who came with me so foully that the indignant old fellow left he cursed me for a few minutes and calmed down  then he told his wife to fetch out the book from a hole in the wall she brought out a big bundle wrapped in the tail of a petticoat of old sheets of miscellaneous notepaper all numbered and covered with fine cramped writing mcintosh ploughed his hand through the rubbish and stirred it up lovingly  this he said is my workthe book of mcintosh jellaludin showing what he saw and how he lived and what befell him and others being also an account of the life and sins and death of mother maturin what mirza murad ali begs book is to all other books on native life will my work be to mirza murad ali begs  this as will be conceded by any one who knows mirza ali begs book was a sweeping statement the papers did not look specially valuable but mcintosh handled them as if they were currencynotes  then he said slowlyin despite the many weaknesses of your education you have been good to me i will speak of your tobacco when i reach the gods i owe you much thanks for many kindnesses  but i abominate indebtedness for this reason i bequeath to you now the monument more enduring than brassmy one bookrude and imperfect in parts but oh how rare in others i wonder if you will understand it it is a gift more honorable than    bah where is my brain rambling to you will mutilate it horribly you will knock out the gems you call latin quotations you philistine and you will butcher the style to carve into your own jerky jargon but you cannot destroy the whole of it i bequeath it to you  ethel    my brain again   mrs mcintosh bear witness that i give the sahib all these papers they would be of no use to you heart of my heart and i lay it upon you he turned to me here that you do not let my book die in its present form it is yours unconditionallythe story of mcintosh jellaludin which is not the story of mcintosh jellaludin but of a greater man than he and of a far greater woman listen now i am neither mad nor drunk that book will make you famous  i said thank you as the native woman put the bundle into my arms  my only baby said mcintosh with a smile he was sinking fast but he continued to talk as long as breath remained i waited for the end knowing that in six cases out of ten the dying man calls for his mother he turned on his side and said  say how it came into your possession no one will believe you but my name at least will live you will treat it brutally i know you will some of it must go the public are fools and prudish fools i was their servant once but do your mangling gentlyvery gently it is a great work and i have paid for it in seven years damnation  his voice stopped for ten or twelve breaths and then he began mumbling a prayer of some kind in greek the native woman cried very bitterly lastly he rose in bed and said as loudly as slowlynot guilty my lord  then he fell back and the stupor held him till he died the native woman ran into the serai among the horses and screamed and beat her breasts for she had loved him  perhaps his last sentence in life told what mcintosh had once gone through but saving the big bundle of old sheets in the cloth there was nothing in his room to say who or what he had been  the papers were in a hopeless muddle  strickland helped me to sort them and he said that the writer was either an extreme liar or a most wonderful person he thought the former one of these days you may be able to judge for yourself  the bundle needed much expurgation and was full of greek nonsense at the head of the chapters which has all been cut out  if the things are ever published some one may perhaps remember this story now printed as a safeguard to prove that mcintosh jellaludin and not i myself wrote the book of mother maturin  i dont want the giants robe to come true in my case      volume vi the light that failed  the light that failed  chapter i   so we settled it all when the storm was done   as comfy as comfy could be   and i was to wait in the barn my dears  because i was only three   and teddy would run to the rainbows foot   because he was five and a man   and thats how it all began my dears   and thats how it all began               big barn stories  what do you think shed do if she caught us we oughtnt to have it you know said maisie  beat me and lock you up in your bedroom dick answered without  hesitation have you got the cartridges  yes theyre in my pocket but they are joggling horribly do pinfire  cartridges go off of their own accord  dont know take the revolver if you are afraid and let me carry them  im not afraid maisie strode forward swiftly a hand in her pocket  and her chin in the air dick followed with a small pinfire revolver  the children had discovered that their lives would be unendurable without pistolpractice after much forethought and selfdenial dick had saved seven shillings and sixpence the price of a badly constructed belgian revolver maisie could only contribute half a crown to the syndicate for the purchase of a hundred cartridges you can save better than i can dick she explained i like nice things to eat and it doesnt matter to you besides boys ought to do these things  dick grumbled a little at the arrangement but went out and made the purchase which the children were then on their way to test revolvers did not lie in the scheme of their daily life as decreed for them by the guardian who was incorrectly supposed to stand in the place of a mother to these two orphans dick had been under her care for six years during which time she had made her profit of the allowances supposed to be expended on his clothes and partly through thoughtlessness partly through a natural desire to painshe was a widow of some years anxious to marry againhad made his days burdensome on his young shoulders  where he had looked for love she gave him first aversion and then hate  where he growing older had sought a little sympathy she gave him ridicule the many hours that she could spare from the ordering of her small house she devoted to what she called the hometraining of dick heldar her religion manufactured in the main by her own intelligence and a keen study of the scriptures was an aid to her in this matter at such times as she herself was not personally displeased with dick she left him to understand that he had a heavy account to settle with his creator wherefore dick learned to loathe his god as intensely as he loathed mrs jennett and this is not a wholesome frame of mind for the young since she chose to regard him as a hopeless liar when dread of pain drove him to his first untruth he naturally developed into a liar but an economical and selfcontained one never throwing away the least unnecessary fib and never hesitating at the blackest were it only plausible that might make his life a little easier the treatment taught him at least the power of living alonea power that was of service to him when he went to a public school and the boys laughed at his clothes which were poor in quality and much mended in the holidays he returned to the teachings of mrs jennett and that the chain of discipline might not be weakened by association with the world was generally beaten on one account or another before he had been twelve hours under her roof  the autumn of one year brought him a companion in bondage a longhaired gray eyed little atom as selfcontained as himself who moved about the house silently and for the first few weeks spoke only to the goat that was her chiefest friend on earth and lived in the backgarden mrs jennett objected to the goat on the grounds that he was unchristianwhich he certainly was then said the atom choosing her words very deliberately i shall write to my lawyerpeoples and tell them that you are a very bad woman amomma is mine mine mine mrs jennett made a movement to the hall where certain umbrellas and canes stood in a rack the atom understood as clearly as dick what this meant i have been beaten before she said still in the same passionless voice i have been beaten worse than you can ever beat me if you beat me i shall write to my lawyerpeoples and tell them that you do not give me enough to eat i am not afraid of you mrs jennett did not go into the hall and the atom after a pause to assure herself that all danger of war was past went out to weep bitterly on amommas neck  dick learned to know her as maisie and at first mistrusted her profoundly for he feared that she might interfere with the small liberty of action left to him she did not however and she volunteered no friendliness until dick had taken the first steps long before the holidays were over the stress of punishment shared in common drove the children together if it were only to play into each others hands as they prepared lies for mrs jennetts use when dick returned to school maisie whispered now i shall be all alone to take care of myself but and she nodded her head bravely i can do it you promised to send amomma a grass collar send it soon a week later she asked for that collar by return of post and was not pleased when she learned that it took time to make when at last dick forwarded the gift she forgot to thank him for it  many holidays had come and gone since that day and dick had grown into a lanky hobbledehoy more than ever conscious of his bad clothes not for a moment had mrs jennett relaxed her tender care of him but the average canings of a public schooldick fell under punishment about three times a monthfilled him with contempt for her powers she doesnt hurt he explained to maisie who urged him to rebellion and she is kinder to you after she has whacked me dick shambled through the days unkempt in body and savage in soul as the smaller boys of the school learned to know for when the spirit moved him he would hit them cunningly and with science the same spirit made him more than once try to tease maisie but the girl refused to be made unhappy we are both miserable as it is said she what is the use of trying to make things worse lets find things to do and forget things  the pistol was the outcome of that search it could only be used on the muddiest foreshore of the beach far away from the bathingmachines and pierheads below the grassy slopes of fort keeling the tide ran out nearly two miles on that coast and the manycoloured mudbanks touched by the sun sent up a lamentable smell of dead weed it was late in the afternoon when dick and maisie arrived on their ground amomma trotting patiently behind them  mf said maisie sniffing the air i wonder what makes the sea so smelly i dontlike it  you never like anything that isnt made just for you said dick bluntly give me the cartridges and ill try first shot how far does one of these little revolvers carry  oh half a mile said maisie promptly at least it makes an awful noise be careful with the cartridges i dont like those jagged stickup things on the rim dick do be careful  all right i know how to load ill fire at the breakwater out there  he fired and amomma ran away bleating the bullet threw up a spurt of mud to the right of the woodwreathed piles  throws high and to the right you try maisie mind its loaded all round  maisie took the pistol and stepped delicately to the verge of the mud her hand firmly closed on the butt her mouth and left eye screwed up  dick sat down on a tuft of bank and laughed amomma returned very cautiously he was accustomed to strange experiences in his afternoon walks and finding the cartridgebox unguarded made investigations with his nose maisie fired but could not see where the bullet went  i think it hit the post she said shading her eyes and looking out across the sailless sea  i know it has gone out to the marazion bellbuoy said dick with a chuckle fire low and to the left then perhaps youll get it oh look at amomma hes eating the cartridges  maisie turned the revolver in her hand just in time to see amomma scampering away from the pebbles dick threw after him nothing is sacred to a billygoat being well fed and the adored of his mistress amomma had naturally swallowed two loaded pinfire cartridges maisie hurried up to assure herself that dick had not miscounted the tale  yes hes eaten two  horrid little beast then theyll joggle about inside him and blow up and serve him right    oh dick have i killed you   revolvers are tricky things for young hands to deal with maisie could not explain how it had happened but a veil of reeking smoke separated her from dick and she was quite certain that the pistol had gone off in his face then she heard him sputter and dropped on her knees beside him crying dick you arent hurt are you i didnt mean it   of course you didnt said dick coming out of the smoke and wiping his cheek but you nearly blinded me that powder stuff stings awfully a neat little splash of gray led on a stone showed where the bullet had gone maisie began to whimper  dont said dick jumping to his feet and shaking himself im not a bit hurt  no but i might have killed you protested maisie the corners of her mouth drooping what should i have done then  gone home and told mrs jennett dick grinned at the thought then softening please dontworry about it besides we are wasting time weve got to get back to tea ill take the revolver for a bit  maisie would have wept on the least encouragement but dicks indifference albeit his hand was shaking as he picked up the pistol restrained her she lay panting on the beach while dick methodically bombarded the breakwater got it at last he exclaimed as a lock of weed flew from the wood  let me try said maisie imperiously im all right now  they fired in turns till the rickety little revolver nearly shook itself to pieces and amomma the outcastbecause he might blow up at any momentbrowsed in the background and wondered why stones were thrown at him then they found a balk of timber floating in a pool which was commanded by the seaward slope of fort keeling and they sat down together before this new target  next holidays said dick as the now thoroughly fouled revolver kicked wildly in his hand well get another pistolcentral firethat will carry farther  there wontbe any next holidays for me said maisie im going away  where to  i dont know my lawyers have written to mrs jennett and ive got to be educated somewherein france perhapsi dontknow where but i shall be glad to go away   i shant like it a bit i suppose i shall be left look here maisie is it really true youre going then these holidays will be the last i shall see anything of you and i go back to school next week i wish  the young blood turned his cheeks scarlet maisie was picking grasstufts and throwing them down the slope at a yellow seapoppy nodding all by itself to the illimitable levels of the mudflats and the milkwhite sea beyond  i wish she said after a pause that i could see you again sometime you wish that too  yes but it would have been better ififyou hadshot straight over there down by the breakwater  maisie looked with large eyes for a moment and this was the boy who only ten days before had decorated amommas horns with cutpaper hamfrills and turned him out a bearded derision among the public ways then she dropped her eyes this was not the boy  dont be stupid she said reprovingly and with swift instinct attacked the sideissue how selfish you are just think what i should have felt if that horrid thing had killed you im quite miserable enough already  why because youre going away from mrs jennett  no  from me then  no answer for a long time dick dared not look at her he felt though he did not know all that the past four years had been to him and this the more acutely since he had no knowledge to put his feelings in words  i dont know she said i suppose it is  maisie you must know im not supposing  lets go home said maisie weakly  but dick was not minded to retreat  i cant say things he pleaded and im awfully sorry for teasing you about amomma the other day its all different now maisie cant you see and you might have told me that you were going instead of leaving me to find out  you didnt i did tell oh dick whats the use of worrying  there isnt any but weve been together years and years and i didnt know how much i cared  i dont believe you ever did care   no i didnt but i doi care awfully now maisie he gulpedmaisie darling say you care too please  i do indeed i do but it wont be any use  why  because i am going away  yes but if you promise before you go only saywill you a second darling came to his lips more easily than the first there were few endearments in dicks home or school life he had to find them by instinct dick caught the little hand blackened with the escaped gas of the revolver  i promise she said solemnly but if i care there is no need for promising  and do you care for the first time in the past few minutes their eyes met and spoke for them who had no skill in speech     oh dick dont please dont it was all right when we said goodmorning but now its all different amomma looked on from afar  he had seen his property quarrel frequently but he had never seen kisses exchanged before the yellow seapoppy was wiser and nodded its head approvingly considered as a kiss that was a failure but since it was the first other than those demanded by duty in all the world that either had ever given or taken it opened to them new worlds and every one of them glorious so that they were lifted above the consideration of any worlds at all especially those in which tea is necessary and sat still holding each others hands and saying not a word  you cant  forget now said dick at last there was that on his cheek that stung more than gunpowder  i shouldnt  have forgotten anyhow said maisie and they looked at each other and saw that each was changed from the companion of an hour ago to a wonder and a mystery they could not understand the sun began to set and a nightwind thrashed along the bents of the foreshore  we shall be awfully late for tea said maisie lets go home  lets use the rest of the cartridges first said dick and he helped maisie down the slope of the fort to the seaa descent that she was quite capable of covering at full speed equally gravely maisie took the grimy hand dick bent forward clumsily maisie drew the hand away and dick blushed  its very pretty he said  pooh said maisie with a little laugh of gratified vanity she stood close to dick as he loaded the revolver for the last time and fired over the sea with a vague notion at the back of his head that he was protecting maisie from all the evils in the world a puddle far across the mud caught the last rays of the sun and turned into a wrathful red disc the light held dicks attention for a moment and as he raised his revolver there fell upon him a renewed sense of the miraculous in that he was standing by maisie who had promised to care for him for an indefinite length of time till such date asa gust of the growing wind drove the girls long black hair across his face as she stood with her hand on his shoulder calling amomma a little beast and for a moment he was in the darka darkness that stung the bullet went singing out to the empty sea  spoilt my aim said he shaking his head there arent  any more cartridges we shall have to run home but they did not run they walked very slowly arm in arm and it was a matter of indifference to them whether the neglected amomma with two pinfire cartridges in his inside blew up or trotted beside them for they had come into a golden heritage and were disposing of it with all the wisdom of all their years  and i shall be quoth dick valiantly then he checked himself i dont  know what i shall be i dont  seem to be able to pass any exams but i can make awful caricatures of the masters ho ho  be an artist then said maisie youre always laughing at my trying to draw and it will do you good  ill never laugh at anything you do he answered ill be an artist and ill do things  artists always want money dontthey  ive got a hundred and twenty pounds a year of my own my guardians tell me im to have it when i come of age that will be enough to begin with  ah im rich said maisie ive got three hundred a year all my own when im twentyone thats why mrs jennett is kinder to me than she is to you i wish though that i had somebody that belonged to mejust a father or a mother  you belong to me said dick for ever and ever  yes we belongfor ever its very nice she squeezed his arm the kindly darkness hid them both and emboldened because he could only just see the profile of maisies cheek with the long lashes veiling the gray eyes dick at the front door delivered himself of the words he had been boggling over for the last two hours  and ilove you maisie he said in a whisper that seemed to him to ring across the worldthe world that he would tomorrow or the next day set out to conquer  there was a scene not for the sake of discipline to be reported when mrs jennett would have fallen upon him first for disgraceful unpunctuality and secondly for nearly killing himself with a forbidden weapon  i was playing with it and it went off by itself said dick when the powder pocked cheek could no longer be hidden but if you think youre going to lick me youre wrong you are never going to touch me again sit down and give me my tea you cant  cheat us out of that anyhow  mrs jennett gasped and became livid maisie said nothing but encouraged dick with her eyes and he behaved abominably all that evening mrs jennett prophesied an immediate judgment of providence and a descent into tophet later but dick walked in paradise and would not hear only when he was going to bed mrs jennett recovered and asserted herself he had bidden maisie good night with downdropped eyes and from a distance  if you arent  a gentleman you might try to behave like one said mrs jennett spitefully youve been quarrelling with maisie again  this meant that the usual goodnight kiss had been omitted maisie white to the lips thrust her cheek forward with a fine air of indifference and was duly pecked by dick who tramped out of the room red as fire that night he dreamed a wild dream he had won all the world and brought it to maisie in a cartridgebox but she turned it over with her foot and instead of saying thank you criedwhere is the grass collar you promised for amomma oh how selfish you are   chapter ii   then we brought the lances down then the bugles blew  when we went to kandahar ridin two an two    ridin ridin ridin two an two  tarararararara  all the way to kandahar ridin two an two           barrackroom ballad  im not angry with the british public but i wish we had a few thousand of

that lotfrizzling on hot gravel  with a blue veil over his head and his clothes in strips has any man here a needle ive got a piece of sugarsack  ill lend you a packingneedle for six square inches of it then both my knees are worn through  why not six square acres while youre about it but lend me the needle and ill see what i can do with the selvage i dont  think theres enough to protect my royal body from the cold blast as it is what are you doing with that everlasting sketchbook of yours dick  study of our special correspondent repairing his wardrobe said dick gravely as the other man kicked off a pair of sorely worn ridingbreeches and began to fit a square of coarse canvas over the most obvious open space he grunted disconsolately as the vastness of the void developed itself  sugarbags indeed hi you pilot man there lend me all the sails for that whaleboat  a fezcrowned head bobbed up in the sternsheets divided itself into exact halves with one flashing grin and bobbed down again the man of the tattered breeches clad only in a norfolk jacket and a gray flannel shirt went on with his clumsy sewing while dick chuckled over the sketch  some twenty whaleboats were nuzzling a sandbank which was dotted with english soldiery of half a dozen corps bathing or washing their clothes a heap of boatrollers commissariatboxes sugarbags and flourand smallarm ammunitioncases showed where one of the whaleboats had been compelled to unload hastily and a regimental carpenter was swearing aloud as he tried on a wholly insufficient allowance of white lead to plaster up the sunparched gaping seams of the boat herself  first the bloomin rudder snaps said he to the world in general then the mast goes an then s help me when she cant  do nothin else she opens erself out like a cockeyed chinese lotus  exactly the case with my breeches whoever you are said the tailor without looking up dick i wonder when i shall see a decent shop again  there was no answer save the incessant angry murmur of the nile as it raced round a basaltwalled bend and foamed across a rockridge half a mile upstream it was as though the brown weight of the river would drive the white men back to their own country the indescribable scent of nile mud in the air told that the stream was falling and the next few miles would be no light thing for the whaleboats to overpass the desert ran down almost to the banks where among gray red and black hillocks a camelcorps was encamped no man dared even for a day lose touch of the slowmoving boats there had been no fighting for weeks past and throughout all that time the nile had never spared them rapid had followed rapid rock rock and islandgroup islandgroup till the rank and file had long since lost all count of direction and very nearly of time they were moving somewhere they did not know why to do something they did not know what before them lay the nile and at the other end of it was one gordon fighting for the dear life in a town called khartoum there were columns of british troops in the desert or in one of the many deserts there were yet more columns waiting to embark on the river there were fresh drafts waiting at assioot and assuan there were lies and rumours running over the face of the hopeless land from suakin to the sixth cataract and men supposed generally that there must be some one in authority to direct the general scheme of the many movements the duty of that particular rivercolumn was to keep the whale boats afloat in the water to avoid trampling on the villagers crops when the gangs tracked the boats with lines thrown from midstream to get as much sleep and food as was possible and above all to press on without delay in the teeth of the churning nile  with the soldiers sweated and toiled the correspondents of the newspapers and they were almost as ignorant as their companions but it was above all things necessary that england at breakfast should be amused and thrilled and interested whether gordon lived or died or half the british army went to pieces in the sands the soudan campaign was a picturesque one and lent itself to vivid wordpainting now and again a special managed to get slainwhich was not altogether a disadvantage to the paper that employed himand more often the handtohand nature of the fighting allowed of miraculous escapes which were worth telegraphing home at eighteenpence the word there were many correspondents with many corps and columnsfrom the veterans who had followed on the heels of the cavalry that occupied cairo in 82 what time arabi pasha called himself king who had seen the first miserable work round suakin when the sentries were cut up nightly and the scrub swarmed with spears to youngsters jerked into the business at the end of a telegraphwire to take the places of their betters killed or invalided  among the seniorsthose who knew every shift and change in the perplexing postal arrangements the value of the seediest weediest egyptian garron offered for sale in cairo or alexandria who could talk a telegraphclerk into amiability and soothe the ruffled vanity of a newly appointed staffofficer when press regulations became burdensomewas the man in the flannel shirt the blackbrowed torpenhow he represented the central southern syndicate in the campaign as he had represented it in the egyptian war and elsewhere the syndicate did not concern itself greatly with criticisms of attack and the like it supplied the masses and all it demanded was picturesqueness and abundance of detail for there is more joy in england over a soldier who insubordinately steps out of square to rescue a comrade than over twenty generals slaving even to baldness at the gross details of transport and commissariat  he had met at suakin a young man sitting on the edge of a recently abandoned redoubt about the size of a hatbox sketching a clump of shelltorn bodies on the gravel plain  what are you for said torpenhow the greeting of the correspondent is that of the commercial traveller on the road  my own hand said the young man without looking up have you any tobacco  torpenhow waited till the sketch was finished and when he had looked at it said whats your business here  nothing there was a row so i came im supposed to be doing something down at the paintingslips among the boats or else im in charge of the condenser on one of the waterships ive forgotten which  youve cheek enough to build a redoubt with said torpenhow and took stock of the new acquaintance do you always draw like that  the young man produced more sketches row on a chinese pigboat said he sententiously showing them one after anotherchief mate dirked by a compradorjunk ashore off hakodatesomali muleteer being floggedstar shell bursting over camp at berberaslavedhow being chased round tajurrah bahsoldier lying dead in the moonlight outside suakinthroat cut by fuzzies  hm said torpenhow cantsay i care for verestchaginandwater myself but theres no accounting for tastes doing anything now are you  no im amusing myself here  torpenhow looked at the sketches again and nodded yes youre right to take your first chance when you can get it  he rode away swiftly through the gate of the two warships rattled across the causeway into the town and wired to his syndicate got man here picture work good and cheap shall i arrange will do letterpress with sketches  the man on the redoubt sat swinging his legs and murmuring i knew the chance would come sooner or later by gad theyll have to sweat for it if i come through this business alive  in the evening torpenhow was able to announce to his friend that the central southern agency was willing to take him on trial paying expenses for three months and by the way whats your name said torpenhow  heldar do they give me a free hand  theyve taken you on chance you must justify the choice youd better stick to me im going upcountry with a column and ill do what i can for you give me some of your sketches taken here and ill send em along to himself he said thats the best bargain the central southern has ever made and they got me cheaply enough  so it came to pass that after some purchase of horseflesh and arrangements financial and political dick was made free of the new and honourable fraternity of war correspondents who all possess the inalienable right of doing as much work as they can and getting as much for it as providence and their owners shall please to these things are added in time if the brother be worthy the power of glib speech that neither man nor woman can resist when a meal or a bed is in question the eye of a horsecope the skill of a cook the constitution of a bullock the digestion of an ostrich and an infinite adaptability to all circumstances but many die before they attain to this degree and the pastmasters in the craft appear for the most part in dress clothes when they are in england and thus their glory is hidden from the multitude  dick followed torpenhow wherever the latters fancy chose to lead him and between the two they managed to accomplish some work that almost satisfied themselves it was not an easy life in any way and under its influence the two were drawn very closely together for they ate from the same dish they shared the same waterbottle and most binding tie of all their mails went off together it was dick who managed to make gloriously drunk a telegraphclerk in a palm hut far beyond the second cataract and while the man lay in bliss on the floor possessed himself of some laboriously acquired exclusive information forwarded by a confiding correspondent of an opposition syndicate made a careful duplicate of the matter and brought the result to torpenhow who said that all was fair in love or war correspondence and built an excellent descriptive article from his rivals riotous waste of words it was torpenhow whobut the tale of their adventures together and apart from philae to the waste wilderness of herawi and muella would fill many books they had been penned into a square side by side in deadly fear of being shot by overexcited soldiers they had fought with baggagecamels in the chill dawn they had jogged along in silence under blinding sun on indefatigable little egyptian horses and they had floundered on the shallows of the nile when the whaleboat in which they had found a berth chose to hit a hidden rock and rip out half her bottomplanks  now they were sitting on the sandbank and the whaleboats were bringing up the remainder of the column  yes said torpenhow as he put the last rude stitches into his overlong neglected gear it has been a beautiful business  the patch or the campaign said dick dont  think much of either myself  you want the euryalus brought up above the third cataract dont  you and eightyoneton guns at jakdul now im quite satisfied with my breeches he turned round gravely to exhibit himself after the manner of a clown  its very pretty specially the lettering on the sack gbt government bullock train thats a sack from india  its my initialsgilbert belling torpenhow i stole the cloth on purpose what the mischief are the camelcorps doing yonder torpenhow shaded his eyes and looked across the scrubstrewn gravel  a bugle blew furiously and the men on the bank hurried to their arms and accoutrements  pisan soldiery surprised while bathing remarked dick calmly  dyou remember the picture its by michael angelo all beginners copy it that scrubs alive with enemy  the camelcorps on the bank yelled to the infantry to come to them and a hoarse shouting down the river showed that the remainder of the column had wind of the trouble and was hastening to take share in it as swiftly as a reach of still water is crisped by the wind the rockstrewn ridges and scrubtopped hills were troubled and alive with armed men  mercifully it occurred to these to stand far off for a time to shout and gesticulate joyously one man even delivered himself of a long story the camelcorps did not fire they were only too glad of a little breathingspace until some sort of square could be formed the men on the sandbank ran to their side and the whaleboats as they toiled up within shouting distance were thrust into the nearest bank and emptied of all save the sick and a few men to guard them the arab orator ceased his outcries and his friends howled  they look like the mahdis men said torpenhow elbowing himself into the crush of the square but what thousands of em there are the tribes hereabout arent  against us i know  then the mahdis taken another town said dick and set all these yelping devils free to show us up lend us your glass  our scouts should have told us of this weve been trapped said a subaltern arent  the camel guns ever going to begin hurry up you men  there was no need of any order the men flung themselves panting against the sides of the square for they had good reason to know that whoso was left outside when the fighting began would very probably die in an extremely unpleasant fashion the little hundredandfiftypound camelguns posted at one corner of the square opened the ball as the square moved forward by its right to get possession of a knoll of rising ground all had fought in this manner many times before and there was no novelty in the entertainment always the same hot and stifling formation the smell of dust and leather the same boltlike rush of the enemy the same pressure on the weakest side the few minutes of handtohand scuffle and then the silence of the desert broken only by the yells of those whom their handful of cavalry attempted to purse they had become careless the camelguns spoke at intervals and the square slouched forward amid the protesting of the camels then came the attack of three thousand men who had not learned from books that it is impossible for troops in close order to attack against breechloading fire  a few dropping shots heralded their approach and a few horsemen led but the bulk of the force was naked humanity mad with rage and armed with the spear and the sword the instinct of the desert where there is always much war told them that the right flank of the square was the weakest for they swung clear of the front the camelguns shelled them as they passed and opened for an instant lanes through their midst most like those quickclosing vistas in a kentish hopgarden seen when the train races by at full speed and the infantry fire held till the opportune moment dropped them in closepacking hundreds no civilised troops in the world could have endured the hell through which they came the living leaping high to avoid the dying who clutched at their heels the wounded cursing and staggering forward till they fella torrent black as the sliding water above a milldamfull on the right flank of the square  then the line of the dusty troops and the faint blue desert sky overhead went out in rolling smoke and the little stones on the heated ground and the tinderdry clumps of scrub became matters of surpassing interest for men measured their agonised retreat and recovery by these things counting mechanically and hewing their way back to chosen pebble and branch there was no semblance of any concerted fighting for aught the men knew the enemy might be attempting all four sides of the square at once their business was to destroy what lay in front of them to bayonet in the back those who passed over them and dying to drag down the slayer till he could be knocked on the head by some avenging gunbutt  dick waited with torpenhow and a young doctor till the stress grew unendurable it was hopeless to attend to the wounded till the attack was repulsed so the three moved forward gingerly towards the weakest side of the square there was a rush from without the short houghhough of the stabbing spears and a man on a horse followed by thirty or forty others dashed through yelling and hacking the right flank of the square sucked in after them and the other sides sent help the wounded who knew that they had but a few hours more to live caught at the enemys feet and brought them down or staggering into a discarded rifle fired blindly into the scuffle that raged in the centre of the square  dick was conscious that somebody had cut him violently across his helmet that he had fired his revolver into a black foamflecked face which forthwith ceased to bear any resemblance to a face and that torpenhow had gone down under an arab whom he had tried to collar low and was turning over and over with his captive feeling for the mans eyes the doctor jabbed at a venture with a bayonet and a helmetless soldier fired over dicks shoulder the flying grains of powder stung his cheek it was to torpenhow that dick turned by instinct the representative of the central southern syndicate had shaken himself clear of his enemy and rose wiping his thumb on his trousers the arab both hands to his forehead screamed aloud then snatched up his spear and rushed at torpenhow who was panting under shelter of dicks revolver dick fired twice and the man dropped limply his upturned face lacked one eye the musketryfire redoubled but cheers mingled with it the rush had failed and the enemy were flying if the heart of the square were shambles the ground beyond was a butchers shop dick thrust his way forward between the maddened men the remnant of the enemy were retiring as the fewthe very fewenglish cavalry rode down the laggards  beyond the lines of the dead a broad bloodstained arab spear cast aside in the retreat lay across a stump of scrub and beyond this again the illimitable dark levels of the desert the sun caught the steel and turned it into a red disc some one behind him was saying ah get away you brute dick raised his revolver and pointed towards the desert his eye was held by the red splash in the distance and the clamour about him seemed to die down to a very far away whisper like the whisper of a level sea there was the revolver and the red light    and the voice of some one scaring something away exactly as had fallen somewhere beforea darkness that stung he fired at random and the bullet went out across the desert as he muttered spoilt my aim there arent  any more cartridges we shall have to run home he put his hand to his head and brought it away covered with blood  old man youre cut rather badly said torpenhow i owe you something for this business thanks stand up i say you cant  be ill here  throughout the night when the troops were encamped by the whaleboats a black figure danced in the strong moonlight on the sandbar and shouted that khartoum the accursed one was deadwas deadwas deadthat two steamers were rock staked on the nile outside the city and that of all their crews there remained not one and khartoum was deadwas deadwas dead but torpenhow took no heed he was watching dick who called aloud to the restless nile for maisie and again maisie behold a phenomenon said torpenhow rearranging the blanket here is a man presumably human who mentions the name of one woman only and ive seen a good deal of delirium toodick heres some fizzy drink  thank you maisie said dick   chapter iii   so he thinks he shall take to the sea again  for one more cruise with his buccaneers  to singe the beard of the king of spain and capture another dean of jaen  and sell him in algiers                      dutch picture longfellow  the soudan campaign and dicks broken head had been some months ended and mended and the central southern syndicate had paid dick a certain sum on account for work done which work they were careful to assure him was not altogether up to their standard dick heaved the letter into the nile at cairo cashed the draft in the same town and bade a warm farewell to torpenhow at the station  i am going to lie up for a while and rest said torpenhow i dont  know where i shall live in london but if god brings us to meet we shall meet are you staying here on the offchance of another row there will be none till the southern soudan is reoccupied by our troops mark that goodbye bless you come back when your moneys spent and give me your address  dick loitered in cairo alexandria ismailia and port saidespecially port said there is iniquity in many parts of the world and vice in all but the concentrated essence of all the iniquities and all the vices in all the continents finds itself at port said and through the heart of that sand bordered hell where the mirage flickers day long above the bitter lake move if you will only wait most of the men and women you have known in this life dick established himself in quarters more riotous than respectable he spent his evenings on the quay and boarded many ships and saw very many friends gracious englishwomen with whom he had talked not too wisely in the veranda of shepherds hotel hurrying war correspondents skippers of the contract troop ships employed in the campaign army officers by the score and others of less reputable trades  he had choice of all the races of the east and west for studies and the advantage of seeing his subjects under the influence of strong excitement at the gamingtables saloons dancinghells and elsewhere for recreation there was the straight vista of the canal the blazing sands the procession of shipping and the white hospitals where the english soldiers lay he strove to set down in black and white and colour all that providence sent him and when that supply was ended sought about for fresh material it was a fascinating employment but it ran away with his money and he had drawn in advance the hundred and twenty pounds to which he was entitled yearly now i shall have to work and starve thought he and was addressing himself to this new fate when a mysterious telegram arrived from torpenhow in england which said come back quick you have caught on come  a large smile overspread his face so soon thats a good hearing said he to himself there will be an orgy tonight ill stand or fall by my luck faith its time it came he deposited half of his funds in the hands of his well known friends monsieur and madame binat and ordered himself a zanzibar dance of the finest monsieur binat was shaking with drink but madame smiles sympatheticallymonsieur needs a chair of course and of course monsieur will sketch monsieur amuses himself strangely  binat raised a bluewhite face from a cot in the inner room i understand he quavered we all know monsieur monsieur is an artist as i have been dick nodded in the end said binat with gravity monsieur will descend alive into hell as i have descended and he laughed  you must come to the dance too said dick i shall want you  for my face i knew it would be so for my face my god and for my degradation so tremendous i will not take him away he is a devil or at least do thou celeste demand of him more the excellent binat began to kick and scream  all things are for sale in port said said madame if my husband comes it will be so much more eh how you call alf a sovereign   the money was paid and the mad dance was held at night in a walled courtyard at the back of madame binats house the lady herself in faded mauve silk always about to slide from her yellow shoulders played the piano and to the tinpot music of a western waltz the naked zanzibari girls danced furiously by the light of kerosene lamps binat sat upon a chair and stared with eyes that saw nothing till the whirl of the dance and the clang of the rattling piano stole into the drink that took the place of blood in his veins and his face glistened dick took him by the chin brutally and turned that face to the light madame binat looked over her shoulder and smiled with many teeth dick leaned against the wall and sketched for an hour till the kerosene lamps began to smell and the girls threw themselves panting on the hardbeaten ground then he shut his book with a snap and moved away binat plucking feebly at his elbow show me he whimpered i too was once an artist even i dick showed him the rough sketch am i that he screamed will you take that away with you and show all the world that it is ibinat he moaned and wept  monsieur has paid for all said madame to the pleasure of seeing monsieur again  the courtyard gate shut and dick hurried up the sandy street to the nearest gamblinghell where he was well known if the luck holds its an omen if i lose i must stay here he placed his money picturesquely about the board hardly daring to look at what he did the luck held  three turns of the wheel left him richer by twenty pounds and he went down to the shipping to make friends with the captain of a decayed cargosteamer who landed him in london with fewer pounds in his pocket than he cared to think about  a thin gray fog hung over the city and the streets were very cold for summer was in england  its a cheerful wilderness and it hasnt  the knack of altering much dick thought as he tramped from the docks westward now what must i do  the packed houses gave no answer dick looked down the long lightless streets and at the appalling rush of traffic oh you rabbithutches said he addressing a row of highly respectable semidetached residences do you know what youve got to do later on you have to supply me with menservants and maidservantshere he smacked his lipsand the peculiar treasure of kings meantime ill clothes and boots and presently i will return and trample on you he stepped forward energetically he saw that one of his shoes was burst at the side as he stooped to make investigations a man jostled him into the gutter all right he said thats another nick in the score ill jostle you later on  good clothes and boots are not cheap and dick left his last shop with the certainty that he would be respectably arrayed for a time but with only fifty shillings in his pocket he returned to streets by the docks and lodged himself in one room where the sheets on the bed were almost audibly marked in case of theft and where nobody seemed to go to bed at all when his clothes arrived he sought the central southern syndicate for torpenhows address and got it with the intimation that there was still some money waiting for him  how much said dick as one who habitually dealt in millions  between thirty and forty pounds if it would be any convenience to you of course we could let you have it at once but we usually settle accounts monthly  if i show that i want anything now im lost he said to himself all i need ill take later on then aloud its hardly worth while and im going to the country for a month too wait till i come back and ill see about it  but we trust mr heldar that you do not intend to sever your connection with us   dicks business in life was the study of faces and he watched the speaker keenly that man means something he said ill do no business till ive seen torpenhow theres a big deal coming so he departed making no promises to his one little room by the docks and that day was the seventh of the month and that month he reckoned with awful distinctness had thirtyone days in it it is not easy for a man of catholic tastes and healthy appetites to exist for twentyfour days on fifty shillings nor is it cheering to begin the experiment alone in all the loneliness of london dick paid seven shillings a week for his lodging which left him rather less than a shilling a day for food and drink naturally his first purchase was of the materials of his craft he had been without them too long half a days investigations and comparison brought him to the conclusion that sausages and mashed potatoes twopence a plate were the best food now sausages once or twice a week for breakfast are not unpleasant as lunch even with mashed potatoes they become monotonous at dinner they are impertinent at the end of three days dick loathed sausages and going forth pawned his watch to revel on sheeps head which is not as cheap as it looks owing to the bones and the gravy then he returned to sausages and mashed potatoes then he confined himself entirely to mashed potatoes for a day and was unhappy because of pain in his inside then he pawned his waistcoat and his tie and thought regretfully of money thrown away in times past there are few things more edifying unto art than the actual bellypinch of hunger and dick in his few walks abroadhe did not care for exercise it raised desires that could not be satisfiedfound himself dividing mankind into two classesthose who looked as if they might give him something to eat and those who looked otherwise i never knew what i had to learn about the human face before he thought and as a reward for his humility providence caused a cabdriver at a sausageshop where dick fed that night to leave half eaten a great chunk of bread dick took itwould have fought all the world for its possessionand it cheered him  the month dragged through at last and nearly prancing with impatience he went to draw his money then he hastened to torpenhows address and smelt the smell of cooking meats all along the corridors of the chambers torpenhow was on the top floor and dick burst into his room to be received with a hug which nearly cracked his ribs as torpenhow dragged him to the light and spoke of twenty different things in the same breath  but youre looking tucked up he concluded  got anything to eat said dick his eye roaming round the room  i shall be having breakfast in a minute what do you say to sausages  no anything but sausages torp ive been starving on that accursed horse flesh for thirty days and thirty nights  now what lunacy has been your latest  dick spoke of the last few weeks with unbridled speech then he opened his coat there was no waistcoat below i ran it fine awfully fine but ive just scraped through                    you havent  much sense but youve got a backbone anyhow eat and talk afterwards dick fell upon eggs and bacon and gorged till he could gorge no more torpenhow handed him a filled pipe and he smoked as men smoke who for three weeks have been deprived of good tobacco  ouf said he thats heavenly well  why in the world didnt  you come to me  couldnt i owe you too much already old man besides i had a sort of superstition that this temporary starvationthats what it was and it hurt would bring me luck later its over and done with now and none of the syndicate know how hard up i was fire away whats the exact state of affairs as regards myself  you had my wire youve caught on here people like your work immensely i dont  know why but they do they say you have a fresh touch and a new way of drawing things and because theyre chiefly homebred english they say you have insight youre wanted by half a dozen papers youre wanted to illustrate books  dick grunted scornfully  youre wanted to work up your smaller sketches and sell them to the dealers they seem to think the money sunk in you is a good investment good lord who can account for the fathomless folly of the public  theyre a remarkably sensible people  they are subject to fits if thats what you mean and you happen to be the object of the latest fit among those who are interested in what they call art just now youre a fashion a phenomenon or whatever you please i appeared to be the only person who knew anything about you here and i have been showing the most useful men a few of the sketches you gave me from time to time those coming after your work on the central southern syndicate appear to have done your business youre in luck  huh call it luck do call it luck when a man has been kicking about the world like a dog waiting for it to come ill luck em later on i want a place to work first  come here said torpenhow crossing the landing this place is a big box room really but it will do for you theres your skylight or your north light or whatever window you call it and plenty of room to thrash about in and a bedroom beyond what more do you need  good enough said dick looking round the large room that took up a third of a top story in the rickety chambers overlooking the thames a pale yellow sun shone through the skylight and showed the much dirt of the place three steps led from the door to the landing and three more to torpenhows room the well of the staircase disappeared into darkness pricked by tiny gasjets and there were sounds of men talking and doors slamming seven flights below in the warm gloom  do they give you a free hand here said dick cautiously he was ishmael enough to know the value of liberty  anything you like latchkeys and license unlimited we are permanent tenants for the most part here tisnt  a place i would recommend for a young mens christian association but it will serve i took these rooms for you when i wired   youre a great deal too kind old man  you didnt  suppose you were going away from me did you torpenhow put his hand on dicks shoulder and the two walked up and down the room henceforward to be called the studio in sweet and silent communion they heard rapping at torpenhows door thats some ruffian come up for a drink said torpenhow and he raised his voice cheerily there entered no one more ruffianly than a portly middleaged gentleman in a satinfaced frockcoat his lips were parted and pale and there were deep pouches under the eyes  weak heart said dick to himself and as he shook hands very weak heart his pulse is shaking his fingers  the man introduced himself as the head of the central southern syndicate and one of the most ardent admirers of your work mr heldar i assure you in the name of the syndicate that we are immensely indebted to you and i trust mr heldar you wont  forget that we were largely instrumental in bringing you before the public he panted because of the seven flights of stairs  dick glanced at torpenhow whose left eyelid lay for a moment dead on his cheek  i shant  forget said dick every instinct of defence roused in him  youve paid me so well that i couldnt you know by the way when i am settled in this place i should like to send and get my sketches there must be nearly a hundred and fifty of them with you  that is eris what i came to speak about i fear we cant  allow it exactly mr heldar in the absence of any specified agreement the sketches are our property of course  do you mean to say that you are going to keep them  yes and we hope to have your help on your own terms mr heldar to assist us in arranging a little exhibition which backed by our name and the influence we naturally command among the press should be of material service to you sketches such as yours  belong to me you engaged me by wire you paid me the lowest rates you dared you cant  mean to keep them good god alive man theyre all ive got in the world  torpenhow watched dicks face and whistled  dick walked up and down thinking he saw the whole of his little stock in trade the first weapon of his equipment annexed at the outset of his campaign by an elderly gentleman whose name dick had not caught aright who said that he represented a syndicate which was a thing for which dick had not the least reverence the injustice of the proceedings did not much move him he had seen the strong hand prevail too often in other places to be squeamish over the moral aspects of right and wrong  but he ardently desired the blood of the gentleman in the frockcoat and when he spoke again it was with a strained sweetness that torpenhow knew well for the beginning of strife  forgive me sir but you have nono younger man who can arrange this business with me  i speak for the syndicate i see no reason for a third party to  you will in a minute be good enough to give back my sketches  the man stared blankly at dick and then at torpenhow who was leaning against the wall he was not used to exemployees who ordered him to be good enough to do things  yes it is rather a coldblooded steal said torpenhow critically but im afraid i am very much afraid youve struck the wrong man be careful dick remember this isnt  the soudan  considering what services the syndicate have done you in putting your name before the world  this was not a fortunate remark it reminded dick of certain vagrant years lived out in loneliness and strife and unsatisfied desires the memory did not contrast well with the prosperous gentleman who proposed to enjoy the fruit of those years  i dont  know quite what to do with you began dick meditatively of course youre a thief and you ought to be half killed but in your case youd probably die i dont  want you dead on this floor and besides its unlucky just as ones moving in dont  hit sir youll only excite yourself  he put one hand on the mans forearm and ran the other down the plump body beneath the coat my goodness said he to torpenhow and this gray oaf dares to be a thief i have seen an esneh cameldriver have the black hide taken off his body in strips for stealing half a pound of wet dates and he was as tough as whipcord this things soft all overlike a woman  there are few things more poignantly humiliating than being handled by a man who does not intend to strike the head of the syndicate began to breathe heavily dick walked round him pawing him as a cat paws a soft hearthrug then he traced with his forefinger the leaden pouches underneath the eyes and shook his head you were going to steal my thingsmine mine mineyou who dont  know when you may die write a note to your officeyou say youre the head of itand order them to give torpenhow my sketchesevery one of them wait a minute your hands shaking now he thrust a pocketbook before him the note was written torpenhow took it and departed without a word while dick walked round and round the spellbound captive giving him such advice as he conceived best for the welfare of his soul when torpenhow returned with a gigantic portfolio he heard dick say almost soothingly now i hope this will be a lesson to you and if you worry me when i have settled down to work with any nonsense about actions for assault believe me ill catch you and manhandle you and youll die you havent  very long to live anyhow go imshi vootsakget out the man departed staggering and dazed dick drew a long breath phew what a lawless lot these people are the first thing a poor orphan meets is gang robbery organised burglary think of the hideous blackness of that mans mind are my sketches all right torp  yes one hundred and fortyseven of them well i must say dick youve begun well  he was interfering with me it only meant a few pounds to him but it was everything to me i dont  think hell bring an action i gave him some medical advice gratis about the state of his body it was cheap at the little flurry it cost him now lets look at my things  two minutes later dick had thrown himself down on the floor and was deep in the portfolio chuckling lovingly as he turned the drawings over and thought of the price at which they had been bought  the afternoon was well advanced when torpenhow came to the door and saw dick dancing a wild saraband under the skylight  i builded better than i knew torp he said without stopping the dance theyre good theyre damned good theyll go like flame i shall have an exhibition of them on my own brazen hook and that man would have cheated me out of it do you know that im sorry now that i didnt  actually hit him  go out said torpenhowgo out and pray to be delivered from the sin of arrogance which you never will be bring your things up from whatever place youre staying in and well try to make this barn a little more shipshape  and thenoh then said dick still capering we will spoil the egyptians   chapter iv                                           the wolfcub at even lay hid in the corn  when the smoke of the cooking hung gray  he knew where the doe made a couch for her fawn  and he looked to his strength for his prey   but the moon swept the smokewreaths away   and he turned from his meal in the villagers close  and he bayed to the moon as she rose            in seonee  well and how does success taste said torpenhow some three months later he had just returned to chambers after a holiday in the country  good said dick as he sat licking his lips before the easel in the studio  i want moreheaps more the lean years have passed and i approve of these fat ones  be careful old man that way lies bad work  torpenhow was sprawling in a long chair with a small foxterrier asleep on his chest while dick was preparing a canvas a dais a background and a lay figure were the only fixed objects in the place they rose from a wreck of oddments that began with feltcovered waterbottles belts and regimental badges and ended with a small bale of secondhand uniforms and a stand of mixed arms the mark of muddy feet on the dais showed that a military model had just gone away the watery autumn sunlight was falling and shadows sat in the corners of the studio  yes said dick deliberately i like the power i like the fun i like the fuss and above all i like the money i almost like the people who make the fuss and pay the money almost but theyre a queer gangan amazingly queer gang  they have been good enough to you at any rate that tinpot exhibition of your sketches must have paid did you see that the papers called it the wild work show  never mind i sold every shred of canvas i wanted to and on my word i believe it was because they believed i was a selftaught flagstone artist i should have got better prices if i worked my things on wool or scratched them on camelbone instead of using mere black and white and colour verily they are a queer gang these people limited isnt  the word to describe em i met a fellow the other day who told me that it was impossible that shadows on white sand should be blueultramarineas they are i found out later that the man had been as far as brighton beach but he knew all about art confound him he gave me a lecture on it and recommended me to go to school to learn technique i wonder what old kami would have said to that  when were you under kami man of extraordinary beginnings  i studied with him for two years in paris he taught by personal magnetism all he ever said was continuez mes enfants and you had to make the best you could of that he had a divine touch and he knew something about colour kami used to dream colour i swear he could never have seen the genuine article but he evolved it and it was good  recollect some of those views in the soudan said torpenhow with a provoking drawl  dick squirmed in his place dont it makes me want to get out there again what colour that was opal and umber and amber and claret and brickred and sulphurcockatoocrestsulphuragainst brown with a niggerblack rock sticking up in the middle of it all and a decorative frieze of camels festooning in front of a pure pale turquoise sky he began to walk up and down and yet you know if you try to give these people the thing as god gave it keyed down to their comprehension and according to the powers he has given you  modest man go on  half a dozen epicene young pagans who havent  even been to algiers will tell you first that your notion is borrowed and secondly that it isnt  art  this comes of my leaving town for a month dickie youve been promenading among the toyshops and hearing people talk  i couldnt  help it said dick penitently you werent  here and it was lonely these long evenings a man cant  work for ever  a man might have gone to a pub and got decently drunk  i wish i had but i forgathered with some men of sorts they said they were artists and i knew some of them could drawbut they wouldnt  draw they gave me teatea at five in the afternoonand talked about art and the state of their souls as if their souls mattered ive heard more about art and seen less of her in the last six months than in the whole of my life do you remember cassavetti who worked for some continental syndicate out with the desert column he was a regular christmastree of contraptions when he took the field in full fig with his waterbottle lanyard revolver writingcase housewife giglamps and the lord knows what all he used to fiddle about with em and show us how they worked but he never seemed to do much except fudge his reports from the nilghai see  dear old nilghai hes in town fatter than ever he ought to be up here this evening i see the comparison perfectly you should have kept clear of all that manmillinery serves you right and i hope it will unsettle your mind  it wont it has taught me what artholy sacred artmeans  youve learnt something while ive been away what is art  give em what they know and when youve done it once do it again  dick dragged forward a canvas laid face to the wall heres a sample of real art its going to be a facsimile reproduction for a weekly i called it his last shot its worked up from the little watercolour i made outside el maghrib well i lured my model a beautiful rifleman up here with drink i drored him and i redrored him and i redrored him and i made him a flushed dishevelled bedevilled scallawag with his helmet at the back of his head and the living fear of death in his eye and the blood oozing out of a cut over his anklebone he wasnt  pretty but he was all soldier and very much man  once more modest child  dick laughed well its only to you im talking i did him just as well as i knew how making allowance for the slickness of oils then the artmanager of that abandoned paper said that his subscribers wouldnt  like it it was brutal and coarse and violentman being naturally gentle when hes fighting for his life they wanted something more restful with a little more colour i could have said a good deal but you might as well talk to a sheep as an artmanager i took my last shot back behold the result i put him into a lovely red coat without a speck on it that is art i polished his bootsobserve the high light on the toe that is art i cleaned his riflerifles are always clean on servicebecause that is art i pipeclayed his helmetpipeclay is always used on active service and is indispensable to art i shaved his chin i washed his hands and gave him an air of fatted peace result military tailors patternplate price thank heaven twice as much as for the first sketch which was moderately decent  and do you suppose youre going to give that thing out as your work  why not i did it alone i did it in the interests of sacred homebred art and dickensons weekly  torpenhow smoked in silence for a while then came the verdict delivered from rolling clouds if you were only a mass of blathering vanity dick i wouldnt  mindid let you go to the deuce on your own mahlstick but when i consider what you are to me and when i find that to vanity you add the twopenny halfpenny pique of a twelveyearold girl then i bestir myself in your behalf thus  the canvas ripped as torpenhows booted foot shot through it and the terrier jumped down thinking rats were about  if you have any bad language to use use it you have not i continue you are an idiot because no man born of woman is strong enough to take liberties with his public even though they bewhich they aintall you say they are  but they dont  know any better what can you expect from creatures born and bred in this light dick pointed to the yellow fog if they want furniture polish let them have furniturepolish so long as they pay for it they are only men and women you talk as if they were gods  that sounds very fine but it has nothing to do with the case they are they people you have to do work for whether you like it or not they are your masters dontbe deceived dickie you arent  strong enough to trifle with themor with yourself which is more important  moreovercome back binkie that red daub isnt  going anywhereunless you take precious good care you will fall under the damnation of the checkbook and thats worse than death you will get drunkyoure half drunk alreadyon easily acquired money for that money and you own infernal vanity you are willing to deliberately turn out bad work youll do quite enough bad work without knowing it and dickie as i love you and as i know you love me i am not going to let you cut off your nose to spite your face for all the gold in england thats settled now swear  dont know said dick ive been trying to make myself angry but i cant youre so abominably reasonable there will be a row on dickensons weekly i fancy  why the dickenson do you want to work on a weekly paper its slow bleeding of power  it brings in the very desirable dollars said dick his hands in his pockets  torpenhow watched him with large contempt why i thought it was a man said he its a child  no it isnt said dick wheeling quickly youve no notion what the certainty of cash means to a man who has always wanted it badly nothing will pay me for some of my lifes joys on that chinese pigboat for instance when we ate bread and jam for every meal because howang wouldnt  allow us anything better and it all tasted of pigchinese pig ive worked for this ive sweated and ive starved for this line on line and month after month and now ive got it i am going to make the most of it while it lasts let them pay theyve no knowledge  what does your majesty please to want you cant  smoke more than you do you wont  drink youre a gross feeder and you dress in the dark by the look of you you wouldnt  keep a horse the other day when i suggested because you said it might fall lame and whenever you cross the street you take a hansom even you are not foolish enough to suppose that theatres and all the live things you can by thereabouts mean life what earthly need have you for money  its there bless its golden heart said dick its there all the time providence has sent me nuts while i have teeth to crack em with i havent  yet found the nut i wish to crack but im keeping my teeth filed perhaps some day you and i will go for a walk round the wide earth  with no work to do nobody to worry us and nobody to compete with you would be unfit to speak to in a week besides i shouldnt  go i dont  care to profit by the price of a mans soulfor thats what it would mean dick its no use arguing youre a fool  dont  see it when i was on that chinese pigboat our captain got credit for saving about twentyfive thousand very seasick little pigs when our old tramp of a steamer fell foul of a timberjunk now taking those pigs as a parallel   oh confound your parallels whenever i try to improve your soul you always drag in some anecdote from your very shady past pigs arent  the british public and selfrespect is selfrespect the world over go out for a walk and try to catch some selfrespect and i say if the nilghai comes up this evening can i show him your diggings  surely and dick departed to take counsel with himself in the rapidly gathering london fog  half an hour after he had left the nilghai laboured up the staircase he was the chiefest as he was the youngest of the war correspondents and his experiences dated from the birth of the needlegun saving only his ally keneu the great war eagle there was no man higher in the craft than he and he always opened his conversation with the news that there would be trouble in the balkans in the spring torpenhow laughed as he entered  never mind the trouble in the balkans those little states are always screeching youve heard about dicks luck  yes he has been called up to notoriety hasnt  he i hope you keep him properly humble he wants suppressing from time to time  he does hes beginning to take liberties with what he thinks is his reputation  already by jove he has cheek i dont  know about his reputation but hell come a cropper if he tries that sort of thing  so i told him i dont  think he believes it  they never do when they first start off whats that wreck on the ground there  specimen of his latest impertinence torpenhow thrust the torn edges of the canvas together and showed the wellgroomed picture to the nilghai who looked at it for a moment and whistled  its a chromo said hea chromolitholeomargarine fake what possessed him to do it and yet how thoroughly he has caught the note that catches a public who think with their boots and read with their elbows the coldblooded insolence of the work almost saves it but he mustnt  go on with this hasnt  he been praised and cockered up too much you know these people here have no sense of proportion theyll call him a second detaille and a thirdhand meissonier while his fashion lasts its windy diet for a colt  i dont  think it affects dick much you might as well call a young wolf a lion and expect him to take the compliment in exchange for a shinbone dicks soul is in the bank hes working for cash  now he has thrown up war work i suppose he doesnt  see that the obligations of the service are just the same only the proprietors are changed  how should he know he thinks he is his own master  does he i could undeceive him for his good if theres any virtue in print he wants the whiplash  lay it on with science then id flay him myself but i like him too much  ive no scruples he had the audacity to try to cut me out with a woman at cairo once i forgot that but i remember now  did he cut you out  youll see when i have dealt with him but after all whats the good leave him alone and hell come home if he has any stuff in him dragging or wagging his tail behind him theres more in a week of life than in a lively weekly none the less ill slate him ill slate him ponderously in the cataclysm  good luck to you but i fancy nothing short of a crowbar would make dick wince his soul seems to have been fired before we came across him hes intensely suspicious and utterly lawless  matter of temper said the nilghai its the same with horses some you wallop and they work some you wallop and they jib and some you wallop and they go out for a walk with their hands in their pockets  thats exactly what dick has done said torpenhow wait till he comes back in the meantime you can begin your slating here ill show you some of his last and worst work in his studio  dick had instinctively sought running water for a comfort to his mood of mind he was leaning over the embankment wall watching the rush of the thames through the arches of westminster bridge he began by thinking of torpenhows advice but as of custom lost himself in the study of the faces flocking past some had death written on their features and dick marvelled that they could laugh others clumsy and coarsebuilt for the most part were alight with love others were merely drawn and lined with work but there was something dick knew to be made out of them all the poor at least should suffer that he might learn and the rich should pay for the output of his learning thus his credit in the world and his cash balance at the bank would be increased so much the better for him he had suffered now he would take toll of the ills of others  the fog was driven apart for a moment and the sun shone a bloodred wafer on the water dick watched the spot till he heard the voice of the tide between the piers die down like the wash of the sea at low tide a girl hard pressed by her lover shouted shamelessly ah get away you beast and a shift of the same wind that had opened the fog drove across dicks face the black smoke of a riversteamer at her berth below the wall he was blinded for the moment then spun round and found himself face to face withmaisie  there was no mistaking the years had turned the child to a woman but they had not altered the darkgray eyes the thin scarlet lips or the firmly modelled mouth and chin and that all should be as it was of old she wore a closely fitting gray dress  since the human soul is finite and not in the least under its own command dick advancing said halloo after the manner of schoolboys and maisie answered oh dick is that you then against his will and before the brain newly released from considerations of the cash balance had time to dictate to the nerves every pulse of dicks body throbbed furiously and his palate dried in his mouth the fog shut down again and maisies face was pearlwhite through it no word was spoken but dick fell into step at her side and the two paced the embankment together keeping the step as perfectly as in their afternoon excursions to the mudflats then dick a little hoarselywhat has happened to amomma  he died dick not cartridges overeating he was always greedy isnt  it funny  yes no do you mean amomma  yees no this where have you come from  over there he pointed eastward through the fog and you  oh im in the norththe black north across all the park i am very busy  what do you do  i paint a great deal thats all i have to do  why whats happened you had three hundred a year  i have that still i am painting thats all  are you alone then  theres a girl living with me dont  walk so fast dick youre out of step  then you noticed it too  of course i did youre always out of step  so i am im sorry you went on with the painting  of course i said i should i was at the slade then at mertons in st johns wood the big studio then i pepperpottedi mean i went to the national and now im working under kami  but kami is in paris surely  no he has his teaching studio in vitrysurmarne i work with him in the summer and i live in london in the winter im a householder  do you sell much  now and again but not often there is my bus i must take it or lose half an hour goodbye dick  goodbye maisie wont  you tell me where you live i must see you again and perhaps i could help you ii paint a little myself  i may be in the park tomorrow if there is no working light i walk from the marble arch down and back again that is my little excursion but of course i shall see you again she stepped into the omnibus and was swallowed up by the fog  welliamdamned exclaimed dick and returned to the chambers  torpenhow and the nilghai found him sitting on the steps to the studio door repeating the phrase with an awful gravity  youll be more damned when im done with you said the nilghai upheaving his bulk from behind torpenhows shoulder and waving a sheaf of halfdry manuscript dick it is of common report that you are suffering from swelled head  halloo nilghai back again how are the balkans and all the little balkans one side of your face is out of drawing as usual  never mind that i am commissioned to smite you in print torpenhow refuses from false delicacy ive been overhauling the potboilers in your studio they are simply disgraceful  oho thats it is it if you think you can slate me youre wrong you can only describe and you need as much room to turn in on paper as a p and o cargoboat but continue and be swift im going to bed  hm hm hm the first part only deals with your pictures heres the peroration for work done without conviction for power wasted on trivialities for labour expended with levity for the deliberate purpose of winning the easy applause of a fashiondriven public  thats his last shot second edition go on  public there remains but one endthe oblivion that is preceded by toleration and cenotaphed with contempt from that fate mr heldar has yet to prove himself out of danger  wowwowwowwowwow said dick profanely its a clumsy ending and vile journalese but its quite true and yethe sprang to his feet and snatched at the manuscriptyou scarred deboshed battered old gladiator youre sent out when a war begins to minister to the blind brutal british publics bestial thirst for blood they have no arenas now but they must have special correspondents youre a fat gladiator who comes up through a trapdoor and talks of what hes seen you stand on precisely the same level as an energetic bishop an affable actress a devastating cyclone ormine own sweet self and you presume to lecture me about my work nilghai if it were worth while id caricature you in four papers  the nilghai winced he had not thought of this  as it is i shall take this stuff and tear it smallso the manuscript fluttered in slips down the dark well of the staircase go home nilghai  said dick go home to your lonely little bed and leave me in peace i am about to turn in till to morrow  why it isnt  seven yet said torpenhow with amazement  it shall be two in the morning if i choose said dick backing to the studio door i go to grapple with a serious crisis and i shant  want any dinner  the door shut and was locked  what can you do with a man like that said the nilghai  leave him alone hes as mad as a hatter  at eleven there was a kicking on the studio door is the nilghai with you still said a voice from within then tell him he might have condensed the whole of his lumbering nonsense into an epigram only the free are bond and only the bond are free tell him hes an idiot torp and tell him im another  all right come out and have supper youre smoking on an empty stomach  there was no answer   chapter v   i have a thousand men said he  to wait upon my will  and towers nine upon the tyne  and three upon the till   and what care i for you men said she  or towers from tyne to till  sith you must go with me she said  to wait upon my will                  sir hoggie and the fairies  next morning torpenhow found dick sunk in deepest repose of tobacco  well madman how dyou feel  i dont know im trying to find out  you had much better do some work  maybe but im in no hurry ive made a discovery torp theres too much ego in my cosmos  not really is this revelation due to my lectures or the nilghais  it came to me suddenly all on my own account much too much ego and now im going to work  he turned over a few halffinished sketches drummed on a new canvas cleaned three brushes set binkie to bite the toes of the lay figure rattled through his collection of arms and accoutrements and then went out abruptly declaring that he had done enough for the day  this is positively indecent said torpenhow and the first time that dick has ever broken up a light morning perhaps he has found out that he has a soul or an artistic temperament or something equally valuable that comes of leaving him alone for a month perhaps he has been going out of evenings i must look to this he rang for the baldheaded old housekeeper whom nothing could astonish or annoy  beeton did mr heldar dine out at all while i was out of town  never laid is dressclothes out once sir all the time mostly e dined in but e brought some most remarkable young gentlemen up ere after theatres once or twice remarkable fancy they was you gentlemen on the top floor does very much as you likes but it do seem to me sir droppin a walkinstick down five flights o stairs an then goin down four abreast to pick it up again at halfpast two in the mornin singin bring back the whiskey willie darlinnot once or twice but scores o timesisnt charity to the other tenants what i say is do as you would be done by thats my motto  of course of course im afraid the top floor isnt the quietest in the house  i make no complaints sir i have spoke to mr heldar friendly an he laughed an did me a picture of the missis that is as good as a coloured print it asnt the high shine of a photograph but what i say is never look a gifthorse in the mouthmr heldars dressclothes avent been on him for weeks  then its all right said torpenhow to himself orgies are healthy and dick has a head of his own but when it comes to women making eyes im not so certainbinkie never you be a man little dorglums theyre contrary brutes and they do things without any reason  dick had turned northward across the park but he was walking in the spirit on the mudflats with maisie he laughed aloud as he remembered the day when he had decked amommas horns with the hamfrills and maisie white with rage had cuffed him how long those four years seemed in review and how closely maisie was connected with every hour of them storm across the sea and maisie in a gray dress on the beach sweeping her drenched hair out of her eyes and laughing at the homeward race of the fishingsmacks hot sunshine on the mud flats and maisie sniffing scornfully with her chin in the air maisie flying before the wind that threshed the foreshore and drove the sand like small shot about her ears maisie very composed and independent telling lies to mrs jennett while dick supported her with coarser perjuries maisie picking her way delicately from stone to stone a pistol in her hand and her teeth firmset and maisie in a gray dress sitting on the grass between the mouth of a cannon and a nodding yellow seapoppy the pictures passed before him one by one and the last stayed the longest  dick was perfectly happy with a quiet peace that was as new to his mind as it was foreign to his experiences it never occurred to him that there might be other calls upon his time than loafing across the park in the forenoon  theres a good working light now he said watching his shadow placidly some poor devil ought to be grateful for this and theres maisie  she was walking towards him from the marble arch and he saw that no mannerism of her gait had been changed it was good to find her still maisie and so to speak his nextdoor neighbour no greeting passed between them because there had been none in the old days  what are you doing out of your studio at this hour said dick as one who was entitled to ask  idling just idling i got angry with a chin and scraped it out then i left it in a little heap of paintchips and came away  i know what paletteknifing means what was the piccy  a fancy head that wouldnt come righthorrid thing  i dont like working over scraped paint when im doing flesh the grain comes up woolly as the paint dries  not if you scrape properly maisie waved her hand to illustrate her methods there was a dab of paint on the white cuff dick laughed  youre as untidy as ever  that comes well from you look at your own cuff  by jove yes its worse than yours i dont think weve much altered in anything lets see though he looked at maisie critically the pale blue haze of an autumn day crept between the treetrunks of the park and made a background for the gray dress the black velvet toque above the black hair and the resolute profile  no theres nothing changed how good it is dyou remember when i fastened your hair into the snap of a handbag  maisie nodded with a twinkle in her eyes and turned her full face to dick  wait a minute said he that mouth is down at the corners a little whos been worrying you maisie  no one but myself i never seem to get on with my work and yet i try hard enough and kami says  continuez mesdemoiselles continuez toujours mes enfants kami is depressing i beg your pardon  yes thats what he says he told me last summer that i was doing better and hed let me exhibit this year  not in this place surely  of course not the salon  you fly high  ive been beating my wings long enough where do you exhibit dick  i dont exhibit i sell                           what is your line then  havent you heard dicks eyes opened was this thing possible he cast about for some means of conviction they were not far from the marble arch come up oxford street a little and ill show you  a small knot of people stood round a printshop that dick knew well  some reproduction of my work inside he said with suppressed triumph never before had success tasted so sweet upon the tongue you see the sort of things i paint dyou like it  maisie looked at the wild whirling rush of a fieldbattery going into action under fire two artillerymen stood behind her in the crowd  theyve chucked the off leadorse said one to the other es tore up awful but theyre makin good time with the others that leaddriver drives better nor you tom see ow cunnin es nursin is orse  number threell be off the limber next jolt was the answer  no e wont see ow is foots braced against the iron es all right  dick watched maisies face and swelled with joyfine rank vulgar triumph she was more interested in the little crowd than in the picture                                                    that was something that she could understand  and i wanted it so oh i did want it so she said at last under her breath  meall me said dick placidly look at their faces it hits em they dont know what makes their eyes and mouths open but i know and i know my works right  yes i see oh what a thing to have come to one  come to one indeed i had to go out and look for it what do you think  i call it success tell me how you got it  they returned to the park and dick delivered himself of the saga of his own doings with all the arrogance of a young man speaking to a woman  from the beginning he told the tale the iiis flashing through the records as telegraphpoles fly past the traveller maisie listened and nodded her head the histories of strife and privation did not move her a hairsbreadth at the end of each canto he would conclude and that gave me some notion of handling colour or light or whatever it might be that he had set out to pursue and understand he led her breathless across half the world speaking as he had never spoken in his life before  and in the floodtide of his exaltation there came upon him a great desire to pick up this maiden who nodded her head and said i understand go onto pick her up and carry her away with him because she was maisie and because she understood and because she was his right and a woman to be desired above all women  then he checked himself abruptly and so i took all i wanted he said and i had to fight for it now you tell  maisies tale was almost as gray as her dress it covered years of patient toil backed by savage pride that would not be broken though dealers laughed and fogs delayed work and kami was unkind and even sarcastic and girls in other studios were painfully polite it had a few bright spots in pictures accepted at provincial exhibitions but it wound up with the oft repeated wail and so you see dick i had no success though i worked so hard  then pity filled dick even thus had maisie spoken when she could not hit the breakwater half an hour before she had kissed him and that had happened yesterday  never mind he said ill tell you something if youll believe it the words were shaping themselves of their own accord the whole thing lock stock and barrel isnt worth one big yellow seapoppy below fort keeling                      maisie flushed a little its all very well for you to talk but youve had the success and i havent  let me talk then i know youll understand maisie dear it sounds a bit absurd but those ten years never existed and ive come back again it really is just the same cant you see youre alone now and im alone whats the use of worrying come to me instead darling  maisie poked the gravel with her parasol they were sitting on a bench  i understand she said slowly but ive got my work to do and i must do it  do it with me then dear i wont interrupt  no i couldnt its my workmineminemine ive been alone all my life in myself and im not going to belong to anybody except myself i remember things as well as you do but that doesnt count we were babies then and we didnt know what was before us dick dont be selfish i think i see my way to a little success next year dont take it away from me  i beg your pardon darling its my fault for speaking stupidly i cant expect you to throw up all your life just because im back ill go to my own place and wait a little  but dick i dont want you togoout ofmy life now youve just come back  im at your orders forgive me dick devoured the troubled little face with his eyes there was triumph in them because he could not conceive that maisie should refuse sooner or later to love him since he loved her  its wrong of me said maisie more slowly than before its wrong and selfish but oh ive been so lonely no you misunderstand now ive seen you againits absurd but i want to keep you in my life  naturally we belong  we dont but you always understood me and there is so much in my work that you could help me in you know things and the ways of doing things you must  i do i fancy or else i dont know myself then you wont care to lose sight of me altogether andyou want me to help you in your work  yes but remember dick nothing will ever come of it thats why i feel so selfish cant things stay as they are i do want your help  you shall have it but lets consider i must see your pics first and overhaul your sketches and find out about your tendencies you should see what the papers say about my tendencies then ill give you good advice and you shall paint according isnt that it maisie  again there was triumph in dicks eye  its too good of youmuch too good because you are consoling yourself with what will never happen and i know that and yet i want to keep you dont blame me later please  im going into the matter with my eyes open moreover the queen can do no wrong it isnt your selfishness that impresses me its your audacity in proposing to make use of me  pooh youre only dickand a printshop  very good thats all i am but maisie you believe dont you that i love you i dont want you to have any false notions about brothers and sisters  maisie looked up for a moment and dropped her eyes  its absurd buti believe i wish i could send you away before you get angry with me butbut the girl that lives with me is redhaired and an impressionist and all our notions clash  so do ours i think never mind three months from today we shall be laughing at this together  maisie shook her head mournfully i knew you wouldnt understand and it will only hurt you more when you find out look at my face dick and tell me what you see  they stood up and faced each other for a moment the fog was gathering and it stifled the roar of the traffic of london beyond the railings dick brought all his painfully acquired knowledge of faces to bear on the eyes mouth and chin underneath the black velvet toque  its the same maisie and its the same me he said weve both nice little wills of our own and one or other of us has to be broken now about the future i must come and see your pictures some dayi suppose when the red haired girl is on the premises  sundays are my best times you must come on sundays there are such heaps of things i want to talk about and ask your advice about now i must get back to work  try to find out before next sunday what i am said dick dont take my word for anything ive told you goodbye darling and bless you  maisie stole away like a little gray mouse dick watched her till she was out of sight but he did not hear her say to herself very soberly im a wretch a horrid selfish wretch but its dick and dick will understand  no one has yet explained what actually happens when an irresistible force meets the immovable post though many have thought deeply even as dick thought he tried to assure himself that maisie would be led in a few weeks by his mere presence and discourse to a better way of thinking then he remembered much too distinctly her face and all that was written on it  if i know anything of heads he said theres everything in that face but love i shall have to put that in myself and that chin and mouth wont be won for nothing but shes right she knows what she wants and shes going to get it what insolence me of all the people in the wide world to use me but then shes maisie theres no getting over that fact and its good to see her again this business must have been simmering at the back of my head for years    shell use me as i used binat at port said shes quite right it will hurt a little i shall have to see her every sundaylike a young man courting a housemaid shes sure to come around and yetthat mouth isnt a yielding mouth i shall be wanting to kiss her all the time and i shall have to look at her picturesi dont even know what sort of work she does yetand i shall have to talk about artwomans art therefore particularly and perpetually damn all varieties of art it did me a good turn once and now its in my way ill go home and do some art  halfway to the studio dick was smitten with a terrible thought the figure of a solitary woman in the fog suggested it  shes all alone in london with a redhaired impressionist girl who probably has the digestion of an ostrich most redhaired people have maisies a bilious little body theyll eat like lone womenmeals at all hours and tea with all meals i remember how the students in paris used to pig along she may fall ill at any minute and i shant be able to help whew this is ten times worse than owning a wife  torpenhow entered the studio at dusk and looked at dick with eyes full of the austere love that springs up between men who have tugged at the same oar together and are yoked by custom and use and the intimacies of toil this is a good love and since it allows and even encourages strife recrimination and brutal sincerity does not die but grows and is proof against any absence and evil conduct  dick was silent after he handed torpenhow the filled pipe of council he thought of maisie and her possible needs it was a new thing to think of anybody but torpenhow who could think for himself here at last was an outlet for that cash balance he could adorn maisie barbarically with jewelrya thick gold necklace round that little neck bracelets upon the rounded arms and rings of price upon her handsthe cool temperate ringless hands that he had taken between his own it was an absurd thought for maisie would not even allow him to put one ring on one finger and she would laugh at golden trappings it would be better to sit with her quietly in the dusk his arm around her neck and her face on his shoulder as befitted husband and wife torpenhows boots creaked that night and his strong voice jarred dicks brows contracted and he murmured an evil word because he had taken all his success as a right and part payment for past discomfort and now he was checked in his stride by a woman who admitted all the success and did not instantly care for him  i say old man said torpenhow who had made one or two vain attempts at conversation i havent put your back up by anything ive said lately have i  you no how could you  liver out of order  the truly healthy man doesnt know he has a liver im only a bit worried about things in general i suppose its my soul  the truly healthy man doesnt know he has a soul what business have you with luxuries of that kind  it came of itself whos the man that says that were all islands shouting lies to each other across seas of misunderstanding  hes right whoever he isexcept about the misunderstanding i dont think we could misunderstand each other  the blue smoke curled back from the ceiling in clouds then torpenhow insinuatinglydick is it a woman  be hanged if its anything remotely resembling a woman and if you begin to talk like that ill hire a redbrick studio with white paint trimmings and begonias and petunias and blue hungarias to play among threeandsixpenny pot palms and ill mount all my pics in anilinedye plush plasters and ill invite every woman who maunders over what her guidebooks tell her is art and you shall receive em torpin a snuffbrown velvet coat with yellow trousers and an orange tie youll like that  too thin dick a better man than you once denied with cursing and swearing youve overdone it just as he did its no business of mine of course but its comforting to think that somewhere under the stars theres saving up for you a tremendous thrashing whether itll come from heaven or earth i dont know but its bound to come and break you up a little you want hammering  dick shivered all right said he when this island is disintegrated it will call for you  i shall come round the corner and help to disintegrate it some more were talking nonsense come along to a theatre   chapter vi   and you may lead a thousand men  nor ever draw the rein  but ere ye lead the faery queen  twill burst your heart in twain   he has slipped his foot from the stirrupbar  the bridle from his hand  and he is bound by hand and foot  to the queen o faeryland         sir hoggie and the fairies  some weeks later on a very foggy sunday dick was returning across the park to his studio this he said is evidently the thrashing that torp meant it hurts more than i expected but the queen can do no wrong and she certainly has some notion of drawing  he had just finished a sunday visit to maisiealways under the green eyes of the redhaired impressionist girl whom he learned to hate at sightand was tingling with a keen sense of shame sunday after sunday putting on his best clothes he had walked over to the untidy house north of the park first to see maisies pictures and then to criticise and advise upon them as he realised that they were productions on which advice would not be wasted sunday after sunday and his love grew with each visit he had been compelled to cram his heart back from between his lips when it prompted him to kiss maisie several times and very much indeed sunday after sunday the head above the heart had warned him that maisie was not yet attainable and that it would be better to talk as connectedly as possible upon the mysteries of the craft that was all in all to her therefore it was his fate to endure weekly torture in the studio built out over the clammy back garden of a frail stuffy little villa where nothing was ever in its right place and nobody every calledto endure and to watch maisie moving to and fro with the teacups he abhorred tea but since it gave him a little longer time in her presence he drank it devoutly and the redhaired girl sat in an untidy heap and eyed him without speaking she was always watching him  once and only once when she had left the studio maisie showed him an album that held a few poor cuttings from provincial papersthe briefest of hurried notes on some of her pictures sent to outlying exhibitions dick stooped and kissed the paintsmudged thumb on the open page oh my love my love he muttered do you value these things chuck em into the wastepaper basket  not till i get something better said maisie shutting the book  then dick moved by no respect for his public and a very deep regard for the maiden did deliberately propose in order to secure more of these coveted cuttings that he should paint a picture which maisie should sign  thats childish said maisie and i didnt think it of you it must be my work mineminemine  go and design decorative medallions for rich brewers houses you are thoroughly good at that dick was sick and savage  better things than medallions dick was the answer in tones that recalled a grayeyed atoms fearless speech to mrs jennett dick would have abased himself utterly but that other girl trailed in  next sunday he laid at maisies feet small gifts of pencils that could almost draw of themselves and colours in whose permanence he believed and he was ostentatiously attentive to the work in hand it demanded among other things an exposition of the faith that was in him  torpenhows hair would have stood on end had he heard the fluency with which dick preached his own gospel of art  a month before dick would have been equally astonished but it was maisies will and pleasure and he dragged his words together to make plain to her comprehension all that had been hidden to himself of the whys and wherefores of work there is not the least difficulty in doing a thing if you only know how to do it the trouble is to explain your method  i could put this right if i had a brush in my hand said dick despairingly over the modelling of a chin that maisie complained would not look fleshit was the same chin that she had scraped out with the palette knifebut i find it almost impossible to teach you theres a queer grim dutch touch about your painting that i like but ive a notion that youre weak in drawing you foreshorten as though you never used the model and youve caught kamis pasty way of dealing with flesh in shadow then again though you dont know it yourself you shirk hard work suppose you spend some of your time on line lone line doesnt allow of shirking oils do and three square inches of flashy tricky stuff in the corner of a pic sometimes carry a bad thing off as i know thats immoral do linework for a little while and then i can tell more about your powers as old kami used to say  maisie protested she did not care for the pure line   i know said dick you want to do your fancy heads with a bunch of flowers at the base of the neck to hide bad modelling the redhaired girl laughed a little you want to do landscapes with cattle kneedeep in grass to hide bad drawing you want to do a great deal more than you can do you have sense of colour but you want form colours a giftput it aside and think no more about itbut form you can be drilled into now all your fancy headsand some of them are very goodwill keep you exactly where you are with line you must go forward or backward and it will show up all your weaknesses  but other people began maisie  you mustnt mind what other people do if their souls were your soul it would be different you stand and fall by your own work remember and its waste of time to think of any one else in this battle  dick paused and the longing that had been so resolutely put away came back into his eyes he looked at maisie and the look asked as plainly as words was it not time to leave all this barren wilderness of canvas and counsel and join hands with life and love maisie assented to the new programme of schooling so adorably that dick could hardly restrain himself from picking her up then and there and carrying her off to the nearest registrars office it was the implicit obedience to the spoken word and the blank indifference to the unspoken desire that baffled and buffeted his soul he held authority in that houseauthority limited indeed to onehalf of one afternoon in seven but very real while it lasted maisie had learned to appeal to him on many subjects from the proper packing of pictures to the condition of a smoky chimney the redhaired girl never consulted him about anything  on the other hand she accepted his appearances without protest and watched him always he discovered that the meals of the establishment were irregular and fragmentary they depended chiefly on tea pickles and biscuit as he had suspected from the beginning the girls were supposed to market week and week about but they lived with the help of a charwoman as casually as the young ravens maisie spent most of her income on models and the other girl revelled in apparatus as refined as her work was rough armed with knowledge dear bought from the docks dick warned maisie that the end of semistarvation meant the crippling of power to work which was considerably worse than death  maisie took the warning and gave more thought to what she ate and drank when his trouble returned upon him as it generally did in the long winter twilights the remembrance of that little act of domestic authority and his coercion with a hearthbrush of the smoky drawingroom chimney stung dick like a whiplash  he conceived that this memory would be the extreme of his sufferings till one sunday the redhaired girl announced that she would make a study of dicks head and that he would be good enough to sit still andquite as an afterthoughtlook at maisie he sat because he could not well refuse and for the space of half an hour he reflected on all the people in the past whom he had laid open for the purposes of his own craft he remembered binat most distinctlythat binat who had once been an artist and talked about degradation  it was the merest monochrome roughing in of a head but it presented the dumb waiting the longing and above all the hopeless enslavement of the man in a spirit of bitter mockery  ill buy it said dick promptly at your own price  my price is too high but i dare say youll be as grateful if the wet sketch fluttered from the girls hand and fell into the ashes of the studio stove when she picked it up it was hopelessly smudged  oh its all spoiled said maisie and i never saw it was it like  thank you said dick under his breath to the redhaired girl and he removed himself swiftly  how that man hates me said the girl and how he loves you maisie  what nonsense i knew dicks very fond of me but he had his work to do and i have mine  yes he is fond of you and i think he knows there is something in impressionism after all maisie cant you see  see see what  nothing only i know that if i could get any man to look at me as that man looks at you idi dont know what id do but he hates me oh how he hates me  she was not altogether correct dicks hatred was tempered with gratitude for a few moments and then he forgot the girl entirely only the sense of shame remained and he was nursing it across the park in the fog therell be an explosion one of these days he said wrathfully but it isnt maisies fault shes right quite right as far as she knows and i cant blame her this business has been going on for three months nearly three monthsand it cost me ten years knocking about to get at the notion the merest raw notion of my work thats true but then i didnt have pins drawingpins and palette knives stuck into me every sunday  oh my little darling if ever i break you somebody will have a very bad time of it no she wont id be as big a fool about her as i am now ill poison that redhaired girl on my weddingdayshes unwholesomeand now ill pass on these present bad times to torp  torpenhow had been moved to lecture dick more than once lately on the sin of levity and dick and listened and replied not a word in the weeks between the first few sundays of his discipline he had flung himself savagely into his work resolved that maisie should at least know the full stretch of his powers then he had taught maisie that she must not pay the least attention to any work outside her own and maisie had obeyed him all too well she took his counsels but was not interested in his pictures  your things smell of tobacco and blood she said once cant you do anything except soldiers  i could do a head of you that would startle you thought dickthis was before the redhaired girl had brought him under the guillotinebut he only said i am very sorry and harrowed torpenhows soul that evening with blasphemies against art later insensibly and to a large extent against his own will he ceased to interest himself in his own work  for maisies sake and to soothe the selfrespect that it seemed to him he lost each sunday he would not consciously turn out bad stuff but since maisie did not care even for his best it were better not to do anything at all save wait and mark time between sunday and sunday torpenhow was disgusted as the weeks went by fruitless and then attacked him one sunday evening when dick felt utterly exhausted after three hours biting selfrestraint in maisies presence there was language and torpenhow withdrew to consult the nilghai who had come it to talk continental politics  boneidle is he careless and touched in the temper said the nilghai it isnt worth worrying over dick is probably playing the fool with a woman  isnt that bad enough  no she may throw him out of gear and knock his work to pieces for a while she may even turn up here some day and make a scene on the staircase one never knows but until dick speaks of his own accord you had better not touch him he is no easytempered man to handle  no i wish he were he is such an aggressive cocksure youbedamned fellow  hell get that knocked out of him in time he must learn that he cant storm up and down the world with a box of moist tubes and a slick brush  youre fond of him  id take any punishment thats in store for him if i could but the worst of it is no man can save his brother  no and the worser of it is there is no discharge in this war dick must learn his lesson like the rest of us talking of war therell be trouble in the balkans in the spring  that trouble is long coming i wonder if we could drag dick out there when it comes off  dick entered the room soon afterwards and the question was put to him  not good enough he said shortly im too comfy where i am  surely you arent taking all the stuff in the papers seriously said the nilghai your vogue will be ended in less than six monthsthe public will know your touch and go on to something newand where will you be then  here in england  when you might be doing decent work among us out there nonsense i shall go the keneu will be there torp will be there cassavetti will be there and the whole lot of us will be there and we shall have as much as ever we can do with unlimited fighting and the chance for you of seeing things that would make the reputation of three verestchagins  um said dick pulling at his pipe  you prefer to stay here and imagine that all the world is gaping at your pictures just think how full an average mans life is of his own pursuits and pleasures when twenty thousand of him find time to look up between mouthfuls and grunt something about something they arent the least interested in the net result is called fame reputation or notoriety according to the taste and fancy of the speller my lord  i know that as well as you do give me credit for a little gumption  be hanged if i do  be hanged then you probably will befor a spy by excited turks heighho im weary dead weary and virtue has gone out of me dick dropped into a chair and was fast asleep in a minute  thats a bad sign said the nilghai in an undertone  torpenhow picked the pipe from the waistcoat where it was beginning to burn and put a pillow behind the head we cant help we cant help he said its a good ugly sort of old cocoanut and im fond of it theres the scar of the wipe he got when he was cut over in the square  shouldnt wonder if that has made him a trifle mad  i should hes a most businesslike madman  then dick began to snore furiously  oh here no affection can stand this sort of thing wake up dick and go and sleep somewhere else if you intend to make a noise about it  when a cat has been out on the tiles all night said the nilghai in his beard i notice that she usually sleeps all day this is natural history  dick staggered away rubbing his eyes and yawning in the nightwatches he was overtaken with an idea so simple and so luminous that he wondered he had never conceived it before it was full of craft he would seek maisie on a weekday would suggest an excursion and would take her by train to fort keeling over the very ground that they two had trodden together ten years ago  as a general rule he explained to his chinlathered reflection in the morning it isnt safe to cross an old trail twice things remind one of things and a cold wind gets up and you feel sad but this is an exception to every rule that ever was ill go to maisie at once  fortunately the redhaired girl was out shopping when he arrived and maisie in a paintspattered blouse was warring with her canvas she was not pleased to see him for weekday visits were a stretch of the bond and it needed all his courage to explain his errand  i know youve been working too hard he concluded with an air of authority if you do that youll break down you had much better come  where said maisie wearily she had been standing before her easel too long and was very tired  anywhere you please well take a train tomorrow and see where it stops well have lunch somewhere and ill bring you back in the evening  if theres a good working light tomorrow i lose a day maisie balanced the heavy white chestnut palette irresolutely  dick bit back an oath that was hurrying to his lips he had not yet learned patience with the maiden to whom her work was all in all  youll lose ever so many more dear if you use every hour of working light overworks only murderous idleness dont be unreasonable ill call for you tomorrow after breakfast early  but surely you are going to ask  no i am not i want you and nobody else besides she hates me as much as i hate her she wont care to come tomorrow then and pray that we get sunshine  dick went away delighted and by consequence did no work whatever  he strangled a wild desire to order a special train but bought a great gray kangaroo cloak lined with glossy black marten and then retired into himself to consider things  im going out for the day tomorrow with dick said maisie to the redhaired girl when the latter returned tired from marketing in the edgware road  he deserves it i shall have the studio floor thoroughly scrubbed while youre away its very dirty  maisie had enjoyed no sort of holiday for months and looked forward to the little excitement but not without misgivings  theres nobody nicer than dick when he talks sensibly she thought but im sure hell be silly and worry me and im sure i cant tell him anything hed like to hear if hed only be sensible i should like him so much better  dicks eyes were full of joy when he made his appearance next morning and saw maisie grayulstered and blackvelvethatted standing in the hallway palaces of marble and not sordid imitation of grained wood were surely the fittest background for such a divinity the redhaired girl drew her into the studio for a moment and kissed her hurriedly  maisies eyebrows climbed to the top of her forehead she was altogether unused to these demonstrations mind my hat she said hurrying away and ran down the steps to dick waiting by the hansom  are you quite warm enough are you sure you wouldnt like some more breakfast put the cloak over your knees  im quite comfy thanks where are we going dick oh do stop singing like that people will think were mad  let em thinkif the exertion doesnt kill them they dont know who we are and im sure i dont care who they are my faith maisie youre looking lovely  maisie stared directly in front of her and did not reply the wind of a keen clear winter morning had put colour into her cheeks overhead the creamy yellow smokeclouds were thinning away one by one against a paleblue sky and the improvident sparrows broke off from waterspout committees and cabrank cabals to clamour of the coming of spring  it will be lovely weather in the country said dick  but where are we going  wait and see  the stopped at victoria and dick sought tickets for less than half the fraction of an instant it occurred to maisie comfortably settled by the waitingroom fire that it was much more pleasant to send a man to the booking office than to elbow ones own way through the crowd  dick put her into a pullmansolely on account of the warmth there and she regarded the extravagance with grave scandalised eyes as the train moved out into the country  i wish i knew where we are going she repeated for the twentieth time  the name of a wellremembered station flashed by towards the end of the run and maisie was delighted  oh dick you villain  well i thought you might like to see the place again you havent been here since the old times have you  no i never cared to see mrs jennett again and she was all that was ever there  not quite look out a minute theres the windmill above the potatofields they havent built villas there yet dyou remember when i shut you up in it  yes how she beat you for it i never told it was you  she guessed i jammed a stick under the door and told you that i was burying amomma alive in the potatoes and you believed me you had a trusting nature in those days  they laughed and leaned to look out identifying ancient landmarks with many reminiscences dick fixed his weather eye on the curve of maisies cheek very near his own and watched the blood rise under the clear skin he congratulated himself upon his cunning and looked that the evening would bring him a great reward  when the train stopped they went out to look at an old town with new eyes first but from a distance they regarded the house of mrs jennett  suppose she should come out now what would you do said dick with mock terror  i should make a face  show then said dick dropping into the speech of childhood  maisie made that face in the direction of the mean little villa and dick laughed  this is disgraceful said maisie mimicking mrs jennetts tone maisie you run in at once and learn the collect gospel and epistle for the next three sundays after all ive taught you too and three helps every sunday at dinner dicks always leading you into mischief if you arent a gentleman dick you might at least   the sentence ended abruptly maisie remembered when it had last been used  try to behave like one said dick promptly quite right now well get some lunch and go on to fort keelingunless youd rather drive there  we must walk out of respect to the place how little changed it all is  they turned in the direction of the sea through unaltered streets and the influence of old things lay upon them presently they passed a confectioners shop much considered in the days when their joint pocketmoney amounted to a shilling a week  dick have you any pennies said maisie half to herself  only three and if you think youre going to have two of em to buy peppermints with youre wrong she says peppermints arent ladylike  again they laughed and again the colour came into maisies cheeks as the blood boiled through dicks heart after a large lunch they went down to the beach and to fort keeling across the waste windbitten land that no builder had thought it worth his while to defile the winter breeze came in from the sea and sang about their ears  maisie said dick your nose is getting a crude prussian blue at the tip ill race you as far as you please for as much as you please  she looked round cautiously and with a laugh set off swiftly as the ulster allowed till she was out of breath  we used to run miles she panted its absurd that we cant run now  old age dear this it is to get fat and sleek in town when i wished to pull your hair you generally ran for three miles shrieking at the top of your voice i ought to know because those shrieks of yours were meant to call up mrs jennett with a cane and  dick i never got you a beating on purpose in my life  no of course you never did good heavens look at the sea  why its the same as ever said maisie  torpenhow had gathered from mr beeton that dick properly dressed and shaved had left the house at halfpast eight in the morning with a travellingrug over his arm the nilghai rolled in at midday for chess and polite conversation  its worse than anything i imagined said torpenhow  oh the everlasting dick i suppose you fuss over him like a hen with one chick let him run riot if he thinks itll amuse him you can  whip a young pup off feather but you cant whip a young man  it isnt a woman its one woman and its a girl  wheres your proof  he got up and went out at eight this morninggot up in the middle of the night by jove a thing he never does except when hes on service even then remember we had to kick him out of his blankets before the fight began at el maghrib its disgusting  it looks odd but maybe hes decided to buy a horse at last he might get up for that mightnt he  buy a blazing wheelbarrow hed have told us if there was a horse in the wind its a girl  dont be certain perhaps its only a married woman  dick has some sense of humour if you havent who gets up in the gray dawn to call on another mans wife its a girl  let it be a girl then she may teach him that theres somebody else in the world besides himself  shell spoil his hand shell waste his time and shell marry him and ruin his work for ever hell be a respectable married man before we can stop him andhell ever go on the long trail again  all quite possible but the earth wont spin the other way when that happens    no ho id give something to see dick go wooing with the boys dont worry about it these things be with allah and we can only look on get the chessmen  the redhaired girl was lying down in her own room staring at the ceiling the footsteps of people on the pavement sounded as they grew indistinct in the distance like a manytimesrepeated kiss that was all one long kiss her hands were by her side and they opened and shut savagely from time to time  the charwoman in charge of the scrubbing of the studio knocked at her door beg y pardon miss but in cleanin of a floor theres two not to say three kind of soap which is yaller an mottled an disinfectink now jist before i took my pail into the passage i though it would be preaps jest as well if i was to come up ere an ask you what sort of soap you was wishful that i should use on them boards the yaller soap miss  there was nothing in the speech to have caused the paroxysm of fury that drove the redhaired girl into the middle of the room almost shoutingdo you suppose i care what you use any kind will doany kind  the woman fled and the redhaired girl looked at her own reflection in the glass for an instant and covered her face with her hands it was as though she had shouted some shameless secret aloud  chapter vii  roses red and roses white plucked i for my loves delight  she would none of all my posies bade me gather her blue roses  half the world i wandered through seeking where such flowers grew half the world unto my quest answered but with laugh and jest  it may be beyond the grave she shall find what she would have  mine was but an idle quest roses white and red are best     blue roses  indeed the sea had not changed its waters were low on the mudbanks and the marazion bellbuoy clanked and swung in the tideway on the white beachsand dried stumps of seapoppy shivered and chattered  i dont see the old breakwater said maisie under her breath  lets be thankful that we have as much as we have i dont believe theyve mounted a single new gun on the fort since we were here come and look  they came to the glacis of fort keeling and sat down in a nook sheltered from the wind under the tarred throat of a fortypounder cannon  now if ammoma were only here said maisie  for a long time both were silent then dick took maisies hand and called her by her name  she shook her head and looked out to sea  maisie darling doesnt it make any difference  no between clenched teeth idid tell you if it did but it doesnt oh dick please be sensible  dont you think that it ever will  no im sure it wont  why  maisie rested her chin on her hand and still regarding the sea spoke hurriedlyi know what you want perfectly well but i cant give it to you dick it isnt my fault indeed it isnt if i felt that i could care for any onebut i dont feel that i care i simply dont understand what the feeling means  is that true dear  youve been very good to me dickie and the only way i can pay you back is by speaking the truth i darent tell a fib i despise myself quite enough as it is  what in the world for  becausebecause i take everything that you give me and i give you nothing in return its mean and selfish of me and whenever i think of it it worries me  understand once for all then that i can manage my own affairs and if i choose to do anything you arent to blame you havent a single thing to reproach yourself with darling  yes i have and talking only makes it worse  then dont talk about it  how can i help myself if you find me alone for a minute you are always talking about it and when you arent you look it you dont know how i despise myself sometimes  great goodness said dick nearly jumping to his feet speak the truth now maisie if you never speak it again do idoes this worrying bore you  no it does not  youd tell me if it did  i should let you know i think  thank you the other thing is fatal but you must learn to forgive a man when hes in love hes always a nuisance you must have known that  maisie did not consider the last question worth answering and dick was forced to repeat it  there were other men of course they always worried just when i was in the middle of my work and wanted me to listen to them  did you listen  at first and they couldnt understand why i didnt care and they used to praise my pictures and i thought they meant it i used to be proud of the praise and tell kami andi shall never forgetonce kami laughed at me  you dont like being laughed at maisie do you  i hate it i never laugh at other people unlessunless they do bad work dick tell me honestly what you think of my pictures generallyof everything of mine that youve seen  honest honest and honest over quoted dick from a catchword of long ago tell me what kami always says  maisie hesitated hehe says that there is feeling in them  how dare you tell me a fib like that remember i was under kami for two years i know exactly what he says  it isnt a fib  its worse its a halftruth kami says when he puts his head on one side so il y a du sentiment mais il ny a pas de parti pris he rolled the r threateningly as kami used to do  yes that is what he says and im beginning to think that he is right  certainly he is dick admitted that two people in the world could do and say no wrong kami was the man  and now you say the same thing its so disheartening  im sorry but you asked me to speak the truth besides i love you too much to pretend about your work its strong its patient sometimesnot always and sometimes theres power in it but theres no special reason why it should be done at all at least thats how it strikes me  theres no special reason why anything in the world should ever be done you know that as well as i do i only want success  youre going the wrong way to get it then hasnt kami ever told you so  dont quote kami to me i want to know what you think my works bad to begin with  i didnt say that and i dont think it  its amateurish then  that it most certainly is not youre a workwoman darling to your boot heels and i respect you for that  you dont laugh at me behind my back  no dear you see you are more to me than any one else put this cloak thing round you or youll get chilled  maisie wrapped herself in the soft marten skins turning the gray kangaroo fur to the outside this is delicious she said rubbing her chin thoughtfully along the fur  well why am i wrong in trying to get a little success  just because you try dont you understand darling good work has nothing to do withdoesnt belong tothe person who does it its put into him or her from outside  but how does that affect  wait a minute all we can do is to learn how to do our work to be masters of our materials instead of servants and never to be afraid of anything  i understand that  everything else comes from outside ourselves very good if we sit down quietly to work out notions that are sent to us we may or we may not do something that isnt bad a great deal depends on being master of the bricks and mortar of the trade but the instant we begin to think about success and the effect of our workto play with one eye on the gallerywe lose power and touch and everything else at least thats how i have found it instead of being quiet and giving every power you possess to your work youre fretting over something which you can neither help no hinder by a minute see  its so easy for you to talk in that way people like what you do dont you ever think about the gallery  much too often but im always punished for it by loss of power its as simple as the rule of three if we make light of our work by using it for our own ends our work will make light of us and as were the weaker we shall suffer  i dont treat my work lightly you know that its everything to me  of course but whether you realise it or not you give two strokes for yourself to one for your work it isnt your fault darling i do exactly the same thing and know that im doing it most of the french schools and all the schools here drive the students to work for their own credit and for the sake of their pride i was told that all the world was interested in my work and everybody at kamis talked turpentine and i honestly believed that the world needed elevating and influencing and all manner of impertinences by my brushes by jove i actually believed that when my little head was bursting with a notion that i couldnt handle because i hadnt sufficient knowledge of my craft i used to run about wondering at my own magnificence and getting ready to astonish the world  but surely one can do that sometimes  very seldom with malice aforethought darling and when its done its such a tiny thing and the worlds so big and all but a millionth part of it doesnt care maisie come with me and ill show you something of the size of the world one can no more avoid working than eatingthat goes on by itselfbut try to see what you are working for i know such little heavens that i could take you toislands tucked away under the line you sight them after weeks of crashing through water as black as black marble because its so deep and you sit in the forechains day after day and see the sun rise almost afraid because the seas so lonely  who is afraidyou or the sun  the sun of course and there are noises under the sea and sounds overhead in a clear sky then you find your island alive with hot moist orchids that make mouths at you and can do everything except talk  theres a waterfall in it three hundred feet high just like a sliver of green jade laced with silver and millions of wild bees live up in the rocks and you can hear the fat cocoanuts falling from the palms and you order an ivorywhite servant to sling you a long yellow hammock with tassels on it like ripe maize and you put up your feet and hear the bees hum and the water fall till you go to sleep  can one work there  certainly one must do something always you hang your canvas up in a palm tree and let the parrots criticise when the scuffle you heave a ripe custard apple at them and it bursts in a lather of cream there are hundreds of places come and see them  i dont quite like that place it sounds lazy tell me another  what do you think of a big red dead city built of red sandstone with raw green aloes growing between the stones lying out neglected on honeycoloured sands there are forty dead kings there maisie each in a gorgeous tomb finer than all the others you look at the palaces and streets and shops and tanks and think that men must live there till you find a wee gray squirrel rubbing its nose all alone in the marketplace and a jewelled peacock struts out of a carved doorway and spreads its tail against a marble screen as fine pierced as pointlace then a monkeya little black monkeywalks through the main square to get a drink from a tank forty feet deep he slides down the creepers to the waters edge and a friend holds him by the tail in case he should fall in  is that all true  i have been there and seen then evening comes and the lights change till its just as though you stood in the heart of a kingopal a little before sundown as punctually as clockwork a big bristly wild boar with all his family following trots through the city gate churning the foam on his tusks you climb on the shoulder of a blind black stone god and watch that pig choose himself a palace for the night and stump in wagging his tail then the night wind gets up and the sands move and you hear the desert outside the city singing now i lay me down to sleep and everything is dark till the moon rises maisie darling come with me and see what the world is really like its very lovely and its very horriblebut i wont let you see anything horridand it doesnt care your life or mine for pictures or anything else except doing its own work and making love come and ill show you how to brew sangaree and sling a hammock andoh thousands of things and youll see for yourself what colour means and well find out together what love means and then maybe we shall be allowed to do some good work come away  why said maisie  how can you do anything until you have seen everything or as much as you can and besides darling i love you come along with me you have no business here you dont belong to this place youre half a gipsyyour face tells that and ieven the smell of open water makes me restless come across the sea and be happy  he had risen to his feet and stood in the shadow of the gun looking down at the girl the very short winter afternoon had worn away and before they knew the winter moon was walking the untroubled sea long ruled lines of silver showed where a ripple of the rising tide was turning over the mudbanks the wind had dropped and in the intense stillness they could hear a donkey cropping the frosty grass many yards away a faint beating like that of a muffled drum came out of the moonhaze  whats that said maisie quickly it sounds like a heart beating where is it  dick was so angry at this sudden wrench to his pleadings that he could not trust himself to speak and in this silence caught the sound maisie from her seat under the gun watched him with a certain amount of fear  she wished so much that he would be sensible and cease to worry her with over sea emotion that she both could and could not understand she was not prepared however for the change in his face as he listened  its a steamer he saida twinscrew steamer by the beat i  cant make her out but she must be standing very close inshore ah as the red of a rocket streaked the haze shes standing in to signal before she clears the channel  is it a wreck said maisie to whom these words were as greek  dicks eyes were turned to the sea wreck what nonsense shes only reporting herself red rocket forwardtheres a green light aft now and two red rockets from the bridge  what does that mean  its the signal of the cross keys line running to australia i wonder which steamer it is the note of his voice had changed he seemed to be talking to himself and maisie did not approve of it the moonlight broke the haze for a moment touching the black sides of a long steamer working down channel four masts and three funnelsshes in deep draught too that must be the barralong or the bhutia no the bhutia has a clipper bow its the barralong to australia shell lift the southern cross in a weeklucky old tuboh lucky old tub  he stared intently and moved up the slope of the fort to get a better view but the mist on the sea thickened again and the beating of the screws grew fainter maisie called to him a little angrily and he returned still keeping his eyes to seaward have you ever seen the southern cross blazing right over your head he asked its superb  no she said shortly and i dont want to if you think its so lovely why dont you go and see it yourself  she raised her face from the soft blackness of the marten skins about her throat and her eyes shone like diamonds the moonlight on the gray kangaroo fur turned it to frosted silver of the coldest  by jove maisie you look like a little heathen idol tucked up there the eyes showed that they did not appreciate the compliment im sorry he continued the southern cross isnt worth looking at unless someone helps you to see that steamers out of hearing  dick she said quietly suppose i were to come to you nowbe quiet a minutejust as i am and caring for you just as much as i do  not as a brother though you said you didntin the park  i never had a brother suppose i said take me to those places and in time perhaps i might really care for you what would you do  send you straight back to where you came from in a cab no i wouldnt id let you walk but you couldnt do it dear and i wouldnt run the risk youre worth waiting for till you can come without reservation  do you honestly believe that  i have a hazy sort of idea that i do has it never struck you in that light  yees i feel so wicked about it  wickeder than usual  you dont know all i think its almost too awful to tell  never mind you promised to tell me the truthat least  its so ungrateful of me butbut though i know you care for me and i like to have you with me idid even sacrifice you if that would bring me what i want  my poor little darling i know that state of mind it doesnt lead to good work  you arent angry remember i do despise myself  im not exactly flatteredi had guessed as much beforebut im not angry im sorry for you surely you ought to have left a littleness like that behind you years ago  youve no right to patronise me i only want what i have worked for so long it came to you without any trouble andand i dont think its fair  what can i do id give ten years of my life to get you what you want but i cant help you even i cant help  a murmur of dissent from maisie he went onand i know by what you have just said that youre on the wrong road to success it isnt got at by sacrificing other peopleive had that much knocked into me you must sacrifice yourself and live under orders and never think for yourself and never have real satisfaction in your work except just at the beginning when youre reaching out after a notion  how can you believe all that  theres no question of belief or disbelief thats the law and you take it or refuse it as you please i try to obey but i  cant and then my work turns bad on my hands under any circumstances remember fourfifths of everybodys work must be bad but the remnant is worth the trouble for its own sake  isnt it nice to get credit even for bad work  its much too nice butmay i tell you something it isnt a pretty tale but youre so like a man that i forget when im talking to you  tell me  once when i was out in the soudan i went over some ground that we had been fighting on for three days there were twelve hundred dead and we hadnt time to bury them  how ghastly  i had been at work on a big doublesheet sketch and i was wondering what people would think of it at home the sight of that field taught me a good deal it looked just like a bed of horrible toadstools in all colours andid never seen men in bulk go back to their beginnings before so i began to understand that men and women were only material to work with and that what they said or did was of no consequence see strictly speaking you might just as well put your ear down to the palette to catch what your colours are saying  dick thats disgraceful  wait a minute i said strictly speaking unfortunately everybody must be either a man or a woman  im glad you allow that much  in your case i dont you arent a woman but ordinary people maisie must behave and work as such thats what makes me so savage he hurled a pebble towards the sea as he spoke i know that it is outside my business to care what people say i can see that it spoils my output if i listen to em and yet confound it allanother pebble flew seawardi cant help purring when im rubbed the right way even when i can see on a mans forehead that he is lying his way through a clump of pretty speeches those lies make me happy and play the mischief with my hand  and when he doesnt say pretty things  then belovedestdick grinnedi forget that i am the steward of these gifts and i want to make that man love and appreciate my work with a thick stick its too humiliating altogether but i suppose even if one were an angel and painted humans altogether from outside one would lose in touch what one gained in grip  maisie laughed at the idea of dick as an angel  but you seem to think she said that everything nice spoils your hand  i dont think its the lawjust the same as it was at mrs jennetts everything that is nice does spoil your hand im glad you see so clearly  i dont like the view  nor i buthave got orders what can do are you strong enough to face it alone  i suppose i must  let me help darling we can hold each other very tight and try to walk straight we shall blunder horribly but it will be better than stumbling apart maisie cant you see reason  i dont think we should get on together we should be two of a trade so we should never agree  how i should like to meet the man who made that proverb he lived in a cave and ate raw bear i fancy id make him chew his own arrowheads well  i should be only half married to you i should worry and fuss about my work as i do now four days out of the seven im not fit to speak to  you talk as if no one else in the world had ever used a brush dyou suppose that i dont know the feeling of worry and bother and  cantgetatness youre lucky if you only have it four days out of the seven what difference would that make  a great dealif you had it too  yes but i could respect it another man might not he might laugh at you but theres no use talking about it if you can think in that way you cant care for meyet  the tide had nearly covered the mudbanks and twenty little ripples broke on the beach before maisie chose to speak  dick she said slowly i believe very much that you are better than i am  this doesnt seem to bear on the argumentbut in what way  i dont quite know but in what you said about work and things and then youre so patient yes youre better than i am  dick considered rapidly the murkiness of an average mans life there was nothing in the review to fill him with a sense of virtue he lifted the hem of the cloak to his lips  why said maisie making as though she had not noticed can you see things that i cant i dont believe what you believe but youre right i believe  if ive seen anything god knows i couldnt have seen it but for you and i know that i couldnt have said it except to you you seemed to make everything clear for a minute but i dont practice what i preach you would help me   there are only us two in the world for all purposes andand you like to have me with you  of course i do i wonder if you can realise how utterly lonely i am  darling i think i can  two years ago when i first took the little house i used to walk up and down the backgarden trying to cry i never can cry can you  its some time since i tried what was the trouble overwork  i dont know but i used to dream that i had broken down and had no money and was starving in london i thought about it all day and it frightened me oh how it frightened me  i know that fear its the most terrible of all it wakes me up in the night sometimes you oughtnt to know anything about it  how do you know  never mind is your three hundred a year safe  its in consols  very well if any one comes to you and recommends a better investmenteven if i should come to youdont you listen never shift the money for a minute and never lend a penny of iteven to the redhaired girl  dont scold me so im not likely to be foolish  the earth is full of men whod sell their souls for three hundred a year and women come and talk and borrow a fivepound note here and a tenpound note there and a woman has no conscience in a money debt stick to your money maisie for theres nothing more ghastly in the world than poverty in london its scared me by jove it put the fear into me and one oughtnt to be afraid of anything  to each man is appointed his particular dreadthe terror that if he does not fight against it must cow him even to the loss of his manhood dicks experience of the sordid misery of want had entered into the deeps of him and lest he might find virtue too easy that memory stood behind him tempting to shame when dealers came to buy his wares as the nilghai quaked against his will at the still green water of a lake or a milldam as torpenhow flinched before any white arm that could cut or stab and loathed himself for flinching dick feared the poverty he had once tasted half in jest his burden was heavier than the burdens of his companions  maisie watched the face working in the moonlight  youve plenty of pennies now she said soothingly  i shall never have enough he began with vicious emphasis then laughing i shall always be threepence short in my accounts  why threepence  i carried a mans bag once from liverpool street station to blackfriars bridge it was a sixpenny jobyou neednt laugh indeed it wasand i wanted the money desperately he only gave me threepence and he hadnt even the decency to pay in silver whatever money i make i shall never get that odd threepence out of the world  this was not language befitting the man who had preached of the sanctity of work it jarred on maisie who preferred her payment in applause which since all men desire it must be of the right she hunted for her little purse and gravely took out a threepenny bit  there it is she said ill pay you dickie and dont worry any more it isnt worth while are you paid  i am said the very human apostle of fair craft taking the coin im paid a thousand times and well close that account it shall live on my watchchain and youre an angel maisie  im very cramped and im feeling a little cold good gracious the cloak is all white and so is your moustache i never knew it was so chilly  a light frost lay white on the shoulder of dicks ulster he too had forgotten the state of the weather they laughed together and with that laugh ended all serious discourse  they ran inland across the waste to warm themselves then turned to look at the glory of the full tide under the moonlight and the intense black shadows of the furze bushes it was an additional joy to dick that maisie could see colour even as he saw itcould see the blue in the white of the mist the violet that is in gray palings and all things else as they arenot of one hue but a thousand and the moonlight came into maisies soul so that she usually reserved chattered of herself and of the things she took interest inof kami wisest of teachers and of the girls in the studioof the poles who will kill themselves with overwork if they are not checked of the french who talk at great length of much more than they will ever accomplish of the slovenly english who toil hopelessly and cannot understand that inclination does not imply power of the americans whose rasping voices in the hush of a hot afternoon strain tensedrawn nerves to breakingpoint and whose suppers lead to indigestion of tempestuous russians neither to hold nor to bind who tell the girls ghoststories till the girls shriek of stolid germans who come to learn one thing and having mastered that much stolidly go away and copy pictures for evermore dick listened enraptured because it was maisie who spoke he knew the old life  it hasnt changed much he said do they still steal colours at lunchtime  not steal attract is the word of course they do im goodi only attract ultramarine but there are students whod attract flakewhite  ive done it myself you cant help it when the palettes are hung up  every colour is common property once it runs downeven though you do start it with a drop of oil it teaches people not to waste their tubes  i should like to attract some of your colours dick perhaps i might catch your success with them  i mustnt say a bad word but i should like to what in the world which youve just missed a lovely chance of seeing does success or want of success or a threestoried success matter compared withno i wont open that question again its time to go back to town  im sorry dick but  youre much more interested in that than you are in me  i dont know i dont think i am  what will you give me if i tell you a sure shortcut to everything you want the trouble and the fuss and the tangle and all the rest will you promise to obey me  of course  in the first place you must never forget a meal because you happen to be at work you forgot your lunch twice last week said dick at a venture for he knew with whom he was dealing  no noonly once really  thats bad enough and you mustnt take a cup of tea and a biscuit in place of a regular dinner because dinner happens to be a trouble  youre making fun of me  i never was more in earnest in my life oh my love my love hasnt it dawned on you yet what you are to me heres the whole earth in a conspiracy to give you a chill or run over you or drench you to the skin or cheat you out of your money or let you die of overwork and underfeeding and i havent the mere right to look after you why i dont even know if you have sense enough to put on warm things when the weathers cold  dick youre the most awful boy to talk toreally how do you suppose i managed when you were away  i wasnt here and i didnt know but now im back id give everything i have for the right of telling you to come in out of the rain  your success too  this time it cost dick a severe struggle to refrain from bad words  as mrs jennett used to say youre a trial maisie youve been cooped up in the schools too long and you think every one is looking at you there arent twelve hundred people in the world who understand pictures the others pretend and dont care remember ive seen twelve hundred men dead in toadstoolbeds its only the voice of the tiniest little fraction of people that makes success the real world doesnt care a tinkersdoesnt care a bit for aught you or i know every man in the world may be arguing with a maisie of his own  poor maisie  poor dick i think do you believe while hes fighting for whats dearer than his life he wants to look at a picture and even if he did and if all the world did and a thousand million people rose up and shouted hymns to my honour and glory would that make up to me for the knowledge that you were out shopping in the edgware road on a rainy day without an umbrella now well go to the station  but you said on the beach persisted maisie with a certain fear  dick groaned aloud yes i know what i said my work is everything i have or am or hope to be to me and i believe ive learnt the law that governs it but ive some lingering sense of fun leftthough youve nearly knocked it out of me i can just see that it isnt everything to all the world do what i say and not what i do  maisie was careful not to reopen debatable matters and they returned to london joyously the terminus stopped dick in the midst of an eloquent harangue on the beauties of exercise he would buy maisie a horsesuch a horse as never yet bowed head to bitwould stable it with a companion some twenty miles from london and maisie solely for her healths sake should ride with him twice or thrice a week  thats absurd said she it wouldnt be proper  now who in all london tonight would have sufficient interest or audacity to call us two to account for anything we chose to do  maisie looked at the lamps the fog and the hideous turmoil dick was right but horseflesh did not make for art as she understood it  youre very nice sometimes but youre very foolish more times im not going to let you give me horses or take you out of your way tonight ill go home by myself only i want you to promise me something you wont think any more about that extra threepence will you remember youve been paid and i wont allow you to be spiteful and do bad work for a little thing like that you can be so big that you mustnt be tiny  this was turning the tables with a vengeance there remained only to put maisie into her hansom  goodbye she said simply youll come on sunday it has been a beautiful day dick why cant it be like this always  because loves like linework you must go forward or backward you cant stand still by the way go on with your linework good night and for my for my sake take care of yourself  he turned to walk home meditating the day had brought him nothing that he hoped for butsurely this was worth many daysit had brought him nearer to maisie the end was only a question of time now and the prize well worth the waiting by instinct once more he turned to the river  and she understood at once he said looking at the water she found out my pet besetting sin on the spot and paid it off my god how she understood and she said i was better than she was better than she was he laughed at the absurdity of the notion i wonder if girls guess at onehalf a mans life they  cant orthey wouldnt marry us he took her gift out of his pocket and considered it in the light of a miracle and a pledge of the comprehension that one day would lead to perfect happiness meantime maisie was alone in london with none to save her from danger and the packed wilderness was very full of danger  dick made his prayer to fate disjointedly after the manner of the heathen as he threw the piece of silver into the river if any evil were to befal let him bear the burden and let maisie go unscathed since the threepenny piece was dearest to him of all his possessions it was a small coin in itself but maisie had given it and the thames held it and surely the fates would be bribed for this once  the drowning of the coin seemed to cut him free from thought of maisie for the moment he took himself off the bridge and went whistling to his chambers with a strong yearning for some mantalk and tobacco after his first experience of an entire day spent in the society of a woman there was a stronger desire at his heart when there rose before him an unsolicited vision of the barralong dipping deep and sailing free for the southern cross  chapter viii   and these two as i have told you  were the friends of hiawatha  chibiabos the musician  and the very strong man kwasind           hiawatha  torpenhow was paging the last sheets of some manuscript while the nilghai who had come for chess and remained to talk tactics was reading through the first part commenting scornfully the while  its picturesque enough and its sketchy said he but as a serious consideration of affairs in eastern europe its not worth much  its off my hands at any rate    thirtyseven thirtyeight thirtynine slips altogether arent there that should make between eleven and twelve pages of valuable misinformation heighho torpenhow shuffled the writing together and hummed  young lambs to sell young lambs to sell  if id as much money as i could tell  i never would cry young lambs to sell  dick entered selfconscious and a little defiant but in the best of tempers with all the world  back at last said torpenhow  more or less what have you been doing  work dickie you behave as though the bank of england were behind you heres sunday monday and tuesday gone and you havent done a line its scandalous  the notions come and go my childrenthey come and go like our baccy he answered filling his pipe moreover he stooped to thrust a spill into the grate apollo does not always stretch hisoh confound your clumsy jests nilghai  this is not the place to preach the theory of direct inspiration said the nilghai returning torpenhows large and workmanlike bellows to their nail on the wall we believe in cobblers wax lawhere you sit down  if you werent so big and fat said dick looking round for a weapon id   no skylarking in my rooms you two smashed half my furniture last time you threw the cushions about you might have the decency to say how dyou do to binkie look at him  binkie had jumped down from the sofa and was fawning round dicks knee and scratching at his boots  dear man said dick snatching him up and kissing him on the black patch above his right eye did ums was binks did that ugly nilghai turn you off the sofa bite him mr binkie he pitched him on the nilghais stomach as the big man lay at ease and binkie pretended to destroy the nilghai inch by inch till a sofa cushion extinguished him and panting he stuck out his tongue at the company  the binkieboy went for a walk this morning before you were up torp i saw him making love to the butcher at the corner when the shutters were being taken downjust as if he hadnt enough to eat in his own proper house said dick  binks is that a true bill said torpenhow severely the little dog retreated under the sofa cushion and showed by the fat white back of him that he really had no further interest in the discussion  strikes me that another disreputable dog went for a walk too said the nilghai what made you get up so early torp said you might be buying a horse  he knows it would need three of us for a serious business like that no i felt lonesome and unhappy so i went out to look at the sea and watch the pretty ships go by  where did you go  somewhere on the channel progly or snigly or some wateringplace was its name ive forgotten but it was only two hours run from london and the ships went by  did you see anything you knew  only the barralong outwards to australia and an odessa grainboat loaded down by the head it was a thick day but the sea smelt good  wherefore put on ones best trousers to see the barralong said torpenhow pointing  because ive nothing except these things and my painting duds besides i wanted to do honour to the sea  did she make you feel restless asked the nilghai keenly  crazy dont speak of it im sorry i went  torpenhow and the nilghai exchanged a look as dick stooping busied himself among the formers boots and trees  these will do he said at last i cant say i think much of your taste in slippers but the fits the thing he slipped his feet into a pair of sock like sambhurskin foot coverings found a long chair and lay at length  theyre my own pet pair torpenhow said i was just going to put them on myself  all your reprehensible selfishness just because you see me happy for a minute you want to worry me and stir me up find another pair  good for you that dick cant wear your clothes torp you two live communistically said the nilghai  dick never has anything that i can wear hes only useful to sponge upon  confound you have you been rummaging round among my clothes then said dick i put a sovereign in the tobaccojar yesterday how do you expect a man to keep his accounts properly if you  here the nilghai began to laugh and torpenhow joined him  hid a sovereign yesterday youre no sort of financier you lent me a fiver about a month back do you remember torpenhow said  yes of course  do you remember that i paid it you ten days later and you put it at the bottom of the tobacco  by jove did i i thought it was in one of my colourboxes  you thought about a week ago i went into your studio to get some baccy and found it  what did you do with it  took the nilghai to a theatre and fed him  you couldnt feed the nilghai under twice the moneynot though you gave him army beef well i suppose i should have found it out sooner or later what is there to laugh at  youre a most amazing cuckoo in many directions said the nilghai still chuckling over the thought of the dinner never mind we had both been working very hard and it was your unearned increment we spent and as youre only a loafer it didnt matter  thats pleasantfrom the man who is bursting with my meat too ill get that dinner back one of these days suppose we go to a theatre now  put our boots onand dressand wash the nilghai spoke very lazily  i withdraw the motion  suppose just for a changeas a startling variety you knowwe that is to say we get our charcoal and our canvas and go on with our work  torpenhow spoke pointedly but dick only wriggled his toes inside the soft leather moccasins  what a oneideaed clucker that is if i had any unfinished figures on hand i havent any model if i had my model i havent any spray and i never leave charcoal unfixed overnight and if i had my spray and twenty photographs of backgrounds i couldnt do anything tonight i dont feel that way  binkiedog hes a lazy hog isnt he said the nilghai  very good i will do some work said dick rising swiftly ill fetch the nungapunga book and well add another picture to the nilghai saga  arent you worrying him a little too much asked the nilghai when dick had left the room  perhaps but i know what he can turn out if he likes it makes me savage to hear him praised for past work when i know what he ought to do you and i are arranged for  by kismet and our own powers mores the pity i have dreamed of a good deal  so have i but we know our limitations now im dashed if i know what dicks may be when he gives himself to his work thats what makes me so keen about him  and when alls said and done you will be put asidequite rightlyfor a female girl  i wonder    where do you think he has been today  to the sea didnt you see the look in his eyes when he talked about her hes as restless as a swallow in autumn  yes but did he go alone  i dont know and i dont care but he has the beginnings of the gofever upon him he wants to upstakes and move out theres no mistaking the signs whatever he may have said before he has the call upon him now  it might be his salvation torpenhow said  perhapsif you care to take the responsibility of being a saviour  dick returned with the big clasped sketchbook that the nilghai knew well and did not love too much in it dick had drawn all manner of moving incidents experienced by himself or related to him by the others of all the four corners of the earth but the wider range of the nilghais body and life attracted him most when truth failed he fell back on fiction of the wildest and represented incidents in the nilghais career that were unseemlyhis marriages with many african princesses his shameless betrayal for arab wives of an army corps to the mahdi his tattooment by skilled operators in burmah his interview and his fears with the yellow headsman in the bloodstained executionground of canton and finally the passings of his spirit into the bodies of whales elephants and toucans torpenhow from time to time had added rhymed descriptions and the whole was a curious piece of art because dick decided having regard to the name of the book which being interpreted means naked that it would be wrong to draw the nilghai with any clothes on under any circumstances consequently the last sketch representing that muchenduring man calling on the war office to press his claims to the egyptian medal was hardly delicate he settled himself comfortably on torpenhows table and turned over the pages  what a fortune you would have been to blake nilghai he said theres a succulent pinkness about some of these sketches thats more than lifelike the nilghai surrounded while bathing by the mahdiehthat was founded on fact eh  it was very nearly my last bath you irreverent dauber has binkie come into the saga yet  no the binkieboy hasnt done anything except eat and kill cats lets see here you are as a stainedglass saint in a church deuced decorative lines about your anatomy you ought to be grateful for being handed down to posterity in this way fifty years hence youll exist in rare and curious facsimiles at ten guineas each what shall i try this time the domestic life of the nilghai  hasnt got any  the undomestic life of the nilghai then of course massmeeting of his wives in trafalgar square thats it they came from the ends of the earth to attend nilghais wedding to an english bride this shall be an epic its a sweet material to work with  its a scandalous waste of time said torpenhow  dont worry it keeps ones hand inspecially when you begin without the pencil he set to work rapidly thats nelsons column presently the nilghai will appear shinning up it  give him some clothes this time  certainlya veil and an orangewreath because hes been married  gad thats clever enough said torpenhow over his shoulder as dick brought out of the paper with three twirls of the brush a very fat back and labouring shoulder pressed against stone  just imagine dick continued if we could publish a few of these dear little things every time the nilghai subsidises a man who can write to give the public an honest opinion of my pictures  well youll admit i always tell you when i have done anything of that kind i know i cant hammer you as you ought to be hammered so i give the job to another young maclagan for instance  nooone halfminute old man stick your hand out against the dark of the wallpaperyou only burble and call me names that left shoulders out of drawing i must literally throw a veil over that wheres my penknife well what about maclagan  i only gave him his ridingorders toto lambast you on general principles for not producing work that will last  whereupon that young fooldick threw back his head and shut one eye as he shifted the page under his handbeing left alone with an inkpot and what he conceived were his own notions went and spilt them both over me in the papers you might have engaged a grown man for the business nilghai how do you think the bridal veil looks now torp  how the deuce do three dabs and two scratches make the stuff stand away from the body as it does said torpenhow to whom dicks methods were always new  it just depends on where you put em if maclagan had know that much about his business he might have done better  why dont you put the damned dabs into something that will stay then insisted the nilghai who had really taken considerable trouble in hiring for dicks benefit the pen of a young gentleman who devoted most of his waking hours to an anxious consideration of the aims and ends of art which he wrote was one and indivisible  wait a minute till i see how i am going to manage my procession of wives you seem to have married extensively and i must rough em in with the pencil medes parthians edomites    now setting aside the weakness and the wickedness andand the fatheadedness of deliberately trying to do work that will live as they call it im content with the knowledge that ive done my best up to date and i shant do anything like it again for some hours at leastprobably years most probably never  what any stuff you have in stock your best work said torpenhow  anything youve sold said the nilghai  oh no it isnt here and it isnt sold better than that it cant be sold and i dont think any one knows where it is im sure i dont    and yet more and more wives on the north side of the square observe the virtuous horror of the lions  you may as well explain said torpenhow and dick lifted his head from the paper  the sea reminded me of it he said slowly i wish it hadnt it weighs some few thousand tonsunless you cut it out with a cold chisel  dont be an idiot you cant pose with us here said the nilghai  theres no pose in the matter at all its a fact i was loafing from lima to auckland in a big old condemned passengership turned into a cargoboat and owned by a secondhand italian firm she was a crazy basket we were cut down to fifteen ton of coal a day and we thought ourselves lucky when we kicked seven knots an hour out of her then we used to stop and let the bearings cool down and wonder whether the crack in the shaft was spreading  were you a steward or a stoker in those days  i was flush for the time being so i was a passenger or else i should have been a steward i think said dick with perfect gravity returning to the procession of angry wives i was the only other passenger from lima and the ship was half empty and full of rats and cockroaches and scorpions  but what has this to do with the picture  wait a minute she had been in the china passenger trade and her lower decks had bunks for two thousand pigtails those were all taken down and she was empty up to her nose and the lights came through the port holesmost annoying lights to work in till you got used to them i hadnt anything to do for weeks the ships charts were in pieces and our skipper darent run south for fear of catching a storm so he did his best to knock all the society islands out of the water one by one and i went into the lower deck and did my picture on the port side as far forward in her as i could go there was some brown paint and some green paint that they used for the boats and some black paint for ironwork and that was all i had  the passengers must have thought you mad  there was only one and it was a woman but it gave me the notion of my picture  what was she like said torpenhow  she was a sort of negroidjewesscuban with morals to match she couldnt read or write and she didnt want to but she used to come down and watch me paint and the skipper didnt like it because he was paying her passage and had to be on the bridge occasionally  i see that must have been cheerful  it was the best time i ever had to begin with we didnt know whether we should go up or go down any minute when there was a sea on and when it was calm it was paradise and the woman used to mix the paints and talk broken english and the skipper used to steal down every few minutes to the lower deck because he said he was afraid of fire so you see we could never tell when we might be caught and i had a splendid notion to work out in only three keys of colour  what was the notion  two lines in poe   neither the angels in heaven above nor the demons down under the sea  can ever dissever my soul from the soul of the beautiful annabel lee  it came out of the seaall by itself i drew that fight fought out in green water over the naked choking soul and the woman served as the model for the devils and the angels bothseadevils and seaangels and the soul half drowned between them it doesnt sound much but when there was a good light on the lower deck it looked very fine and creepy it was seven by fourteen feet all done in shifting light for shifting light  did the woman inspire you much said torpenhow  she and the sea between themimmensely there was a heap of bad drawing in that picture i remember i went out of my way to foreshorten for sheer delight of doing it and i foreshortened damnably but for all that its the best thing ive ever done and now i suppose the ships broken up or gone down whew what a time that was  what happened after all  it all ended they were loading her with wool when i left the ship but even the stevedores kept the picture clear to the last the eyes of the demons scared them i honestly believe  and the woman  she was scared too when it was finished she used to cross herself before she went down to look at it just three colours and no chance of getting any more and the sea outside and unlimited lovemaking inside and the fear of death atop of everything else o lord he had ceased to look at the sketch but was staring straight in front of him across the room  why dont you try something of the same kind now said the nilghai  because those things come not by fasting and prayer when i find a cargoboat and a jewesscuban and another notion and the same old life i may  you wont find them here said the nilghai  no i shall not dick shut the sketchbook with a bang this rooms as hot as an oven open the window some one  he leaned into the darkness watching the greater darkness of london below him the chambers stood much higher than the other houses commanding a hundred chimneyscrooked cowls that looked like sitting cats as they swung round and other uncouth brick and zinc mysteries supported by iron stanchions and clamped by 8pieces northward the lights of piccadilly circus and leicester square threw a coppercoloured glare above the black roofs and southward by all the orderly lights of the thames a train rolled out across one of the railway bridges and its thunder drowned for a minute the dull roar of the streets the nilghai looked at his watch and said shortly thats the paris nightmail you can book from here to st petersburg if you choose  dick crammed head and shoulders out of the window and looked across the river torpenhow came to his side while the nilghai passed over quietly to the piano and opened it binkie making himself as large as possible spread out upon the sofa with the air of one who is not to be lightly disturbed  well said the nilghai to the two pairs of shoulders have you never seen this place before  a steamtug on the river hooted as she towed her barges to wharf then the boom of the traffic came into the room torpenhow nudged dick  good place to bank inbad place to bunk in dickie isnt it  dicks chin was in his hand as he answered in the words of a general not without fame still looking out on the darknessmy god what a city to loot  binkie found the night air tickling his whiskers and sneezed plaintively  we shall give the binkiedog a cold said torpenhow come in and they withdrew their heads youll be buried in kensal green dick one of these days if it isnt closed by the time you want to go thereburied within two feet of some one else his wife and his family  allah forbid i shall get away before that time comes give a man room to stretch his legs mr binkie dick flung himself down on the sofa and tweaked binkies velvet ears yawning heavily the while  youll find that wardrobecase very much out of tune torpenhow said to the nilghai its never touched except by you  a piece of gross extravagance dick grunted the nilghai only comes when im out  thats because youre always out howl nilghai and let him hear  the life of the nilghai is fraud and slaughter his writings are watered dickens and water but the voice of the nilghai raised on high makes even the mahdieh glad to die  dick quoted from torpenhows letterpress in the nungapunga book  how do they call moose in canada nilghai  the man laughed singing was his one polite accomplishment as many presstents in faroff lands had known  what shall i sing said he turning in the chair  moll roe in the morning said torpenhow at a venture  no said dick sharply and the nilghai opened his eyes the old chanty whereof he among a very few possessed all the words was not a pretty one but dick had heard it many times before without wincing without prelude he launched into that stately tune that calls together and troubles the hearts of the gipsies of the sea  farewell and adieu to you spanish ladies farewell and adieu to you ladies of spain  dick turned uneasily on the sofa for he could hear the bows of the barralong crashing into the green seas on her way to the southern cross  then came the chorus  well rant and well roar like true british sailors well rant and well roar across the salt seas until we take soundings in the channel of old england from ushant to scilly tis fortyfive leagues  thirtyfivethirtyfive said dick petulantly dont tamper with holy writ go on nilghai  the first land we made it was called the deadman  and they sang to the end very vigourously  that would be a better song if her head were turned the other wayto the ushant light for instance said the nilghai  flinging his arms about like a mad windmill said torpenhow give us something else nilghai youre in fine foghorn form tonight  give us the ganges pilot you sang that in the square the night before el maghrib by the way i wonder how many of the chorus are alive tonight said dick  torpenhow considered for a minute by jove i believe only you and i raynor vicery and deenesall dead vincent caught smallpox in cairo carried it here and died of it yes only you and i and the nilghai  umph and yet the men here whove done their work in a wellwarmed studio all their lives with a policeman at each corner say that i charge too much for my pictures  they are buying your work not your insurance policies dear child said the nilghai  i gambled with one to get at the other dont preach go on with the pilot where in the world did you get that song  on a tombstone said the nilghai on a tombstone in a distant land i made it an accompaniment with heaps of base chords  oh vanity begin and the nilghai began  i have slipped my cable messmates im drifting down with the tide i have my sailing orders while yet at anchor ride and never on fair june morning have i put out to sea with clearer conscience or better hope or a heart more light and free  shoulder to shoulder joe my boy into the crowd like a wedge strike with the hangers messmates but do not cut with the edge cries charnock scatter the faggots double that brahmin in two the tall pale widow for me joe the little brown girl for you  young joe youre nearing sixty why is your hide so dark katie has soft fair blue eyes who blackened yourswhy hark  they were all singing now dick with the roar of the wind of the open sea about his ears as the deep bass voice let itself go  the morning gunho steady the arquebuses to me i ha sounded the dutch high admirals heart as my lead doth sound the sea  sounding sounding the ganges floating down with the tide moore me close to charnock next to my nutbrown bride my blessing to kate at fairlightholwell my thanks to you steady we steer for heaven through sanddrifts cold and blue  now what is there in that nonsense to make a man restless said dick hauling binkie from his feet to his chest  it depends on the man said torpenhow  the man who has been down to look at the sea said the nilghai  i didnt know she was going to upset me in this fashion  thats what men say when they go to say goodbye to a woman its more easy though to get rid of three women than a piece of ones life and surroundings  but a woman can be began dick unguardedly  a piece of ones life continued torpenhow no she cant his face darkened for a moment she says she wants to sympathise with you and help you in your work and everything else that clearly a man must do for himself then she sends round five notes a day to ask why the dickens you havent been wasting your time with her  dont generalise said the nilghai by the time you arrive at five notes a day you must have gone through a good deal and behaved accordingly shouldnt begin these things my son  i shouldnt have gone down to the sea said dick just a little anxious to change the conversation and you shouldnt have sung  the sea isnt sending you five notes a day said the nilghai  no but im fatally compromised shes an enduring old hag and im sorry i ever met her why wasnt i born and bred and dead in a threepair back  hear him blaspheming his first love why in the world shouldnt you listen to her said torpenhow  before dick could reply the nilghai lifted up his voice with a shout that shook the windows in the men of the sea that begins as all know the sea is a wicked old woman and after wading through eight lines whose imagery is truthful ends in a refrain slow as the clacking of a capstan when the boat comes unwillingly up to the bars where the men sweat and tramp in the shingle  ye that bore us o restore us she is kinder than ye for the call is on our heartstrings said the men of the sea  the nilghai sang that verse twice with simple cunning intending that dick should hear but dick was waiting for the farewell of the men to their wives  ye that love us can ye move us she is dearer than ye and your sleep will be the sweeter said the men of the sea  the rough words beat like the blows of the waves on the bows of the rickety boat from lima in the days when dick was mixing paints making love drawing devils and angels in the half dark and wondering whether the next minute would put the italian captains knife between his shoulderblades and the gofever which is more real than many doctors diseases waked and raged urging him who loved maisie beyond anything in the world to go away and taste the old hot unregenerate life againto scuffle swear gamble and love light loves with his fellows to take ship and know the sea once more and by her beget pictures to talk to binat among the sands of port said while yellow tina mixed the drinks to hear the crackle of musketry and see the smoke roll outward thin and thicken again till the shining black faces came through and in that hell every man was strictly responsible for his own head and his own alone and struck with an unfettered arm it was impossible utterly impossible but  oh our fathers in the churchyard she is older than ye and our graves will be the greener said the men of the sea  what is there to hinder said torpenhow in the long hush that followed the song  you said a little time since that you wouldnt come for a walk round the world torp  that was months ago and i only objected to your making money for travelling expenses youve shot your bolt here and it has gone home go away and do some work and see some things  get some of the fat off you youre disgracefully out of condition said the nilghai making a plunge from the chair and grasping a handful of dick generally over the right ribs soft as puttypure tallow born of over feeding train it off dickie  were all equally gross nilghai next time you have to take the field youll sit down wink your eyes gasp and die in a fit  never mind you go away on a ship go to lima again or to brazil theres always trouble in south america  do you suppose i want to be told where to go great heavens the only difficulty is to know where im to stop but i shall stay here as i told you before  then youll be buried in kensal green and turn into adipocere with the others said torpenhow are you thinking of commissions in hand pay forfeit and go youve money enough to travel as a king if you please  youve the grisliest notions of amusement torp i think i see myself shipping first class on a sixthousandton hotel and asking the third engineer what makes the engines go round and whether it isnt very warm in the stokehold ho ho i should ship as a loafer if ever i shipped at all which im not going to do i shall compromise and go for a small trip to begin with  thats something at any rate where will you go said torpenhow it would do you all the good in the world old man  the nilghai saw the twinkle in dicks eye and refrained from speech  i shall go in the first place to rathrays stable where i shall hire one horse and take him very carefully as far as richmond hill then i shall walk him back again in case he should accidentally burst into a lather and make rathray angry i shall do that tomorrow for the sake of air and exercise  bah dick had barely time to throw up his arm and ward off the cushion that the disgusted torpenhow heaved at his head  air and exercise indeed said the nilghai sitting down heavily on dick  lets give him a little of both get the bellows torp  at this point the conference broke up in disorder because dick would not open his mouth till the nilghai held his nose fast and there was some trouble in forcing the nozzle of the bellows between his teeth and even when it was there he weakly tried to puff against the force of the blast and his cheeks blew up with a great explosion and the enemy becoming helpless with laughter he so beat them over the head with a soft sofa cushion that became unsewn and distributed its feathers and binkie interfering in torpenhows interests was bundled into the halfempty bag and advised to scratch his way out which he did after a while travelling rapidly up and down the floor in the shape of an agitated green haggis and when he came out looking for satisfaction the three pillars of his world were picking feathers out of their hair  a prophet has no honour in his own country said dick ruefully dusting his knees this filthy fluff will never brush off my legs  it was all for your own good said the nilghai nothing like air and exercise  all for your good said torpenhow not in the least with reference to past clowning it would let you focus things at their proper worth and prevent your becoming slack in this hothouse of a town indeed it would old man i shouldnt have spoken if i hadnt thought so only you make a joke of everything  before god i do no such thing said dick quickly and earnestly you dont know me if you think that  i dont think it said the nilghai  how can fellows like ourselves who know what life and death really mean dare to make a joke of anything i know we pretend it to save ourselves from breaking down or going to the other extreme cant i see old man how youre always anxious about me and try to advise me to make my work better do you suppose i dont think about that myself but you cant help meyou cant help menot even you i must play my own hand alone in my own way  hear hear from the nilghai  whats the one thing in the nilghai saga that ive never drawn in the nungapunga book dick continued to torpenhow who was a little astonished at the outburst  now there was one blank page in the book given over to the sketch that dick had not drawn of the crowning exploit in the nilghais life when that man being young and forgetting that his body and bones belonged to the paper that employed him had ridden over sunburned slippery grass in the rear of bredows brigade on the day that the troopers flung themselves at cauroberts artillery and for aught they knew twenty battalions in front to save the battered 24th german infantry to give time to decide the fate of vionville and to learn ere their remnant came back to flavigay that cavalry can attack and crumple and break unshaken infantry whenever he was inclined to think over a life that might have been better an income that might have been larger and a soul that might have been considerably cleaner the nilghai would comfort himself with the thought i rode with bredows brigade at vionville and take heart for any lesser battle the next day might bring  i know he said very gravely i was always glad that you left it out  i left it out because nilghai taught me what the germany army learned then and what schmidt taught their cavalry i dont know german  what is it take care of the time and the dressing will take care of itself i must ride my own line to my own beat old man  tempe ist richtung youve learned your lesson well said the nilghai  he must go alone he speaks truth torp  maybe im as wrong as i can behideously wrong i must find that out for myself as i have to think things out for myself but i darent turn my head to dress by the next man it hurts me a great deal more than you know not to be able to go but i cannot thats all i must do my own work and live my own life in my own way because im responsible for both  only dont think i frivol about it torp i have my own matches and sulphur and ill make my own hell thanks  there was an uncomfortable pause then torpenhow said blandly what did the governor of north carolina say to the governor of south carolina  excellent notion it is a long time between drinks there are the makings of a very fine prig in you dick said the nilghai  ive liberated my mind estimable binkie with the feathers in his mouth dick picked up the still indignant one and shook him tenderly youre tied up in a sack and made to run about blind binkiewee without any reason and it has hurt your little feelings never mind sic volo sic jubeo stet pro ratione voluntas and dont sneeze in my eye because i talk latin good night  he went out of the room  thats distinctly one for you said the nilghai i told you it was hopeless to meddle with him hes not pleased  hed swear at me if he werent i cant make it out he has the gofever upon him and he wont go i only hope that he maynt have to go some day when he doesnt want to said torpenhow        in his own room dick was settling a question with himselfand the question was whether all the world and all that was therein and a burning desire to exploit both was worth one threepenny piece thrown into the thames  it came of seeing the sea and im a cur to think about it he decided after all the honeymoon will be that tourwith reservations only    only i didnt realise that the sea was so strong i didnt feel it so much when i was with maisie these damnable songs did it hes beginning again  but it was only herricks nightpiece to julia that the nilghai sang and before it was ended dick reappeared on the threshold not altogether clothed indeed but in his right mind thirsty and at peace  the mood had come and gone with the rising and the falling of the tide by fort keeling   chapter ix   if i have taken the common clay  and wrought it cunningly  in the shape of a god that was digged a clod  the greater honour to me   if thou hast taken the common clay  and thy hands be not free  from the taint of the soil  thou hast made thy spoil  the greater shame to thee          the two potters  he did no work of any kind for the rest of the week then came another sunday he dreaded and longed for the day always but since the redhaired girl had sketched him there was rather more dread than desire in his mind  he found that maisie had entirely neglected his suggestions about linework she had gone off at score filed with some absurd notion for a fancy head it cost dick something to command his temper  whats the good of suggesting anything he said pointedly  ah but this will be a picturea real picture and i know that kami will let me send it to the salon you dont mind do you  i suppose not but you wont have time for the salon  maisie hesitated a little she even felt uncomfortable  were going over to france a month sooner because of it i shall get the idea sketched out here and work it up at kamis  dicks heart stood still and he came very near to being disgusted with his queen who could do no wrong just when i thought i had made some headway she goes off chasing butterflies its too maddening  there was no possibility of arguing for the redhaired girl was in the studio dick could only look unutterable reproach  im sorry he said and i think you make a mistake but whats the idea of your new picture  i took it from a book  thats bad to begin with books arent the places for pictures and  its this said the redhaired girl behind him i was reading it to maisie the other day from the city of dreadful night dyou know the book  a little i am sorry i spoke there are pictures in it what has taken her fancy  the description of the melancolia   her folded wings as of a mighty eagle  but all too impotent to lift the regal  robustness of her earthborn strength and pride  and here again maisie get the tea dear   the forehead charged with baleful thoughts and dreams  the household bunch of keys the housewifes gown  voluminous indented and yet rigid  as though a shell of burnished metal frigid  her feet thickshod to tread all weakness down  there was no attempt to conceal the scorn of the lazy voice dick winced  but that has been done already by an obscure artist by the name of durer said he how does the poem run   three centuries and threescore years ago  with phantasies of his peculiar thought  you might as well try to rewrite hamlet it will be a waste of time  no it wont said maisie putting down the teacups with a clatter to reassure herself and i mean to do it cant you see what a beautiful thing it would make  how in perdition can one do work when one hasnt had the proper training any fool can get a notion it needs training to drive the thing throughtraining and conviction not rushing after the first fancy dick spoke between his teeth  you dont understand said maisie i think i can do it  again the voice of the girl behind him  baffled and beaten back she works on still weary and sick of soul she works the more  sustained by her indomitable will the hands shall fashion and the brain shall pore and all her sorrow shall be turned to labour  i fancy maisie means to embody herself in the picture  sitting on a throne of rejected pictures no i shant dear the notion in itself has fascinated meof course you dont care for fancy heads dick i dont think you could do them you like blood and bones  thats a direct challenge if you can do a melancolia that isnt merely a sorrowful female head i can do a better one and i will too what dyou know about melacolias dick firmly believed that he was even then tasting three quarters of all the sorrow in the world  she was a woman said maisie and she suffered a great dealtill she could suffer no more then she began to laugh at it all and then i painted her and sent her to the salon  the redhaired girl rose up and left the room laughing  dick looked at maisie humbly and hopelessly  never mind about the picture he said are you really going back to kamis for a month before your time  i must if i want to get the picture done  and thats all you want  of course dont be stupid dick  you havent the power you have only the ideasthe ideas and the little cheap impulses how you could have kept at your work for ten years steadily is a mystery to me so you are really goinga month before you need  i must do my work  your workbah    no i didnt mean that its all right dear of course you must do your work andi think ill say goodbye for this week  wont you even stay for tea no thank you have i your leave to go dear theres nothing more you particularly want me to do and the linework doesnt matter  i wish you could stay and then we could talk over my picture if only one single pictures a success it draws attention to all the others i know some of my work is good if only people could see and you neednt have been so rude about it  im sorry well talk the melancolia over some one of the other sundays  there are four moreyes one two three fourbefore you go goodbye maisie  maisie stood by the studio window thinking till the redhaired girl returned a little white at the corners of her lips  dicks gone off said maisie just when i wanted to talk about the picture isnt it selfish of him  her companion opened her lips as if to speak shut them again and went on reading the city of dreadful night  dick was in the park walking round and round a tree that he had chosen as his confidante for many sundays past he was swearing audibly and when he found that the infirmities of the english tongue hemmed in his rage he sought consolation in arabic which is expressly designed for the use of the afflicted he was not pleased with the reward of his patient service nor was he pleased with himself and it was long before he arrived at the proposition that the queen could do no wrong  its a losing game he said im worth nothing when a whim of hers is in question but in a losing game at port said we used to double the stakes and go on she do a melancolia she hasnt the power or the insight or the training only the desire shes cursed with the curse of reuben she wont do linework because it means real work and yet shes stronger than i am ill make her understand that i can beat her on her own melancolia even then she wouldnt care she says i can only do blood and bones i dont believe she has blood in her veins all the same i lover her and i must go on loving her and if i can humble her inordinate vanity i will ill do a melancolia that shall be something like a melancolia  the melancolia that transcends all wit ill do it at once conbless her  he discovered that the notion would not come to order and that he could not free his mind for an hour from the thought of maisies departure he took very small interest in her rough studies for the melancolia when she showed them next week the sundays were racing past and the time was at hand when all the church bells in london could not ring maisie back to him once or twice he said something to binkie about hermaphroditic futilities but the little dog received so many confidences both from torpenhow and dick that he did not trouble his tulipears to listen  dick was permitted to see the girls off they were going by the dover night boat and they hoped to return in august it was then february and dick felt that he was being hardly used maisie was so busy stripping the small house across the park and packing her canvases that she had not time for thought dick went down to dover and wasted a day there fretting over a wonderful possibility would maisie at the very last allow him one small kiss he reflected that he might capture her by the strong arm as he had seem women captured in the southern soudan and lead her away but maisie would never be led she would turn her gray eyes upon him and say dick how selfish you are then his courage would fail him it would be better after all to beg for that kiss  maisie looked more than usually kissable as she stepped from the nightmail on to the windy pier in a gray waterproof and a little gray cloth travellingcap the redhaired girl was not so lovely her green eyes were hollow and her lips were dry dick saw the trunks aboard and went to maisies side in the darkness under the bridge the mailbags were thundering into the forehold and the red haired girl was watching them  youll have a rough passage tonight said dick its blowing outside i suppose i may come over and see you if im good  you mustnt i shall be busy at least if i want you ill send for you but i shall write from vitrysurmarne i shall have heaps of things to consult you about oh dick you have been so good to meso good to me  thank you for that dear it hasnt made any difference has it  i cant tell a fib it hasntin that way but dont think im not grateful  damn the gratitude said dick huskily to the paddlebox  whats the use of worrying you know i should ruin your life and youd ruin mine as things are now you remember what you said when you were so angry that day in the park one of us has to be broken cant you wait till that day comes  no love i want you unbrokenall to myself  maisie shook her head my poor dick what can i say  dont say anything give me a kiss only one kiss maisie ill swear i wont take any more you might as well and then i can be sure youre grateful  maisie put her cheek forward and dick took his reward in the darkness  it was only one kiss but since there was no timelimit specified it was a long one maisie wrenched herself free angrily and dick stood abashed and tingling from head to toe  goodbye darling i didnt mean to scare you im sorry onlykeep well and do good workspecially the melancolia im going to do one too remember me to kami and be careful what you drink country drinkingwater is bad everywhere but its worse in france write to me if you want anything and goodbye say goodbye to the whateveryoucallum girl andcant i have another kiss no youre quite right goodbye  a shout told him that it was not seemly to charge of the mailbag incline he reached the pier as the steamer began to move off and he followed her with his heart  and theres nothingnothing in the wide worldto keep us apart except her obstinacy these calais nightboats are much too small ill get torp to write to the papers about it shes beginning to pitch already  maisie stood where dick had left her till she heard a little gasping cough at her elbow the redhaired girls eyes were alight with cold flame  he kissed you she said how could you let him when he wasnt anything to you how dared you to take a kiss from him oh maisie lets go to the ladies cabin im sickdeadly sick  we arent into open water yet go down dear and ill stay here i dont like the smell of the engines    poor dick he deserved oneonly one but i didnt think hed frighten me so  dick returned to town next day just in time for lunch for which he had telegraphed to his disgust there were only empty plates in the studio  he lifted up his voice like the bears in the fairytale and torpenhow entered looking guilty  hsh said he dont make such a noise i took it come into my rooms and ill show you why  dick paused amazed at the threshold for on torpenhows sofa lay a girl asleep and breathing heavily the little cheap sailorhat the blueandwhite dress fitter for june than for february dabbled with mud at the skirts the jacket trimmed with imitation astrakhan and ripped at the shoulderseams the oneand elevenpenny umbrella and above all the disgraceful condition of the kid topped boots declared all things  oh i say old man this is too bad you mustnt bring this sort up here they steal things from the rooms  it looks bad i admit but i was coming in after lunch and she staggered into the hall i thought she was drunk at first but it was collapse i couldnt leave her as she was so i brought her up here and gave her your lunch she was fainting from want of food she went fast asleep the minute she had finished  i know something of that complaint shes been living on sausages i suppose torp you should have handed her over to a policeman for presuming to faint in a respectable house poor little wretch look at the face there isnt an ounce of immorality in it only follyslack fatuous feeble futile folly its a typical head dyou notice how the skull begins to show through the flesh padding on the face and cheekbone  what a coldblooded barbarian it is dont hit a woman when shes down cant we do anything she was simply dropping with starvation she almost fell into my arms and when she got to the food she ate like a wild beast it was horrible  i can give her money which she would probably spend in drinks is she going to sleep for ever  the girl opened her eyes and glared at the men between terror and effrontery  feeling better said torpenhow  yes thank you there arent many gentlemen that are as kind as you are thank you  when did you leave service said dick who had been watching the scarred and chapped hands  how did you know i was in service i was general servant i didnt like it  and how do you like being your own mistress  do i look as if i liked it  i suppose not one moment would you be good enough to turn your face to the window  the girl obeyed and dick watched her face keenlyso keenly that she made as if to hide behind torpenhow  the eyes have it said dick walking up and down they are superb eyes for my business and after all every head depends on the eyes this has been sent from heaven to make up forwhat was taken away now the weekly strains off my shoulders i can get to work in earnest evidently sent from heaven yes raise your chin a little please  gently old man gently youre scaring somebody out of her wits said torpenhow who could see the girl trembling  dont let him hit me oh please dont let him hit me ive been hit cruel today because i spoke to a man dont let him look at me like that hes reglar wicked that one dont let him look at me like that neither oh i feel as if i hadnt nothing on when he looks at me like that  the overstrained nerves in the frail body gave way and the girl wept like a little child and began to scream dick threw open the window and torpenhow flung the door back  there you are said dick soothingly my friend here can call for a policeman and you can run through that door nobody is going to hurt you  the girl sobbed convulsively for a few minutes and then tried to laugh  nothing in the world to hurt you now listen to me for a minute im what they call an artist by profession you know what artists do  they draw the things in red and black ink on the popshop labels  i dare say i havent risen to popshop labels yet those are done by the academicians i want to draw your head  what for  because its pretty that is why you will come to the room across the landing three times a week at eleven in the morning and ill give you three quid a week just for sitting still and being drawn and theres a quid on account  for nothing oh my the girl turned the sovereign in her hand and with more foolish tears aint neither o you two gentlemen afraid of my bilking you  no only ugly girls do that try and remember this place and by the way whats your name  im bessiebessieits no use giving the rest bessie brokestone broke if you like whats your names but thereno one ever gives the real ones  dick consulted torpenhow with his eyes  my names heldar and my friends called torpenhow and you must be sure to come here where do you live  souththewaterone roomfive and sixpence a week arent you making fun of me about that three quid  youll see later on and bessie next time you come remember you neednt wear that paint its bad for the skin and i have all the colours youll be likely to need  bessie withdrew scrubbing her cheek with a ragged pockethandkerchief the two men looked at each other  youre a man said torpenhow  im afraid ive been a fool it isnt our business to run about the earth reforming bessie brokes and a woman of any kind has no right on this landing  perhaps she wont come back  she will if she thinks she can get food and warmth here i know she will worse luck but remember old man she isnt a woman shes my model and be careful  the idea shes a dissolute little scarecrowa guttersnippet and nothing more  so you think wait till she has been fed a little and freed from fear that fair type recovers itself very quickly you wont know her in a week or two when that abject fear has died out of her eyes shell be too happy and smiling for my purposes  but surely youre not taking her out of charityto please me  i am not in the habit of playing with hot coals to please anybody she has been sent from heaven as i may have remarked before to help me with my melancolia  never heard a word about the lady before  whats the use of having a friend if you must sling your notions at him in words you ought to know what im thinking about youve heard me grunt lately  even so but grunts mean anything in your language from bad baccy to wicked dealers and i dont think ive been much in your confidence for some time  it was a high and soulful grunt you ought to have understood that it meant the melancolia dick walked torpenhow up and down the room keeping silence then he smote him in the ribs now dont you see it bessies abject futility and the terror in her eyes welded on to one or two details in the way of sorrow that have come under my experience lately likewise some orange and blacktwo keys of each but i  cant explain on an empty stomach  it sounds mad enough youd better stick to your soldiers dick instead of maundering about heads and eyes and experiences  think so dick began to dance on his heels singing  theyre as proud as a turkey when they hold the ready cash you ought to ear the way they laugh an joke they are tricky an theyre funny when theyve got the ready money ow but see em when theyre all stonebroke  then he sat down to pour out his heart to maisie in a foursheet letter of counsel and encouragement and registered an oath that he would get to work with an undivided heart as soon as bessie should reappear  the girl kept her appointment unpainted and unadorned afraid and overbold by turns when she found that she was merely expected to sit still she grew calmer and criticised the appointments of the studio with freedom and some point she liked the warmth and the comfort and the release from fear of physical pain dick made two or three studies of her head in monochrome but the actual notion of the melancolia would not arrive  what a mess you keep your things in said bessie some days later when she felt herself thoroughly at home i spose your clothes are just as bad gentlemen never think what buttons and tape are made for  i buy things to wear and wear em till they go to pieces i dont know what torpenhow does  bessie made diligent inquiry in the latters room and unearthed a bale of disreputable socks some of these ill mend now she said and some ill take home dyou know i sit all day long at home doing nothing just like a lady and no more noticing them other girls in the house than if they was so many flies i dont have any unnecessary words but i put em down quick i can tell you when they talk to me no its quite nice these days i lock my door and they can only call me names through the keyhole and i sit inside just like a lady mending socks mr torpenhow wears his socks out both ends at once  three quid a week from me and the delights of my society no socks mended nothing from torp except a nod on the landing now and again and all his socks mended bessie is very much a woman thought dick and he looked at her between halfshut eyes food and rest had transformed the girl as dick knew they would  what are you looking at me like that for she said quickly dont you look reglar bad when you look that way you dont think much o me do you  that depends on how you behave  bessie behaved beautifully only it was difficult at the end of a sitting to bid her go out into the gray streets she very much preferred the studio and a big chair by the stove with some socks in her lap as an excuse for delay then torpenhow would come in and bessie would be moved to tell strange and wonderful stories of her past and still stranger ones of her present improved circumstances she would make them tea as though she had a right to make it and once or twice on these occasions dick caught torpenhows eyes fixed on the trim little figure and because bessies flittings about the room made dick ardently long for maisie he realised whither torpenhows thoughts were tending and bessie was exceedingly careful of the condition of torpenhows linen she spoke very little to him but sometimes they talked together on the landing  i was a great fool dick said to himself i know what red firelight looks like when a mans tramping through a strange town and ours is a lonely selfish sort of life at the best i wonder maisie doesnt feel that sometimes but i cant order bessie away thats the worst of beginning things one never knows where they stop  one evening after a sitting prolonged to the last limit of the light dick was roused from a nap by a broken voice in torpenhows room he jumped to his feet now what ought i to do it looks foolish to go inoh bless you binkie the little terrier thrust torpenhows door open with his nose and came out to take possession of dicks chair the door swung wide unheeded and dick across the landing could see bessie in the halflight making her little supplication to torpenhow she was kneeling by his side and her hands were clasped across his knee  i knowi know she said thickly tisnt right o me to do this but i cant help it and you were so kindso kind and you never took any notice o me and ive mended all your things so carefullyi did oh please tisnt as if i was asking you to marry me i wouldnt think of it but youcouldnt you take and live with me till miss right comes along im only miss wrong i know but id work my hands to the bare bone for you and im not ugly to look at say you will  dick hardly recognised torpenhows voice in replybut look here its no use im liable to be ordered off anywhere at a minutes notice if a war breaks out at a minutes noticedear  what does that matter until you go then until you go tisnt much im asking andyou dont know how good i can cook she had put an arm round his neck and was drawing his head down  untiligo then  torp said dick across the landing he could hardly steady his voice  come here a minute old man im in trouble  heaven send hell listen to me there was something very like an oath from bessies lips she was afraid of dick and disappeared down the staircase in panic but it seemed an age before torpenhow entered the studio he went to the mantelpiece buried his head on his arms and groaned like a wounded bull  what the devil right have you to interfere he said at last  whos interfering with which your own sense told you long ago you couldnt be such a fool it was a tough rack st anthony but youre all right now  i oughtnt to have seen her moving about these rooms as if they belonged to her thats what upset me it gives a lonely man a sort of hankering doesnt it said torpenhow piteously  now you talk sense it does but since you arent in a condition to discuss the disadvantages of double housekeeping do you know what youre going to do  i dont i wish i did  youre going away for a season on a brilliant tour to regain tone youre going to brighton or scarborough or prawle point to see the ships go by and youre going at once isnt it odd ill take care of binkie but out you go immediately never resist the devil he holds the bank fly from him pack your things and go  i believe youre right where shall i go  and you call yourself a special correspondent pack first and inquire afterwards  an hour later torpenhow was despatched into the night for a hansom  youll probably think of some place to go to while youre moving said dick on to euston to begin with andoh yesget drunk tonight  he returned to the studio and lighted more candles for he found the room very dark  oh you jezebel you futile little jezebel wont you hate me tomorrow binkie come here  binkie turned over on his back on the hearthrug and dick stirred him with a meditative foot  i said she was not immoral i was wrong she said she could cook that showed premeditated sin oh binkie if you are a man you will go to perdition but if you are a woman and say that you can cook you will go to a much worse place  chapter x   whats you that follows at my side  the foe that ye must fight my lord  that hirples swift as i can ride  the shadow of the night my lord  then wheel my horse against the foe  hes down and overpast my lord   ye war against the sunset glow  the darkness gathers fast my lord          the fight of heriots ford  this is a cheerful life said dick some days later torps away bessie hates me i cant get at the notion of the melancolia maisies letters are scrappy and i believe i have indigestion what give a man pains across the head and spots before his eyes binkie shall us take some liver pills  dick had just gone through a lively scene with bessie she had for the fiftieth time reproached him for sending torpenhow away she explained her enduring hatred for dick and made it clear to him that she only sat for the sake of his money and mr torpenhows ten times a better man than you she concluded  he is thats why he went away i should have stayed and made love to you  the girl sat with her chin on her hand scowling to me id like to catch you if i wasnt afraid o being hung id kill you thats what id do dyou believe me  dick smiled wearily it is not pleasant to live in the company of a notion that will not work out a foxterrier that cannot talk and a woman who talks too much he would have answered but at that moment there unrolled itself from one corner of the studio a veil as it were of the flimsiest gauze he rubbed his eyes but the gray haze would not go  this is disgraceful indigestion binkie we will go to a medicineman we cant have our eyes interfered with for by these we get our bread also muttonchop bones for little dogs  the doctor was an affable local practitioner with white hair and he said nothing till dick began to describe the gray film in the studio  we all want a little patching and repairing from time to time he chirped like a ship my dear sirexactly like a ship sometimes the hull is out of order and we consult the surgeon sometimes the rigging and then i advise sometimes the engines and we go to the brainspecialist sometimes the look out on the bridge is tired and then we see an oculist i should recommend you to see an oculist a little patching and repairing from time to time is all we want an oculist by all means  dick sought an oculistthe best in london he was certain that the local practitioner did not know anything about his trade and more certain that maisie would laugh at him if he were forced to wear spectacles  ive neglected the warnings of my lord the stomach too long hence these spots before the eyes binkie i can see as well as i ever could  as he entered the dark hall that led to the consultingroom a man cannoned against him dick saw the face as it hurried out into the street  thats the writertype he has the same modelling of the forehead as torp he looks very sick probably heard something he didnt like  even as he thought a great fear came upon dick a fear that made him hold his breath as he walked into the oculists waiting room with the heavy carved furniture the darkgreen paper and the soberhued prints on the wall he recognised a reproduction of one of his own sketches  many people were waiting their turn before him his eye was caught by a flaming redandgold christmascarol book little children came to that eyedoctor and they needed largetype amusement  thats idolatrous bad art he said drawing the book towards himself  from the anatomy of the angels it has been made in germany he opened in mechanically and there leaped to his eyes a verse printed in red ink   the next good joy that mary had  it was the joy of three  to see her good son jesus christ  making the blind to see  making the blind to see good lord  and happy we may be  praise father son and holy ghost  to all eternity  dick read and reread the verse till his turn came and the doctor was bending above him seated in an armchair the blaze of the gasmicroscope in his eyes made him wince the doctors hand touched the scar of the swordcut on dicks head and dick explained briefly how he had come by it when the flame was removed dick saw the doctors face and the fear came upon him again the doctor wrapped himself in a mist of words dick caught allusions to scar frontal bone optic nerve extreme caution and the avoidance of mental anxiety  verdict he said faintly my business is painting and i darent waste time what do you make of it  again the whirl of words but this time they conveyed a meaning  can you give me anything to drink  many sentences were pronounced in that darkened room and the prisoners often needed cheering dick found a glass of liqueur brandy in his hand  as far as i can gather he said coughing above the spirit you call it decay of the optic nerve or something and therefore hopeless what is my timelimit avoiding all strain and worry  perhaps one year  my god and if i dont take care of myself  i really could not say one cannot ascertain the exact amount of injury inflicted by the swordcut the scar is an old one andexposure to the strong light of the desert did you saywith excessive application to fine work i really could not say  i beg your pardon but it has come without any warning if you will let me ill sit here for a minute and then ill go you have been very good in telling me the truth without any warning without any warning thanks  dick went into the street and was rapturously received by binkie  weve got it very badly little dog just as badly as we can get it well go to the park to think it out  they headed for a certain tree that dick knew well and they sat down to think because his legs were trembling under him and there was cold fear at the pit of his stomach  how could it have come without any warning its as sudden as being shot its the living death binkie were to be shut up in the dark in one year if were careful and we shant see anybody and we shall never have anything we want not though we live to be a hundred binkie wagged his tail joyously binkie we must think lets see how it feels to be blind dick shut his eyes and flaming commas and catherinewheels floated inside the lids yet when he looked across the park the scope of his vision was not contracted he could see perfectly until a procession of slowwheeling fireworks defiled across his eyeballs  little dorglums we arent at all well lets go home if only torp were back now  but torpenhow was in the south of england inspecting dockyards in the company of the nilghai his letters were brief and full of mystery  dick had never asked anybody to help him in his joys or his sorrows he argued in the loneliness of his studio henceforward to be decorated with a film of gray gauze in one corner that if his fate were blindness all the torpenhows in the world could not save him i cant call him off his trip to sit down and sympathise with me i must pull through this business alone he said he was lying on the sofa eating his moustache and wondering what the darkness of the night would be like then came to his mind the memory of a quaint scene in the soudan a soldier had been nearly hacked in two by a broadbladed arab spear for one instant the man felt no pain looking down he saw that his lifeblood was going from him the stupid bewilderment on his face was so intensely comic that both dick and torpenhow still panting and unstrung from a fight for life had roared with laughter in which the man seemed as if he would join but as his lips parted in a sheepish grin the agony of death came upon him and he pitched grunting at their feet dick laughed again remembering the horror it seemed so exactly like his own case  but i have a little more time allowed me he said he paced up and down the room quietly at first but afterwards with the hurried feet of fear it was as though a black shadow stood at his elbow and urged him to go forward and there were only weaving circles and floating pindots before his eyes  we need to be calm binkie we must be calm he talked aloud for the sake of distraction this isnt nice at all what shall we do we must do something our time is short i shouldnt have believed that this morning but now things are different binkie where was moses when the light went out  binkie smiled from ear to ear as a wellbred terrier should but made no suggestion  were there but world enough and time this coyness binkie were not crime    but at my back i always hear he wiped his forehead which was unpleasantly damp what can i do what can i do i havent any notions left and i cant think connectedly but i must do something or i shall go off my head  the hurried walk recommenced dick stopping every now and again to drag forth longneglected canvases and old notebooks for he turned to his work by instinct as a thing that could not fail you wont do and you wont do he said at each inspection no more soldiers i couldnt paint em sudden death comes home too nearly and this is battle and murder for me  the day was failing and dick thought for a moment that the twilight of the blind had come upon him unaware allah almighty he cried despairingly help me through the time of waiting and i wont whine when my punishment comes what can i do now before the light goes  there was no answer dick waited till he could regain some sort of control over himself his hands were shaking and he prided himself on their steadiness he could feel that his lips were quivering and the sweat was running down his face he was lashed by fear driven forward by the desire to get to work at once and accomplish something and maddened by the refusal of his brain to do more than repeat the news that he was about to go blind its a humiliating exhibition he thought and im glad torp isnt here to see the doctor said i was to avoid mental worry come here and let me pet you binkie  the little dog yelped because dick nearly squeezed the bark out of him  then he heard the man speaking in the twilight and doglike understood that his trouble stood off from himallah is good binkie not quite so gentle as we could wish but well discuss that later i think i see my way to it now all those studies of bessies head were nonsense and they nearly brought your master into a scrape i hold the notion now as clear as crystal the melancolia that transcends all wit there shall be maisie in that head because i shall never get maisie and bess of course because she knows all about melancolia though she doesnt know she knows and there shall be some drawing in it and it shall all end up with a laugh thats for myself shall she giggle or grin no she shall laugh right out of the canvas and every man and woman that ever had a sorrow of their own shallwhat is it the poem says   understand the speech and feel a stir  of fellowship in all disastrous fight  in all disastrous fight thats better than painting the thing merely to pique maisie i can do it now because i have it inside me binkie im going to hold you up by your tail youre an omen come here  binkie swung head downward for a moment without speaking  rather like holding a guineapig but youre a brave little dog and you dont yelp when youre hung up it is an omen  binkie went to his own chair and as often as he looked saw dick walking up and down rubbing his hands and chuckling that night dick wrote a letter to maisie full of the tenderest regard for her health but saying very little about his own and dreamed of the melancolia to be born not till morning did he remember that something might happen to him in the future  he fell to work whistling softly and was swallowed up in the clean clear joy of creation which does not come to man too often lest he should consider himself the equal of his god and so refuse to die at the appointed time he forgot maisie torpenhow and binkie at his feet but remembered to stir bessie who needed very little stirring into a tremendous rage that he might watch the smouldering lights in her eyes  he threw himself without reservation into his work and did not think of the doom that was to overtake him for he was possessed with his notion and the things of this world had no power upon him  youre pleased today said bessie  dick waved his mahlstick in mystic circles and went to the sideboard for a drink in the evening when the exaltation of the day had died down he went to the sideboard again and after some visits became convinced that the eyedoctor was a liar since he could still see everything very clearly  he was of opinion that he would even make a home for maisie and that whether she liked it or not she should be his wife the mood passed next morning but the sideboard and all upon it remained for his comfort  again he set to work and his eyes troubled him with spots and dashes and blurs till he had taken counsel with the sideboard and the melancolia both on the canvas and in his own mind appeared lovelier than ever there was a delightful sense of irresponsibility upon him such as they feel who walking among their fellowmen know that the deathsentence of disease is upon them and seeing that fear is but waste of the little time left are riotously happy the days passed without event  bessie arrived punctually always and though her voice seemed to dick to come from a distance her face was always very near the melancolia began to flame on the canvas in the likeness of a woman who had known all the sorrow in the world and was laughing at it it was true that the corners of the studio draped themselves in gray film and retired into the darkness that the spots in his eyes and the pains across his head were very troublesome and that maisies letters were hard to read and harder still to answer he could not tell her of his trouble and he could not laugh at her accounts of her own melancolia which was always going to be finished but the furious days of toil and the nights of wild dreams made amends for all and the sideboard was his best friend on earth  bessie was singularly dull she used to shriek with rage when dick stared at her between halfclosed eyes now she sulked or watched him with disgust saying very little  torpenhow had been absent for six weeks an incoherent note heralded his return news great news he wrote the nilghai knows and so does the keneu were all back on thursday get lunch and clean your accoutrements  dick showed bessie the letter and she abused him for that he had ever sent torpenhow away and ruined her life  well said dick brutally youre better as you are instead of making love to some drunken beast in the street he felt that he had rescued torpenhow from great temptation  i dont know if thats any worse than sitting to a drunken beast in a studio you havent been sober for three weeks youve been soaking the whole time and yet you pretend youre better than me  what dyou mean said dick  mean youll see when mr torpenhow comes back  it was not long to wait torpenhow met bessie on the staircase without a sign of feeling he had news that was more to him than many bessies and the keneu and the nilghai were trampling behind him calling for dick  drinking like a fish bessie whispered hes been at it for nearly a month she followed the men stealthily to hear judgment done  they came into the studio rejoicing to be welcomed over effusively by a drawn lined shrunken haggard wreckunshaven bluewhite about the nostrils stooping in the shoulders and peering under his eyebrows nervously the drink had been at work as steadily as dick  is this you said torpenhow  all thats left of me sit down binkies quite well and ive been doing some good work he reeled where he stood  youve done some of the worst work youve ever done in your life man alive youre  torpenhow turned to his companions appealingly and they left the room to find lunch elsewhere then he spoke but since the reproof of a friend is much too sacred and intimate a thing to be printed and since torpenhow used figures and metaphors which were unseemly and contempt untranslatable it will never be known what was actually said to dick who blinked and winked and picked at his hands after a time the culprit began to feel the need of a little self respect he was quite sure that he had not in any way departed from virtue and there were reasons too of which torpenhow knew nothing he would explain  he rose tried to straighten his shoulders and spoke to the face he could hardly see  you are right he said but i am right too after you went away i had some trouble with my eyes so i went to an oculist and he turned a gasogenei mean a gasengineinto my eye that was very long ago he said scar on the head swordcut and optic nerve make a note of that so i am going blind i have some work to do before i go blind and i suppose that i must do it i cannot see much now but i can see best when i am drunk i did not know i was drunk till i was told but i must go on with my work if you want to see it there it is he pointed to the all but finished melancolia and looked for applause  torpenhow said nothing and dick began to whimper feebly for joy at seeing torpenhow again for grief at misdeedsif indeed they were misdeedsthat made torpenhow remote and unsympathetic and for childish vanity hurt since torpenhow had not given a word of praise to his wonderful picture  bessie looked through the keyhole after a long pause and saw the two walking up and down as usual torpenhows hand on dicks shoulder  hereat she said something so improper that it shocked even binkie who was dribbling patiently on the landing with the hope of seeing his master again  chapter xi  the lark will make her hymn to god the partridge call her brood while i forget the heath i trod the fields wherein i stood  tis dule to know not night from morn but deeper dule to know i can but hear the hunters horn that once i used to blow         the only son  it was the third day after torpenhows return and his heart was heavy  do you mean to tell me that you cant see to work without whiskey its generally the other way about  can a drunkard swear on his honour said dick  yes if he has been as good a man as you  then i give you my word of honour said dick speaking hurriedly through parched lips old man i can hardly see your face now youve kept me sober for two daysif i ever was drunkand ive done no work dont keep me back any more i dont know when my eyes may give out the spots and dots and the pains and things are crowding worse than ever i swear i can see all right when imwhen im moderately screwed as you say give me three more sittings from bessie and allthe stuff i want and the picture will be done i cant kill myself in three days it only means a touch of d t at the worst  if i give you three days more will you promise me to stop work andthe other thing whether the pictures finished or not  i cant you dont know what that picture means to me but surely you could get the nilghai to help you and knock me down and tie me up i shouldnt fight for the whiskey but i should for the work  go on then i give you three days but youre nearly breaking my heart  dick returned to his work toiling as one possessed and the yellow devil of whiskey stood by him and chased away the spots in his eyes the melancolia was nearly finished and was all or nearly all that he had hoped she would be dick jested with bessie who reminded him that he was a drunken beast but the reproof did not move him  you cant understand bess we are in sight of land now and soon we shall lie back and think about what weve done ill give you three months pay when the pictures finished and next time i have any more work in handbut that doesnt matter wont three months pay make you hate me less  no it wont i hate you and ill go on hating you mr torpenhow wont speak to me any more hes always looking at maps  bessie did not say that she had again laid siege to torpenhow or that at the end of our passionate pleading he had picked her up given her a kiss and put her outside the door with the recommendation not to be a little fool he spent most of his time in the company of the nilghai and their talk was of war in the near future the hiring of transports and secret preparations among the dockyards he did not wish to see dick till the picture was finished  hes doing firstclass work he said to the nilghai and its quite out of his regular line but for the matter of that sos his infernal soaking  never mind leave him alone when he has come to his senses again well carry him off from this place and let him breathe clean air poor dick i dont envy you torp when his eyes fail  yes it will be a case of god help the man whos chained to our davie the worst is that we dont know when it will happen and i believe the uncertainty and the waiting have sent dick to the whiskey more than anything else  how the arab who cut his head open would grin if he knew  hes at perfect liberty to grin if he can hes dead thats poor consolation now  in the afternoon of the third day torpenhow heard dick calling for him  all finished he shouted ive done it come in isnt she a beauty isnt she a darling ive been down to hell to get her but isnt she worth it  torpenhow looked at the head of a woman who laugheda fulllipped hollow eyed woman who laughed from out of the canvas as dick had intended she would  who taught you how to do it said torpenhow the touch and notion have nothing to do with your regular work what a face it is what eyes and what insolence unconsciously he threw back his head and laughed with her shes seen the game played outi dont think she had a good time of itand now she doesnt care isnt that the idea  exactly  where did you get the mouth and chin from they dont belong to bess  theyresome one elses but isnt it good isnt it thundering good wasnt it worth the whiskey i did it alone i did it and its the best i can do he drew his breath sharply and whispered just god what could i not do ten years hence if i can do this nowby the way what do you think of it bess  the girl was biting her lips she loathed torpenhow because he had taken no notice of her  i think its just the horridest beastliest thing i ever saw she answered and turned away  more than you will be of that way of thinking young womandick theres a sort of murderous viperine suggestion in the poise of the head that i dont understand said torpenhow  thats trickwork said dick chuckling with delight at being completely understood i couldnt resist one little bit of sheer swagger its a french trick and you wouldnt understand but its got at by slewing round the head a trifle and a tiny tiny foreshortening of one side of the face from the angle of the chin to the top of the left ear that and deepening the shadow under the lobe of the ear it was flagrant trickwork but having the notion fixed i felt entitled to play with itoh you beauty  amen she is a beauty i can feel it  so will every man who has any sorrow of his own said dick slapping his thigh he shall see his trouble there and by the lord harry just when hes feeling properly sorry for himself he shall throw back his head and laughas she is laughing ive put the life of my heart and the light of my eyes into her and i dont care what comes    im tiredawfully tired i think ill get to sleep take away the whiskey it has served its turn and give bessie thirtysix quid and three over for luck cover the picture  he dropped asleep in the long chair hid face white and haggard almost before he had finished the sentence bessie tried to take torpenhows hand arent you never going to speak to me any more she said but torpenhow was looking at dick  what a stock of vanity the man has ill take him in hand tomorrow and make much of him he deserves iteh what was that bess  nothing ill put things tidy here a little and then ill go you couldnt give the that three months pay now could you he said you were to  torpenhow gave her a check and went to his own rooms bessie faithfully tidied up the studio set the door ajar for flight emptied half a bottle of turpentine on a duster and began to scrub the face of the melancolia viciously the paint did not smudge quickly enough she took a paletteknife and scraped following each stroke with the wet duster in five minutes the picture was a formless scarred muddle of colours she threw the paintstained duster into the studio stove stuck out her tongue at the sleeper and whispered bilked as she turned to run down the staircase she would never see torpenhow any more but she had at least done harm to the man who had come between her and her desire and who used to make fun of her cashing the check was the very cream of the jest to bessie then the little privateer sailed across the thames to be swallowed up in the gray wilderness of souththe water  dick slept till late in the evening when torpenhow dragged him off to bed his eyes were as bright as his voice was hoarse lets have another look at the picture he said insistently as a child  yougotobed said torpenhow you arent at all well though you maynt know it youre as jumpy as a cat  i reform tomorrow good night  as he repassed through the studio torpenhow lifted the cloth above the picture and almost betrayed himself by outcries wiped outscraped out and turped out hes on the verge of jumps as it is thats bessthe little fiend only a woman could have done thatwith the ink not dry on the check too dick will be raving mad tomorrow it was all my fault for trying to help gutterdevils oh my poor dick the lord is hitting you very hard  dick could not sleep that night partly for pure joy and partly because the wellknown catherinewheels inside his eyes had given place to crackling volcanoes of manycoloured fire spout away he said aloud  ive done my work and now you can do what you please he lay still staring at the ceiling the longpentup delirium of drink in his veins his brain on fire with racing thoughts that would not stay to be considered and his hands crisped and dry he had just discovered that he was painting the face of the melancolia on a revolving dome ribbed with millions of lights and that all his wondrous thoughts stood embodied hundreds of feet below his tiny swinging plank shouting together in his honour when something cracked inside his temples like an overstrained bowstring the glittering dome broke inward and he was alone in the thick night  ill go to sleep the rooms very dark lets light a lamp and see how the melancolia looks there ought to have been a moon  it was then that torpenhow heard his name called by a voice that he did not knowin the rattling accents of deadly fear  hes looked at the picture was his first thought as he hurried into the bedroom and found dick sitting up and beating the air with his hands  torp torp where are you for pitys sake come to me  whats the matter  dick clutched at his shoulder matter ive been lying here for hours in the dark and you never heard me torp old man dont go away im all in the dark in the dark i tell you  torpenhow held the candle within a foot of dicks eyes but there was no light in those eyes he lit the gas and dick heard the flame catch the grip of his fingers on torpenhows shoulder made torpenhow wince  dont leave me you wouldnt leave me alone now would you i  cant see dyou understand its blackquite blackand i feel as if i was falling through it all  steady does it torpenhow put his arm round dick and began to rock him gently to and fro  thats good now dont talk if i keep very quiet for a while this darkness will lift it seems just on the point of breaking hsh dick knit his brows and stared desperately in front of him the night air was chilling torpenhows toes  can you stay like that a minute he said ill get my dressinggown and some slippers  dick clutched the bedhead with both hands and waited for the darkness to clear away what a time youve been he cried when torpenhow returned its as black as ever what are you banging about in the doorway  long chairhorseblanketpillow going to sleep by you lie down now youll be better in the morning  i shant the voice rose to a wail my god im blind im blind and the darkness will never go away he made as if to leap from the bed but torpenhows arms were round him and torpenhows chin was on his shoulder and his breath was squeezed out of him he could only gasp blind and wriggle feebly  steady dickie steady said the deep voice in his ear and the grip tightened bite on the bullet old man and dont let them think youre afraid the grip could draw no closer both men were breathing heavily  dick threw his head from side to side and groaned  let me go he panted youre cracking my ribs wewe mustnt let them think were afraid must weall the powers of darkness and that lot  lie down its all over now  yes said dick obediently but would you mind letting me hold your hand i feel as if i wanted something to hold on to one drops through the dark so  torpenhow thrust out a large and hairy paw from the long chair dick clutched it tightly and in half an hour had fallen asleep torpenhow withdrew his hand and stooping over dick kissed him lightly on the forehead as men do sometimes kiss a wounded comrade in the hour of death to ease his departure  in the gray dawn torpenhow heard dick talking to himself he was adrift on the shoreless tides of delirium speaking very quicklyits a pitya great pity but its helped and it must be eaten master george sufficient unto the day is the blindness thereof and further putting aside all melancolias and false humours it is of obvious notorietysuch as mine wasthat the queen can do no wrong torp doesnt know that ill tell him when were a little farther into the desert  what a bungle those boatmen are making of the steamerropes theyll have that fourinch hawser chafed through in a minute i told you sothere she goes white foam on green water and the steamer slewing round how good that looks ill sketch it no i cant im afflicted with ophthalmia that was one of the ten plagues of egypt and it extends up the nile in the shape of cataract ha thats a joke torp laugh you graven image and stand clear of the hawser    itll knock you into the water and make your dress all dirty maisie dear  oh said torpenhow this happened before that night on the river  shell be sure to say its my fault if you get muddy and youre quite near enough to the breakwater maisie thats not fair ah i knew youd miss  low and to the left dear but youve no conviction dont be angry darling id cut my hand off if it would give you anything more than obstinacy my right hand if it would serve  now we mustnt listen heres an island shouting across seas of misunderstanding with a vengeance but its shouting truth i fancy said torpenhow  the babble continued it all bore upon maisie sometimes dick lectured at length on his craft then he cursed himself for his folly in being enslaved he pleaded to maisie for a kissonly one kissbefore she went away and called to her to come back from vitrysurmarne if she would but through all his ravings he bade heaven and earth witness that the queen could do no wrong  torpenhow listened attentively and learned every detail of dicks life that had been hidden from him for three days dick raved through the past and then a natural sleep what a strain he has been running under poor chap said torpenhow dick of all men handing himself over like a dog and i was lecturing him on arrogance i ought to have known that it was no use to judge a man but i did it what a demon that girl must be dicks given her his life confound himand shes given him one kiss apparently  torp said dick from the bed go out for a walk youve been here too long ill get up hi this is annoying i cant dress myself oh its too absurd  torpenhow helped him into his clothes and led him to the big chair in the studio he sat quietly waiting under strained nerves for the darkness to lift it did not lift that day nor the next dick adventured on a voyage round the walls he hit his shins against the stove and this suggested to him that it would be better to crawl on all fours one hand in front of him torpenhow found him on the floor  im trying to get the geography of my new possessions said he dyou remember that nigger you gouged in the square pity you didnt keep the odd eye it would have been useful any letters for me give me all the ones in fat gray envelopes with a sort of crown thing outside theyre of no importance  torpenhow gave him a letter with a black m on the envelope flap dick put it into his pocket there was nothing in it that torpenhow might not have read but it belonged to himself and to maisie who would never belong to him  when she finds that i dont write shell stop writing its better so i couldnt be any use to her now dick argued and the tempter suggested that he should make known his condition every nerve in him revolted i have fallen low enough already im not going to beg for pity besides it would be cruel to her he strove to put maisie out of his thoughts but the blind have many opportunities for thinking and as the tides of his strength came back to him in the long employless days of dead darkness dicks soul was troubled to the core another letter and another came from maisie then there was silence and dick sat by the window the pulse of summer in the air and pictured her being won by another man stronger than himself his imagination the keener for the dark background it worked against spared him no single detail that might send him raging up and down the studio to stumble over the stove that seemed to be in four places at once worst of all tobacco would not taste in the darkness the arrogance of the man had disappeared and in its place were settled despair that torpenhow knew and blind passion that dick confided to his pillow at night the intervals between the paroxysms were filled with intolerable waiting and the weight of intolerable darkness  come out into the park said torpenhow you havent stirred out since the beginning of things  whats the use theres no movement in the dark and besideshe paused irresolutely at the head of the stairssomething will run over me  not if im with you proceed gingerly  the roar of the streets filled dick with nervous terror and he clung to torpenhows arm fancy having to feel for a gutter with your foot he said petulantly as he turned into the park lets curse god and die  sentries are forbidden to pay unauthorised compliments by jove there are the guards  dicks figure straightened lets get near em lets go in and look lets get on the grass and run i can smell the trees  mind the low railing thats all right torpenhow kicked out a tuft of grass with his heel smell that he said isnt it good dick sniffed luxuriously now pick up your feet and run they approached as near to the regiment as was possible the clank of bayonets being unfixed made dicks nostrils quiver  lets get nearer theyre in column arent they  yes how did you know  felt it oh my menmy beautiful men he edged forward as though he could see i could draw those chaps once wholl draw em now  theyll move off in a minute dont jump when the band begins  huh im not a new charger its the silences that hurt nearer torp nearer oh my god what wouldnt i give to see em for a minuteone half minute  he could hear the armed life almost within reach of him could hear the slings tighten across the bandsmans chest as he heaved the big drum from the ground  sticks crossed above his head whispered torpenhow  i know i know who should know if i dont hsh  the drumsticks fell with a boom and the men swung forward to the crash of the band dick felt the wind of the massed movement in his face heard the maddening tramp of feet and the friction of the pouches on the belts the big drum pounded out the tune it was a musichall refrain that made a perfect quickstep  he must be a man of decent height he must be a man of weight he must come home on a saturday night in a thoroughly sober state he must know how to love me and he must know how to kiss and if hes enough to keep us both i cant refuse him bliss  whats the matter said torpenhow as he saw dicks head fall when the last of the regiment had departed  nothing i feel a little bit out of the runningthats all torp take me back why did you bring me out  chapter xii  there were three friends that buried the fourth  the mould in his mouth and the dust in his eyes and they went south and east and north  the strong man fights but the sick man dies  there were three friends that spoke of the dead  the strong man fights but the sick man dies and would he were with us now they said  the sun in our face and the wind in our eyes                    ballad  the nilghai was angry with torpenhow dick had been sent to bedblind men are ever under the orders of those who can seeand since he had returned from the park had fluently sworn at torpenhow because he was alive and all the world because it was alive and could see while he dick was dead in the death of the blind who at the best are only burdens upon their associates torpenhow had said something about a mrs gummidge and dick had retired in a black fury to handle and rehandle three unopened letters from maisie  the nilghai fat burly and aggressive was in torpenhows rooms  behind him sat the keneu the great war eagle and between them lay a large map embellished with blackandwhiteheaded pins  i was wrong about the balkans said the nilghai but im not wrong about this business the whole of our work in the southern soudan must be done over again the public doesnt care of course but the government does and they are making their arrangements quietly you know that as well as i do  i remember how the people cursed us when our troops withdrew from omdurman it was bound to crop up sooner or later but i cant go said torpenhow he pointed through the open door it was a hot night can you blame me  the keneu purred above his pipe like a large and very happy catdont blame you in the least its uncommonly good of you and all the rest of it but every maneven you torpmust consider his work i know it sounds brutal but dicks out of the racedowngastados expended finished done for he has a little money of his own he wont starve and you cant pull out of your slide for his sake think of your own reputation  dicks was five times bigger than mine and yours put together  that was because he signed his name to everything he did its all ended now you must hold yourself in readiness to move out you can command your own prices and you do better work than any three of us  dont tell me how tempting it is ill stay here to look after dick for a while hes as cheerful as a bear with a sore head but i think he likes to have me near him  the nilghai said something uncomplimentary about softheaded fools who throw away their careers for other fools torpenhow flushed angrily the constant strain of attendance on dick had worn his nerves thin  there remains a third fate said the keneu thoughtfully consider this and be not larger fools than necessary dick isor rather wasan ablebodied man of moderate attractions and a certain amount of audacity  oho said the nilghai who remembered an affair at cairo i begin to see torp im sorry  torpenhow nodded forgiveness you were more sorry when he cut you out thoughgo on keneu  ive often thought when ive seen men die out in the desert that if the news could be sent through the world and the means of transport were quick enough there would be one woman at least at each mans bedside  there would be some mighty quaint revelations let us be grateful things are as they are said the nilghai  let us rather reverently consider whether torps threecornered ministrations are exactly what dick needs just nowwhat do you think yourself torp  i know they arent but what can i do  lay the matter before the board we are all dicks friends here youve been most in his life  but i picked it up when he was off his head  the greater chance of its being true i thought we should arrive who is she  then torpenhow told a tale in plain words as a special correspondent who knows how to make a verbal precis should tell it the men listened without interruption  is it possible that a man can come back across the years to his calflove  said the keneu is it possible  i give the facts he says nothing about it now but he sits fumbling three letters from her when he thinks im not looking what am i to do  speak to him said the nilghai  oh yes write to heri dont know her full name rememberand ask her to accept him out of pity i believe you once told dick you were sorry for him nilghai you remember what happened eh go into the bedroom and suggest full confession and an appeal to this maisie girl whoever she is i honestly believe hed try to kill you and the blindness has made him rather muscular  torpenhows course is perfectly clear said the keneu he will go to vitry surmarne which is on the beziereslandes railwaysingle track from tourgas the prussians shelled it out in 70 because there was a poplar on the top of a hill eighteen hundred yards from the church spire theres a squadron of cavalry quartered thereor ought to be where this studio torp spoke about may be i cannot tell that is torps business i have given him his route he will dispassionately explain the situation to the girl and she will come back to dickthe more especially because to use dicks words there is nothing but her damned obstinacy to keep them apart  and they have four hundred and twenty pounds a year between em  dick never lost his head for figures even in his delirium you havent the shadow of an excuse for not going said the nilghai  torpenhow looked very uncomfortable but its absurd and impossible i cant drag her back by the hair  our businessthe business for which we draw our moneyis to do absurd and impossible thingsgenerally with no reason whatever except to amuse the public here we have a reason the rest doesnt matter i shall share these rooms with the nilghai till torpenhow returns there will be a batch of unbridled specials coming to town in a little while and these will serve as their headquarters another reason for sending torpenhow away thus providence helps those who help others andhere the keneu dropped his measured speech we cant have you tied by the leg to dick when the trouble begins its your only chance of getting away and dick will be grateful  he willworse luck i can but go and try i cant conceive a woman in her senses refusing dick  talk that out with the girl i have seen you wheedle an angry mahdieh woman into giving you dates this wont be a tithe as difficult you had better not be here tomorrow afternoon because the nilghai and i will be in possession it is an order obey  dick said torpenhow next morning can i do anything for you  no leave me alone how often must i remind you that im blind  nothing i could go for to fetch for to carry for to bring  no take those infernal creaking boots of yours away  poor chap said torpenhow to himself i must have been sitting on his nerves lately he wants a lighter step then aloud very well since youre so independent im going off for four or five days say goodbye at least the housekeeper will look after you and keneu has my rooms  dicks face fell you wont be longer than a week at the outside i know im touched in the temper but i cant get on without you  cant you youll have to do without me in a little time and youll be glad im gone  dick felt his way back to the big chair and wondered what these things might mean he did not wish to be tended by the housekeeper and yet torpenhows constant tenderness jarred on him he did not exactly know what he wanted the darkness would not lift and maisies unopened letters felt worn and old from much handling he could never read them for himself as long as life endured but maisie might have sent him some fresh ones to play with the nilghai entered with a gifta piece of red modellingwax he fancied that dick might find interest in using his hands dick poked and patted the stuff for a few minutes and is it like anything in the world he said drearily take it away i may get the touch of the blind in fifty years do you know where torpenhow has gone  the nilghai knew nothing were staying in his rooms till he comes back can we do anything for you  id like to be left alone please dont think im ungrateful but im best alone  the nilghai chuckled and dick resumed his drowsy brooding and sullen rebellion against fate he had long since ceased to think about the work he had done in the old days and the desire to do more work had departed from him he was exceedingly sorry for himself and the completeness of his tender grief soothed him but his soul and his body cried for maisiemaisie who would understand his mind pointed out that maisie having her own work to do would not care his experience had taught him that when money was exhausted women went away and that when a man was knocked out of the race the others trampled on him then at the least said dick in reply she could use me as i used binat for some sort of a study i wouldnt ask more than to be near her again even though i knew that another man was making love to her ugh what a dog i am  a voice on the staircase began to sing joyfully  when we gogogo away from here our creditors will weep and they will wail our absence much regretting when they find that weve been getting out of england by next tuesdays indian mail  following the trampling of feet slamming of torpenhows door and the sound of voices in strenuous debate some one squeaked and see you good fellows i have found a new waterbottlefirsclass patenteh how you say open himself inside out  dick sprang to his feet he knew the voice well thats cassavetti come back from the continent now i know why torp went away theres a row somewhere andim out of it  the nilghai commanded silence in vain thats for my sake dick said bitterly the birds are getting ready to fly and they wouldnt tell me i can hear mortensutherland and mackaye half the war correspondents in london are thereand im out of it  he stumbled across the landing and plunged into torpenhows room he could feel that it was full of men wheres the trouble said he in the balkans at last why didnt some one tell me  we thought you wouldnt be interested said the nilghai shamefacedly  its in the soudan as usual  you lucky dogs let me sit here while you talk i shant be a skeleton at the feastcassavetti where are you your english is as bad as ever  dick was led into a chair he heard the rustle of the maps and the talk swept forward carrying him with it everybody spoke at once discussing press censorships railwayroutes transport watersupply the capacities of generalsthese in language that would have horrified a trusting public ranting asserting denouncing and laughing at the top of their voices there was the glorious certainty of war in the soudan at any moment the nilghai said so and it was well to be in readiness the keneu had telegraphed to cairo for horses cassavetti had stolen a perfectly inaccurate list of troops that would be ordered forward and was reading it out amid profane interruptions and the keneu introduced to dick some man unknown who would be employed as war artist by the central southern syndicate its his first outing said the keneu give him some tipsabout riding camels  oh those camels groaned cassavetti i shall learn to ride him again and now i am so much all soft listen you good fellows i know your military arrangement very well there will go the royal argalshire sutherlanders so it was read to me upon best authority  a roar of laughter interrupted him  sit down said the nilghai the lists arent even made out in the war office  will there be any force at suakin said a voice  then the outcries redoubled and grew mixed thus how many egyptian troops will they usegod help the fellaheentheres a railway in plumstead marshes doing duty as a fivescourtwe shall have the suakinberber line built at lastcanadian voyageurs are too careful give me a halfdrunk krooman in a whaleboatwho commands the desert columnno they never blew up the big rock in the ghineh bend we shall have to be hauled up as usualsomebody tell me if theres an indian contingent or ill break everybodys headdont tear the map in twoits a war of occupation i tell you to connect with the african companies in the souththeres guineaworm in most of the wells on that route then the nilghai despairing of peace bellowed like a foghorn and beat upon the table with both hands  but what becomes of torpenhow said dick in the silence that followed  torps in abeyance just now hes off lovemaking somewhere i suppose said the nilghai  he said he was going to stay at home said the keneu  is he said dick with an oath he wont im not much good now but if you and the nilghai hold him down ill engage to trample on him till he sees reason hell stay behind indeed hes the best of you all therell be some tough work by omdurman we shall come there to stay this time  but i forgot i wish i were going with you  so do we all dickie said the keneu  and i most of all said the new artist of the central southern syndicate  could you tell me  ill give you one piece of advice dick answered moving towards the door if you happen to be cut over the head in a scrimmage dont guard tell the man to go on cutting youll find it cheapest in the end thanks for letting me look in  theres grit in dick said the nilghai an hour later when the room was emptied of all save the keneu  it was the sacred call of the wartrumpet did you notice how he answered to it poor fellow lets look at him said the keneu  the excitement of the talk had died away dick was sitting by the studio table with his head on his arms when the men came in he did not change his position  it hurts he moaned god forgive me but it hurts cruelly and yet yknow the world has a knack of spinning round all by itself shall i see torp before he goes  oh yes youll see him said the nilghai  chapter xiii  the sun went down an hour ago i wonder if i face towards home if i lost my way in the light of day how shall i find it now night is come               old song  maisie come to bed  its so hot i cant sleep dont worry  maisie put her elbows on the windowsill and looked at the moonlight on the straight poplarflanked road summer had come upon vitrysurmarne and parched it to the bone the grass was dryburnt in the meadows the clay by the bank of the river was caked to brick the roadside flowers were long since dead and the roses in the garden hung withered on their stalks the heat in the little low bedroom under the eaves was almost intolerable the very moonlight on the wall of kamis studio across the road seemed to make the night hotter and the shadow of the big bellhandle by the closed gate cast a bar of inky black that caught maisies eye and annoyed her  horrid thing it should be all white she murmured and the gate isnt in the middle of the wall either i never noticed that before  maisie was hard to please at that hour first the heat of the past few weeks had worn her down secondly her work and particularly the study of a female head intended to represent the melancolia and not finished in time for the salon was unsatisfactory thirdly kami had said as much two days before fourthlybut so completely fourthly that it was hardly worth thinking about dick her property had not written to her for more than six weeks she was angry with the heat with kami and with her work but she was exceedingly angry with dick  she had written to him three timeseach time proposing a fresh treatment of her melancolia dick had taken no notice of these communications she had resolved to write no more when she returned to england in the autumnfor her prides sake she could not return earliershe would speak to him she missed the sunday afternoon conferences more than she cared to admit all that kami said was continuez mademoiselle continuez toujours and he had been repeating the wearisome counsel through the hot summer exactly like a cicada an old gray cicada in a black alpaca coat white trousers and a huge felt hat  but dick had tramped masterfully up and down her little studio north of the cool green london park and had said things ten times worse than continuez before he snatched the brush out of her hand and showed her where the error lay his last letter maisie remembered contained some trivial advice about not sketching in the sun or drinking water at wayside farmhouses and he had said that not once but three timesas if he did not know that maisie could take care of herself  but what was he doing that he could not trouble to write a murmur of voices in the road made her lean from the window a cavalryman of the little garrison in the town was talking to kamis cook the moonlight glittered on the scabbard of his sabre which he was holding in his hand lest it should clank inopportunely the cooks cap cast deep shadows on her face which was close to the conscripts he slid his arm round her waist and there followed the sound of a kiss  faugh said maisie stepping back  whats that said the redhaired girl who was tossing uneasily outside her bed  only a conscript kissing the cook said maisie  theyve gone away now she leaned out of the window again and put a shawl over her nightgown to guard against chills there was a very small nightbreeze abroad and a sunbaked rose below nodded its head as one who knew unutterable secrets was it possible that dick should turn his thoughts from her work and his own and descend to the degradation of suzanne and the conscript he could not the rose nodded its head and one leaf therewith it looked like a naughty little devil scratching its ear  dick could not because thought maisie he is mineminemine he said he was im sure i dont care what he does it will only spoil his work if he does and it will spoil mine too  the rose continued to nod in the futile way peculiar to flowers there was no earthly reason why dick should not disport himself as he chose except that he was called by providence which was maisie to assist maisie in her work and her work was the preparation of pictures that went sometimes to english provincial exhibitions as the notices in the scrapbook proved and that were invariably rejected by the salon when kami was plagued into allowing her to send them up her work in the future it seemed would be the preparation of pictures on exactly similar lines which would be rejected in exactly the same waythe redhaired girl threshed distressfully across the sheets its too hot to sleep she moaned and the interruption jarred  exactly the same way then she would divide her years between the little studio in england and kamis big studio at vitrysurmarne no she would go to another master who should force her into the success that was her right if patient toil and desperate endeavour gave one a right to anything dick had told her that he had worked ten years to understand his craft she had worked ten years and ten years were nothing dick had said that ten years were nothingbut that was in regard to herself only he had saidthis very man who could not find time to writethat he would wait ten years for her and that she was bound to come back to him sooner or later he had said this in the absurd letter about sunstroke and diphtheria and then he had stopped writing he was wandering up and down moonlit streets kissing cooks she would like to lecture him nownot in her nightgown of course but properly dressed severely and from a height yet if he was kissing other girls he certainly would not care whether she lecture him or not he would laugh at her very good  she would go back to her studio and prepare pictures that went etc etc  the millwheel of thought swung round slowly that no section of it might be slurred over and the redhaired girl tossed and turned behind her  maisie put her chin in her hands and decided that there could be no doubt whatever of the villainy of dick to justify herself she began unwomanly to weigh the evidence there was a boy and he had said he loved her and he kissed herkissed her on the cheekby a yellow seapoppy that nodded its head exactly like the maddening dry rose in the garden then there was an interval and men had told her that they loved herjust when she was busiest with her work then the boy came back and at their very second meeting had told her that he loved her then he hadbut there was no end to the things he had done he had given her his time and his powers he had spoken to her of art housekeeping technique teacups the abuse of pickles as a stimulant that was rudesable hairbrusheshe had given her the best in her stock she used them daily he had given her advice that she profited by and now and againa look such a look the look of a beaten hound waiting for the word to crawl to his mistresss feet in return she had given him nothing whatever excepthere she brushed her mouth against the openwork sleeve of her nightgownthe privilege of kissing her once and on the mouth too disgraceful was that not enough and more than enough and if it was not had he not cancelled the debt by not writing andprobably kissing other girls maisie youll catch a chill do go and lie down said the wearied voice of her companion i cant sleep a wink with you at the window  maisie shrugged her shoulders and did not answer she was reflecting on the meannesses of dick and on other meannesses with which he had nothing to do the moonlight would not let her sleep it lay on the skylight of the studio across the road in cold silver she stared at it intently and her thoughts began to slide one into the other the shadow of the big bellhandle in the wall grew short lengthened again and faded out as the moon went down behind the pasture and a hare came limping home across the road then the dawnwind washed through the upland grasses and brought coolness with it and the cattle lowed by the droughtshrunk river maisies head fell forward on the window sill and the tangle of black hair covered her arms  maisie wake up youll catch a chill  yes dear yes dear she staggered to her bed like a wearied child and as she buried her face in the pillows she muttered i thinki thinkbut he ought to have written  day brought the routine of the studio the smell of paint and turpentine and the monotone wisdom of kami who was a leaden artist but a golden teacher if the pupil were only in sympathy with him maisie was not in sympathy that day and she waited impatiently for the end of the work  she knew when it was coming for kami would gather his black alpaca coat into a bunch behind him and with faded flue eyes that saw neither pupils nor canvas look back into the past to recall the history of one binat you have all done not so badly he would say but you shall remember that it is not enough to have the method and the art and the power nor even that which is touch but you shall have also the conviction that nails the work to the wall of the so many i taughthere the students would begin to unfix drawingpins or get their tubes togetherthe very so many that i have taught the best was binat all that comes of the study and the work and the knowledge was to him even when he came after he left me he should have done all that could be done with the colour the form and the knowledge only he had not the conviction so today i hear no more of binatthe best of my pupilsand that is long ago so today too you will be glad to hear no more of me continuez mesdemoiselles and above all with conviction  he went into the garden to smoke and mourn over the lost binat as the pupils dispersed to their several cottages or loitered in the studio to make plans for the cool of the afternoon  maisie looked at her very unhappy melancolia restrained a desire to grimace before it and was hurrying across the road to write a letter to dick when she was aware of a large man on a white troophorse how torpenhow had managed in the course of twenty hours to find his way to the hearts of the cavalry officers in quarters at vitrysurmarne to discuss with them the certainty of a glorious revenge for france to reduce the colonel to tears of pure affability and to borrow the best horse in the squadron for the journey to kamis studio is a mystery that only special correspondents can unravel  i beg your pardon said he it seems an absurd question to ask but the fact is that i dont know her by any other name is there any young lady here that is called maisie  i am maisie was the answer from the depths of a great sunhat  i ought to introduce myself he said as the horse capered in the blinding white dust my name is torpenhow dick heldar is my best friend andandthe fact is that he has gone blind  blind said maisie stupidly he cant be blind  he has been stoneblind for nearly two months  maisie lifted up her face and it was pearly white no no not blind i wont have him blind  would you care to see for yourself said torpenhow  nowat once  oh no the paris train doesnt go through this place till tonight there will be ample time  did mr heldar send you to me  certainly not dick wouldnt do that sort of thing hes sitting in his studio turning over some letters that he cant read because hes blind  there was a sound of choking from the sunhat maisie bowed her head and went into the cottage where the redhaired girl was on a sofa complaining of a headache  dicks blind said maisie taking her breath quickly as she steadied herself against a chairback my dicks blind  what the girl was on the sofa no longer  a man has come from england to tell me he hasnt written to me for six weeks  are you going to him  i must think  think i should go back to london and see him and i should kiss his eyes and kiss them and kiss them until they got well again if you dont go i shall oh what am i talking about you wicked little idiot go to him at once go  torpenhows neck was blistering but he preserved a smile of infinite patience as maisies appeared bareheaded in the sunshine  i am coming said she her eyes on the ground  you will be at vitry station then at seven this evening this was an order delivered by one who was used to being obeyed maisie said nothing but she felt grateful that there was no chance of disputing with this big man who took everything for granted and managed a squealing horse with one hand she returned to the redhaired girl who was weeping bitterly and between tears kissesvery few of thosementhol packing and an interview with kami the sultry afternoon wore away  thought might come afterwards her present duty was to go to dickdick who owned the wondrous friend and sat in the dark playing with her unopened letters  but what will you do she said to her companion  i oh i shall stay here andfinish your melancolia she said smiling pitifully write to me afterwards  that night there ran a legend through vitrysurmarne of a mad englishman doubtless suffering from sunstroke who had drunk all the officers of the garrison under the table had borrowed a horse from the lines and had then and there eloped after the english custom with one of those more mad english girls who drew pictures down there under the care of that good monsieur kami  they are very droll said suzanne to the conscript in the moonlight by the studio wall she walked always with those big eyes that saw nothing and yet she kisses me on both cheeks as though she were my sister and gives mesee ten francs  the conscript levied a contribution on both gifts for he prided himself on being a good soldier  torpenhow spoke very little to maisie during the journey to calais but he was careful to attend to all her wants to get her a compartment entirely to herself and to leave her alone he was amazed of the ease with which the matter had been accomplished  the safest thing would be to let her think things out by dicks showing when he was off his headshe must have ordered him about very thoroughly wonder how she likes being under orders  maisie never told she sat in the empty compartment often with her eyes shut that she might realise the sensation of blindness it was an order that she should return to london swiftly and she found herself at last almost beginning to enjoy the situation this was better than looking after luggage and a red haired friend who never took any interest in her surroundings but there appeared to be a feeling in the air that she maisieof all peoplewas in disgrace therefore she justified her conduct to herself with great success till torpenhow came up to her on the steamer and without preface began to tell the story of dicks blindness suppressing a few details but dwelling at length on the miseries of delirium he stopped before he reached the end as though he had lost interest in the subject and went forward to smoke maisie was furious with him and with herself  she was hurried on from dover to london almost before she could ask for breakfast andshe was past any feeling of indignation nowwas bidden curtly to wait in a hall at the foot of some leadcovered stairs while torpenhow went up to make inquiries again the knowledge that she was being treated like a naughty little girl made her pale cheeks flame it was all dicks fault for being so stupid as to go blind  torpenhow led her up to a shut door which he opened very softly dick was sitting by the window with his chin on his chest there were three envelopes in his hand and he turned them over and over the big man who gave orders was no longer by her side and the studio door snapped behind her  dick thrust the letters into his pocket as he heard the sound hullo torp is that you ive been so lonely  his voice had taken the peculiar flatness of the blind maisie pressed herself up into a corner of the room her heart was beating furiously and she put one hand on her breast to keep it quiet dick was staring directly at her and she realised for the first time that he was blind  shutting her eyes in a railway carriage to open them when she pleased was childs play this man was blind though his eyes were wide open  torp is that you they said you were coming dick looked puzzled and a little irritated at the silence  no its only me was the answer in a strained little whisper maisie could hardly move her lips  hm said dick composedly without moving this is a new phenomenon darkness im getting used to but i object to hearing voices  was he mad then as well as blind that he talked to himself maisies heart beat more wildly and she breathed in gasps dick rose and began to feel his way across the room touching each table and chair as he passed once he caught his foot on a rug and swore dropping on his knees to feel what the obstruction might be maisie remembered him walking in the park as though all the earth belonged to him tramping up and down her studio two months ago and flying up the gangway of the channel steamer the beating of her heart was making her sick and dick was coming nearer guided by the sound of her breathing she put out a hand mechanically to ward him off or to draw him to herself she did not know which it touched his chest and he stepped back as though he had been shot  its maisie said he with a dry sob what are you doing here  i camei cameto see you please  dicks lips closed firmly  wont you sit down then you see ive had some bother with my eyes and  i know i know why didnt you tell me  i couldnt write  you might have told mr torpenhow  what has he to do with my affairs  hehe brought me from vitrysurmarne he thought i ought to see you  why what has happened can i do anything for you no i cant i forgot  oh dick im so sorry ive come to tell you andlet me take you back to your chair  dont im not a child you only do that out of pity i never meant to tell you anything about it im no good now im down and done for let me alone  he groped back to his chair his chest labouring as he sat down  maisie watched him and the fear went out of her heart to be followed by a very bitter shame he had spoken a truth that had been hidden from the girl through every step of the impetuous flight to london for he was indeed down and done formasterful no longer but rather a little abject neither an artist stronger than she nor a man to be looked up toonly some blind one that sat in a chair and seemed on the point of crying she was immensely and unfeignedly sorry for himmore sorry than she had ever been for any one in her life but not sorry enough to deny his words  so she stood still and felt ashamed and a little hurt because she had honestly intended that her journey should end triumphantly and now she was only filled with pity most startlingly distinct from love  well said dick his face steadily turned away i never meant to worry you any more whats the matter  he was conscious that maisie was catching her breath but was as unprepared as herself for the torrent of emotion that followed she had dropped into a chair and was sobbing with her face hidden in her hands  i  canti  cant she cried desperately indeed i cant it isnt my fault im so sorry oh dickie im so sorry  dicks shoulders straightened again for the words lashed like a whip  still the sobbing continued it is not good to realise that you have failed in the hour of trial or flinched before the mere possibility of making sacrifices  i do despise myselfindeed i do but i cant oh dickie you wouldnt ask mewould you wailed maisie  she looked up for a minute and by chance it happened that dicks eyes fell on hers the unshaven face was very white and set and the lips were trying to force themselves into a smile but it was the wornout eyes that maisie feared her dick had gone blind and left in his place some one that she could hardly recognise till he spoke  who is asking you to do anything maisie i told you how it would be whats the use of worrying for pitys sake dont cry like that it isnt worth it  you dont know how i hate myself oh dick help mehelp me the passion of tears had grown beyond her control and was beginning to alarm the man he stumbled forward and put his arm round her and her head fell on his shoulder  hush dear hush dont cry youre quite right and youve nothing to reproach yourself withyou never had youre only a little upset by the journey and i dont suppose youve had any breakfast what a brute torp was to bring you over  i wanted to come i did indeed she protested  very well and now youve come and seen and imimmensely grateful when youre better you shall go away and get something to eat what sort of a passage did you have coming over  maisie was crying more subduedly for the first time in her life glad that she had something to lean against dick patted her on the shoulder tenderly but clumsily for he was not quite sure where her shoulder might be  she drew herself out of his arms at last and waited trembling and most unhappy he had felt his way to the window to put the width of the room between them and to quiet a little the tumult in his heart  are you better now he said  yes butdont you hate me  i hate you my god i  isntisnt there anything i could do for you then ill stay here in england to do it if you like perhaps i could come and see you sometimes  i think not dear it would be kindest not to see me any more please i dont want to seem rude butdont you thinkperhaps you had almost better go now  he was conscious that he could not bear himself as a man if the strain continued much longer  i dont deserve anything else ill go dick oh im so miserable  nonsense youve nothing to worry about id tell you if you had wait a moment dear ive got something to give you first i meant it for you ever since this little trouble began its my melancolia she was a beauty when i last saw her you can keep her for me and if ever youre poor you can sell her shes worth a few hundreds at any state of the market he groped among his canvases shes framed in black is this a black frame that i have my hand on there she is what do you think of her  he turned a scarred formless muddle of paint towards maisie and the eyes strained as though they would catch her wonder and surprise one thing and one thing only could she do for him  well  the voice was fuller and more rounded because the man knew he was speaking of his best work maisie looked at the blur and a lunatic desire to laugh caught her by the throat but for dicks sakewhatever this mad blankness might mean she must make no sign her voice choked with hardheld tears as she answered still gazing at the wreckoh dick it is good  he heard the little hysterical gulp and took it for tribute wont you have it then ill send it over to your house if you will  i oh yesthank you ha ha if she did not fly at once the laughter that was worse than tears would kill her she turned and ran choking and blinded down the staircases that were empty of life to take refuge in a cab and go to her house across the parks there she sat down in the dismantled drawingroom and thought of dick in his blindness useless till the end of life and of herself in her own eyes behind the sorrow the shame and the humiliation lay fear of the cold wrath of the redhaired girl when maisie should return maisie had never feared her companion before not until she found herself saying well he never asked me did she realise her scorn of herself and that is the end of maisie        for dick was reserved more searching torment he could not realise at first that maisie whom he had ordered to go had left him without a word of farewell he was savagely angry against torpenhow who had brought upon him this humiliation and troubled his miserable peace then his dark hour came and he was alone with himself and his desires to get what help he could from the darkness the queen could do no wrong but in following the right so far as it served her work she had wounded her one subject more than his own brain would let him know  its all i had and ive lost it he said as soon as the misery permitted clear thinking and torp will think that he has been so infernally clever that i shant have the heart to tell him i must think this out quietly  hullo said torpenhow entering the studio after dick had enjoyed two hours of thought im back are you feeling any better  torp i dont know what to say come here dick coughed huskily wondering indeed what he should say and how to say it temperately  whats the need for saying anything get up and tramp torpenhow was perfectly satisfied  they walked up and down as of custom torpenhows hand on dicks shoulder and dick buried in his own thoughts  how in the world did you find it all out said dick at last  you shouldnt go off your head if you want to keep secrets dickie it was absolutely impertinent on my part but if youd seen me rocketing about on a halftrained french troophorse under a blazing sun youd have laughed there will be a charivari in my rooms tonight seven other devils  i knowthe row in the southern soudan i surprised their councils the other day and it made me unhappy have you fixed your flint to go who dyou work for  havent signed any contracts yet i wanted to see how your business would turn out  would you have stayed with me then ifthings had gone wrong he put his question cautiously  dont ask me too much im only a man  youve tried to be an angel very successfully  oh yees    well do you attend the function tonight we shall be half screwed before the morning all the men believe the wars a certainty  i dont think i will old man if its all the same to you ill stay quiet here  and meditate i dont blame you you observe a good time if ever a man did  that night there was a tumult on the stairs the correspondents poured in from theatre dinner and musichall to torpenhows room that they might discuss their plan of campaign in the event of military operations becoming a certainty torpenhow the keneu and the nilghai had bidden all the men they had worked with to the orgy and mr beeton the housekeeper declared that never before in his checkered experience had he seen quite such a fancy lot of gentlemen they waked the chambers with shoutings and song and the elder men were quite as bad as the younger for the chances of war were in front of them and all knew what those meant  sitting in his own room a little perplexed by the noise across the landing dick suddenly began to laugh to himself  when one comes to think of it the situation is intensely comic maisies quite rightpoor little thing i didnt know she could cry like that before but now i know what torp thinks im sure hed be quite fool enough to stay at home and try to console meif he knew besides it isnt nice to own that youve been thrown over like a broken chair i must carry this business through aloneas usual if there isnt a war and torp finds out i shall look foolish thats all if there is a way i mustnt interfere with another mans chances business is business and i want to be alonei want to be alone what a row theyre making  somebody hammered at the studio door  come out and frolic dickie said the nilghai  i should like to but i cant im not feeling frolicsome  then ill tell the boys and theyll drag you like a badger  please not old man on my word id sooner be left alone just now  very good can we send anything in to you fizz for instance cassavetti is beginning to sing songs of the sunny south already  for one minute dick considered the proposition seriously  no thanks ive a headache already  virtuous child thats the effect of emotion on the young all my congratulations dick i also was concerned in the conspiracy for your welfare  go to the deviloh send binkie in here  the little dog entered on elastic feet riotous from having been made much of all the evening he had helped to sing the choruses but scarcely inside the studio he realised that this was no place for tailwagging and settled himself on dicks lap till it was bedtime then he went to bed with dick who counted every hour as it struck and rose in the morning with a painfully clear head to receive torpenhows more formal congratulations and a particular account of the last nights revels  you arent looking very happy for a newly accepted man said torpenhow  never mind thatits my own affair and im all right do you really go  yes with the old central southern as usual they wired and i accepted on better terms than before  when do you start  the day after tomorrowfor brindisi  thank god dick spoke from the bottom of his heart  well thats not a pretty way of saying youre glad to get rid of me but men in your condition are allowed to be selfish  i didnt mean that will you get a hundred pounds cashed for me before you leave  thats a slender amount for housekeeping isnt it  oh its only formarriage expenses  torpenhow brought him the money counted it out in fives and tens and carefully put it away in the writing table  now i suppose i shall have to listen to his ravings about his girl until i go heaven send us patience with a man in love he said to himself  but never a word did dick say of maisie or marriage he hung in the doorway of torpenhows room when the latter was packing and asked innumerable questions about the coming campaign till torpenhow began to feel annoyed  youre a secretive animal dickie and you consume your own smoke dont you he said on the last evening  ii suppose so by the way how long do you think this war will last  days weeks or months one can never tell it may go on for years  i wish i were going  good heavens youre the most unaccountable creature hasnt it occurred to you that youre going to be marriedthanks to me  of course yes im going to be marriedso i am going to be married im awfully grateful to you havent i told you that  you might be going to be hanged by the look of you said torpenhow  and the next day torpenhow bade him goodbye and left him to the loneliness he had so much desired  chapter xiv  yet at the last ere our spearmen had found him yet at the last ere a swordthrust could save yet at the last with his masters around him he of the faith spoke as master to slave yet at the last tho the kafirs had maimed him broken by bondage and wrecked by the reiver yet at the last tho the darkness had claimed him he called upon allah and died a believerkizzilbashi  beg your pardon mr heldar butbut isntn othin going to happen said mr beeton  no dick had just waked to another morning of blank despair and his temper was of the shortest  taint my regular business o course sir and what i say is mind your own business and let other people mind theirs but just before mr torpenhow went away he give me to understand like that you might be moving into a house of your own so to speaka sort of house with rooms upstairs and downstairs where youd be better attended to though i try to act just by all our tenants dont i  ah that must have been a madhouse i shant trouble you to take me there yet get me my breakfast please and leave me alone  i hope i havent done anything wrong sir but you know i hope that as far as a man can i tries to do the proper thing by all the gentlemen in chambersand more particular those whose lot is hardsuch as you for instance mr heldar you likes softroe bloater dont you softroe bloaters is scarcer than hard roe but what i says is never mind a little extra trouble so long as you give satisfaction to the tenants  mr beeton withdrew and left dick to himself torpenhow had been long away there was no more rioting in the chambers and dick had settled down to his new life which he was weak enough to consider nothing better than death  it is hard to live alone in the dark confusing the day and night dropping to sleep through sheer weariness at midday and rising restless in the chill of the dawn at first dick on his awakenings would grope along the corridors of the chambers till he heard some one snore then he would know that the day had not yet come and return wearily to his bedroom  later he learned not to stir till there was a noise and movement in the house and mr beeton advised him to get up once dressedand dressing now that torpenhow was away was a lengthy business because collars ties and the like hid themselves in far corners of the room and search meant headbeating against chairs and trunksonce dressed there was nothing whatever to do except to sit still and brood till the three daily meals came centuries separated breakfast from lunch and lunch from dinner and though a man prayed for hundreds of years that his mind might be taken from him god would never hear rather the mind was quickened and the revolving thoughts ground against each other as millstones grind when there is no corn between and yet the brain would not wear out and give him rest it continued to think at length with imagery and all manner of reminiscences it recalled maisie and past success reckless travels by land and sea the glory of doing work and feeling that it was good and suggested all that might have happened had the eyes only been faithful to their duty when thinking ceased through sheer weariness there poured into dicks soul tide on tide of overwhelming purposeless feardread of starvation always terror lest the unseen ceiling should crush down upon him fear of fire in the chambers and a louses death in red flame and agonies of fiercer horror that had nothing to do with any fear of death then dick bowed his head and clutching the arms of his chair fought with his sweating self till the tinkle of plates told him that something to eat was being set before him  mr beeton would bring the meal when he had time to spare and dick learned to hang upon his speech which dealt with badly fitted gasplugs wastepipes out of repair little tricks for driving picturenails into walls and the sins of the charwoman or the housemaids in the lack of better things the small gossip of a servants hall becomes immensely interesting and the screwing of a washer on a tap an event to be talked over for days  once or twice a week too mr beeton would take dick out with him when he went marketing in the morning to haggle with tradesmen over fish lampwicks mustard tapioca and so forth while dick rested his weight first on one foot and then on the other and played aimlessly with the tins and stringball on the counter then they would perhaps meet one of mr beetons friends and dick standing aside a little would hold his peace till mr beeton was willing to go on again  the life did not increase his selfrespect he abandoned shaving as a dangerous exercise and being shaved in a barbers shop meant exposure of his infirmity he could not see that his clothes were properly brushed and since he had never taken any care of his personal appearance he became every known variety of sloven a blind man cannot deal with cleanliness till he has been some months used to the darkness if he demand attendance and grow angry at the want of it he must assert himself and stand upright then the meanest menial can see that he is blind and therefore of no consequence a wise man will keep his eyes on the floor and sit still for amusement he may pick coal lump by lump out of the scuttle with the tongs and pile it in a little heap in the fender keeping count of the lumps which must all be put back again one by one and very carefully he may set himself sums if he cares to work them out he may talk to himself or to the cat if she chooses to visit him and if his trade has been that of an artist he may sketch in the air with his forefinger but that is too much like drawing a pig with the eyes shut he may go to his bookshelves and count his books ranging them in order of their size or to his wardrobe and count his shirts laying them in piles of two or three on the bed as they suffer from frayed cuffs or lost buttons  even this entertainment wearies after a time and all the times are very very long  dick was allowed to sort a toolchest where mr beeton kept hammers taps and nuts lengths of gaspipes oilbottles and string  if i dont have everything just where i know where to look for it why then i cant find anything when i do want it youve no idea sir the amount of little things that these chambers uses up said mr beeton  fumbling at the handle of the door as he went out its hard on you sir i do think its hard on you aint you going to do anything sir  ill pay my rent and messing isnt that enough  i wasnt doubting for a moment that you couldnt pay your way sir but i ave often said to my wife its ard on im because it isnt as if he was an old man nor yet a middleaged one but quite a young gentleman thats where it comes so ard  i suppose so said dick absently this particular nerve through long battering had ceased to feelmuch  i was thinking continued mr beeton still making as if to go that you might like to hear my boy alf read you the papers sometimes of an evening he do read beautiful seeing hes only nine  i should be very grateful said dick only let me make it worth his while  we wasnt thinking of that sir but of course its in your own ands but only to ear alf sing a boys best friend is is mother ah  ill hear him sing that too let him come this evening with the newspapers  alf was not a nice child being puffed up with many schoolboard certificates for good conduct and inordinately proud of his singing mr beeton remained beaming while the child wailed his way through a song of some eight eightline verses in the usual whine of a young cockney and after compliments left him to read dick the foreign telegrams ten minutes later alf returned to his parents rather pale and scared  e said e couldnt stand it no more he explained  he never said you read badly alf mrs beeton spoke  no e said i read beautiful said e never eard any one read like that but e said e couldnt abide the stuff in the papers  praps hes lost some money in the stocks were you readin him about stocks alf  no it was all about fightin out there where the soldiers is gonea great long piece with all the lines close together and very hard words in it e give me arf a crown because i read so well and e says the next time theres anything e wants read ell send for me  thats good hearing but i do think for all the halfcrownput it into the kickingdonkey moneybox alf and let me see you do ithe might have kept you longer why he couldnt have begun to understand how beautiful you read  hes best left to hisselfgentlemen always are when theyre downhearted said mr beeton  alfs rigorously limited powers of comprehending torpenhows special correspondence had waked the devil of unrest in dick he could hear through the boys nasal chant the camels grunting in the squares behind the soldiers outside suakin could hear the men swearing and chaffing across the cooking pots and could smell the acrid woodsmoke as it drifted over camp before the wind of the desert  that night he prayed to god that his mind might be taken from him offering for proof that he was worthy of this favour the fact that he had not shot himself long ago that prayer was not answered and indeed dick knew in his heart of hearts that only a lingering sense of humour and no special virtue had kept him alive suicide he had persuaded himself would be a ludicrous insult to the gravity of the situation as well as a weakkneed confession of fear  just for the fun of the thing he said to the cat who had taken binkies place in his establishment i should like to know how long this is going to last i can live for a year on the hundred pounds torp cashed for me i must have two or three thousand at least in the banktwenty or thirty years more provided for that is to say then i fall back on my hundred and twenty a year which will be more by that time lets consider  twentyfivethirtyfivea mans in his prime then they sayfortyfivea middleaged man just entering politicsfiftyfive died at the comparatively early age of fiftyfive according to the newspapers bah how these christians funk death sixtyfivewere only getting on in years seventyfive is just possible though great hell cat o fifty years more of solitary confinement in the dark youll die and beeton will die and torp will die and maieverybody else will die but i shall be alive and kicking with nothing to do im very sorry for myself i should like some one else to be sorry for me evidently im not going mad before i die but the pains just as bad as ever some day when youre vivisected cat o theyll tie you down on a little table and cut you openbut dont be afraid theyll take precious good care that you dont die youll live and youll be very sorry then that you werent sorry for me perhaps torp will come back or    i wish i could go to torp and the nilghai even though i were in their way  pussy left the room before the speech was ended and alf as he entered found dick addressing the empty hearthrug  theres a letter for you sir he said perhaps youd like me to read it  lend it to me for a minute and ill tell you  the outstretched hand shook just a little and the voice was not oversteady it was within the limits of human possibility thatthat was no letter from maisie he knew the heft of three closed envelopes only too well it was a foolish hope that the girl should write to him for he did not realise that there is a wrong which admits of no reparation though the evildoer may with tears and the hearts best love strive to mend all it is best to forget that wrong whether it be caused or endured since it is as remediless as bad work once put forward  read it then said dick and alf began intoning according to the rules of the board schooli could have given you love i could have given you loyalty such as you never dreamed of do you suppose i cared what you were but you chose to whistle everything down the wind for nothing my only excuse for you is that you are so young thats all he said returning the paper to be dropped into the fire  what was in the letter asked mrs beeton when alf returned  i dont know i think it was a circular or a tract about not whistlin at everything when youre young  i must have stepped on something when i was alive and walking about and it has bounced up and hit me god help it whatever it isunless it was all a joke but i dont know any one whod take the trouble to play a joke on melove and loyalty for nothing it sounds tempting enough i wonder whether i have lost anything really  dick considered for a long time but could not remember when or how he had put himself in the way of winning these trifles at a womans hands  still the letter as touching on matters that he preferred not to think about stung him into a fit of frenzy that lasted for a day and night when his heart was so full of despair that it would hold no more body and soul together seemed to be dropping without check through the darkness  then came fear of darkness and desperate attempts to reach the light again but there was no light to be reached when that agony had left him sweating and breathless the downward flight would recommence till the gathering torture of it spurred him into another fight as hopeless as the first followed some few minutes of sleep in which he dreamed that he saw then the procession of events would repeat itself till he was utterly worn out and the brain took up its everlasting consideration of maisie and mighthavebeens  at the end of everything mr beeton came to his room and volunteered to take him out not marketing this time but well go into the parks if you like  be damned if i do quoth dick keep to the streets and walk up and down i like to hear the people round me  this was not altogether true the blind in the first stages of their infirmity dislike those who can move with a free stride and unlifted armsbut dick had no earthly desire to go to the parks once and only once since maisie had shut her door he had gone there under alfs charge alf forgot him and fished for minnows in the serpentine with some companions after half an hours waiting dick almost weeping with rage and wrath caught a passerby who introduced him to a friendly policeman who led him to a fourwheeler opposite the albert hall he never told mr beeton of alfs forgetfulness but    this was not the manner in which he was used to walk the parks aforetime  what streets would you like to walk down then said mr beeton sympathetically his own ideas of a riotous holiday meant picnicking on the grass of green park with his family and half a dozen paper bags full of food  keep to the river said dick and they kept to the river and the rush of it was in his ears till they came to blackfriars bridge and struck thence on to the waterloo road mr beeton explaining the beauties of the scenery as he went on  and walking on the other side of the pavement said he unless im much mistaken is the young woman that used to come to your rooms to be drawed i never forgets a face and i never remembers a name except paying tenants o course  stop her said dick its bessie broke tell her id like to speak to her again quick man  mr beeton crossed the road under the noses of the omnibuses and arrested bessie then on her way northward she recognised him as the man in authority who used to glare at her when she passed up dicks staircase and her first impulse was to run  wasnt you mr heldars model said mr beeton planting himself in front of her you was hes on the other side of the road and hed like to see you  why said bessie faintly she rememberedindeed had never for long forgottenan affair connected with a newly finished picture  because he has asked me to do so and because hes most particular blind  drunk  no orspital blind he cant see thats him over there  dick was leaning against the parapet of the bridge as mr beeton pointed him outa stubbearded bowed creature wearing a dirty magentacoloured neckcloth outside an unbrushed coat there was nothing to fear from such an one even if he chased her bessie thought he could not follow far she crossed over and dicks face lighted up it was long since a woman of any kind had taken the trouble to speak to him  i hope youre well mr heldar said bessie a little puzzled mr beeton stood by with the air of an ambassador and breathed responsibly  im very well indeed and by jove im glad to seehear you i mean bess you never thought it worth while to turn up and see us again after you got your money i dont know why you should are you going anywhere in particular just now  i was going for a walk said bessie  not the old business dick spoke under his breath  lor no i paid my premiumbessie was very proud of that wordfor a barmaid sleeping in and im at the bar now quite respectable indeed i am  mr beeton had no special reason to believe in the loftiness of human nature therefore he dissolved himself like a mist and returned to his gasplugs without a word of apology bessie watched the flight with a certain uneasiness but so long as dick appeared to be ignorant of the harm that had been done to him     its hard work pulling the beerhandles she went on and theyve got one of them pennyintheslot cashmachines so if you get wrong by a penny at the end of the daybut then i dont believe the machinery is right do you  ive only seen it work mr beeton  hes gone  im afraid i must ask you to help me home then ill make it worth your while you see the sightless eyes turned towards her and bessie saw  it isnt taking you out of your way he said hesitatingly i can ask a policeman if it is  not at all i come on at seven and im off at four thats easy hours  good godbut im on all the time i wish i had some work to do too lets go home bess  he turned and cannoned into a man on the sidewalk recoiling with an oath bessie took his arm and said nothingas she had said nothing when he had ordered her to turn her face a little more to the light they walked for some time in silence the girl steering him deftly through the crowd  and whereswheres mr torpenhow she inquired at last  he has gone away to the desert  wheres that  dick pointed to the right eastout of the mouth of the river said he  then west then south and then east again all along the underside of europe then south again god knows how far the explanation did not enlighten bessie in the least but she held her tongue and looked to dicks patch till they came to the chambers  well have tea and muffins he said joyously i cant tell you bessie how glad i am to find you again what made you go away so suddenly  i didnt think youd want me any more she said emboldened by his ignorance  i didnt as a matter of factbut afterwardsat any rate im glad youve come you know the stairs  so bessie led him home to his own placethere was no one to hinderand shut the door of the studio  what a mess was her first word all these things havent been looked after for months and months  no only weeks bess you cant expect them to care  i dont know what you expect them to do they ought to know what youve paid them for the dusts just awful its all over the easel  i dont use it much now  all over the pictures and the floor and all over your coat id like to speak to them housemaids  ring for tea then dick felt his way to the one chair he used by custom  bessie saw the action and as far as in her lay was touched but there remained always a keen sense of newfound superiority and it was in her voice when she spoke  how long have you been like this she said wrathfully as though the blindness were some fault of the housemaids  how  as you are  the day after you went away with the check almost as soon as my picture was finished i hardly saw her alive  then theyve been cheating you ever since thats all i know their nice little ways  a woman may love one man and despise another but on general feminine principles she will do her best to save the man she despises from being defrauded her loved one can look to himself but the other man being obviously an idiot needs protection  i dont think mr beeton cheats much said dick bessie was flouncing up and down the room and he was conscious of a keen sense of enjoyment as he heard the swish of her skirts and the light step between  tea and muffins she said shortly when the ring at the bell was answered two teaspoonfuls and one over for the pot i dont want the old teapot that was here when i used to come it dont draw get another  the housemaid went away scandalised and dick chuckled then he began to cough as bessie banged up and down the studio disturbing the dust  what are you trying to do  put things straight this is like unfurnished lodgings how could you let it go so  how could i help it dust away  she dusted furiously and in the midst of all the pother entered mrs beeton her husband on his return had explained the situation winding up with the peculiarly felicitous proverb do unto others as you would be done by she had descended to put into her place the person who demanded muffins and an uncracked teapot as though she had a right to both  muffins ready yet said bess still dusting she was no longer a drab of the streets but a young lady who thanks to dicks check had paid her premium and was entitled to pull beerhandles with the best being neatly dressed in black she did not hesitate to face mrs beeton and there passed between the two women certain regards that dick would have appreciated the situation adjusted itself by eye bessie had won and mrs beeton returned to cook muffins and make scathing remarks about models hussies trollops and the like to her husband  theres nothing to be got of interfering with him liza he said alf you go along into the street to play when he isnt crossed hes as kindly as kind but when hes crossed hes the devil and all we took too many little things out of his rooms since he was blind to be that particular about what he does they aint no objects to a blind man of course but if it was to come into court wed get the sack yes i did introduce him to that girl because im a feelin man myself  much too feelin mrs beeton slapped the muffins into the dish and thought of comely housemaids long since dismissed on suspicion  i aint ashamed of it and it isnt for us to judge him hard so long as he pays quiet and regular as he do i know how to manage young gentlemen you know how to cook for them and what i says is let each stick to his own business and then there wont be any trouble take them muffins down liza and be sure you have no words with that young woman his lot is cruel hard and if hes crossed he do swear worse than any one ive ever served  thats a little better said bessie sitting down to the tea you neednt wait thank you mrs beeton  i had no intention of doing such i do assure you  bessie made no answer whatever this she knew was the way in which real ladies routed their foes and when one is a barmaid at a firstclass public house one may become a real lady at ten minutes notice  her eyes fell on dick opposite her and she was both shocked and displeased there were droppings of food all down the front of his coat the mouth under the ragged illgrown beard drooped sullenly the forehead was lined and contracted and on the lean temples the hair was a dusty indeterminate colour that might or might not have been called gray the utter misery and self abandonment of the man appealed to her and at the bottom of her heart lay the wicked feeling that he was humbled and brought low who had once humbled her  oh it is good to hear you moving about said dick rubbing his hands tell us all about your bar successes bessie and the way you live now  never mind that im quite respectable as youd see by looking at me you dont seem to live too well what made you go blind that sudden why isnt there any one to look after you  dick was too thankful for the sound of her voice to resent the tone of it  i was cut across the head a long time ago and that ruined my eyes i dont suppose anybody thinks it worth while to look after me any more why should theyand mr beeton really does everything i want  dont you know any gentlemen and ladies then while you waswell  a few but i dont care to have them looking at me  i suppose thats why youve growed a beard take it off it dont become you  good gracious child do you imagine that i think of what becomes of me these days  you ought get that taken off before i come here again i suppose i can come cant i  id be only too grateful if you did i dont think i treated you very well in the old days i used to make you angry  very angry you did  im sorry for it then come and see me when you can and as often as you can god knows there isnt a soul in the world to take that trouble except you and mr beeton  a lot of trouble hes taking and she too this with a toss of the head  theyve let you do anyhow and they havent done anything for you ive only to look and see that much ill come and ill be glad to come but you must go and be shaved and you must get some other clothesthose ones arent fit to be seen  i have heaps somewhere he said helplessly  i know you have tell mr beeton to give you a new suit and ill brush it and keep it clean you may be as blind as a barndoor mr heldar but it doesnt excuse you looking like a sweep  do i look like a sweep then  oh im sorry for you im that sorry for you she cried impulsively and took dicks hands mechanically he lowered his head as if to kissshe was the only woman who had taken pity on him and he was not too proud for a little pity now she stood up to go  nothing o that kind till you look more like a gentleman its quite easy when you get shaved and some clothes  he could hear her drawing on her gloves and rose to say goodbye she passed behind him kissed him audaciously on the back of the neck and ran away as swiftly as on the day when she had destroyed the melancolia  to think of me kissing mr heldar she said to herself after all hes done to me and all well im sorry for him and if he was shaved he wouldnt be so bad to look at but    oh them beetons how shameful theyve treated him i know beetons wearing his shirt on his back today just as well as if id aired it tomorrow ill see    i wonder if he has much of his own it might be worth more than the bari wouldnt have to do any workand just as respectable as if no one knew  dick was not grateful to bessie for her parting gift he was acutely conscious of it in the nape of his neck throughout the night but it seemed among very many other things to enforce the wisdom of getting shaved  he was shaved accordingly in the morning and felt the better for it a fresh suit of clothes white linen and the knowledge that some one in the world said that she took an interest in his personal appearance made him carry himself almost upright for the brain was relieved for a while from thinking of maisie who under other circumstances might have given that kiss and a million others  let us consider said he after lunch the girl cant care and its a toss up whether she comes again or not but if money can buy her to look after me she shall be bought nobody else in the world would take the trouble and i can make it worth her while shes a child of the gutter holding brevet rank as a barmaid so she shall have everything she wants if shell only come and talk and look after me he rubbed his newly shorn chin and began to perplex himself with the thought of her not coming i suppose i did look rather a sweep he went on i had no reason to look otherwise i knew things dropped on my clothes but it didnt matter it would be cruel if she didnt come she must maisie came once and that was enough for her she was quite right she had something to work for this creature has only beerhandles to pull unless she has deluded some young man into keeping company with her fancy being cheated for the sake of a counterjumper were falling pretty low  something cried aloud within himthis will hurt more than anything that has gone before it will recall and remind and suggest and tantalise and in the end drive you mad  i know it i know it dick cried clenching his hands despairingly but good heavens is a poor blind beggar never to get anything out of his life except three meals a day and a greasy waistcoat i wish shed come  early in the afternoon time she came because there was no young man in her life just then and she thought of material advantages which would allow her to be idle for the rest of her days  i shouldnt have known you she said approvingly you look as you used to looka gentleman that was proud of himself  dont you think i deserve another kiss then said dick flushing a little  maybebut you wont get it yet sit down and lets see what i can do for you im certain sure mr beeton cheats you now that you cant go through the housekeeping books every month isnt that true  youd better come and housekeep for me then bessie  couldnt do it in these chambersyou know that as well as i do  i know but we might go somewhere else if you thought it worth your while  id try to look after you anyhow but i shouldnt care to have to work for both of us this was tentative  dick laughed  do you remember where i used to keep my bankbook said he torp took it to be balanced just before he went away look and see  it was generally under the tobaccojar ah  well  oh four thousand two hundred and ten pounds nine shillings and a penny oh my  you can have the penny thats not bad for one years work is that and a hundred and twenty pounds a year good enough  the idleness and the pretty clothes were almost within her reach now but she must by being housewifely show that she deserved them  yes but youd have to move and if we took an inventory i think wed find that mr beeton has been prigging little things out of the rooms here and there they dont look as full as they used  never mind well let him have them the only thing im particularly anxious to take away is that picture i used you forwhen you used to swear at me well pull out of this place bess and get away as far as ever we can  oh yes she said uneasily  i dont know where i can go to get away from myself but ill try and you shall have all the pretty frocks that you care for youll like that give me that kiss now bess ye gods its good to put ones arm round a womans waist again  then came the fulfilment of the prophecy within the brain if his arm were thus round maisies waist and a kiss had just been given and taken between them why then    he pressed the girl more closely to himself because the pain whipped him she was wondering how to explain a little accident to the melancolia at any rate if this man really desired the solace of her company and certainly he would relapse into his original slough if she withdrew ithe would not be more than just a little vexed  it would be delightful at least to see what would happen and by her teachings it was good for a man to stand in certain awe of his companion  she laughed nervously and slipped out of his reach  i shouldnt worrit about that picture if i was you she began in the hope of turning his attention  its at the back of all my canvases somewhere find it bess you know it as well as i do  i knowbut  but what youve wit enough to manage the sale of it to a dealer women haggle much better than men it might be a matter of eight or nine hundred pounds to to us i simply didnt like to think about it for a long time it was mixed up with my life sobut well cover up our tracks and get rid of everything eh make a fresh start from the beginning bess  then she began to repent very much indeed because she knew the value of money still it was probable that the blind man was overestimating the value of his work gentlemen she knew were absurdly particular about their things she giggled as a nervous housemaid giggles when she tries to explain the breakage of a pipe  im very sorry but you remember i wasi was angry with you before mr torpenhow went away  you were very angry child and on my word i think you had some right to be  then ibut arent you sure mr torpenhow didnt tell you  tell me what good gracious what are you making such a fuss about when you might just as well be giving me another kiss  he was beginning to learn not for the first time in his experience that kissing is a cumulative poison the more you get of it the more you want  bessie gave the kiss promptly whispering as she did so i was so angry i rubbed out that picture with the turpentine you arent angry are you  what say that again the mans hand had closed on her wrist  i rubbed it out with turps and the knife faltered bessie i thought youd only have to do it over again you did do it over again didnt you oh let go of my wrist youre hurting me  isnt there anything left of the thing  nnothing that looks like anything im sorryi didnt know youd take on about it i only meant to do it in fun you arent going to hit me  hit you no lets think  he did not relax his hold upon her wrist but stood staring at the carpet  then he shook his head as a young steer shakes it when the lash of the stock whip cross his nose warns him back to the path on to the shambles that he would escape for weeks he had forced himself not to think of the melancolia because she was a part of his dead life with bessies return and certain new prospects that had developed themselves the melancolialovelier in his imagination than she had ever been on canvasreappeared by her aid he might have procured more money wherewith to amuse bess and to forget maisie as well as another taste of an almost forgotten success now thanks to a vicious little housemaids folly there was nothing to look fornot even the hope that he might some day take an abiding interest in the housemaid worst of all he had been made to appear ridiculous in maisies eyes a woman will forgive the man who has ruined her lifes work so long as he gives her love a man may forgive those who ruin the love of his life but he will never forgive the destruction of his work  tcktcktck said dick between his teeth and then laughed softly its an omen bessie anda good many things considered it serves me right for doing what i have done by jove that accounts for maisies running away she must have thought me perfectly madsmall blame to her the whole picture ruined isnt it so what made you do it  because i was that angry im not angry nowim awful sorry  i wonderit doesnt matter anyhow im to blame for making the mistake  what mistake  something you wouldnt understand dear great heavens to think that a little piece of dirt like you could throw me out of stride dick was talking to himself as bessie tried to shake off his grip on her wrist  i aint a piece of dirt and you shouldnt call me so i did it cause i hated you and im only sorry now cause youre cause youre  exactlybecause im blind theres noting like tact in little things  bessie began to sob she did not like being shackled against her will she was afraid of the blind face and the look upon it and was sorry too that her great revenge had only made dick laugh  dont cry he said and took her into his arms you only did what you thought right  ii aint a little piece of dirt and if you say that ill never come to you again  you dont know what youve done to me im not angryindeed im not be quiet for a minute  bessie remained in his arms shrinking dicks first thought was connected with maisie and it hurt him as whitehot iron hurts an open sore  not for nothing is a man permitted to ally himself to the wrong woman  the first pangthe first sense of things lost is but the prelude to the play for the very just providence who delights in causing pain has decreed that the agony shall return and that in the midst of keenest pleasure  they know this pain equally who have forsaken or been forsaken by the love of their life and in their new wives arms are compelled to realise it  it is better to remain alone and suffer only the misery of being alone so long as it is possible to find distraction in daily work when that resource goes the man is to be pitied and left alone  these things and some others dick considered while he was holding bessie to his heart  though you maynt know it he said raising his head the lord is a just and a terrible god bess with a very strong sense of humour it serves me right how it serves me right torp could understand it if he were here he must have suffered something at your hands child but only for a minute or so i saved him set that to my credit some one  let me go said bess her face darkening let me go  all in good time did you ever attend sunday school  never let me go i tell you youre making fun of me  indeed im not im making fun of myself    thus he saved others himself he cannot save it isnt exactly a schoolboard text he released her wrist but since he was between her and the door she could not escape what an enormous amount of mischief one little woman can do  im sorry im awful sorry about the picture  im not im grateful to you for spoiling it    what were we talking about before you mentioned the thing  about getting awayand money me and you going away  of course we will get awaythat is to say i will  and me  you shall have fifty whole pounds for spoiling a picture  then you wont  im afraid not dear think of fifty pounds for pretty things all to yourself  you said you couldnt do anything without me  that was true a little while ago im better now thank you get me my hat  spose i dont  beeton will and youll lose fifty pounds thats all get it  bessie cursed under her breath she had pitied the man sincerely had kissed him with almost equal sincerity for he was not unhandsome it pleased her to be in a way and for a time his protector and above all there were four thousand pounds to be handled by some one now through a slip of the tongue and a little feminine desire to give a little not too much pain she had lost the money the blessed idleness and the pretty things the companionship and the chance of looking outwardly as respectable as a real lady  now fill me a pipe tobacco doesnt taste but it doesnt matter and ill think things out whats the day of the week bess  tuesday  then thursdays mailday what a foolwhat a blind fool i have been twenty two pounds covers my passage home again allow ten for additional expenses we must put up at madam binats for old times sake thirtytwo pounds altogether add a hundred for the cost of the last tripgad wont torp stare to see me a hundred and thirtytwo leaves seventyeight for

and the checkbook stop a minute four thousand pounds at four per centthats safe interestmeans a hundred and sixty pounds a year one hundred and twenty pounds a yearalso safeis two eighty and two hundred and eighty pounds added to three hundred a year means gilded luxury for a single woman bess well go to the bank  richer by two hundred and ten pounds stored in his moneybelt dick caused bessie now thoroughly bewildered to hurry from the bank to the p and o offices where he explained things tersely  port said single first cabin as close to the baggagehatch as possible what ships going  the colgong said the clerk  shes a wet little hooker is it tilbury and a tender or galleons and the docks  galleons twelveforty thursday  thanks change please i cant see very wellwill you count it into my hand  if they all took their passages like that instead of talking about their trunks life would be worth something said the clerk to his neighbour who was trying to explain to a harassed mother of many that condensed milk is just as good for babes at sea as daily dairy being nineteen and unmarried he spoke with conviction  we are now quoth dick as they returned to the studio patting the place where his moneybelt covered ticket and money beyond the reach of man or devil or womanwhich is much more important ive had three little affairs to carry through before thursday but i neednt ask you to help bess come here on thursday morning at nine well breakfast and you shall take me down to galleons station  what are you going to do  going away of course what should i stay for  but you cant look after yourself  i can do anything i didnt realise it before but i can ive done a great deal already resolution shall be treated to one kiss if bessie doesnt object strangely enough bessie objected and dick laughed i suppose youre right well come at nine the day after tomorrow and youll get your money  shall i sure  i dont bilk and you wont know whether i do or not unless you come oh but its long and long to wait goodbye bessiesend beeton here as you go out  the housekeeper came  what are all the fittings of my rooms worth said dick imperiously  tisnt for me to say sir some things is very pretty and some is wore out dreadful  im insured for two hundred and seventy  insurance policies is no criterion though i dont say  oh damn your longwindedness youve made your pickings out of me and the other tenants why you talked of retiring and buying a publichouse the other day give a straight answer to a straight question  fifty said mr beeton without a moments hesitation  double it or ill break up half my sticks and burn the rest  he felt his way to a bookstand that supported a pile of sketchbooks and wrenched out one of the mahogany pillars  thats sinful sir said the housekeeper alarmed  its my own one hundred or  one hundred it is itll cost me three and six to get that there pilaster mended  i thought so what an out and out swindler you must have been to spring that price at once  i hope ive done nothing to dissatisfy any of the tenants least of all you sir  never mind that get me the money tomorrow and see that all my clothes are packed in the little brown bullocktrunk im going  but the quarters notice  ill pay forfeit look after the packing and leave me alone  mr beeton discussed this new departure with his wife who decided that bessie was at the bottom of it all her husband took a more charitable view  its very suddenbut then he was always sudden in his ways listen to him now  there was a sound of chanting from dicks room  well never come back any more boys well never come back no more well go to the deuce on any excuse and never come back no more oh say were afloat or ashore boys oh say were afloat or ashore but well never come back any more boys well never come back no more  mr beeton mr beeton where the deuce is my pistol  quick hes going to shoot himself avin gone mad said mrs beeton  mr beeton addressed dick soothingly but it was some time before the latter threshing up and down his bedroom could realise the intention of the promises to find everything tomorrow sir  oh you coppernosed old foolyou impotent academician he shouted at last do you suppose i want to shoot myself take the pistol in your silly shaking hand then if you touch it it will go off because its loaded its among my campaignkit somewherein the parcel at the bottom of the trunk  long ago dick had carefully possessed himself of a fortypound weight field equipment constructed by the knowledge of his own experience it was this put away treasure that he was trying to find and rehandle mr beeton whipped the revolver out of its place on the top of the package and dick drove his hand among the khaki coat and breeches the blue cloth legbands and the heavy flannel shirts doubled over a pair of swanneck spurs under these and the waterbottle lay a sketchbook and a pigskin case of stationery  these we dont want you can have them mr beeton everything else ill keep pack em on the top righthand side of my trunk when youve done that come into the studio with your wife i want you both wait a minute get me a pen and a sheet of notepaper  it is not an easy thing to write when you cannot see and dick had particular reasons for wishing that his work should be clear so he began following his right hand with his left the badness of this writing is because i am blind and cannot see my pen hmpheven a lawyer cant mistake that it must be signed i suppose but it neednt be witnessed now an inch lowerwhy did i never learn to use a typewriterthis is the last will and testament of me richard heldar i am in sound bodily and mental health and there is no previous will to revokethats all right damn the pen whereabouts on the paper was ii leave everything that i possess in the world including four thousand pounds and two thousand seven hundred and twenty eight pounds held for meoh i cant get this straight he tore off half the sheet and began again with the caution about the handwriting then i leave all the money i possess in the world tohere followed maisies name and the names of the two banks that held the money  it maynt be quite regular but no one has a shadow of a right to dispute it and ive given maisies address come in mr beeton this is my signature i want you and your wife to witness it thanks tomorrow you must take me to the landlord and ill pay forfeit for leaving without notice and ill lodge this paper with him in case anything happens while im away now were going to light up the studio stove stay with me and give me my papers as i want em  no one knows until he has tried how fine a blaze a years accumulation of bills letters and dockets can make dick stuffed into the stove every document in the studiosaving only three unopened letters destroyed sketch books rough notebooks new and halffinished canvases alike  what a lot of rubbish a tenant gets about him if he stays long enough in one place to be sure said mr beeton at last  he does is there anything more left dick felt round the walls  not a thing and the stoves nigh redhot  excellent and youve lost about a thousand pounds worth of sketches ho ho quite a thousand pounds worth if i can remember what i used to be  yes sir politely mr beeton was quite sure that dick had gone mad otherwise he would have never parted with his excellent furniture for a song the canvas things took up storage room and were much better out of the way  there remained only to leave the little will in safe hands that could not be accomplished til tomorrow dick groped about the floor picking up the last pieces of paper assured himself again and again that there remained no written word or sign of his past life in drawer or desk and sat down before the stove till the fire died out and the contracting iron cracked in the silence of the night  chapter xv  with a heart of furious fancies whereof i am commander           with a burning spear and a horse of air to the wilderness i wander  with a knight of ghosts and shadows i summoned am to tourney ten leagues beyond the wide worlds end methinks it is no journey           tom o bedlams song  goodbye bess i promised you fifty heres a hundredall that i got for my furniture from beeton that will keep you in pretty frocks for some time youve been a good little girl all things considered but youve given me and torpenhow a fair amount of trouble  give mr torpenhow my love if you see him wont you  of course i will dear now take me up the gangplank and into the cabin once aboard the lugger and the maid isand i am free i mean  wholl look after you on this ship  the headsteward if theres any use in money the doctor when we come to port said if i know anything of p and o doctors after that the lord will provide as he used to do  bess found dick his cabin in the wild turmoil of a ship full of leavetakers and weeping relatives then he kissed her and laid himself down in his bunk until the decks should be clear he who had taken so long to move about his own darkened rooms well understood the geography of a ship and the necessity of seeing to his own comforts was as wine to him  before the screw began to thrash the ship along the docks he had been introduced to the headsteward had royally tipped him secured a good place at table opened out his baggage and settled himself down with joy in the cabin it was scarcely necessary to feel his way as he moved about for he knew everything so well then god was very kind a deep sleep of weariness came upon him just as he would have thought of maisie and he slept till the steamer had cleared the mouth of the thames and was lifting to the pulse of the channel  the rattle of the engines the reek of oil and paint and a very familiar sound in the next cabin roused him to his new inheritance  oh its good to be alive again he yawned stretched himself vigorously and went on deck to be told that they were almost abreast of the lights of brighton this is no more open water than trafalgar square is a common the free levels begin at ushant but none the less dick could feel the healing of the sea at work upon him already a boisterous little crossswell swung the steamer disrespectfully by the nose and one wave breaking far aft spattered the quarterdeck and the pile of new deckchairs he heard the foam fall with the clash of broken glass was stung in the face by a cupful and sniffing luxuriously felt his way to the smokingroom by the wheel there a strong breeze found him blew his cap off and left him bareheaded in the doorway and the smokingroom steward understanding that he was a voyager of experience said that the weather would be stiff in the chops off the channel and more than half a gale in the bay these things fell as they were foretold and dick enjoyed himself to the utmost it is allowable and even necessary at sea to lay firm hold upon tables stanchions and ropes in moving from place to place on land the man who feels with his hands is patently blind at sea even a blind man who is not seasick can jest with the doctor over the weakness of his fellows dick told the doctor many talesand these are coin of more value than silver if properly handledsmoked with him till unholy hours of the night and so won his shortlived regard that he promised dick a few hours of his time when they came to port said  and the sea roared or was still as the winds blew and the engines sang their song day and night and the sun grew stronger day by day and tom the lascar barber shaved dick of a morning under the opened hatchgrating where the cool winds blew and the awnings were spread and the passengers made merry and at last they came to port said  take me said dick to the doctor to madame binatsif you know where that is  whew said the doctor i do theres not much to choose between em but i suppose youre aware that thats one of the worst houses in the place theyll rob you to begin with and knife you later  not they take me there and i can look after myself  so he was brought to madame binats and filled his nostrils with the well remembered smell of the east that runs without a change from the canal head to hongkong and his mouth with the villainous lingua franca of the levant the heat smote him between the shoulderblades with the buffet of an old friend his feet slipped on the sand and his coatsleeve was warm as newbaked bread when he lifted it to his nose  madame binat smiled with the smile that knows no astonishment when dick entered the drinkingshop which was one source of her gains but for a little accident of complete darkness he could hardly realise that he had ever quitted the old life that hummed in his ears somebody opened a bottle of peculiarly strong schiedam the smell reminded dick of monsieur binat who by the way had spoken of art and degradation  binat was dead madame said as much when the doctor departed scandalised so far as a ships doctor can be at the warmth of dicks reception dick was delighted at it they remember me here after a year they have forgotten me across the water by this time madame i want a long talk with you when youre at liberty it is good to be back again  in the evening she set an irontopped cafétable out on the sands and dick and she sat by it while the house behind them filled with riot merriment oaths and threats the stars came out and the lights of the shipping in the harbour twinkled by the head of the canal  yes the war is good for trade my friend but what dost thou do here we have not forgotten thee  i was over there in england and i went blind  but there was the glory first we heard of it here even herei and binat and thou hast used the head of yellow tinashe is still aliveso often and so well that tina laughed when the papers arrived by the mailboats it was always something that we here could recognise in the paintings and then there was always the glory and the money for thee  i am not poori shall pay you well  not to me thou hast paid for everything under her breath mon dieu to be blind and so young what horror  dick could not see her face with the pity on it or his own with the discoloured hair at the temples he did not feel the need of pity he was too anxious to get to the front once more and explained his desire  and where the canal is full of the english ships sometimes they fire as they used to do when the war was hereten years ago beyond cairo there is fighting but how canst thou go there without a correspondents passport and in the desert there is always fighting but that is impossible also said she  i must go to suakin he knew thanks to alfs readings that torpenhow was at work with the column that was protecting the construction of the suakinberber line p and o steamers do not touch at that port and besides madame binat knew everybody whose help or advice was worth anything they were not respectable folk but they could cause things to be accomplished which is much more important when there is work toward  but at suakin they are always fighting that desert breeds men alwaysand always more men and they are so bold why to suakin  my friend is there  thy friend chtt thy friend is death then  madame binat dropped a fat arm on the tabletop filled dicks glass anew and looked at him closely under the stars there was no need that he should bow his head in assent and sayno he is a man butif it should arrive    blamest thou  i blame she laughed shrilly who am i that i should blame any oneexcept those who try to cheat me over their consommations but it is very terrible  i must go to suakin think for me a great deal has changed within the year and the men i knew are not here the egyptian lighthouse steamer goes down the canal to suakinand the postboatsbut even then  do not think any longer i know and it is for me to think thou shalt go thou shalt go and see thy friend be wise sit here until the house is a little quieti must attend to my guestsand afterwards go to bed thou shalt go in truth thou shalt go  tomorrow  as soon as may be she was talking as though he were a child  he sat at the table listening to the voices in the harbour and the streets and wondering how soon the end would come till madame binat carried him off to bed and ordered him to sleep the house shouted and sang and danced and revelled madame binat moving through it with one eye on the liquor payments and the girls and the other on dicks interests to this latter end she smiled upon scowling and furtive turkish officers of fellaheen regiments and was more than kind to camel agents of no nationality whatever  in the early morning being then appropriately dressed in a flaming red silk balldress with a front of tarnished gold embroidery and a necklace of plate glass diamonds she made chocolate and carried it in to dick  it is only i and i am of discreet age eh drink and eat the roll too thus in france mothers bring their sons when those behave wisely the morning chocolate she sat down on the side of the bed whisperingit is all arranged thou wilt go by the lighthouse boat that is a bribe of ten pounds english the captain is never paid by the government the boat comes to suakin in four days there will go with thee george a greek muleteer another bribe of ten pounds i will pay they must not know of thy money george will go with thee as far as he goes with his mules then he comes back to me for his well beloved is here and if i do not receive a telegram from suakin saying that thou art well the girl answers for george  thank you he reached out sleepily for the cup you are much too kind madame  if there were anything that i might do i would say stay here and be wise but i do not think that would be best for thee she looked at her liquorstained dress with a sad smile nay thou shalt go in truth thou shalt go it is best so my boy it is best so  she stooped and kissed dick between the eyes that is for goodmorning she said going away when thou art dressed we will speak to george and make everything ready but first we must open the little trunk give me the keys  the amount of kissing lately has been simply scandalous i shall expect torp to kiss me next he is more likely to swear at me for getting in his way though well it wont last longohe madame help me to my toilette of the guillotine there will be no chance of dressing properly out yonder  he was rummaging among his new campaignkit and rowelling his hands with the spurs there are two ways of wearing welloiled anklejacks spotless blue bands khaki coat and breeches and a perfectly pipeclayed helmet the right way is the way of the untired man master of himself setting out upon an expedition well pleased  everything must be very correct dick explained it will become dirty afterwards but now it is good to feel well dressed is everything as it should be  he patted the revolver neatly hidden under the fulness of the blouse on the right hip and fingered his collar  i can do no more madame said between laughing and crying look at thyself but i forgot  i am very content he stroked the creaseless spirals of his leggings  now let us go and see the captain and george and the lighthouse boat be quick madame  but thou canst not be seen by the harbour walking with me in the daylight figure to yourself if some english ladies  there are no english ladies and if there are i have forgotten them take me there  in spite of this burning impatience it was nearly evening ere the lighthouse boat began to move madame had said a great deal both to george and the captain touching the arrangements that were to be made for dicks benefit very few men who had the honour of her acquaintance cared to disregard madames advice that sort of contempt might end in being knifed by a stranger in a gambling hell upon surprisingly short provocation  for six daystwo of them were wasted in the crowded canalthe little steamer worked her way to suakin where she was to pick up the superintendent of the lighthouse and dick made it his business to propitiate george who was distracted with fears for the safety of his lightoflove and half inclined to make dick responsible for his own discomfort when they arrived george took him under his wing and together they entered the redhot seaport encumbered with the material and wastage of the suakinberger line from locomotives in disconsolate fragments to mounds of chairs and potsleepers  if you keep with me said george nobody will ask for passports or what you do they are all very busy  yes but i should like to hear some of the englishmen talk they might remember me i was known here a long time agowhen i was some one indeed  a long time ago is a very long time ago here the graveyards are full now listen this new railway runs out so far as tanaielhassanthat is seven miles then there is a camp they say that beyond tanaielhassan the english troops go forward and everything that they require will be brought to them by this line  ah base camp i see thats a better business than fighting fuzzies in the open  for this reason even the mules go up in the irontrain  iron what  it is all covered with iron because it is still being shot at  an armoured train better and better go on faithful george  and i go up with my mules tonight only those who particularly require to go to the camp go out with the train they begin to shoot not far from the city  the dearsthey always used to dick snuffed the smell of parched dust heated iron and flaking paint with delight certainly the old life was welcoming him back most generously  when i have got my mules together i go up tonight but you must first send a telegram of port said declaring that i have done you no harm  madame has you well in hand would you stick a knife into me if you had the chance  i have no chance said the greek she is there with that woman  i see its a bad thing to be divided between love of woman and the chance of loot i sympathise with you george  they went to the telegraphoffice unquestioned for all the world was desperately busy and had scarcely time to turn its head and suakin was the last place under sky that would be chosen for holidayground on their return the voice of an english subaltern asked dick what he was doing the blue goggles were over his eyes and he walked with his hand on georges elbow as he repliedegyptian governmentmules my orders are to give them over to the a c g at tanaielhassan any occasion to show my papers  oh certainly not i beg your pardon id no right to ask but not seeing your face before i  i go out in the train tonight i suppose said dick boldly there will be no difficulty in loading up the mules will there  you can see the horseplatforms from here you must have them loaded up early the young man went away wondering what sort of brokendown waif this might be who talked like a gentleman and consorted with greek muleteers dick felt unhappy to outface an english officer is no small thing but the bluff loses relish when one plays it from the utter dark and stumbles up and down rough ways thinking and eternally thinking of what might have been if things had fallen out otherwise and all had been as it was not  george shared his meal with dick and went off to the mulelines his charge sat alone in a shed with his face in his hands before his tightshut eyes danced the face of maisie laughing with parted lips there was a great bustle and clamour about him he grew afraid and almost called for george  i say have you got your mules ready it was the voice of the subaltern over his shoulder  my mans looking after them thethe fact is ive a touch of ophthalmia and cant see very well  by jove thats bad you ought to lie up in hospital for a while ive had a turn of it myself its as bad as being blind  so i find it when does this armoured train go  at six oclock it takes an hour to cover the seven miles  are the fuzzies on the rampageeh  about three nights a week fact is im in acting command of the nighttrain it generally runs back empty to tanai for the night  big camp at tanai i suppose  pretty big it has to feed our desertcolumn somehow  is that far off  between thirty and forty milesin an infernal thirsty country  is the country quiet between tanai and our men  more or less i shouldnt care to cross it alone or with a subalterns command for the matter of that but the scouts get through it in some extraordinary fashion  they always did  have you been here before then  i was through most of the trouble when it first broke out  in the service and cashiered was the subalterns first thought so he refrained from putting any questions  theres your man coming up with the mules it seems rather queer  that i should be muleleading said dick  i didnt mean to say so but it is forgive meits beastly impertinence i know but you speak like a man who has been at a public school theres no mistaking the tone  i am a public school man  i thought so i say i dont want to hurt your feelings but youre a little down on your luck arent you i saw you sitting with your head in your hands and thats why i spoke  thanks i am about as thoroughly and completely broke as a man need be  supposei mean im a public school man myself couldnt i perhapstake it as a loan yknow and  youre much too good but on my honour ive as much money as i want     i tell you what you could do for me though and put me under an everlasting obligation let me come into the bogie truck of the train  there is a foretruck isnt there  yes how dyou know  ive been in an armoured train before only let me seehear some of the fun i mean and ill be grateful i go at my own risk as a noncombatant  the young man thought for a minute all right he said were supposed to be an empty train and theres no one to blow me up at the other end  george and a horde of yelling amateur assistants had loaded up the mules and the narrowgauge armoured train plated with threeeighths inch boilerplate till it looked like one long coffin stood ready to start  two bogie trucks running before the locomotive were completely covered in with plating except that the leading one was pierced in front for the muzzle of a machinegun and the second at either side for lateral fire  the trucks together made one long ironvaulted chamber in which a score of artillerymen were rioting  whitechapellast train ah i see yer kissin in the first class there somebody shouted just as dick was clamouring into the forward truck  lordy eres a real live passenger for the kew tanai acton and ealin train echo sir speshul edition star sirshall i get you a foot warmer said another  thanks ill pay my footing said dick and relations of the most amiable were established ere silence came with the arrival of the subaltern and the train jolted out over the rough track  this is an immense improvement on shooting the unimpressionable fuzzy in the open said dick from his place in the corner  oh but hes still unimpressed there he goes said the subaltern as a bullet struck the outside of the truck we always have at least one demonstration against the nighttrain generally they attack the reartruck where my junior commands he gets all the fun of the fair  not tonight though listen said dick a flight of heavyhanded bullets was succeeded by yelling and shouts the children of the desert valued their nightly amusement and the train was an excellent mark  is it worth giving them half a hopper full the subaltern asked of the engine which was driven by a lieutenant of sappers  i should think so this is my section of the line theyll be playing old harry with my permanent way if we dont stop em  right o  hrrmph said the machine gun through all its five noses as the subaltern drew the lever home the empty cartridges clashed on the floor and the smoke blew back through the truck there was indiscriminate firing at the rear of the train and return fire from the darkness without and unlimited howling dick stretched himself on the floor wild with delight at the sounds and the smells  god is very goodi never thought id hear this again give em hell men oh give em hell he cried  the train stopped for some obstruction on the line ahead and a party went out to reconnoitre but came back cursing for spades the children of the desert had piled sand and gravel on the rails and twenty minutes were lost in clearing it away then the slow progress recommenced to be varied with more shots more shoutings the steady clack and kick of the machine guns and a final difficulty with a halflifted rail ere the train came under the protection of the roaring camp at tanaielhassan  now you see why it takes an hour and a half to fetch her through said the subaltern unshipping the cartridgehopper above his pet gun  it was a lark though i only wish it had lasted twice as long how superb it must have looked from outside said dick sighing regretfully  it palls after the first few nights by the way when youve settled about your mules come and see what we can find to eat in my tent im bennil of the gunnersin the artillery linesand mind you dont fall over my tentropes in the dark  but it was all dark to dick he could only smell the camels the haybales the cooking the smoky fires and the tanned canvas of the tents as he stood where he had dropped from the train shouting for george there was a sound of light hearted kicking on the iron skin of the rear trucks with squealing and grunting george was unloading the mules  the engine was blowing off steam nearly in dicks ear a cold wind of the desert danced between his legs he was hungry and felt tired and dirtyso dirty that he tried to brush his coat with his hands that was a hopeless job he thrust his hands into his pockets and began to count over the many times that he had waited in strange or remote places for trains or camels mules or horses to carry him to his business in those days he could seefew men more clearlyand the spectacle of an armed camp at dinner under the stare was an ever fresh pleasure to the eye there was colour light and motion without which no man has much pleasure in living this night there remained for him only one more journey through the darkness that never lifts to tell a man how far he has travelled then he would grip torpenhows hand againtorpenhow who was alive and strong and lived in the midst of the action that had once made the reputation of a man called dick heldar not in the least to be confused with the blind bewildered vagabond who seemed to answer to the same name yes he would find torpenhow and come as near to the old life as might be afterwards he would forget everything bessie who had wrecked the melancolia and so nearly wrecked his life beeton who lived in a strange unreal city full of tintacks and gasplugs and matters that no men needed that irrational being who had offered him love and loyalty for nothing but had not signed her name and most of all maisie who from her own point of view was undeniably right in all she did but oh at this distance so tantalisingly fair  georges hand on his arm pulled him back to the situation  and what now said george  oh yes of course what now take me to the camelmen take me to where the scouts sit when they come in from the desert they sit by their camels and the camels eat grain out of a black blanket held up at the corners and the men eat by their side just like camels take me there  the camp was rough and rutty and dick stumbled many times over the stumps of scrub the scouts were sitting by their beasts as dick knew they would the light of the dungfires flickered on their bearded faces and the camels bubbled and mumbled beside them at rest it was no part of dicks policy to go into the desert with a convoy of supplies that would lead to impertinent questions and since a blind noncombatant is not needed at the front he would probably be forced to return to suakin  he must go up alone and go immediately  now for one last bluffthe biggest of all he said peace be with you brethren the watchful george steered him to the circle of the nearest fire the heads of the camelsheiks bowed gravely and the camels scenting a european looked sideways curiously like brooding hens half ready to get to their feet  a beast and a driver to go to the fighting line tonight said dick  a mulaid said a voice scornfully naming the best baggagebreed that he knew  a bisharin returned dick with perfect gravity a bisharin without saddle galls therefore no charge of thine shockhead  two or three minutes passed thenwe be kneehaltered for the night there is no going out from the camp  not for money  hm ah english money  another depressing interval of silence  how much  twentyfive pounds english paid into the hand of the driver at my journeys end and as much more into the hand of the camelsheik here to be paid when the driver returns  this was royal payment and the sheik who knew that he would get his commission on this deposit stirred in dicks behalf  for scarcely one nights journeyfifty pounds land and wells and good trees and wives to make a man content for the rest of his days who speaks said dick  i said a voice i will gobut there is no going from the camp  fool i know that a camel can break his kneehalter and the sentries do not fire if one goes in chase twentyfive pounds and another twentyfive pounds but the beast must be a good bisharin i will take no baggagecamel  then the bargaining began and at the end of half an hour the first deposit was paid over to the sheik who talked in low tones to the driver  dick heard the latter say a little way out only any baggagebeast will serve am i a fool to waste my cattle for a blind man  and though i cannot seedick lifted his voice a littleyet i carry that which has six eyes and the driver will sit before me if we do not reach the english troops in the dawn he will be dead  but where in gods name are the troops  unless thou knowest let another man ride dost thou know remember it will be life or death to thee  i know said the driver sullenly stand back from my beast i am going to slip him  not so swiftly george hold the camels head a moment i want to feel his cheek the hands wandered over the hide till they found the branded half circle that is the mark of the biharin the lightbuilt ridingcamel  that is well cut this one loose remember no blessing of god comes on those who try to cheat the blind  the men chuckled by the fires at the cameldrivers discomfiture he had intended to substitute a slow saddlegalled baggagecolt  stand back one shouted lashing the biharin under the belly with a quirt dick obeyed as soon as he felt the nosestring tighten in his handand a cry went up illaha aho he is loose  with a roar and a grunt the biharin rose to his feet and plunged forward toward the desert his driver following with shouts and lamentation  george caught dicks arm and hurried him stumbling and tripping past a disgusted sentry who was used to stampeding camels  whats the row now he cried  every stitch of my kit on that blasted dromedary dick answered after the manner of a common soldier  go on and take care your throats not cut outsideyou and your dromedarys  the outcries ceased when the camel had disappeared behind a hillock and his driver had called him back and made him kneel down  mount first said dick then climbing into the second seat and gently screwing the pistol muzzle into the small of his companions back go on in gods name and swiftly goodbye george remember me to madame and have a good time with your girl get forward child of the pit  a few minutes later he was shut up in a great silence hardly broken by the creaking of the saddle and the soft pad of the tireless feet dick adjusted himself comfortably to the rock and pitch of the pace girthed his belt tighter and felt the darkness slide past for an hour he was conscious only of the sense of rapid progress  a good camel he said at last  he was never underfed he is my own and clean bred the driver replied  go on  his head dropped on his chest and he tried to think but the tenor of his thoughts was broken because he was very sleepy in the half doze in seemed that he was learning a punishment hymn at mrs jennetts he had committed some crime as bad as sabbathbreaking and she had locked him up in his bedroom but he could never repeat more than the first two lines of the hymn  when israel of the lord believed out of the land of bondage came  he said them over and over thousands of times the driver turned in the saddle to see if there were any chance of capturing the revolver and ending the ride dick roused struck him over the head with the butt and stormed himself wide awake somebody hidden in a clump of camelthorn shouted as the camel toiled up rising ground a shot was fired and the silence shut down again bringing the desire to sleep dick could think no longer he was too tired and stiff and cramped to do more than nod uneasily from time to time waking with a start and punching the driver with the pistol  is there a moon he asked drowsily  she is near her setting  i wish that i could see her halt the camel at least let me hear the desert talk  the man obeyed out of the utter stillness came one breath of wind it rattled the dead leaves of a shrub some distance away and ceased a handful of dry earth detached itself from the edge of a rail trench and crumbled softly to the bottom  go on the night is very cold  those who have watched till the morning know how the last hour before the light lengthens itself into many eternities it seemed to dick that he had never since the beginning of original darkness done anything at all save jolt through the air once in a thousand years he would finger the nailheads on the saddle front and count them all carefully centuries later he would shift his revolver from his right hand to his left and allow the eased arm to drop down at his side from the safe distance of london he was watching himself thus employed watching critically yet whenever he put out his hand to the canvas that he might paint the tawny yellow desert under the glare of the sinking moon the black shadow of a camel and the two bowed figures atop that hand held a revolver and the arm was numbed from wrist to collarbone moreover he was in the dark and could see no canvas of any kind whatever  the driver grunted and dick was conscious of a change in the air  i smell the dawn he whispered  it is here and yonder are the troops have i done well  the camel stretched out its neck and roared as there came down wind the pungent reek of camels in the square  go on we must get there swiftly go on  they are moving in their camp there is so much dust that i cannot see what they do  am i in better case go forward  they could hear the hum of voices ahead the howling and the bubbling of the beasts and the hoarse cries of the soldiers girthing up for the day  two or three shots were fired  is that at us surely they can see that i am english dick spoke angrily  nay it is from the desert the driver answered cowering in his saddle  go forward my child well it is that the dawn did not uncover us an hour ago  the camel headed straight for the column and the shots behind multiplied the children of the desert had arranged that most uncomfortable of surprises a dawn attack for the english troops and were getting their distance by snap shots at the only moving object without the square  what luck what stupendous and imperial luck said dick its just before the battle mother oh god has been most good to me onlythe agony of the thought made him screw up his eyes for an instantmaisie     allahu we are in said the man as he drove into the rearguard and the camel knelt  who the deuce are you despatches or what whats the strength of the enemy behind that ridge how did you get through asked a dozen voices for all answer dick took a long breath unbuckled his belt and shouted from the saddle at the top of a wearied and dusty voice torpenhow ohe torp cooee tor penhow  a bearded man raking in the ashes of a fire for a light to his pipe moved very swiftly towards that cry as the rearguard facing about began to fire at the puffs of smoke from the hillocks around gradually the scattered white cloudlets drew out into the long lines of banked white that hung heavily in the stillness of the dawn before they turned over wavelike and glided into the valleys the soldiers in the square were coughing and swearing as their own smoke obstructed their view and they edged forward to get beyond it a wounded camel leaped to its feet and roared aloud the cry ending in a bubbling grunt some one had cut its throat to prevent confusion then came the thick sob of a man receiving his deathwound from a bullet then a yell of agony and redoubled firing  there was no time to ask any questions  get down man get down behind the camel  no put me i pray in the forefront of the battle dick turned his face to torpenhow and raised his hand to set his helmet straight but miscalculating the distance knocked it off torpenhow saw that his hair was gray on the temples and that his face was the face of an old man  come down you damned fool dickie come off  and dick came obediently but as a tree falls pitching sideways from the bisharins saddle at torpenhows feet his luck had held to the last even to the crowning mercy of a kindly bullet through his head  torpenhow knelt under the lee of the camel with dicks body in his arms   the end    volume vii the story of the gadsbys   preface  to the address of  captain j mafflin  duke of

right im thinking of mrs cockley the womans an absolute wreck  doone exactly because she stays down here the only way to keep her fit would be to send her to the hills for eight monthsand the same with any woman i fancy i see myself taking a wife on those terms  mackesy with the rupee at one and sixpence the little doones would be little debra doones with a fine mussoorie chichi anent to bring

instead of bothering me  blayne hes a nervous little chap what has he got this time  anthony cant quite say a very bad tummy and a blue funk so far he asked me at once if it was cholera and i told him not to be a fool that soothed him  curtiss poor devil the funk does half the business in a man of that build  anthony lighting a cheroot i firmly believe the funk will kill him if he stays down you know the amount of trouble hes been giving fewton for the last three weeks hes doing his very best to frighten himself into the grave  general chorus poor little devil why doesnt he get away  anthony cant he has his leave all right but hes so dipped he cant take it and i dont think his name on paper would raise four annas thats in confidence though  mackesy all the station knows it  anthony  i suppose i shall have to die here he said squirming all across the bed hes quite made up his mind to kingdom come and i know he has nothing more than a wetweather tummy if he could only keep a hand on himself  blayne thats bad thats very bad poor little miggy good little chap too i say  anthony what do you say  blayne well look hereanyhow if its like thatas you sayi say fifty  curtiss i say fifty  mackesy i go twenty better  doone bloated croesus of the bar i say fifty jervoise what do you say hi wake up  jervoise eh whats that whats that  curtiss we want a hundred rupees from you youre a bachelor drawing a gigantic income and theres a man in a hole  jervoise what man any one dead  blayne no but hell die if you dontgive the hundred here heres a peg voucher you can see what weve signed

twenty thatll give him a month clear at the hills many thanks you men ill send round the chaprassi tomorrow  curtiss you must engineer his taking the stuff and of course you mustnt  anthony of course it would never do hed weep with gratitude over his evening drink  blayne thats just what he would do damn him oh i say anthony you pretend to know everything have you heard about gadsby  anthony no divorce court at last  blayne worse hes engaged  anthony how much he cant be  blayne he is hes going to be married in a few weeks markyn told me at the judges this evening its pukka  anthony you dont say so holy moses therell be a shine in the tents of kedar  curtiss regiment cut up rough think you  anthony dont know anything about the regiment  mackesy it is bigamy then  anthony maybe do you mean to say that you men have forgotten or is there more charity in the world than i thought  doone you dont look pretty when you are trying to keep a secret you bloat explain  anthony mrs herriott  blayne after a long pause to the room generally its my notion that we are a set of fools  mackesy nonsense that business was knocked on the head last season why young mallard  anthony mallard was a candlestick paraded as such think awhile recollect last season and the talk then mallard or no mallard did gadsby ever talk to any other woman  curtiss theres something in that it was slightly noticeable now you come to mention it but shes at naini tal and hes at simla  anthony he had to go to simla to look after a globetrotter relative of hisa person with a title uncle or aunt  blayne and there he got engaged no law prevents a man growing tired of a woman  anthony except that he mustnt do it till the woman is tired of him and the herriott woman was not that  curtiss she may be now two months of naini tal works wonders  doone curious thing how some women carry a fate with them there was a mrs deegie in the central provinces whose men invariably fell away and got married it became a regular proverb with us when i was down there i remember three men desperately devoted to her and they all one after another took wives  curtiss thats odd now i should have thought that mrs deegies influence would have led them to take other mens wives it ought to have made them afraid of the judgment of providence  anthony mrs herriott will make gadsby afraid of something more than the judgment of providence i fancy  blayne supposing things are as you say hell be a fool to face her hell sit tight at simla  anthony shouldnt be a bit surprised if he went off to naini to explain hes an unaccountable sort of man and shes likely to be a more than unaccountable woman  doone what makes you take her character away so confidently  anthony primum tempus caddy was her first and a woman doesnt allow her first man to drop away without expostulation she justifies the first transfer of affection to herself by swearing that it is forever and ever consequently  blayne consequently we are sitting here till past one oclock talking scandal like a set of station cats anthony its all your fault we were perfectly respectable till you came in go to bed im off good night all  curtiss past one its past two by jove and heres the khit coming for the late charge just heavens one two three four five rupees to pay for the pleasure of saying that a poor little beast of a woman is no better than she should be im ashamed of myself go to bed you slanderous villains and if im sent to beora tomorrow be prepared to hear im dead before paying my card account  the tents of kedar  only why should it be with pain at all why must i twixt the leaves of coronal put any kiss of pardon on thy brow why should the other women know so much and talk togethersuch the look and such the smile he used to love

captain gadsby turning from regularly ordained dinner partner and settling hock glasses good evening sotto voce not quite so loud another time youve no notion how your voice carries aside so much for

a heavy score against you where were you at the monday pop where were you on tuesday where were you at the lamonts tennis i was looking everywhere  capt g for me oh i was alive somewhere i suppose

little calendar and put it in my cardcase and every time the twelve oclock gun went off i scratched out a square and said that brings me nearer to pip my pip  capt g with an uneasy laugh what will mackler think if you neglect him so  mrs h and it hasnt brought you nearer you seem farther away than ever are you sulking about something i know your temper  capt g no  mrs h have i grown old in the

shoulders once upon a time what an ass a man can make of himself  mrs h helping herself to a paper frill seven peas some stamped carrots and a spoonful of gravy that isnt an answer tell me whether i have done anything  capt g aside if it isnt ended here there will be a ghastly scene some where else if only id written to her and stood the racket at long range to khitmatgar han simpkin do aloud ill tell you later on  mrs h tell me now it must be some foolish misunderstanding and you know that there was to be nothing of that sort between us we of all people in the world cant afford it is it the vaynor man and dont you like to say so on my honor  capt g i havent given the vaynor man a thought  mrs h but how dyou know that i havent  capt g aside heres my chance and may the devil help me through with it aloud and measuredly believe me i do not care how often or how tenderly you think of the vaynor man  mrs h i wonder if you mean that oh what is the good of squabbling and pretending to misunderstand when you are only up for so short a time pip dont be a stupid  follows a pause during which he crosses his left leg over his right and continues his dinner  capt g in answer to the thunderstorm in her eyes cornsmy worst  mrs h upon my word you are the very rudest man in the world ill never do it again  capt g aside no i dont think you will but i wonder what you will do before

wont see  mrs h im waiting or would you like me to dictate a form of apology  capt g desperately by all means dictate  mrs h lightly very well rehearse your several christian names after me and go on profess my sincere repentance  capt g sincere repentance  mrs h for having behaved  capt g aside at last i wish to goodness shed look away for having behavedas i have behaved and declare that i am thoroughly and heartily sick of the whole business and take this opportunity of making clear my intention of ending it now henceforward and forever aside if any one had told me i should be such a blackguard  mrs h shaking a spoonful of potato chips into her plate thats not a pretty joke  capt g no its a reality aside i wonder if smashes of this kind are always so raw  mrs h really pip youre getting more absurd every day  capt g i dont think you quite understand me shall i repeat it  mrs h no for pitys sake dont do that its too terrible even in fur  capt g ill let her think it over for a while but i ought to be horsewhipped  mrs h i want to know what you meant by what you said just now  capt g exactly what i said no less  mrs h but what have i done to deserve it what have i done  capt g aside if she only wouldnt look at me aloud and very slowly his eyes on his plate dyou remember that evening in july before the rains broke when you said that the end would have to come sooner or laterand you wondered for which of us it would come first  mrs h yes i was only joking and you swore that as long as there was breath in your body it should never come and i believed you  capt g fingering menucard well it has thats all  a long pause during which mrs h bows her head and rolls the breadtwist into little pellets g stares at the oleanders  mrs h throwing back her head and laughing naturally they train us women well dont they pip  capt g brutally touching shirtstud so far as the expression goes aside it isnt in her nature to take things quietly therell be an explosion

very close tonight isnt it you find it too much for you  mrs h oh no not in the least but they really ought to have punkahs even in your cool naini tal oughtnt they turns dropping fan and raising eyebrows  capt g its all right aside here comes the storm  mrs h her eyes on the tablecloth fan ready in right hand it was very cleverly managed pip and i congratulate you you sworeyou never contented yourself with merely saying a thingyou swore that as far as lay in your power youd make my wretched life pleasant for me and youve denied me the consolation of breaking down i should have done itindeed i should a woman would hardly have thought of this refinement my kind considerate friend fanguard as before you have explained things so tenderly and truthfully too you havent spoken or written a word of warning and you have let me believe in you till the last minute you havent condescended to give me your reason yet no a woman could not have managed it half so well are there many men like you in the world  capt g im sure i dont know to khitmatgar ohe simpkin do  mrs h you call yourself a man of the world dont you do men of the world behave like devils when they do a woman the honor to get tired of her  capt g im sure i dont know dont speak so loud  mrs h keep us respectable o lord whatever happens dont be afraid of my compromising you youve chosen your ground far too well and ive been properly brought up lowering fan havent you any pity pip except for yourself  capt g wouldnt it be rather impertinent of me to say that im sorry for you  mrs h i think you have said it once or twice before youre growing very careful of my feelings my god pip i was a good woman once you said i was youve made me what i am what are you going to do with me what are you going to do with me wont you say that you are sorry helps herself to iced asparagus  capt g i am sorry for you if you want the pity of such a brute as i am im awfly sorry for you  mrs h rather tame for a man of the world do you think that that admission clears you  capt g what can i do i can only tell you what i think of myself you cant think worse than that  mrs h oh yes i can and now will you tell me the reason of all this remorse has bayard been suddenly conscience stricken  capt g angrily his eyes still lowered no the thing has come to an end on my side thats all mafisch  mrs h thats all mafisch as though i were a cairene dragoman you used to make prettier speeches dyou remember when you said  capt g for heavens sake dont bring that back call me anything you like and ill admit it  mrs h but you dont care to be reminded of old lies if i could hope to hurt you onetenth as much as you have hurt me tonightno i wouldnti couldnt do itliar though you are  capt g ive spoken the truth  mrs h my dear sir you flatter yourself you have lied over the reason pip remember that i know you as you dont know yourself you have been everything to me though you arefanguard oh what a contemptible thing it is and so you are merely tired of me  capt g since you insist upon my repeating ityes  mrs h lie the first i wish i knew a coarser word lie seems so ineffectual in your case the fire has just died out and there is no fresh one think for a minute pip if you care whether i despise you more than i do simply mafisch is it  capt g yes aside i think i deserve this  mrs h lie number two before the next glass chokes you tell me her name  capt g aside ill make her pay for dragging minnie into the business aloud is it likely  mrs h very likely if you thought that it would flatter your vanity youd cry my name on the housetops to make people turn round  capt g i wish i had there would have been an end to this business  mrs h oh no there would notand so you were going to be virtuous and blase were you to come to me and say ive done with you the incident is cloosed i ought to be proud of having kept such a man so long  capt g aside it only remains to pray for the end of the dinner aloud you know what i think of myself  mrs h as its the only person in he world you ever do think of and as i know your mind thoroughly i do you want to get it all over andoh i cant keep you back and youre goingthink of it pipto throw me over for another woman and you swore that all other women werepip my pip she cant care for you as i do believe me she cant is it any one that i know  capt g thank goodness it isnt aside i expected a cyclone but not an earthquake  mrs h she  cant is there anything that i wouldnt do for youor havent done and to think that i should take this trouble over you knowing what you are do you despise me for it  capt g wiping his mouth to hide a smile again its entirely a work of charity on your part  mrs h ahhh but i have no right to resent itis she betterlooking than i who was it said  capt g nonot that  mrs h ill be more merciful than you were dont you know that all women are alike  capt g aside then this is the exception that proves the rule  mrs h all of them ill tell you anything you like i will upon my word they only want the admirationfrom anybodyno matter whoanybody but there is always one man that they care for more than any one else in the world and would sacrifice all the others to oh do listen ive kept the vaynor man trotting after me like a poodle and he believes that he is the only man i am interested in ill tell you what he said to me  capt g spare him aside i wonder what his version is  mrs h hes been waiting for me to look at him all through dinner shall i do it and you can see what an idiot he looks  capt g but what imports the nomination of this gentleman  mrs h watch sends a glance to the vaynor man who tries vainly to combine a mouthful of ice pudding a smirk of selfsatisfaction a glare of intense devotion and the stolidity of a british dining countenance  capt g critically he doesnt look pretty why didnt you wait till the spoon was out of his mouth  mrs h to amuse you shell make an exhibition of you as ive made of him and people will laugh at you oh pip cant you see that its as plain as the noonday sun youll be trotted about and told lies and made a fool of like the others i never made a fool of you did i  capt g aside what a clever little woman it is  mrs h well what have you to say  capt g i feel better  mrs h yes i suppose so after i have come down to your level i couldnt have done it if i hadnt cared for you so much i have spoken the truth  capt g it doesnt alter the situation  mrs h passionately then she has said that she cares for you dont believe her pip its a lieas bad as yours to me  capt g ssssteady ive a notion that a friend of yours is looking at you  mrs h he i hate him he introduced you to me  capt g aside and some people would like women to assist in making the laws introduction to imply condonement aloud well you see if you can remember so far back as that i couldnt in common politeness refuse the offer  mrs h in common politeness iwe have got beyond that  capt g aside old ground means fresh trouble aloud on my honor  mrs h your what ha ha  capt g dishonor then shes not what you imagine i meant to  mrs h dont tell me anything about her she wont care for you and when you come back after having made an exhibition of yourself youll find me occupied with  capt g insolently you couldnt while i am alive aside if that doesnt bring her pride to her rescue nothing will  mrs h drawing herself up couldnt do it isoftening youre right i dont believe i couldthough you are what you area coward and a liar in grain  capt g it doesnt hurt so much after your little lecturewith demonstrations  mrs h one mass of vanity will nothing ever touch you in this life there must be a hereafter if its only for the benefit ofbut you will have it all to yourself  capt g under his eyebrows are you certain of that  mrs h i shall have had mine in this life and it will serve me right  capt g but the admiration that you insisted on so strongly a moment ago aside oh i am a brute  mrs h fiercely will that console me for knowing that you will go to her with the same words the same arguments and thethe same pet names you used to me and if she cares for you you two will laugh over my story wont that be punishment heavy enough even for meeven for meand its all useless thats another punishment  capt g feebly oh come im not so low as you think  mrs h not now perhaps but you will be oh pip if a woman flatters your vanity theres nothing on earth that you would not tell her and no meanness that you would not do have i known you so long without knowing that  capt g if you can trust me in nothing elseand i dont see why i should be trustedyou can count upon my holding my tongue  mrs h if you denied everything youve said this evening and declared it was all in fun a long pause id trust you not otherwise all i ask is dont tell her my name please dont a man might forget a woman never would looks up table and sees hostess beginning to collect eyes so its all ended

out with an uncertain smile he watches her through the door and settles into a chair as the men redistribute themselves  capt g now if there is any power who looks after this world will he kindly tell

put a head on this thing in the meantime  mrs g im to be turned out of the room like a troublesome child  capt g noo i dont mean that exactly but you see i shall be tramping up and down shifting these things to and fro and i shall be in your way dont you think so  mrs g cant i lift them about let me try reaches forward to troopers saddle  capt g good gracious child dont touch it youll hurt yourself

whats that ugly red streak inside your arm  capt g lowering saddle quickly nothing its a mark of sorts aside and jacks coming to tiffin with his notions all cut and dried  mrs g i know its a mark but ive never seen it before it runs all up the arm what is it  capt g a cutif you want to know  mrs g want to know of course i do i cant have my husband cut to pieces in this way how did it come was it an accident tell me pip  capt g grimly no twasnt an accident i got itfrom a manin afghanistan  mrs g in action oh pip and you never told me  capt g id forgotten all about it  mrs g hold up your arm what a horrid ugly scar are you sure it doesnt hurt now how did the man give it you  capt g desperately looking at his watch with a knife i came downold van loo did thats to sayand fell on my leg so i couldnt run and then this man came up and began chopping at me as i sprawled  mrs g oh dont dont thats enoughwell what happened  capt g i couldnt get to my holster and mafflin came round the corner and stopped the performance  mrs g how hes such a lazy man i dont believe he did  capt g dont you i dont think the man had much doubt about it jack cut his head off  mrs g cuthisheadoff with one blow as they say in the books  capt g im not sure i was too interested in myself to know much about it anyhow the head was off and jack was punching old van loo in the ribs to make him get up now you know all about it dear and now  mrs g you want me to go of course you never told me about this though ive been married to you for ever so long and you never would have told me if i hadnt found out and you never do tell me anything about yourself or what you do or what you take an interest in  capt g darling im always with you arent i  mrs g always in my pocket you were going to say i know you are but you are always thinking away from me  capt g trying to hide a smile am i i wasnt aware of it im awfly sorry  mrs g piteously oh dont make fun of me pip you know what i mean when you are reading one of those things about cavalry by that idiotic princewhy doesnt he be a prince instead of a stableboy  capt g prince kraft a stableboyoh my aunt never mind dear you were going to say  mrs g it doesnt matter you dont care for what i say onlyonly you get up and walk about the room staring in front of you and then mafflin comes in to dinner and after im in the drawingroom i can hear you and him talking and talking and talking about things i cant understand andoh i get so tired and feel so lonelyi dont want to complain and be a trouble pip but i do indeed i do  capt g my poor darling i never thought of that why dont you ask some nice people in to dinner  mrs g nice people where am i to find them horrid frumps and if i did i shouldnt be amused you know i only want you  capt g and you have me surely sweetheart  mrs g i have not pip why dont you take me into your life  capt g more than i do that would be difficult dear  mrs g yes i suppose it wouldto you im no help to youno companion to you and you like to have it so  capt g arent you a little unreasonable pussy  mrs g stamping her foot im the most reasonable woman in the worldwhen im treated properly  capt g and since when have i been treating you improperly  mrs g alwaysand since the beginning you know you have  capt g i dont but im willing to be convinced  mrs g pointing to saddlery there  capt g how do you mean  mrs g what does all that mean why am i not to be told is it so precious  capt g i forget its exact government value just at present it means that it is a great deal too heavy  mrs g then why do you touch it  capt g to make it lighter see here little love ive one notion and jack has another but we are both agreed that all this equipment is about thirty pounds too heavy the thing is how to cut it down without weakening any part of it and at the same time allowing the trooper to carry everything he wants for his own comfortsocks and shirts and things of that kind  mrs g why doesnt he pack them in a little trunk  capt g kissing her oh you darling pack them in a little trunk indeed hussars dont carry trunks and its a most important thing to make the horse do all the carrying  mrs g but why need you bother about it youre not a trooper  capt g no but i command a few score of him and equipment is nearly everything in these days  mrs g more than me  capt g stupid of course not but its a matter that im tremendously interested in because if i or jack or i and jack work out some sort of lighter saddlery and all that its possible that we may get it adopted  mrs g how  capt g sanctioned at home where they will make a sealed patterna pattern that all the saddlers must copyand so it will be used by all the regiments  mrs g and that interests you  capt g its part of my profession yknow and my profession is a good deal to me everything in a soldiers equipment is important and if we can improve that equipment so much the better for the soldiers and for us  mrs g whos us  capt g jack and i only jacks notions are too radical whats that big sigh for minnie  mrs g oh nothingand youve kept all this a secret from me why  capt g not a secret exactly dear i didnt say anything about it to you because i didnt think it would amuse you  mrs g and am i only made to be amused  capt g no of course i merely mean that it couldnt interest you  mrs g its your work andand if youd let me id count all these things up if they are too heavy you know by how much they are too heavy and you must have a list of things made out to your scale of lightness and  capt g i have got both scales somewhere in my head but its hard to tell how light you can make a headstall for instance until youve actually had a model made  mrs g but if you read out the list i could copy it down and pin it up there just above your table wouldnt that do  capt g it would be awfly nice dear but it would be giving you trouble for nothing i cant work that way i go by rule of thumb i know the present scale of weights and the other onethe one that im trying to work towill shift and vary so much that i couldnt be certain even if i wrote it down  mrs g im so sorry i thought i might help is there anything else that i could be of use in  capt g looking round the room i cant think of anything youre always helping me you know  mrs g am i how  capt g you are of course and as long as youre near mei  cant explain exactly but its in the air  mrs g and thats why you wanted to send me away  capt g thats only when im trying to do workgrubby work like this  mrs g mafflins better then isnt he  capt g rashly of course he is jack and i have been thinking along the same groove for two or three years about this equipment its our hobby and it may really be useful some day  mrs g after a pause and thats all that you have away from me

got the money too thats about the case eh  capt g i suppose thats it but its not for myself its because of them at least i think it is  capt m are you sure looking at the matter in a coldblooded light the wife is provided for even if you were wiped out tonight she has an ancestral home to go to money and the brigadier to carry on the illustrious name  capt g then it is for myself or because they are part of me you dont see it my lifes so good so pleasant as it is that i want to make it quite safe cant you understand  capt m perfectly shelterpit for the offcers charger as they say in the line

with you  this is the end of the story of the gadsbys    volume viii from mine own people  bimi namgay doola the recrudescence of imray moti gujmutineer  bimi  the orangoutang in the big iron cage lashed to the sheeppen began the discussion the night was stiflingly hot and as hans breitmann and i passed him dragging our bedding to the forepeak of the steamer he roused himself and chattered obscenely he had been caught somewhere in the malayan archipelago and was going to england to be exhibited at a shilling a head for four days he had struggled yelled and wrenched at the heavy iron bars of his prison without ceasing and had nearly slain a lascar incautious enough to come within reach of the great hairy paw  it would he well for you mine friend if you was a liddle seasick said hans breitmann pausing by the cage you haf too much ego in your cosmos  the orangoutangs arm slid out negligently from between the bars no one would have believed that it would make a sudden snakelike rush at the germans breast the thin silk of the sleepingsuit tore out hans stepped back unconcernedly to pluck a banana from a bunch hanging close to one of the boats  too much ego said he peeling the fruit and offering it to the caged devil who was rending the silk to tatters  then we laid out our bedding in the bows among the sleeping lascars to catch any breeze that the pace of the ship might give us the sea was like smoky oil except where it turned to fire under our forefoot and whirled back into the dark in smears of dull flame there was a thunderstorm some miles away we could see the glimmer of the lightning the ships cow distressed by the heat and the smell of the apebeast in the cage lowed unhappily from time to time in exactly the same key as the lookout man at the bows answered the hourly call from the bridge the trampling tune of the engines was very distinct and the jarring of the ashlift as it was tipped into the sea hurt the procession of hushed noise hans lay down by my side and lighted a goodnight cigar this was naturally the beginning of conversation he owned a voice as soothing as the wash of the sea and stores of experiences as vast as the sea itself for his business in life was to wander up and down the world collecting orchids and wild beasts and ethnological specimens for german and american dealers i watched the glowing end of his cigar wax and wane in the gloom as the sentences rose and fell till i was nearly asleep the orangoutang troubled by some dream of the forests of his freedom began to yell like a soul in purgatory and to wrench madly at the bars of the cage  if he was out now dere would not be much of us left hereabouts said hans lazily he screams good see now how i shall tame him when he stops himself  there was a pause in the outcry and from hans mouth came an imitation of a snakes hiss so perfect that i almost sprung to my feet the sustained murderous sound ran along the deck and the wrenching at the bars ceased the orangoutang was quaking in an ecstasy of pure terror  dot stop him said hans i learned dot trick in mogoung tanjong when i was collecting liddle monkeys for some peoples in berlin efery one in der world is afraid of der monkeys except der snake so i blay snake against monkey and he keep quite still dere was too much ego in his cosmos dot is der soulcustom of monkeys are you asleep or will you

to mineself dot i should lif after i had seen dot room wit der hole in der thatch und bertran he was her husband goodnight und sleep well    namgay doola  once upon a time there was a king who lived on the road to thibet very many miles in the himalaya mountains his kingdom was 11000 feet above the sea and exactly four miles square but most of the miles stood on end owing to the nature of the country his revenues were rather less than 400 pounds yearly and they were expended on the maintenance of one elephant and a standing army of five men he was tributary to the indian government who allowed him certain sums for keeping a section of the himalayathibet road in repair he further increased his revenues by selling timber to the railway companies for he would cut the great deodar trees in his own forest and they fell thundering into the sutlej river and were swept down to the plains 300 miles away and became railway ties now and again this king whose name does not matter would mount a ringstreaked horse and ride scores of miles to simlatown to confer with the lieutenantgovernor on matters of state or assure the viceroy that his sword was at the service of the queenempress then the viceroy would cause a ruffle of drums to be sounded and the ringstreaked horse and the cavalry of the statetwo men in tattersand the herald who bore the silver stick before the king would trot back to their own place which was between the tail of a heavenclimbing glacier and a dark birch forest  now from such a king always remembering that he possessed one veritable elephant and could count his descent for 1200 years i expected when it was my fate to wander through his dominions no more than mere license to live  the night had closed in rain and rolling clouds blotted out the lights of the villages in the valley forty miles away untouched by cloud or storm the white shoulder of dongo pathe mountain of the council of the godsupheld the evening star the monkeys sung sorrowfully to each other as they hunted for dry roots in the ferndraped trees and the last puff of the daywind brought from the unseen villages the scent of damp wood smoke hot cakes dripping undergrowth and rotting pinecones that smell is the true smell of the himalayas and if it once gets into the blood of a man he will at the last forgetting everything else return to the hills to die the clouds closed and the smell went away and there remained nothing in all the world except chilling white mists and the boom of the sutlej river  a fattailed sheep who did not want to die bleated lamentably at my tent door he was scuffling with the prime minister and the directorgeneral of public education and he was a royal gift to me and my camp servants i expressed my thanks suitably and inquired if i might have audience of the king the prime minister readjusted his turbanit had fallen off in the struggle and assured me that the king would be very pleased to see me therefore i dispatched two bottles as a foretaste and when the sheep had entered upon another incarnation climbed up to the kings palace through the wet he had sent his army to escort me but it stayed to talk with my cook soldiers are very much alike all the world over  the palace was a fourroomed whitewashed mudandtimber house the finest in all the hills for a days journey the king was dressed in a purple velvet jacket white muslin trousers and a saffronyellow turban of price he gave me audience in a little carpeted room opening off the palace courtyard which was occupied by the elephant of state the great beast was sheeted and anchored from trunk to tail and the curve of his back stood out against the sky line  the prime minister and the directorgeneral of public instruction were present to introduce me but all the court had been dismissed lest the two bottles aforesaid should corrupt their morals the king cast a wreath of heavy scented flowers round my neck as i bowed and inquired how my honored presence had the felicity to be i said that through seeing his auspicious countenance the mists of the night had turned into sunshine and that by reason of his beneficent sheep his good deeds would be remembered by the gods he said that since i had set my magnificent foot in his kingdom the crops would probably yield seventy per cent more than the average i said that the fame of the king had reached to the four corners of the earth and that the nations gnashed their teeth when they heard daily of the glory of his realm and the wisdom of his moonlike prime minister and lotuseyed directorgeneral of public education  then we sat down on clean white cushions and i was at the kings right hand three minutes later he was telling me that the condition of the maize crop was something disgraceful and that the railway companies would not pay him enough for his timber the talk shifted to and fro with the bottles we discussed very many quaint things and the king became confidential on the subject of government generally most of all he dwelt on the shortcomings of one of his subjects who from what i could gather had been paralyzing the executive  in the old days said the king i could have ordered the elephant yonder to trample him to death now i must een send him seventy miles across the hills to be tried and his keep for that time would be upon the state and the elephant eats everything  what be the mans crimes rajah sahib said i  firstly he is an outlander and no man of mine own people secondly since of my favor i gave him land upon his coming he refuses to pay revenue am i not the lord of the earth above and belowentitled by right and custom to oneeighth of the crop yet this devil establishing himself refuses to pay a single tax    and he brings a poisonous spawn of babes  cast him into jail i said  sahib the king answered shifting a little on the cushions once and only once in these forty years sickness came upon me so that i was not able to go abroad in that hour i made a vow to my god that i would never again cut man or woman from the light of the sun and the air of god for i perceived the nature of the punishment how can i break my vow were it only the lopping off of a hand or a foot i should not delay but even that is impossible now that the english have rule one or another of my peoplehe looked obliquely at the directorgeneral of public educationwould at once write a letter to the viceroy and perhaps i should be deprived of that ruffle of drums  he unscrewed the mouthpiece of his silver waterpipe fitted a plain amber one and passed the pipe to me not content with refusing revenue he continued this outlander refuses also to beegar this is the corvee or forced labor on the roads and stirs my people up to the like treason yet he is if so he wills an expert logsnatcher there is none better or bolder among my people to clear a block of the river when the logs stick fast  but he worships strange gods said the prime minister deferentially  for that i have no concern said the king who was as tolerant as akbar in matters of belief to each man his own god and the fire or mother earth for us all at the last it is the rebellion that offends me  the king has an army i suggested has not the king burned the mans house and left him naked to the night dews  nay a hut is a hut and it holds the life of a man but once i sent my army against him when his excuses became wearisome of their heads he brake three across the top with a stick the other two men ran away also the guns would not shoot  i had seen the equipment of the infantry onethird of it was an old muzzle loading fowlingpiece with ragged rust holes where the nipples should have been onethird a wirebound matchlock with a wormeaten stock and onethird a fourbore flint duckgun without a flint  but it is to be remembered said the king reaching out for the bottle that he is a very expert logsnatcher and a man of a merry face what shall i do to him sahib  this was interesting the timid hillfolk would as soon have refused taxes to their king as offerings to their gods the rebel must be a man of character  if it be the kings permission i said i will not strike my tents till the third day and i will see this man the mercy of the king is godlike and rebellion is like unto the sin of witchcraft moreover both the bottles and another be empty  you have my leave to go said the king  next morning the crier went through the stare proclaiming that there was a log jam on the river and that it behooved all loyal subjects to clear it the people poured down from their villages to the moist warm valley of poppy fields and the king and i went with them  hundreds of dressed deodar logs had caught on a snag of rock and the river was bringing down more logs every minute to complete the blockade the water snarled and wrenched and worried at the timber while the population of the state prodded at the nearest logs with poles in the hope of easing the pressure then there went up a shout of namgay doola namgay doola and a large redhaired villager hurried up stripping off his clothes as he ran  that he is that is the rebel said the king now will the dam be cleared  but why has he red hair i asked since red hair among hillfolk is as uncommon as blue or green  he is an outlander said the king well done oh well done  namgay doola had scrambled on the jam and was clawing out the butt of a log with a rude sort of a boathook it slid forward slowly as an alligator moves and three or four others followed it the green water spouted through the gaps then the villagers howled and shouted and leaped among the logs pulling and pushing the obstinate timber and the red head of namgay doola was chief among them all the logs swayed and chafed and groaned as fresh consignments from up stream battered the now weakening dam it gave way at last in a smother of foam racing butts bobbing black heads and a confusion indescribable as the river tossed everything before it i saw the red head go down with the last remnants of the jam and disappear between the great grinding tree trunks it rose close to the hank and blowing like a grampus namgay doola wiped the water out of his eyes and made obeisance to the king  i had time to observe the man closely the virulent redness of his shock head and beard was most startling and in the thicket of hair twinkled above high cheekbones two very merry blue eyes he was indeed an outlander but yet a thibetan in language habit and attire he spoke the lepcha dialect with an indescribable softening of the gutturals it was not so much a lisp as an accent  whence comest thou i asked wondering  from thibet he pointed across the hills and grinned that grin went straight to my heart mechanically i held out my hand and namgay doola took it no pure thibetan would have understood the meaning of the gesture he went away to look for his clothes and as he climbed back to his village i heard a joyous yell that seemed unaccountably familiar it was the whooping of namgay doola  you see now said the king why i would not kill him he is a bold man among my logs but and he shook his head like a schoolmaster i know that before long there will be complaints of him in the court let us return to the palace and do justice  it was that kings custom to judge his subjects every day between eleven and three oclock i heard him do justice equitably on weighty matters of trespass slander and a little wifestealing then his brow clouded and he summoned me  again it is namgay doola he said despairingly not content with refusing revenue on his own part he has bound half his village by an oath to the like treason never before has such a thing befallen me nor are my taxes heavy  a rabbitfaced villager with a blushrose stuck behind his ear advanced trembling he had been in namgay doolas conspiracy but had told everything and hoped for the kings favor  oh king said i if it be the kings will let this matter stand over till the morning only the gods can do right in a hurry and it may be that yonder villager has lied  nay for i know the nature of namgay doola but since a guest asks let the matter remain wilt thou for my sake speak harshly to this redheaded outlander he may listen to thee  i made an attempt that very evening but for the life of me i could not keep my countenance namgay doola grinned so persuasively and began to tell me about a big brown bear in a poppy field by the river would i care to shoot that bear i spoke austerely on the sin of detected conspiracy and the certainty of punishment namgay doolas face clouded for a moment shortly afterward he withdrew from my tent and i heard him singing softly among the pines the words were unintelligible to me but the tune like his liquid insinuating speech seemed the ghost of something strangely familiar  dir hane mardiyemen dir to weeree ala gee  crooned namgay doola again and again and i racked my brain for that lost tune it was not till after dinner that i discovered some one had cut a square foot of velvet from the centre of my best cameracloth this made me so angry that i wandered down the valley in the hope of meeting the big brown bear i could hear him grunting like a discontented pig in the poppy field as i waited shoulder deep in the dewdripping indian corn to catch him after his meal the moon was at full and drew out the scent of the tasseled crop then i heard the anguished bellow of a himalayan cowone of the little black crummies no bigger than newfoundland dogs two shadows that looked like a bear and her cub hurried past me i was in the act of firing when i saw that each bore a brilliant red head the lesser animal was trailing something ropelike that left a dark track on the path they were within six feet of me and the shadow of the moonlight lay velvetblack on their faces velvetblack was exactly the word for by all the powers of moonlight they were masked in the velvet of my cameracloth i marveled and went to bed  next morning the kingdom was in an uproar namgay doola men said had gone forth in the night and with a sharp knife had cut off the tail of a cow belonging to the rabbitfaced villager who had betrayed him it was sacrilege unspeakable against the holy cow the state desired his blood but he had retreated into his hut barricaded the doors and windows with big stones and defied the world  the king and i and the populace approached the hut cautiously there was no hope of capturing our man without loss of life for from a hole in the wall projected the muzzle of an extremely wellcaredfor gunthe only gun in the state that could shoot namgay doola had narrowly missed a villager just before we came up  the standing army stood  it could do no more for when it advanced pieces of sharp shale flew from the windows to these were added from time to time showers of scalding water we saw red beads bobbing up and down within the family of namgay doola were aiding their sire bloodcurdling yells of defiance were the only answer to our prayers  never said the king puffing has such a thing befallen my state next year i will certainly buy a little cannon he looked at me imploringly  is there any priest in the kingdom to whom he will listen said i for a light was beginning to break upon me  he worships his own god said the prime minister we can but starve him out  let the white man approach said namgay doola from within all others i will kill send me the white man  the door was thrown open and i entered the smoky interior of a thibetan hut crammed with children and every child had flaming red hair a freshgathered cows tail lay on the floor and by its side two pieces of black velvetmy black velvetrudely hacked into the semblance of masks  and what is this shame namgay doola i asked  he grinned more charmingly than ever there is no shame said he i did but cut off the tail of that mans cow he betrayed me i was minded to shoot him sahib but not to death indeed not to death only in the legs  and why at all since it is the custom to pay revenue to the king why at all  by the god of my father i cannot tell said namgay doola  and who was thy father  the same that had this gun he showed me his weapon a tower musket bearing date 1832 and the stamp of the honorable east india company  and thy fathers name said i  he obeyed and i understood whence the puzzling accent in his speech came thimla dhula said he excitedly to this hour i worship his god  may i see that god  in a little whileat twilight time  rememberest thou aught of thy fathers speech  it is long ago but there was one word which he said often thus shun then i and my brethren stood upon our feet our hands to our sides thus  even so and what was thy mother  a woman of the hills we be lepchas of darjiling but me they call an outlander because my hair is as thou seest  the thibetan woman his wife touched him on the arm gently the long parley outside the fort had lasted far into the day it was now close upon twilight the hour of the angelus very solemnly the redheaded brats rose from the floor and formed a semicircle namgay doola laid his gun aside lighted a little oil lamp and set it before a recess in the wall pulling back a wisp of dirty cloth he revealed a worn brass crucifix leaning against the helmet badge of a longforgotten east india companys regiment thus did my father he said crossing himself clumsily the wife and children followed suit then all together they struck up the wailing cham that i heard on the hillside  dir bane mardiyemen dir to weeree ala gee  i was puzzled no longer again and again they sung as if their hearts would break their version of the chorus of the wearing of the green  theyre hanging men and women too for the wearing of the green  a diabolical inspiration came to me one of the brats a boy about eight years oldcould he have been in the fields last nightwas watching me as he sung i pulled out a rupee held the coin between finger and thumb and lookedonly lookedat the gun leaning against the wall a grin of brilliant and perfect comprehension overspread his porringerlike face never for an instant stopping the song he held out his hand for the money and then slid the gun to my hand i might have shot namgay doola dead as he chanted but i was satisfied the inevitable bloodinstinct held true namgay doola drew the curtain across the recess angelus was over  thus my father sung there was much more but i have forgotten and i do not know the purport of even these words but it may be that the god will understand i am not of this people and i will not pay revenue  and why  again that soulcompelling grin what occupation would be to me between crop and crop it is better than scaring bears but these people do not understand  he picked the masks off the floor and looked in my face as simply as a child  by what road didst thou attain knowledge to make those deviltries i said pointing  i cannot tell i am but a lepcha of darjiling and yet the stuff  which thou hast stolen said i  nay surely did i steal i desired it so the stuffthe stuff what else should i have done with the stuff he twisted the velvet between his fingers  but the sin of maiming the cowconsider that  oh sahib the man betrayed me the heifers tail waved in the moonlight and i had my knife what else should i have done the tail came off ere i was aware sahib thou knowest more than i  that is true said i stay within the door i go to speak to the king the population of the state were ranged on the hillside i went forth and spoke  o king said i touching this man there be two courses open to thy wisdom thou canst either hang him from a treehim and his broodtill there remains no hair that is red within thy land  nay said the king why should i hurt the little children  they had poured out of the hut and were making plump obeisances to everybody namgay doola waited at the door with his gun across his arm  or thou canst discarding their impiety of the cowmaiming raise him to honor in thy army he comes of a race that will not pay revenue a red flame is in his blood which comes out at the top of his head in that glowing hair make him chief of thy army give him honor as may befall and full allowance of work but look to it oh king that neither he nor his hold a foot of earth from thee henceforward feed him with words and favor and also liquor from certain bottles that thou knowest of and he will be a bulwark of defense but deny him even a tuftlet of grass for his own this is the nature that god has given him moreover he has brethren  the state groaned unanimously  but if his brethren come they will surely fight with each other till they die or else the one will always give information concerning the other shall he be of thy army oh king choose  the king bowed his head and i said  come forth namgay doola and command the kings army thy name shall no more be namgay in the mouths of men but patsay doola for as thou hast truly said i

making offerings for the sin of the cattlemaiming  and the king was so pleased with my perspicacity that he offered to sell me a village for 20 pounds sterling but i buy no village in the himalayas so long as one red head flares between the tail of the heavenclimbing glacier and the dark birch forest  i know that breed    the recrudescence of imray  imray had achieved the impossible without warning for no conceivable motive in his youth and at the threshold of his career he had chosen to disappear from the worldwhich is to say the little indian station where he lived upon a day he was alive well happy and in great evidence at his club among the billiardtables upon a morning he was not and no manner of search could make sure where he might be he had stepped out of his place he had not appeared at his office at the proper time and his dogcart was not upon the public roads for these reasons and because he was hampering in a microscopical degree the administration of the indian empire the indian empire paused for one microscopical moment to make inquiry into the fate of imray ponds were dragged wells were plumbed telegrams were dispatched down the lines of railways and to the nearest seaport town1200 miles awaybut imray was not at the end of the dragropes nor the telegrams he was gone and his place knew him no more then the work of the great indian empire swept forward because it could not be delayed and imray from being a man became a mysterysuch a thing as men talk over at their tables in the club for a month and then forget utterly his guns horses and carts were sold to the highest bidder his superior officer wrote an absurd letter to his mother saying that imray had unaccountably disappeared and his bungalow stood empty on the road  after three or four months of the scorching hot weather had gone by my friend strickland of the police force saw fit to rent the bungalow from the native landlord this was before he was engaged to miss youghalan affair which has been described in another placeand while he was pursuing his investigations into native life his own life was sufficiently peculiar and men complained of his manners and customs there was always food in his house but there were no regular times for meals he ate standing up and walking about whatever he might find on the sideboard and this is not good for the insides of human beings his domestic equipment was limited to six rifles three shotguns five saddles and a collection of stiffjointed masheer rods bigger and stronger than the largest salmon rods these things occupied one half of his bungalow and the other half was given up to strickland and his dog tietjensan enormous rampur slut who sung when she was ordered and devoured daily the rations of two men she spoke to strickland in a language of her own and whenever in her walks abroad she saw things calculated to destroy the peace of her majesty the queen empress she returned to her master and gave him information strickland would take steps at once and the end of his labors was trouble and fine and imprisonment for other people the natives believed that tietjens was a familiar spirit and treated her with the great reverence that is born of hate and fear one room in the bungalow was set apart for her special use she owned a bedstead a blanket and a drinkingtrough and if any one came into stricklands room at night her custom was to knock down the invader and give tongue till some one came with a light strickland owes his life to her when he was on the frontier in search of the local murderer who came in the grey dawn to send strickland much further than the andaman islands tietjens caught him as he was crawling into stricklands tent with a dagger between his teeth and after his record of iniquity was established in the eyes of the law he was hanged from that date tietjens wore a collar of rough silver and employed a monogram on her night blanket and the blanket was doublewoven kashmir cloth for she was a delicate dog  under no circumstances would she be separated from strickland and when he was ill with fever she made great trouble for the doctors because she did not know how to help her master and would not allow another creature to attempt aid macarnaght of the indian medical service beat her over the head with a gun before she could understand that she must give room for those who could give quinine  a short time after strickland had taken imrays bungalow my business took me through that station and naturally the club quarters being full i quartered myself upon strickland it was a desirable bungalow eightroomed and heavily thatched against any chance of leakage from rain under the pitch of the roof ran a ceiling cloth which looked just as nice as a whitewashed ceiling the landlord had repainted it when strickland took the bungalow and unless you knew how indian bungalows were built you would never have suspected that above the cloth lay the dark threecornered cavern of the roof where the beams and the under side of the thatch harbored all manner of rats hats ants and other things  tietjens met me in the veranda with a bay like the boom of the bells of st pauls and put her paws on my shoulders and said she was glad to see me strickland had contrived to put together that sort of meal which he called lunch and immediately after it was finished went out about his business i was left alone with tietjens and my own affairs the heat of the summer had broken up and given place to the warm damp of the rains there was no motion in the heated air but the rain fell like bayonet rods on the earth and flung up a blue mist where it splashed back again the bamboos and the custard apples the poinsettias and the mangotrees in the garden stood still while the warm water lashed through them and the frogs began to sing among the aloe hedges a little before the light failed and when the rain was at its worst i sat in the back veranda and heard the water roar from the eaves and scratched myself because i was covered with the thing they called prickly heat tietjens came out with me and put her head in my lap and was very sorrowful so i gave her biscuits when tea was ready and i took tea in the back veranda on account of the little coolness i found there the rooms of the house were dark behind me i could smell stricklands saddlery and the oil on his guns and i did not the least desire to sit among these things my own servant came to me in the twilight the muslin of his clothes clinging tightly to his drenched body and told me that a gentleman had called and wished to see some one very much against my will and because of the darkness of the rooms i went into the naked drawingroom telling my man to bring the lights there might or might not have been a caller in the roomit seems to me that i saw a figure by one of the windows but when the lights came there was nothing save the spikes of the rain without and the smell of the drinking earth in my nostrils i explained to my man that he was no wiser than he ought to be and went back to the veranda to talk to tietjens she had gone out into the wet and i could hardly coax her back to meeven with biscuits with sugar on top strickland rode back dripping wet just before dinner and the first thing he said was  has any one called  i explained with apologies that my servant had called me into the drawing room on a false alarm or that some loafer had tried to call on strickland and thinking better of it fled after giving his name strickland ordered dinner without comment and since it was a real dinner with white tablecloth attached we sat down  at nine oclock strickland wanted to go to bed and i was tired too tietjens who had been lying underneath the table rose up and went into the least exposed veranda as soon as her master moved to his own room which was next to the stately chamber set apart for tietjens if a mere wife had wished to sleep outofdoors in that pelting rain it would not have mattered but tietjens was a dog and therefore the better animal i looked at strickland expecting to see him flog her with a whip he smiled queerly as a man would smile after telling some hideous domestic tragedy she has done this ever since i moved in here  the dog was stricklands dog so i said nothing but i felt all that strickland felt in being made light of tietjens encamped outside my bedroom window and storm after storm came up thundered on the thatch and died away the lightning spattered the sky as a thrown egg spattered a barn door but the light was pale blue not yellow and looking through my slit bamboo blinds i could see the great dog standing not sleeping in the veranda the hackles alift on her back and her feet planted as tensely as the drawn wire rope of a suspension bridge in the very short pauses of the thunder i tried to sleep but it seemed that some one wanted me very badly he whoever he was was trying to call me by name but his voice was no more than a husky whisper then the thunder ceased and tietjens went into the garden and howled at the low moon somebody tried to open my door and walked about and through the house and stood breathing heavily in the verandas and just when i was falling asleep i fancied that i heard a wild hammering and clamoring above my head or on the door  i ran into stricklands room and asked him whether he was ill and had been calling for me he was lying on the bed halfdressed with a pipe in his mouth i thought youd come he said have i been walking around the house at all  i explained that he had been in the diningroom and the smokingroom and two or three other places and he laughed and told me to go back to bed i went back to bed and slept till the morning but in all my dreams i was sure i was doing some one an injustice in not attending to his wants what those wants were i could not tell but a fluttering whispering boltfumbling luring loitering some one was reproaching me for my slackness and through all the dreams i heard the howling of tietjens in the garden and the thrashing of the rain  i was in that house for two days and strickland went to his office daily leaving me alone for eight or ten hours a day with tietjens for my only companion as long as the full light lasted i was comfortable and so was tietjens but in the twilight she and i moved into the back veranda and cuddled each other for company we were alone in the house but for all that it was fully occupied by a tenant with whom i had no desire to interfere i never saw him but i could see the curtains between the rooms quivering where he had just passed through i could hear the chairs creaking as the bamboos sprung under a weight that had just quitted them and i could feel when i went to get a book from the diningroom that somebody was waiting in the shadows of the front veranda till i should have gone away tietjens made the twilight more interesting by glaring into the darkened rooms with every hair erect and following the motions of something that i could not see she never entered the rooms but her eyes moved and that was quite sufficient only when my servant came to trim the lamps and make all light and habitable she would come in with me and spend her time sitting on her haunches watching an invisible extra man as he moved about behind my shoulder dogs are cheerful companions  i explained to strickland gently as might be that i would go over to the club and find for myself quarters there i admired his hospitality was pleased with his guns and rods but i did not much care for his house and its atmosphere he heard me out to the end and then smiled very wearily but without contempt for he is a man who understands things stay on he said and see what this thing means all you have talked about i have known since i took the bungalow stay on and wait tietjens has left me are you going too  i had seen him through one little affair connected with an idol that had brought me to the doors of a lunatic asylum and i had no desire to help him through further experiences he was a man to whom unpleasantnesses arrived as do dinners to ordinary people  therefore i explained more clearly than ever that i liked him immensely and would he happy to see him in the daytime but that i didnt care to sleep under his roof this was after dinner when tietjens had gone out to lie in the veranda  pon my soul i dont wonder said strickland with his eyes on the ceiling cloth look at that  the tails of two snakes were hanging between the cloth and the cornice of the wall they threw long shadows in the lamplight if you are afraid of snakes of coursesaid strickland i hate and fear snakes because if you look into the eyes of any snake you will see that it knows all and more of mans fall and that it feels all the contempt that the devil felt when adam was evicted from eden besides which its bite is generally fatal and it bursts up trouser legs  you ought to get your thatch overhauled i said give me a masheer rod and well poke em down  theyll hide among the roof beams said strickland i  cant stand snakes overhead im going up if i shake em down stand by with a cleaningrod and break their backs  i was not anxious to assist strickland in his work hut i took the loadingrod and waited in the diningroom while strickland brought a gardeners ladder from the veranda and set it against the side of the room the snake tails drew themselves up and disappeared we could hear the dry rushing scuttle of long bodies running over the baggy cloth strickland took a lamp with him while i tried to make clear the danger of hunting roof snakes between a ceiling cloth and a thatch apart from the deterioration of property caused by ripping out ceilingcloths  n o n s en s e  said strickland theyre sure to hide near the walls by the cloth the bricks are too cold for em and the heat of the room is just what they like he put his hands to the corner of the cloth and ripped the rotten stuff from the cornice it gave great sound of tearing and strickland put his head through the opening into the dark of the angle of the roof beams i set my teeth and lifted the loadingrod for i had not the least knowledge of what might descend  hm said strickland and his voice rolled and rumbled in the roof theres room for another set of rooms up here and by jove some one is occupying em  snakes i said down below  no its a buffalo hand me up the two first joints of a masheer rod and ill prod it its lying on the main beam  i handed up the rod  what a nest for owls and serpents no wonder the snakes live here said strickland climbing further into the roof i could see his elbow thrusting with the rod come out of that whoever you are look out heads below there its tottering  i saw the ceilingcloth nearly in the centre of the room bag with a shape that was pressing it downward and downward toward the lighted lamps on the table i snatched a lamp out of danger and stood back then the cloth ripped out from the walls tore split swayed and shot down upon the table something that i dared not look at till strickland had slid down the ladder and was standing by my side  he did not say much being a man of few words but he picked up the loose end of the tablecloth and threw it over the thing on the table  it strikes me said he pulling down the lamp our friend imray has come back oh you would would you  there was a movement under the cloth and a little snake wriggled out to be backbroken by the butt of the masheer rod i was sufficiently sick to make no remarks worth recording  strickland meditated and helped himself to drinks liberally the thing under the cloth made no more signs of life  is it imray i said  strickland turned back the cloth for a moment and looked it is imray he said and his throat is cut from ear to ear  then we spoke both together and to ourselves  thats why he whispered about the house  tietjens in the garden began to bay furiously a little later her great nose heaved upon the diningroom door  she sniffed and was still the broken and tattered ceilingcloth hung down almost to the level of the table and there was hardly room to move away from the discovery  then tietjens came in and sat down her teeth bared and her forepaws planted she looked at strickland  its bad business old lady said he men dont go up into the roofs of their bungalows to die and they dont fasten up the ceilingcloth behind em lets think it out  lets think it out somewhere else i said  excellent idea turn the lamps out well get into my room  i did not turn the lamps out i went into stricklands room first and allowed him to make the darkness then he followed me and we lighted tobacco and thought strickland did the thinking i smoked furiously because i was afraid  imray is back said strickland the question is who killed imray dont talki have a notion of my own when i took this bungalow i took most of imrays servants imray was guileless and inoffensive wasnt he  i agreed though the heap under the cloth looked neither one thing nor the other  if i call the servants they will stand fast in a crowd and lie like aryans what do you suggest  call em in one by one i said  theyll run away and give the news to all their fellows said strickland  we must segregate em do you suppose your servant knows anything about it  he may for aught i know hut i dont think its likely he has only been here two or three days  whats your notion i asked  i cant quite tell how the dickens did the man get the wrong side of the ceilingcloth  there was a heavy coughing outside stricklands bedroom door this showed that bahadur khan his bodyservant had waked from sleep and wished to put strickland to bed  come in said strickland it is a very warm night isnt it  bahadur khan a great greenturbaned sixfoot mohammedan said that it was a very warm night but that there was more rain pending which by his honors favor would bring relief to the country  it will be so if god pleases said strickland tugging off his hoots it is in my mind bahadur khan that i have worked thee remorselessly for many days ever since that time when thou first came into my service what time was that  has the heavenborn forgotten it was when imray sahib went secretly to europe without warning given and ieven icame into the honored service of the protector of the poor  and imray sahib went to europe  it is so said among the servants  and thou wilt take service with him when he returns  assuredly sahib he was a good master and cherished his dependents  that is true i am very tired but i can go buckshooting tomorrow give me the little rifle that i use for black buck it is in the case yonder  the man stooped over the case banded barrels stock and foreend to strickland who fitted them together yawning dolefully then he reached down to the guncase took a solid drawn cartridge and slipped it into the breech of the 360 express  and imray sahib has gone to europe secretly that is very strange bahadur khan is it not  what do i know of the ways of the white man heavenborn  very little truly but thou shalt know more it has reached me that imray sahib has returned from his so long journeyings and that even now he lies in the next room waiting his servant  sahib  the lamplight slid along the barrels of the rifle as they leveled themselves against bahadur khans broad breast  go then and look said strickland take a lamp thy master is tired and he waits go  the man picked up a lamp and went into the diningroom strickland following and almost pushing him with the muzzle of the rifle he looked for a moment at the black depths behind the ceilingcloth at the carcass of the mangled snake under foot and last a grey glaze setting on his face at the thing under the tablecloth  hast thou seen said strickland after a pause  i have seen i am clay in the white mans hands what does the presence do  hang thee within a month what else  for killing him nay sahib consider walking among us his servants he cast his eyes upon my child who was four years old him he bewitched and in ten days he died of the fever my child  what said imray sahib  he said he was a handsome child and patted him on the head wherefore my child died wherefore i killed imray sahib in the twilight when he came back from office and was sleeping the heavenborn knows all things i am the servant of the heavenborn  strickland looked at me above the rifle and said in the vernacular thou art witness to this saying he has killed  bahadur khan stood ashen grey in the light of the one lamp the need for justification came upon him very swiftly  i am trapped he said but the offence was that mans he cast an evil eye upon my child and i killed and hid him only such as are served by devils he glared at tietjens crouched stolidly before him only such could know what i did  it was clever but thou shouldst have lashed him to the beam with a rope now thou thyself wilt hang by a rope orderly  a drowsy policeman answered stricklands call he was followed by another and tietjens sat still  take him to the station said strickland there is a case toward  do i hang then said bahadur khan making no attempt to escape and keeping his eyes on the ground  if the sun shines or the water runs thou wilt hang said strickland bahadur khan stepped back one pace quivered and stood still the two policemen waited further orders  go said strickland  nay but i go very swiftly said bahadur khan look i am even now a dead man  he lifted his foot and to the little toe there clung the head of the half killed snake firm fixed in the agony of death  i come of landholding stock said bahadur khan rocking where he stood it were a disgrace for me to go to the public scaffold therefore i take this way be it remembered that the sahibs shirts are correctly enumerated and that there is an extra piece of soap in his washbasin my child was bewitched and i slew the wizard why should you seek to slay me my honor is saved andandi die  at the end of an hour he died as they die who are bitten by the little kariat and the policeman bore him and the thing under the tablecloth to their appointed places they were needed to make clear the disappearance of imray  this said strickland very calmly as he climbed into bed is called the nineteenth century did you hear what that man said  i heard i answered imray made a mistake  simply and solely through not knowing the nature and coincidence of a little seasonal fever bahadur khan has been with him for four years  i shuddered my own servant had been with me for exactly that length of time when i went over to my own room i found him waiting impassive as the copper head on a penny to pull off my boots  what has befallen bahadur khan said i  he was bitten by a snake and died the rest the sahib knows was the answer  and how much of the matter hast thou known  as much as might be gathered from one coming in the twilight to seek satisfaction gently sahib let me pull off those boots  i had just settled to the sleep of exhaustion when i heard strickland shouting from his side of the house  tietjens has come back to her room  and so she had the great deerhound was couched on her own bedstead on her own blanket and in the next room the idle empty ceilingcloth wagged light heartedly as it flailed on the table    moti gujmutineer  once upon a time there was a coffeeplanter in india who wished to clear some forest land for coffeeplanting when he had cut down all the trees and burned the underwood the stumps still remained dynamite is expensive and slow fire slow the happy medium for stumpclearing is the lord of all beasts who is the elephant he will either push the stump out of the ground with his tusks if he has any or drag it out with ropes the planter therefore hired elephants by ones and twos and threes and fell to work the very best of all the elephants belonged to the very worst of all the drivers or mahouts and this superior beasts name was moti guj he was the absolute property of his mahout which would never have been the case under native rule for moti guj was a creature to be desired by kings and his name being translated meant the pearl elephant because the british government was in the land deesa the mahout enjoyed his property undisturbed he was dissipated when he had made much money through the strength of his elephant he would get extremely drunk and give moti guj a beating with a tentpeg over the tender nails of the forefeet moti guj never trampled the life out of deesa on these occasions for he knew that after the beating was over deesa would embrace his trunk and weep and call him his love and his life and the liver of his soul and give him some liquor moti guj was very fond of liquorarrack for choice though he would drink palmtree toddy if nothing better offered then deesa would go to sleep between moti gujs forefeet and as deesa generally chose the middle of the public road and as moti guj mounted guard over him and would not permit horse foot or cart to pass by traffic was congested till deesa saw fit to wake up  there was no sleeping in the daytime on the planters clearing the wages were too high to risk deesa sat on moti gujs neck and gave him orders while moti guj rooted up the stumpsfor he owned a magnificent pair of tusks or pulled at the end of a ropefor he had a magnificent pair of shoulderswhile deesa kicked him behind the ears and said he was the king of elephants at evening time moti guj would wash down his three hundred pounds weight of green food with a quart of arrack and deesa would take a share and sing songs between moti gujs legs till it was time to go to bed once a week deesa led moti guj down to the river and moti gui lay on his side luxuriously in the shallows while deesa went over him with a coir swab and a brick moti guj never mistook the pounding blow of the latter for the smack of the former that warned him to get up and turn over on the other side then deesa would look at his feet and examine his eyes and turn up the fringes of his mighty ears in case of sores or budding ophthalmia after inspection the two would come up with a song from the sea moti guj all black and shining waving a torn tree branch twelve feet long in his trunk and deesa knotting up his own long wet hair  it was a peaceful wellpaid life till deesa felt the return of the desire to drink deep he wished for an orgy the little draughts that led nowhere were taking the manhood out of him  he went to the planter and my mothers dead said he weeping  she died on the last plantation two months ago and she died once before that when you were working for me last year said the planter who knew something of the ways of nativedom  then its my aunt and she was just the same as a mother to me said deesa weeping more than ever she has left eighteen small children entirely without bread and it is i who must fill their little stomachs said deesa beating his head on the floor  who brought the news said the planter  the post said deesa  there hasnt been a post here for the past week get back to your lines  a devastating sickness has fallen on my village and all my wives are dying yelled deesa really in tears this time  call chihun who comes from deesas village said the planter chihun has this man got a wife  he said chihun no not a woman of our village would look at him theyd sooner marry the elephant  chihun snorted deesa wept and bellowed  you will get into a difficulty in a minute said the planter go back to your work  now i will speak heavens truth gulped deesa with an inspiration i havent been drunk for two months i desire to depart in order to get properly drunk afar off and distant from this heavenly plantation thus i shall cause no trouble  a flickering smile crossed the planters face deesa said he youve spoken the truth and id give you leave on the spot if anything could be done with moti guj while youre away you know that he will only obey your orders  may the light of the heavens live forty thousand years i shall be absent but ten little days after that upon my faith and honor and soul i return as to the inconsiderable interval have i the gracious permission of the heavenborn to call up moti guj  permission was granted and in answer of deesas shrill yell the mighty tusker swung out of the shade of a clump of trees where he had been squirting dust over himself till his master should return  light of my heart protector of the drunken mountain of might give ear said deesa standing in front of him  moti guj gave ear and saluted with his trunk i am going away said deesa  moti gujs eyes twinkled he liked jaunts as well as his master one could snatch all manner of nice things from the roadside then  but you you fussy old pig must stay behind and work  the twinkle died out as moti guj tried to look delighted he hated stump hauling on the plantation it hurt his teeth  i shall be gone for ten days oh delectable one hold up your near forefoot and ill impress the fact upon it warty toad of a dried mudpuddle deesa took a tentpeg and banged moti guj ten times on the nails moti guj grunted and shuffled from foot to foot  ten days said deesa you will work and haul and root the trees as chihun here shall order you take up chihun and set him on your neck moti guj curled the tip of his trunk chihun put his foot there and was swung on to the neck deesa handed chihun the heavy ankusthe iron elephant goad  chihun thumped moti gujs bald head as a paver thumps a curbstone  moti guj trumpeted  be still hog of the backwoods chihuns your mahout for ten days and now bid me goodbye beast after mine own heart oh my lord my king jewel of all created elephants lily of the herd preserve your honored health be virtuous adieu  moti guj lapped his trunk round deesa and swung him into the air twice that was his way of bidding him goodbye  hell work now said deesa to the planter have i leave to go  the planter nodded and deesa dived into the woods moti guj went back to haul stumps  chihun was very kind to him but he felt unhappy and forlorn for all that chihun gave him a ball of spices and tickled him under the chin and chihuns little baby cooed to him after work was over and chihuns wife called him a darling but moti guj was a bachelor by instinct as deesa was he did not understand the domestic emotions he wanted the light of his universe back againthe drink and the drunken slumber the savage beatings and the savage caresses  none the less he worked well and the planter wondered deesa had wandered along the roads till he met a marriage procession of his own caste and drinking dancing and tippling had drifted with it past all knowledge of the lapse of time  the morning of the eleventh day dawned and there returned no deesa moti guj was loosed from his ropes for the daily stint he swung clear looked round shrugged his shoulders and began to walk away as one having business elsewhere  hi ho come back you shouted chihun come back and put me on your neck misborn mountain return splendor of the hillsides adornment of all india heave to or ill bang every toe off your forefoot  moti guj gurgled gently but did not obey chihun ran after him with a rope and caught him up moti guj put his ears forward and chihun knew what that meant though he tried to carry it off with high words  none of your nonsense with me said he to your pickets devilson  hrrump said moti guj and that was allthat and the forebent ears  moti guj put his hands in his pockets chewed a branch for a toothpick and strolled about the clearing making fun of the other elephants who had just set to work  chihun reported the state of affairs to the planter who came out with a dog whip and cracked it furiously moti guj paid the white man the compliment of charging him nearly a quarter of a mile across the clearing and hrrumphing him into his veranda then he stood outside the house chuckling to himself and shaking all over with the fun of it as an elephant will  well thrash him said the planter he shall have the finest thrashing ever elephant received give kala nag and nazim twelve foot of chain apiece and tell them to lay on twenty  kala nagwhich means black snakeand nazim were two of the biggest elephants in the lines and one of their duties was to administer the graver punishment since no man can beat an elephant properly  they took the whippingchains and rattled them in their trunks as they sidled up to moti guj meaning to hustle him between them moti guj had never in all his life of thirtynine years been whipped and he did not intend to begin a new experience so he waited waving his head from right to left and measuring the precise spot in kala nags fat side where a blunt tusk could sink deepest kala nag had no tusks the chain was the badge of his authority but for all that he swung wide of moti guj at the last minute and tried to appear as if he had brought the chain out for amusement nazim turned round and went home early he did not feel fighting fit that morning and so moti guj was left standing alone with his ears cocked  that decided the planter to argue no more and moti guj rolled back to his amateur inspection of the clearing an elephant who will not work and is not tied up is about as manageable as an eightyoneton gun loose in a heavy seaway he slapped old friends on the back and asked them if the stumps were coming away easily he talked nonsense concerning labor and the inalienable rights of elephants to a long nooning and wandering to and fro he thoroughly demoralized the garden till sundown when he returned to his picket for food  if you wont work you shant eat said chihun angrily youre a wild elephant and no educated animal at all go back to your jungle  chihuns little brown baby was rolling on the floor of the hut and stretching out its fat arms to the huge shadow in the doorway moti guj knew well that it was the dearest thing on earth to chihun he swung out his trunk with a fascinating crook at the end and the brown baby threw itself shouting upon it moti guj made fast and pulled up till the brown baby was crowing in the air twelve feet above his fathers head  great lord said chihun flour cakes of the best twelve in number two feet across and soaked in rum shall be yours on the instant and two hundred pounds weight of freshcut young sugarcane therewith deign only to put down safely that insignificant brat who is my heart and my life to me  moti guj tucked the brown baby comfortably between his forefeet that could have knocked into toothpicks all chihuns hut and waited for his food he ate it and the brown baby crawled away moti guj dozed and thought of deesa one of many mysteries connected with the elephant is that his huge body needs less sleep than anything else that lives four or five hours in the night suffice two just before midnight lying down on one side two just after one oclock lying down on the other the rest of the silent hours are filled with eating and fidgeting and long grumbling soliloquies  at midnight therefore moti guj strode out of his pickets for a thought had come to him that deesa might be lying drunk somewhere in the dark forest with none to look after him so all that night he chased through the undergrowth blowing and trumpeting and shaking his ears he went down to the river and blared across the shallows where deesa used to wash him hut there was no answer he could not find deesa but he disturbed all the other elephants in the lines and nearly frightened to death some gypsies in the woods  at dawn deesa returned to the plantation he had been very drunk in deed and he expected to get into trouble for outstaying his leave he drew a long breath when he saw that the bungalow and the plantation were still uninjured for he knew something of moti gujs temper and reported himself with many lies and salaams moti guj had gone to his pickets for breakfast the night exercise had made him hungry

guj was at the planters door almost before chihun noticed that he had left his pickets he fell into deesas arms trumpeting with joy and the man and beast wept and slobbered over each other and handled each other from head to heel to see that no harm had befallen  now we will get to work said deesa lift me up my son and my joy  moti guj swung him up and the two went to the coffeeclearing to look for difficult stumps  the planter was too astonished to be very angry
