which is entirely introductorycontains an account of miss crump her suitors and her family circle  in a certain quiet and sequestered nook of the retired village of londonperhaps in the neighbourhood of berkeley square or at any rate somewhere near burlington gardensthere was once a house of entertainment called the bootjack hotel mr crump the landlord had in the outset of life performed the duties of boots in some inn even more frequented than his own and far from being ashamed of his origin as many persons are in the days of their prosperity had thus solemnly recorded it over the hospitable gate of his hotel  crump married miss budge so well known to the admirers of the festive dance on the other side of the water as miss delancy and they had one daughter named morgiana after that celebrated part in the forty thieves which miss budge performed with unbounded applause both at the surrey and the wells mrs crump sat in a little bar profusely ornamented with pictures of the dancers of all ages from hillisberg rose parisot who plied the light fantastic toe in 1805 down to the sylphides of our day there was in the collection a charming portrait of herself done by de wilde she was in the dress of morgiana and in the act of pouring to very slow music a quantity of boiling oil into one of the forty jars in this sanctuary she sat with black eyes black hair a purple face and a turban and morning noon or night as you went into the parlour of the hotel there was mrs crump taking tea with a little something in it looking at the fashions or reading cumberlands british theatre the sunday times was her paper for she voted the dispatch that journal which is taken in by most ladies of her profession to be vulgar and radical and loved the theatrical gossip in which the other mentioned journal abounds  the fact is that the royal bootjack though a humble was a very genteel house and a very little persuasion would induce mr crump as he looked at his own door in the sun to tell you that he had himself once drawn off with that very bootjack the topboots of his royal highness the prince of wales and the first gentleman in europe while then the houses of entertainment in the neighbourhood were loud in their pretended liberal politics the bootjack stuck to the good old conservative line and was only frequented by such persons as were of that way of thinking there were two parlours much accustomed one for the gentlemen of the shoulderknot who came from the houses of their employers hard by another for some gents who used the ouse as mrs crump would say heaven bless her in her simple cockniac dialect and who formed a little club there  i forgot to say that while mrs c was sipping her eternal tea or washing up her endless blue china you might often hear miss morgiana employed at the little redsilk cottage piano singing come where the haspens quiver or bonny lad march over hill and furrow or my art and lute or any other popular piece of the day and the dear girl sang with very considerable skill too for she had a fine loud voice which if not always in tune made up for that defect by its great energy and activity and morgiana was not content with singing the mere tune but gave every one of the roulades flourishes and ornaments as she heard them at the theatres by mrs humby mrs waylett or madame vestris the girl had a fine black eye like her mamma a grand enthusiasm for the stage as every actors child will have and if the truth must be known had appeared many and many a time at the theatre in catherine street in minor parts first and then in little pickle in desdemona in rosina and in miss footes part where she used to dance i have not the name to my hand but think it is davidson four times in the week at least her mother and she used to sail off at night to some place of public amusement for mrs crump had a mysterious acquaintance with all sorts of theatrical personages and the gates of her old haunt the wells of the cobourg by the kind permission of mrs davidge nay of the lane and the market themselves flew open before her open sesame as the robbers door did to her colleague ali baba hornbuckle in the operatic piece in which she was so famous  beer was mr crumps beverage diversified by a little gin in the evenings and little need be said of this gentleman except that he discharged his duties honourably and filled the presidents chair at the club as completely as it could possibly be filled for he could not even sit in it in his greatcoat so accurately was the seat adapted to him his wife and daughter perhaps thought somewhat slightingly of him for he had no literary tastes and had never been at a theatre since he took his bride from one he was valet to lord slapper at the time and certain it is that his lordship set him up in the bootjack and that stories had been told but what are such to you or me let bygones be bygones mrs crump was quite as honest as her neighbours and miss had five hundred pounds to be paid down on the day of her wedding  those who know the habits of the british tradesman are aware that he has gregarious propensities like any lord in the land that he loves a joke that he is not averse to a glass that after the days toil he is happy to consort with men of his degree and that as society is not so far advanced among us as to allow him to enjoy the comforts of splendid clubhouses which are open to many persons with not a tenth part of his pecuniary means he meets his friends in the cosy tavern parlour where a neat sanded floor a large windsor chair and a glass of hot something and water make him as happy as any of the clubmen in their magnificent saloons  at the bootjack was as we have said a very genteel and select society called the kidney club from the fact that on saturday evenings a little graceful supper of broiled kidneys was usually discussed by the members of the club saturday was their grand night not but that they met on all other nights in the week when inclined for festivity and indeed some of them could not come on saturdays in the summer having elegant villas in the suburbs where they passed the sixandthirty hours of recreation that are happily to be found at the end of every week  there was mr balls the great grocer of south audley street a warm man who they say had his twenty thousand pounds jack snaffle of the mews hard by a capital fellow for a song clinker the ironmonger all married gentlemen and in the best line of business tressle the undertaker etc no liveries were admitted into the room as may be imagined but one or two select butlers and majordomos joined the circle for the persons composing it knew very well how important it was to be on good terms with these gentlemen and many a time my lords account would never have been paid and my ladys large order never have been given but for the conversation which took place at the bootjack and the friendly intercourse subsisting between all the members of the society  the tiptop men of the society were two bachelors and two as fashionable tradesmen as any in the town mr woolsey from stultzs of the famous house of linsey woolsey and co of conduit street tailors and mr eglantine the celebrated perruquier and perfumer of bond street whose soaps razors and patent ventilating scalps are know throughout europe linsey the senior partner of the tailors firm had his handsome mansion in regents park drove his buggy and did little more than lend his name to the house woolsey lived in it was the working man of the firm and it was said that his cut was as magnificent as that of any man in the profession woolsey and eglantine were rivals in many waysrivals in fashion rivals in wit and above all rivals for the hand of an amiable young lady whom we have already mentioned the darkeyed songstress morgiana crump they were both desperately in love with her that was the truth and each in the absence of the other abused his rival heartily of the hairdresser woolsey said that as for eglantine being his real name it was all his mr woolseys eye that he was in the hands of the jews and his stock and grand shop eaten up by usury and with regard to woolsey eglantine remarked that his pretence of being descended from the cardinal was all nonsense that he was a partner certainly in the firm but had only a sixteenth share and that the firm could never get their moneys in and had an immense number of bad debts in their books as is usual there was a great deal of truth and a great deal of malice in these tales however the gentlemen were take them all in all in a very fashionable way of business and had their claims to miss morgianas hand backed by the parents mr crump was a partisan of the tailor while mrs c was a strong advocate for the claims of the enticing perfumer  now it was a curious fact that these two gentlemen were each in need of the others serviceswoolsey being afflicted with premature baldness or some other necessity for a wig still more fataleglantine being a very fat man who required much art to make his figure at all decent he wore a brown frockcoat and frogs and attempted by all sorts of contrivances to hide his obesity but woolseys remark that dress as he would he would always look like a snob and that there was only one man in england who could make a gentleman of him went to the perfumers soul and if there was one thing on earth he longed for not including the hand of miss crump it was to have a coat from linseys in which costume he was sure that morgiana would not resist him  if eglantine was uneasy about the coat on the other hand he attacked woolsey atrociously on the score of his wig for though the latter went to the best makers he never could get a peruke to sit naturally upon him and the unhappy epithet of mr wiggins applied to him on one occasion by the barber stuck to him ever after in the club and made him writhe when it was uttered each man would have quitted the kidneys in disgust long since but for the otherfor each had an attraction in the place and dared not leave the field in possession of his rival  to do miss morgiana justice it must be said that she did not encourage one more than another but as far as accepting eaudecologne and haircombs from the perfumersome opera tickets a treat to greenwich and a piece of real genoa velvet for a bonnet it had originally been intended for a waistcoat from the admiring tailor she had been equally kind to each and in return had made each a present of a lock of her beautiful glossy hair it was all she had to give poor girl and what could she do but gratify her admirers by this cheap and artless testimony of her regard a pretty scene and quarrel took place between the rivals on the day when they discovered that each was in possession of one of morgianas ringlets  such then were the owners and inmates of the little bootjack from whom and which as this chapter is exceedingly discursive and descriptive we must separate the reader for a while and carry himit is only into bond street so no gentleman need be afraidcarry him into bond street where some other personages are awaiting his consideration  not far from mr eglantines shop in bond street stand as is very well known the windsor chambers the west diddlesex association western branch the british and foreign soap company the celebrated attorneys kite and levison have their respective offices here and as the names of the other inhabitants of the chambers are not only painted on the walls but also registered in mr boyles court guide it is quite unnecessary that they should be repeated here among them on the entresol between the splendid saloons of the soap company on the first floor with their statue of britannia presenting a packet of the soap to europe asia africa and america and the west diddlesex western branch on the basementlives a gentleman by the name of mr howard walker the brass plate on the door of that gentlemans chambers had the word agency inscribed beneath his name and we are therefore at liberty to imagine that he followed that mysterious occupation in person mr walker was very genteel he had large whiskers dark eyes with a slight cast in them a cane and a velvet waistcoat he was a member of a club had an admission to the opera and knew every face behind the scenes and was in the habit of using a number of french phrases in his conversation having picked up a smattering of that language during a residence on the continent in fact he had found it very convenient at various times of his life to dwell in the city of boulogne where he acquired a knowledge of smoking ecarte and billiards which was afterwards of great service to him he knew all the best tables in town and the marker at hunts could only give him ten he had some fashionable acquaintances too and you might see him walking arminarm with such gentlemen as my lord vauxhall the marquess of billingsgate or captain buff and at the same time nodding to young moses the dandy bailiff or loder the gamblinghouse keeper or aminadab the cigarseller in the quadrant sometimes he wore a pair of moustaches and was called captain walker grounding his claim to that title upon the fact of having once held a commission in the service of her majesty the queen of portugal it scarcely need be said that he had been through the insolvent court many times but to those who did not know his history intimately there was some difficulty in identifying him with the individual who had so taken the benefit of the law inasmuch as in his schedule his name appeared as hooker walker winemerchant commissionagent musicseller or what not the fact is that though he preferred to call himself howard hooker was his christian name and it had been bestowed on him by his worthy old father who was a clergyman and had intended his son for that profession but as the old gentleman died in york gaol where he was a prisoner for debt he was never able to put his pious intentions with regard to his son into execution and the young fellow as he was wont with many oaths to assert was thrown on his own resources and became a man of the world at a very early age  what mr howard walkers age was at the time of the commencement of this history and indeed for an indefinite period before or afterwards it is impossible to determine if he were eightandtwenty as he asserted himself time had dealt hardly with him his hair was thin there were many crowsfeet about his eyes and other signs in his countenance of the progress of decay if on the contrary he were forty as sam snaffle declared who himself had misfortunes in early life and vowed he knew mr walker in whitecross street prison in 1820 he was a very younglooking person considering his age his figure was active and slim his leg neat and he had not in his whiskers a single white hair  it must however be owned that he used mr eglantines regenerative unction which will make your whiskers as black as your boot and in fact he was a pretty constant visitor at that gentlemans emporium dealing with him largely for soaps and articles of perfumery which he had at an exceedingly low rate indeed he was never known to pay mr eglantine one single shilling for those objects of luxury and having them on such moderate terms was enabled to indulge in them pretty copiously thus mr walker was almost as great a nosegay as mr eglantine himself his handkerchief was scented with verbena his hair with jessamine and his coat had usually a fine perfume of cigars which rendered his presence in a small room almost instantaneously remarkable i have described mr walker thus accurately because in truth it is more with characters than with astounding events that this little history deals and mr walker is one of the principal of our dramatis personae  and so having introduced mr w we will walk over with him to mr eglantines emporium where that gentleman is in waiting too to have his likeness taken  there is about an acre of plate glass under the royal arms on mr eglantines shopwindow and at night when the gas is lighted and the washballs are illuminated and the lambent flame plays fitfully over numberless bottles of varicoloured perfumesnow flashes on a case of razors and now lightens up a crystal vase containing a hundred thousand of his patent toothbrushesthe effect of the sight may be imagined you dont suppose that he is a creature who has those odious simpering wax figures in his window that are called by the vulgar dummies he is above such a wretched artifice and it is my belief that he would as soon have his own head chopped off and placed as a trunkless decoration to his shopwindow as allow a dummy to figure there on one pane you read in elegant gold letters eglantiniatis his essence for the handkerchief on the other is written regenerative unctiontis his invaluable pomatum for the hair  there is no doubt about it eglantines knowledge of his profession amounts to genius he sells a cake of soap for seven shillings for which another man would not get a shilling and his toothbrushes go off like wildfire at halfaguinea apiece if he has to administer rouge or pearlpowder to ladies he does it with a mystery and fascination which there is no resisting and the ladies believe there are no cosmetics like his he gives his wares unheardof names and obtains for them sums equally prodigious he can dress hairthat is a factas few men in this age can and has been known to take twenty pounds in a single night from as many of the first ladies of england when ringlets were in fashion the introduction of bands he says made a difference of two thousand pounds a year in his income and if there is one thing in the world he hates and despises it is a madonna im not says he a tradesmanim a hartist mr eglantine was born in londonim a hartist and show me a fine ead of air and ill dress it for nothink he vows that it was his way of dressing mademoiselle sontags hair that caused the count her husband to fall in love with her and he has a lock of it in a brooch and says it was the finest head he ever saw except one and that was morgiana crumps  with his genius and his position in the profession how comes it then that mr eglantine was not a man of fortune as many a less clever has been if the truth must be told he loved pleasure and was in the hands of the jews he had been in business twenty years he had borrowed a thousand pounds to purchase his stock and shop and he calculated that he had paid upwards of twenty thousand pounds for the use of the one thousand which was still as much due as on the first day when he entered business he could show that he had received a thousand dozen of champagne from the disinterested moneydealers with whom he usually negotiated his paper he had pictures all over his studios which had been purchased in the same bargains if he sold his goods at an enormous price he paid for them at a rate almost equally exorbitant there was not an article in his shop but came to him through his israelite providers and in the very front shop itself sat a gentleman who was the nominee of one of them and who was called mr mossrose he was there to superintend the cash account and to see that certain instalments were paid to his principals according to certain agreements entered into between mr eglantine and them  having that sort of opinion of mr mossrose which damocles may have had of the sword which hung over his head of course mr eglantine hated his foreman profoundly he an artist would the former gentleman exclaim why hes only a disguised bailiff mossrose indeed the chaps names amos and he sold oranges before he came here mr mossrose on his side utterly despised mr eglantine and looked forward to the day when he would become the proprietor of the shop and take eglantine for a foreman and then it would his turn to sneer and bully and ride the high horse  thus it will be seen that there was a skeleton in the great perfumers house as the saying is a worm in his hearts core and though to all appearance prosperous he was really in an awkward position  what mr eglantines relations were with mr walker may be imagined from the following dialogue which took place between the two gentlemen at five oclock one summers afternoon when mr walker issuing from his chambers came across to the perfumers shop  is eglantine at home mr mossrose said walker to the foreman who sat in the front shop  dont knowgo and look meaning go and be hanged for mossrose also hated mr walker  if youre uncivil ill break your bones mr amos says mr walker sternly  i should like to see you try mr hooker walker replies the undaunted shopman on which the captain looking several tremendous canings at him walked into the back room or studio  how are you tiny my buck says the captain much doing  not a soul in town i avent touched the hirons all day replied mr eglantine in rather a desponding way  well just get them ready now and give my whiskers a turn im going to dine with billingsgate and some outandout fellows at the regent and so my lad just do your best  i cant says mr eglantine i expect ladies captain every minute  very good i dont want to trouble such a great man im sure goodbye and let me hear from you this day week mr eglantine this day week meant that at seven days from that time a certain bill accepted by mr eglantine would be due and presented for payment  dont be in such a hurry captaindo sit down ill curl you in one minute and i say wont the party renew  impossibleits the third renewal  but ill make the thing handsome to youindeed i will  how much  will ten pounds do the business  what offer my principal ten pounds are you mad eglantinea little more of the iron to the left whisker  no i meant for commission  well ill see if that will do the party i deal with eglantine has power i know and can defer the matter no doubt as for me you know ive nothing to do in the affair and only act as a friend between you and him i give you my honour and soul i do  i know you do my dear sir the last two speeches were lies the perfumer knew perfectly well that mr walker would pocket the ten pounds but he was too easy to care for paying it and too timid to quarrel with such a powerful friend and he had on three different occasions already paid ten pounds fine for the renewal of the bill in question all of which bonuses he knew went to his friend mr walker  here too the reader will perceive what was in part the meaning of the word agency on mr walkers door he was a gobetween between moneylenders and borrowers in this world and certain small sums always remained with him in the course of the transaction he was an agent for wine too an agent for places to be had through the influence of great men he was an agent for halfadozen theatrical people male and female and had the interests of the latter especially it was said at heart such were a few of the means by which this worthy gentleman contrived to support himself and if as he was fond of high living gambling and pleasures of all kinds his revenue was not large enough for his expenditurewhy he got into debt and settled his bills that way he was as much at home in the fleet as in pall mall and quite as happy in the one place as in the other thats the way i take things would this philosopher say if ive money i spend if ive credit i borrow if im dunned i whitewash and so you cant beat me down happy elasticity of temperament i do believe that in spite of his misfortunes and precarious position there was no man in england whose conscience was more calm and whose slumbers were more tranquil than those of captain howard walker  as he was sitting under the hands of mr eglantine he reverted to the ladies whom the latter gentleman professed to expect said he was a sly dog a lucky ditto and asked him if the ladies were handsome  eglantine thought there could be no harm in telling a bouncer to a gentleman with whom he was engaged in money transactions and so to give the captain an idea of his solvency and the brilliancy of his future prospects captain said he ive got a hundred and eighty pounds out with you which you were obliging enough to negotiate for me have i or have i not two bills out to that amount  well my good fellow you certainly have and what then  what then why i bet you five pounds to one that in three months those bills are paid  done five pounds to one i take it  this sudden closing with him made the perfumer rather uneasy but he was not to pay for three months and so he said done too and went on what would you say if your bills were paid  not mine pikes  well if pikes were paid and the minories man paid and every single liability i have cleared off and that mossrose flung out of winder and me and my emporium as free as hair  you dont say so is queen anne dead and has she left you a fortune or whats the luck in the wind now  its better than queen anne or anybody dying what should you say to seeing in that very place where mossrose now sits hang himseeing the finest head of air now in europe a woman i tell youa slapup lovely woman who im proud to say will soon be called mrs heglantine and will bring me five thousand pounds to her fortune  well tiny this is good luck indeed i say youll be able to do a bill or two for me then hay you wont forget an old friend  that i wont i shall have a place at my board for you capting and manys the time i shall ope to see you under that maogany  what will the french milliner say shell hang herself for despair eglantine  hush not a word about er ive sown all my wild oats i tell you eglantine is no longer the gay young bachelor but the sober married man i want a heart to share the feelings of mine i want repose im not so young as i was i feel it  pooh pooh you areyou are  well but i sigh for an appy fireside and ill have it  and give up that club which you belong to hay  the kidneys oh of course no married man should belong to such places at least ill not and ill have my kidneys broiled at home but be quiet captain if you please the ladies appointed to  and is it the lady you expect eh you rogue  well get along its her and her ma  but mr walker determined he wouldnt get along and would see these lovely ladies before he stirred  the operation on mr walkers whiskers being concluded he was arranging his toilet before the glass in an agreeable attitude his neck out his enormous pin settled in his stock to his satisfaction his eyes complacently directed towards the reflection of his left and favourite whisker eglantine was laid on a settee in an easy though melancholy posture he was twiddling the tongs with which he had just operated on walker with one hand and his righthand ringlet with the other and he was thinkingthinking of morgiana and then of the bill which was to become due on the 16th and then of a lightblue velvet waistcoat with gold sprigs in which he looked very killing and so was trudging round in his little circle of loves fears and vanities hang it mr walker was thinking i am a handsome man a pair of whiskers like mine are not met with every day if anybody can see that my tuft is dyed may i be when the door was flung open and a large lady with a curl on her forehead yellow shawl a greenvelvet bonnet with feathers halfboots and a drab gown with tulips and other large exotics painted on itwhen in a word mrs crump and her daughter bounced into the room  here we are mr e cries mrs crump in a gay folatre confidential air but law theres a gent in the room  dont mind me ladies said the gent alluded to in his fascinating way im a friend of eglantines aint i egg a chip of the old block hay  that you are said the perfumer starting up  an airdresser asked mrs crump well i thought he was theres something mr e in gentlemen of your profession so exceeding so uncommon distangy  madam you do me proud replied the gentleman so complimented with great presence of mind will you allow me to try my skill upon you or upon miss your lovely daughter im not so clever as eglantine but no bad hand i assure you  nonsense captain interrupted the perfumer who was uncomfortable somehow at the rencontre between the captain and the object of his affection hes not in the profession mrs c this is my friend captain walker and proud i am to call him my friend and then aside to mrs c one of the first swells on town maama regular tiptopper  humouring the mistake which mrs crump had just made mr walker thrust the curlingirons into the fire in a minute and looked round at the ladies with such a fascinating grace that both now made acquainted with his quality blushed and giggled and were quite pleased mamma looked at gina and gina looked at mamma and then mamma gave gina a little blow in the region of her little waist and then both burst out laughing as ladies will laugh and as let us trust they may laugh for ever and ever why need there be a reason for laughing let us laugh when we are laughy as we sleep when we are sleepy and so mrs crump and her demoiselle laughed to their hearts content and both fixed their large shining black eyes repeatedly on mr walker  i wont leave the room said he coming forward with the heated iron in his hand and smoothing it on the brown paper with all the dexterity of a professor for the fact is mr w every morning curled his own immense whiskers with the greatest skill and carei wont leave the room eglantine my boy my lady here took me for a hairdresser and so you know ive a right to stay  he cant stay said mrs crump all of a sudden blushing as red as a peony  i shall have on my peignoir mamma said miss looking at the gentleman and then dropping down her eyes and blushing too  but he cant stay gina i tell you do you think that i would before a gentleman take off my  mamma means her front said miss jumping up and beginning to laugh with all her might at which the honest landlady of the bootjack who loved a joke although at her own expense laughed too and said that no one except mr crump and mr eglantine had ever seen her without the ornament in question  do go now you provoking thing you continued miss c to mr walker i wish to hear the hoverture and its six oclock now and we shall never be done against then but the way in which morgiana said do go clearly indicated dont to the perspicacious mind of mr walker  perhaps you ad better go continued mr eglantine joining in this sentiment and being in truth somewhat uneasy at the admiration which his swell friend excited  ill see you hanged first eggy my boy go i wont until these ladies have had their hair dressed didnt you yourself tell me that miss crumps was the most beautiful hair in europe and do you think that ill go away without seeing it no here i stay  you naughty wicked odious provoking man said miss crump but at the same time she took off her bonnet and placed it on one of the side candlesticks of mr eglantines glass it was a blackvelvet bonnet trimmed with sham lace and with a wreath of nasturtiums convolvuluses and wallflowers within and then said give me the peignoir mr archibald if you please and eglantine who would do anything for her when she called him archibald immediately produced that garment and wrapped round the delicate shoulders of the lady who removing a sham gold chain which she wore on her forehead two brass haircombs set with glass rubies and the comb which kept her back hair togetherremoving them i say and turning her great eyes towards the stranger and giving her head a shake down let tumble such a flood of shining waving heavy glossy jetty hair as would have done mr rowlands heart good to see it tumbled down miss morgianas back and it tumbled over her shoulders it tumbled over the chair on which she sat and from the midst of it her jolly brighteyed rosy face beamed out with a triumphant smile which said ant i now the most angelic being you ever saw  by heaven its the most beautiful thing i ever saw cried mr walker with undisguised admiration  isnt it said mrs crump who made her daughters triumph her own heigho when i acted at the wells in 1820 before that dear girl was born i had such a head of hair as that to a shade sir to a shade they called me ravenswing on account of it i lost my head of hair when that dear child was born and i often say to her morgiana you came into the world to rob your mother of her air were you ever at the wells sir in 1820 perhaps you recollect miss delancy i am that miss delancy perhaps you recollect       tinkatink tinkatink          by the light of the star        on the blue rivers brink          i heard a guitar       i heard a guitar          on the blue waters clear        and knew by its muusic          that selim was near  you remember that in the bagdad bells fatima delancy selim benlomond his real name was bunnion and he failed poor fellow in the public line afterwards it was done to the tambourine and dancing between each verse       tinkatink tinkatink          how the soft music swells        and i hear the soft clink          of the minaret bells       tinka  oh here cried miss crump as if in exceeding pain and whether mr eglantine had twitched pulled or hurt any one individual hair of that lovely head i dont knowoh you are killing me mr eglantine  and with this mamma who was in her attitude holding up the end of her boa as a visionary tambourine and mr walker who was looking at her and in his amusement at the mothers performances had almost forgotten the charms of the daughterboth turned round at once and looked at her with many expressions of sympathy while eglantine in a voice of reproach said killed you morgiana i kill you  im better now said the young lady with a smileim better mr archibald now and if the truth must be told no greater coquette than miss morgiana existed in all mayfairno not among the most fashionable mistresses of the fashionable valets who frequented the bootjack she believed herself to be the most fascinating creature that the world ever produced she never saw a stranger but she tried these fascinations upon him and her charms of manner and person were of that showy sort which is most popular in this world where people are wont to admire most that which gives them the least trouble to see and so you will find a tulip of a woman to be in fashion when a little humble violet or daisy of creation is passed over without remark morgiana was a tulip among women and the tulip fanciers all came flocking round her  well the said oh and im better now mr archibald thereby succeeded in drawing everybodys attention to her lovely self by the latter words mr eglantine was specially inflamed he glanced at mr walker and said capting didnt i tell you she was a creecher see her hair sir its as black and as glossy as satting it weighs fifteen pound that hair sir and i wouldnt let my apprenticethat blundering mossrose for instance hang himi wouldnt let anyone but myself dress that hair for five hundred guineas ah miss morgiana remember that you may always have eglantine to dress your hairremember that thats all and with this the worthy gentleman began rubbing delicately a little of the eglantinia into those ambrosial locks which he loved with all the love of a man and an artist  and as for morgiana showing her hair i hope none of my readers will entertain a bad opinion of the poor girl for doing so her locks were her pride she acted at the private theatre hair parts where she could appear on purpose to show them in a dishevelled state and that her modesty was real and not affected may be proved by the fact that when mr walker stepping up in the midst of eglantines last speech took hold of a lock of her hair very gently with his hand she cried oh and started with all her might and mr eglantine observed very gravely capting miss crumps hair is to be seen and not to be touched if you please  no more it is mr eglantine said her mamma and now as its come to my turn i beg the gentleman will be so obliging as to go  must i cried mr walker and as it was halfpast six and he was engaged to dinner at the regent club and as he did not wish to make eglantine jealous who evidently was annoyed by his staying he took his hat just as miss crumps coiffure was completed and saluting her and her mamma left the room  a tiptop swell i can assure you said eglantine nodding after him a regular bangup chap and no mistake intimate with the marquess of billingsgate and lord vauxhall and that set  hes very genteel said mrs crump  law im sure i think nothing of him said morgiana  and captain walker walked towards his club meditating on the beauties of morgiana what hair said he what eyes the girl has theyre as big as billiardballs and five thousand pounds eglantines in luck five thousand poundsshe cant have it its impossible  no sooner was mrs crumps front arranged during the time of which operation morgiana sat in perfect contentment looking at the last french fashions in the courrier des dames and thinking how her pink satin slip would dye and make just such a mantilla as that represented in the engravingno sooner was mrs crumps front arranged than both ladies taking leave of mr eglantine tripped back to the bootjack hotel in the neighbourhood where a very neat green fly was already in waiting the gentleman on the box of which from a liverystable in the neighbourhood gave a knowing touch to his hat and a salute with his whip to the two ladies as they entered the tavern  mr ws inside said the mana driver from mr snaffles establishment hes been in and out this score of times and looking down the street for you and in the house in fact was mr woolsey the tailor who had hired the fly and was engaged to conduct the ladies that evening to the play  it was really rather too bad to think that miss morgiana after going to one lover to have her hair dressed should go with another to the play but such is the way with lovely woman let her have a dozen admirers and the dear coquette will exercise her power upon them all and as a lady when she has a large wardrobe and a taste for variety in dress will appear every day in a different costume so will the young and giddy beauty wear her lovers encouraging now the black whiskers now smiling on the brown now thinking that the gay smiling rattle of an admirer becomes her very well and now adopting the sad sentimental melancholy one according as her changeful fancy prompts her let us not be too angry with these uncertainties and caprices of beauty and depend on it that for the most part those females who cry out loudest against the flightiness of their sisters and rebuke their undue encouragement of this man or that would do as much themselves if they had the chance and are constant as i am to my coat just now because i have no other  did you see doubleyou gina dear said her mamma addressing that young lady hes in the bar with your pa and has his military coat with the kings buttons and looks like an officer  this was mr woolseys style his great aim being to look like an army gent for many of whom he in his capacity of tailor made those splendid red and blue coats which characterise our military as for the royal button had not he made a set of coats for his late majesty george iv and he would add when he narrated this circumstance sir prince blucher and prince swartzenbergs measures in the house now and whats more ive cut for wellington i believe he would have gone to st helena to make a coat for napoleon so great was his ardour he wore a blueblack wig and his whiskers were of the same hue he was brief and stern in conversations and he always went to masquerades and balls in a fieldmarshals uniform  he looks really quite the thing tonight continued mrs crump  yes said gina but hes such an odious wig and the dye of his whiskers always comes off on his white gloves  everybody has not their own hair love continued mrs crump with a sigh but eglantines is beautiful  every hairdressers is answered morgiana rather contemptuously but what i cant bear is that their fingers is always so very fat and pudgy  in fact something had gone wrong with the fair morgiana was it that she had but little liking for the one pretender or the other was it that young glauber who acted romeo in the private theatricals was far younger and more agreeable than either or was it that seeing a real gentleman such as mr walker with whom she had had her first interview she felt more and more the want of refinement in her other declared admirers certain however it is that she was very reserved all the evening in spite of the attentions of mr woolsey that she repeatedly looked round at the boxdoor as if she expected someone to enter and that she partook of only a very few oysters indeed out of the barrel which the gallant tailor had sent down to the bootjack and off which the party supped  what is it said mr woolsey to his ally crump as they sat together after the retirement of the ladies she was dumb all night she never once laughed at the farce nor cried at the tragedy and you know she laughs and cries uncommon she only took half her negus and not above a quarter of her beer  no more she did replied mr crump very calmly i think it must be the barber as has been captivating her he dressed her hair for the play  hang him ill shoot him said mr woolsey a fat foolish effeminate beast like that marry miss morgiana never i will shoot him ill provoke him next saturdayill tread on his toeill pull his nose  no quarrelling at the kidneys answered crump sternly there shall be no quarrelling in that room as long as im in the chair   well at any rate youll stand my friend  you know i will answered the other you are honourable and i like you better than eglantine i trust you more than eglantine sir youre more of a man than eglantine though you are a tailor and i wish with all my heart you may get morgiana mrs c goes the other way i know but i tell you what women will go their own ways sir and morgys like her mother in this point and depend upon it morgy will decide for herself  mr woolsey presently went home still persisting in his plan for the assassination of eglantine mr crump went to bed very quietly and snored through the night in his usual tone mr eglantine passed some feverish moments of jealousy for he had come down to the club in the evening and had heard that morgiana was gone to the play with his rival and miss morgiana dreamed of a man who wasmust we say itexceedingly like captain howard walker mrs captain soandso thought she oh i do love a gentleman dearly  and about this time too mr walker himself came rolling home from the regent hiccupping such hairsuch eyebrowssuch eyes like bbbilliardballs by jove    chapter ii in which mr walker makes three attempts to ascertain the dwelling of morgiana  the day after the dinner at the regent club mr walker stepped over to the shop of his friend the perfumer where as usual the young man mr mossrose was established in the front premises  for some reason or other the captain was particularly goodhumoured and quite forgetful of the words which had passed between him and mr eglantines lieutenant the day before began addressing the latter with extreme cordiality  a good morning to you mr mossrose said captain walker why sir you look as fresh as your namesakeyou do indeed now mossrose  you look ash yellow ash a guinea responded mr mossrose sulkily he thought the captain was hoaxing him  my good sir replies the other nothing cast down i drank rather too freely last night  the more beast you said mr mossrose  thank you mossrose the same to you answered the captain  if you call me a beast ill punch your head off answered the young man who had much skill in the art which many of his brethren practise  i didnt my fine fellow replied walker on the contrary you  do you mean to give me the lie broke out the indignant mossrose who hated the agent fiercely and did not in the least care to conceal his hate  in fact it was his fixed purpose to pick a quarrel with walker and to drive him if possible from mr eglantines shop do you mean to give me the lie i say mr hooker walker  for heavens sake amos hold your tongue exclaimed the captain to whom the name of hooker was as poison but at this moment a customer stepping in mr amos exchanged his ferocious aspect for a bland grin and mr walker walked into the studio  when in mr eglantines presence walker too was all smiles in a minute sank down on a settee held out his hand to the perfumer and began confidentially discoursing with him  such a dinner tiny my boy said he such prime fellows to eat it too billingsgate vauxhall cinqbars buff of the blues and halfadozen more of the best fellows in town and what do you think the dinner cost a head ill wager youll never guess  was it two guineas a headin course i mean without wine said the genteel perfumer  guess again  well was it ten guineas a head ill guess any sum you please replied mr eglantine for i know that when you nobs are together you dont spare your money i myself at the star and garter at richmond once paid  eighteenpence  heighteenpence siri paid fiveandthirty shillings per ead id have you to know that i can act as a gentleman as well as any other gentleman sir answered the perfumer with much dignity  well eighteenpence was what we paid and not a rap more upon my honour  nonsense youre joking the marquess of billinsgate dine for eighteenpence why hang it if i was a marquess id pay a fivepound note for my lunch  you little know the person master eglantine replied the captain with a smile of contemptuous superiority you little know the real man of fashion my good fellow simplicity sirsimplicitys the characteristic of the real gentleman and so ill tell you what we had for dinner  turtle and venison of courseno nob dines without them  psha were sick of em we had pea soup and boiled tripe what do you think of that we had sprats and herrings a bullocks heart a baked shoulder of mutton and potatoes pigsfry and irish stew i ordered the dinner sir and got more credit for inventing it than they ever gave to ude or soyer the marquess was in ecstasies the earl devoured half a bushel of sprats and if the viscount is not laid up with a surfeit of bullocks heart my names not howard walker billy as i call him was in the chair and gave my health and what do you think the rascal proposed  what did his lordship propose  that every man present should subscribe twopence and pay for my share of the dinner by jove it is true and the money was handed to me in a pewterpot of which they also begged to make me a present we afterwards went to tom springs from toms to the finish from the finish to the watchhousethat is they didand sent for me just as i was getting into bed to bail them all out  theyre happy dogs those young noblemen said mr eglantine nothing but pleasure from morning till night no affectation neitherno hoture but manly downright straightforward good fellows  should you like to meet them tiny my boy said the captain  if i did sir i hope i should show myself to be gentleman answered mr eglantine  well you shall meet them and lady billingsgate shall order her perfumes at your shop we are going to dine next week all our set at mealyfaced bobs and you shall be my guest cried the captain slapping the delighted artist on the back and now my boy tell me how you spent the evening  at my club sir answered mr eglantine blushing rather  what not at the play with the lovely blackeyed misswhat is her name eglantine  never mind her name captain replied eglantine partly from prudence and partly from shame he had not the heart to own it was crump and he did not care that the captain should know more of his destined bride  you wish to keep the five thousand to yourselfeh you rogue responded the captain with a goodhumoured air although exceedingly mortified for to say the truth he had put himself to the trouble of telling the above long story of the dinner and of promising to introduce eglantine to the lords solely that he might elicit from that gentlemans goodhumour some further particulars regarding the young lady with the billiardball eyes it was for the very same reason too that he had made the attempt at reconciliation with mr mossrose which had just so signally failed nor would the reader did he know mr w better at all require to have the above explanation but as yet we are only at the first chapter of his history and who is to know what the heros motives can be unless we take the trouble to explain  well the little dignified answer of the worthy dealer in bergamot never mind her name captain threw the gallant captain quite aback and though he sat for a quarter of an hour longer and was exceedingly kind and though he threw out some skilful hints yet the perfumer was quite unconquerable or rather he was too frightened to tell the poor fat timid easy goodnatured gentleman was always the prey of roguespanting and floundering in one rascals snare or anothers he had the dissimulation too which timid men have and felt the presence of a victimiser as a hare does of a greyhound now he would be quite still now he would double and now he would run and then came the end he knew by his sure instinct of fear that the captain had in asking these questions a scheme against him and so he was cautious and trembled and doubted and oh how he thanked his stars when lady grogmores chariot drove up with the misses grogmore who wanted their hair dressed and were going to a breakfast at three oclock  ill look in again tiny said the captain on hearing the summons  do captain said the other thank you and went into the ladys studio with a heavy heart  get out of the way you infernal villain roared the captain with many oaths to lady grogmores large footman with rubycoloured tights who was standing inhaling the ten thousand perfumes of the shop and the latter moving away in great terror the gallant agent passed out quite heedless of the grin of mr mossrose  walker was in a fury at his want of success and walked down bond street in a fury i will know where the girl lives swore he ill spend a fivepound note by jove rather than not know where she lives  that you wouldi know you would said a little grave low voice all of a sudden by his side pooh whats money to you  walker looked down it was tom dale  who in london did not know little tom dale he had cheeks like an apple and his hair curled every morning and a little blue stock and always two new magazines under his arm and an umbrella and a little brown frockcoat and big squaretoed shoes with which he went papping down the street he was everywhere at once everybody met him every day and he knew everything that everybody ever did though nobody ever knew what he did he was they say a hundred years old and had never dined at his own charge once in those hundred years he looked like a figure out of a waxwork with glassy clear meaningless eyes he always spoke with a grin he knew what you had for dinner the day before he met you and what everybody had had for dinner for a century back almost he was the receptacle of all the scandal of all the world from bond street to bread street he knew all the authors all the actors all the notorieties of the town and the private histories of each that is he never knew anything really but supplied deficiencies of truth and memory with readycoined neverfailing lies he was the most benevolent man in the universe and never saw you without telling you everything most cruel of your neighbour and when he left you he went to do the same kind turn by yourself  pooh whats money to you my dear boy said little tom dale who had just come out of eberss where he had been filching an operaticket you make it in bushels in the city you know you doin thousands i saw you go into eglantines fine business that finest in london fiveshilling cakes of soap my dear boy i cant wash with such thousands a year that man has madehasnt he  upon my word tom i dont know says the captain  you not know dont tell me you know everythingyou agents you know he makes five thousand a yearay and might make ten but you know why he dont  indeed i dont  nonsense dont humbug a poor old fellow like me jewsamosfifty per cent ay why cant he get his money from a good christian  i have heard something of that sort said walker laughing why by jove tom you know everything  you know everything my dear boy you know what a rascally trick that opera creature served him poor fellow cashmere shawlsstorr and mortimersstar and garter much better dine quiet off peasoup and spratsay his betters have as you know very well  peasoup and sprats what have you heard of that already  who bailed lord billingsgate hey you rogue and here tom gave a knowing and almost demoniacal grin who wouldnt go to the finish who had the piece of plate presented to him filled with sovereigns and you deserved it my dear boyyou deserved it they said it was only halfpence but i know better and here tom went off in a cough  i say tom cried walker inspired with a sudden thought you who know everything and are a theatrical man did you ever know a miss delancy an actress  at sadlers wells in 16 of course i did real name was budge lord slapper admired her very much my dear boy she married a man by the name of crump his lordships black footman and brought him five thousand pounds and they keep the bootjack publichouse in bunkers buildings and theyve got fourteen children is one of them handsome eh you sly rogueand is it that which you will give five pounds to know god bless you my dear dear boy jones my dear friend how are you  and now seizing on jones tom dale left mr walker alone and proceeded to pour into mr joness ear an account of the individual whom he had just quitted how he was the best fellow in the world and jones knew it how he was in a fine way of making his fortune how he had been in the fleet many times and how he was at this moment employed in looking out for a young lady of whom a certain great marquess whom jones knew very well too had expressed an admiration  but for these observations which he did not hear captain walker it may be pronounced did not care his eyes brightened up he marched quickly and gaily away and turning into his own chambers opposite eglantines shop saluted that establishment with a grin of triumph you wouldnt tell me her name wouldnt you said mr walker well the lucks with me now and here goes  two days after as mr eglantine with white gloves and a case of eaudecologne as a present in his pocket arrived at the bootjack hotel little bunkers buildings berkeley square for it must outthat was the place in which mr crumps inn was situated he paused for a moment at the threshold of the little house of entertainment and listened with beating heart to the sound of delicious music that a wellknown voice was uttering within  the moon was playing in silvery brightness down the gutter of the humble street a helper rubbing down one of lady smigsmags carriagehorses even paused in his whistle to listen to the strain mr tressles man who had been professionally occupied ceased his taptap upon the coffin which he was getting in readiness the greengrocer there is always a greengrocer in those narrow streets and he goes out in white berlin gloves as a supernumerary footman was standing charmed at his little green gate the cobbler there is always a cobbler too was drunk as usual of evenings but with unusual subordination never sang except when the refrain of the ditty arrived when he hiccupped it forth with tipsy loyalty and eglantine leaned against the chequers painted on the doorside under the name of crump and looked at the red illumined curtain of the bar and the vast wellknown shadow of mrs crumps turban within now and again the shadow of that worthy matrons hand would be seen to grasp the shadow of a bottle then the shadow of a cup would rise towards the turban and still the strain proceeded eglantine i say took out his yellow bandanna and brushed the beady drops from his brow and laid the contents of his white kids on his heart and sighed with ecstatic sympathy the song began           come to the greenwood tree 1           come where the dark woods be           dearest o come with me      let us roveo my loveo my love                              o myy love  drunken cobbler without                              o myy love  beast says eglantine           cometis the moonlight hour           dew is on leaf and flower           come to the linden bower      let us roveo my loveo my love    let us rooove lurlurliety yes well rove lurlurliety    through the grooove lurlurlietylurlurlieieiei  cobbler as usual                              let us rooove etc  you here says another individual coming clinking up the street in a militarycut dresscoat the buttons whereof shone very bright in the moonlight you here eglantineyoure always here  hush woolsey said mr eglantine to his rival the tailor for he was the individual in question and woolsey accordingly put his back against the opposite doorpost and chequers so that with poor eglantines bulk nothing much thicker than a sheet of paper could pass out or in and thus these two amorous caryatides kept guard as the song continued            dark is the wood and wide            dangers they say betide            but at my alberts side      nought i fear o my loveo my love            welcome the greenwood tree            welcome the forest tree            dearest with thee with thee      nought i fear o my loveo maay love  eglantines fine eyes were filled with tears as morgiana passionately uttered the above beautiful words little woolseys eyes glistened as he clenched his fist with an oath and said show me any singing that can beat that cobbler shut your mouth or ill break your head  but the cobbler regardless of the threat continued to perform the lurlurliety with great accuracy and when that was ended both on his part and morgianas a rapturous knocking of glasses was heard in the little bar then a great clapping of hands and finally somebody shouted brava  brava  at that word eglantine turned deadly pale then gave a start then a rush forward which pinned or rather cushioned the tailor against the wall then twisting himself abruptly round he sprang to the door of the bar and bounced into that apartment  how are you my nosegay exclaimed the same voice which had shouted brava it was that of captain walker  at ten oclock the next morning a gentleman with the kings button on his military coat walked abruptly into mr eglantines shop and turning on mr mossrose said tell your master i want to see him  hes in his studio said mr mossrose  well then fellow go and fetch him  and mossrose thinking it must be the lord chamberlain or doctor praetorius at least walked into the studio where the perfumer was seated in a very glossy old silk dressinggown his fair hair hanging over his white face his double chin over his flaccid whitybrown shirtcollar his peagreen slippers on the hob and on the fire the pot of chocolate which was simmering for his breakfast a lazier fellow than poor eglantine it would be hard to find whereas on the contrary woolsey was always up and brushed spickandspan at seven oclock and had gone through his books and given out the work for the journeymen and eaten a hearty breakfast of rashers of bacon before eglantine had put the usual pound of grease to his hair his fingers were always as damp and shiny as if he had them in a pomatumpot and arranged his figure for the day  heres a gent wants you in the shop says mr mossrose leaving the door of communication wide open  say im in bed mr mossrose im out of sperrets and really can see nobody  its someone from vindsor i think hes got the royal button says mossrose  its mewoolsey shouted the little man from the shop  mr eglantine at this jumped up made a rush to the door leading to his private apartment and disappeared in a twinkling but it must not be imagined that he fled in order to avoid mr woolsey he only went away for one minute just to put on his belt for he was ashamed to be seen without it by his rival  this being assumed and his toilet somewhat arranged mr woolsey was admitted into his private room and mossrose would have heard every word of the conversation between those two gentlemen had not woolsey opening the door suddenly pounced on the assistant taken him by the collar and told him to disappear altogether into the shop which mossrose did vowing he would have his revenge  the subject on which woolsey had come to treat was an important one mr eglantine says he theres no use disguising from one another that we are both of us in love with miss morgiana and that our chances up to this time have been pretty equal but that captain whom you introduced like an ass as you were  an ass mr woolsey id have you to know sir that im no more a hass than you are sir and as for introducing the captain i did no such thing  well well hes got apoaching into our preserves somehow hes evidently sweet upon the young woman and is a more fashionable chap than either of us two we must get him out of the house sirwe must circumwent him and then mr eglantine will be time enough for you and me to try which is the best man  he the best man thought eglantine the little bald unsightly tailorcreature a man with no more soul than his smoothinghiron the perfumer as may be imagined did not utter this sentiment aloud but expressed himself quite willing to enter into any hamicable arrangement by which the new candidate for miss crumps favour must be thrown over it was accordingly agreed between the two gentlemen that they should coalesce against the common enemy that they should by reciting many perfectly wellfounded stories in the captains disfavour influence the minds of miss crumps parents and of herself if possible against this wolf in sheeps clothing and that when they were once fairly rid of him each should be at liberty as before to prefer his own claim  i have thought of a subject said the little tailor turning very red and hemming and hawing a great deal ive thought i say of a pint which may be resorted to with advantage at the present juncture and in which each of us may be useful to the other an exchange mr eglantine do you take  do you mean an accommodationbill said eglantine whose mind ran a good deal on that species of exchange  pooh nonsense sir the name of our firm is i flatter myself a little more up in the market than some other peoples names  do you mean to insult the name of archibald eglantine sir id have you to know that at three months  nonsense says mr woolsey mastering his emotion theres no use aquarrelling mr e were not in love with each other i know that you wish me hanged or as good i know that  indeed i dont sir  you do sir i tell you you do and whats more i wish the same to youtransported at any rate but as two sailors when a boats asinking though they hate each other ever so much will help and bale the boat out so sir let us act let us be the two sailors  bail sir said eglantine as usual mistaking the drift of the argument ill bail no man if youre in difficulties i think you had better go to your senior partner mr woolsey and eglantines cowardly little soul was filled with a savage satisfaction to think that his enemy was in distress and actually obliged to come to him for succour  youre enough to make job swear you great fat stupid lazy old barber roared mr woolsey in a fury  eglantine jumped up and made for the bellrope the gallant little tailor laughed  theres no need to call in betsy said he im not agoing to eat you eglantine youre a bigger man than me if you were just to fall on me youd smother me just sit still on the sofa and listen to reason  well sir proceed said the barber with a gasp  now listen whats the darling wish of your heart i know it sir youve told it to mr tressle sir and other gents at the club the darling wish of your heart sir is to have a slapup coat turned out of the ateliers of messrs linsey woolsey and company you said youd give twenty guineas for one of our coats you know you did lord bolstertons a fatter man than you and look what a figure we turn him out can any firm in england dress lord bolsterton but us so as to make his lordship look decent i defy em sir we could have given daniel lambert a figure  if i want a coat sir said mr eglantine and i dont deny it theres some people want a head of hair  thats the very point i was coming to said the tailor resuming the violent blush which was mentioned as having suffused his countenance at the beginning of the conversation let us have terms of mutual accommodation make me a wig mr eglantine and though i never yet cut a yard of cloth except for a gentleman ill pledge you my word ill make you a coat  will you honour bright says eglantine  honour bright says the tailor look and in an instant he drew from his pocket one of those slips of parchment which gentlemen of his profession carry and putting eglantine into the proper position began to take the preliminary observations he felt eglantines heart thump with happiness as his measure passed over that soft part of the perfumers person  then pulling down the windowblind and looking that the door was locked and blushing still more deeply than ever the tailor seated himself in an armchair towards which mr eglantine beckoned him and taking off his black wig exposed his head to the great perruquiers gaze mr eglantine looked at it measured it manipulated it sat for three minutes with his head in his hand and his elbow on his knee gazing at the tailors cranium with all his might walked round it twice or thrice and then said its enough mr woolsey consider the job as done and now sir said he with a greatly relieved airand now woolsey let us ave a glass of curacoa to celebrate this hauspicious meeting  the tailor however stiffly replied that he never drank in a morning and left the room without offering to shake mr eglantine by the hand for he despised that gentleman very heartily and himself too for coming to any compromise with him and for so far demeaning himself as to make a coat for a barber  looking from his chambers on the other side of the street that inevitable mr walker saw the tailor issuing from the perfumers shop and was at no loss to guess that something extraordinary must be in progress when two such bitter enemies met together    chapter iii what came of mr walkers discovery of the bootjack  it is very easy to state how the captain came to take up that proud position at the bootjack which we have seen him occupy on the evening when the sound of the fatal brava so astonished mr eglantine  the mere entry into the establishment was of course not difficult any person by simply uttering the words a pint of beer was free of the bootjack and it was some such watchword that howard walker employed when he made his first appearance he requested to be shown into a parlour where he might repose himself for a while and was ushered into that very sanctum where the kidney club met then he stated that the beer was the best he had ever tasted except in bavaria and in some parts of spain he added and professing to be extremely peckish requested to know if there were any cold meat in the house whereof he could make a dinner  i dont usually dine at this hour landlord said he flinging down a halfsovereign for payment of the beer but your parlour looks so comfortable and the windsor chairs are so snug that im sure i could not dine better at the first club in london  one of the first clubs in london is held in this very room said mr crump very well pleased and attended by some of the best gents in town too we call it the kidney club  why bless my soul it is the very club my friend eglantine has so often talked to me about and attended by some of the tiptop tradesmen of the metropolis  theres better men here than mr eglantine replied mr crump though hes a good mani dont say hes not a good manbut theres better mr clinker sir mr woolsey of the house of linsey woolsey and co  the great armyclothiers cried walker the first house in town and so continued with exceeding urbanity holding conversation with mr crump until the honest landlord retired delighted and told mrs crump in the bar that there was a tiptop swell in the kidney parlour who was agoing to have his dinner there  fortune favoured the brave captain in every way it was just mr crumps own dinnerhour and on mrs crump stepping into the parlour to ask the guest whether he would like a slice of the joint to which the family were about to sit down fancy that ladys start of astonishment at recognising mr eglantines facetious friend of the day before the captain at once demanded permission to partake of the joint at the family table the lady could not with any great reason deny this request the captain was inducted into the bar and miss crump who always came down late for dinner was even more astonished than her mamma on beholding the occupier of the fourth place at the table had she expected to see the fascinating stranger so soon again i think she had her big eyes said as much as furtively looking up at mr walkers face they caught his looks and then bouncing down again towards her plate pretended to be very busy in looking at the boiled beef and carrots there displayed she blushed far redder than those carrots but her shining ringlets hid her confusion together with her lovely face  sweet morgiana the billiardball eyes had a tremendous effect on the captain they fell plump as it were into the pocket of his heart and he gallantly proposed to treat the company to a bottle of champagne which was accepted without much difficulty  mr crump under pretence of going to the cellar where he said he had some cases of the finest champagne in europe called dick the boy to him and despatched him with all speed to a wine merchants where a couple of bottles of the liquor were procured  bring up two bottles mr c captain walker gallantly said when crump made his move as it were to the cellar and it may be imagined after the two bottles were drunk of which mrs crump took at least nine glasses to her share how happy merry and confidential the whole party had become crump told his story of the bootjack and whose boot it had drawn the former miss delancy expatiated on her past theatrical life and the pictures hanging round the room miss was equally communicative and in short the captain had all the secrets of the little family in his possession ere sunset he knew that miss cared little for either of her suitors about whom mamma and papa had a little quarrel he heard mrs crump talk of morgianas property and fell more in love with her than ever then came tea the luscious crumpet the quiet game at cribbage and the songthe song which poor eglantine heard and which caused woolseys rage and his despair  at the close of the evening the tailor was in a greater rage and the perfumer in greater despair than ever he had made his little present of eaudecologne oh fie says the captain with a horselaugh it smells of the shop he taunted the tailor about his wig and the honest fellow had only an oath to give by way of repartee he told his stories about his club and his lordly friends what chance had either against the allaccomplished howard walker  old crump with a good innate sense of right and wrong hated the man mrs crump did not feel quite at her ease regarding him but morgiana thought him the most delightful person the world ever produced  eglantines usual morning costume was a blue satin neckcloth embroidered with butterflies and ornamented with a brandyball brooch a light shawl waistcoat and a rhubarbcoloured coat of the sort which i believe are called taglionis and which have no waistbuttons and made a pretence as it were to have no waists but are in reality adopted by the fat in order to give them a waist nothing easier for an obese man than to have a waist he has but to pinch his middle part a little and the very fat on either side pushed violently forward makes a waist as it were and our worthy perfumers figure was that of a bolster cut almost in two with a string  walker presently saw him at his shopdoor grinning in this costume twiddling his ringlets with his dumpy greasy fingers glittering with oil and rings and looking so exceedingly contented and happy that the estateagent felt assured some very satisfactory conspiracy had been planned between the tailor and him how was mr walker to learn what the scheme was alas the poor fellows vanity and delight were such that he could not keep silent as to the cause of his satisfaction and rather than not mention it at all in the fulness of his heart he would have told his secret to mr mossrose himself  when i get my coat thought the bond street alnaschar ill hire of snaffle that easygoing creamcoloured oss that he bought from astleys and ill canter through the park and wont i pass through little bunkers buildings thats all ill wear my grey trousers with the velvet stripe down the side and get my spurs lacquered up and a french polish to my boot and if i dont do for the captain and the tailor too my names not archibald and i know what ill do ill hire the small clarence and invite the crumps to dinner at the gar and starter this was his facetious way of calling the star and garter and ill ride by them all the way to richmond its rather a long ride but with snaffles soft saddle i can do it pretty easy i dare say and so the honest fellow built castles upon castles in the air and the last most beautiful vision of all was miss crump in white satting with a horange flower in her air putting him in possession of her lovely and before the haltar of st georges anover square as for woolsey eglantine determined that he should have the best wig his art could produce for he had not the least fear of his rival  these points then being arranged to the poor fellows satisfaction what does he do but send out for half a quire of pink notepaper and in a filagree envelope despatch a note of invitation to the ladies at the bootjack   bower of bloom bond street  thursday  mr archibald eglantine presents his compliments to mrs and miss crump and requests the honour and pleasure of their company at the star and garter at richmond to an early dinner on sunday next  if agreeable mr eglantines carriage will be at your door at three oclock and i propose to accompany them on horseback if agreeable likewise   this note was sealed with yellow wax and sent to its destination and of course mr eglantine went himself for the answer in the evening and of course he told the ladies to look out for a certain new coat he was going to sport on sunday and of course mr walker happens to call the next day with spare tickets for mrs crump and her daughter when the whole secret was laid bare to himhow the ladies were going to richmond on sunday in mr snaffles clarence and how mr eglantine was to ride by their side  mr walker did not keep horses of his own his magnificent friends at the regent had plenty in their stables and some of these were at livery at the establishment of the captains old college companion mr snaffle it was easy therefore for the captain to renew his acquaintance with that individual so hanging on the arm of my lord vauxhall captain walker next day made his appearance at snaffles liverystables and looked at the various horses there for sale or at bait and soon managed by putting some facetious questions to mr snaffle regarding the kidney club etc to place himself on a friendly footing with that gentleman and to learn from him what horse mr eglantine was to ride on sunday  the monster walker had fully determined in his mind that eglantine should fall off that horse in the course of his sundays ride  that singlar hanimal said mr snaffle pointing to the old horse is the celebrated hemperor that was the wonder of hastleys some years back and was parted with by mr ducrow honly because his feelins wouldnt allow him to keep him no longer after the death of the first mrs d who invariably rode him i bought him thinking that praps ladies and cockney bucks might like to ride him for his haction is wonderful and he canters like a harmchair but hes not safe on any day except sundays  and whys that asked captain walker why is he safer on sundays than other days  because theres no music in the streets on sundays the first gent that rode him found himself dancing a quadrille in hupper brook street to an urdygurdy that was playing cherry ripe such is the natur of the hanimal and if you reklect the play of the battle of hoysterlitz in which mrs d hacted the female hussar you may remember how she and the horse died in the third act to the toon of god preserve the emperor from which this horse took his name only play that toon to him and he rears hisself up beats the hair in time with his forelegs and then sinks gently to the ground as though he were carried off by a cannonball he served a lady hopposite hapsley ouse so one day and since then ive never let him out to a friend except on sunday when in course theres no danger heglantine is a friend of mine and of course i wouldnt put the poor fellow on a hanimal i couldnt trust  after a little more conversation my lord and his friend quitted mr snaffles and as they walked away towards the regent his lordship might be heard shrieking with laughter crying capital by jingo exthlent dwive down in the dwag take lungly worth a thousand pound by jove and similar ejaculations indicative of exceeding delight  on saturday morning at ten oclock to a moment mr woolsey called at mr eglantines with a yellow handkerchief under his arm it contained the best and handsomest bodycoat that ever gentleman put on it fitted eglantine to a nicetyit did not pinch him in the least and yet it was of so exquisite a cut that the perfumer found as he gazed delighted in the glass that he looked like a manly portly highbred gentlemana lieutenantcolonel in the army at the very least  youre a full man eglantine said the tailor delighted too with his own work but that cant be helped you look more like hercules than falstaff now sir and if a coat can make a gentleman a gentleman you are let me recommend you to sink the blue cravat and take the stripes off your trousers dress quiet sir draw it mild plain waistcoat dark trousers black neckcloth black hat and if theres a betterdressed man in europe tomorrow im a dutchman  thank you woolseythank you my dear sir said the charmed perfumer and now ill just trouble you to try on this here  the wig had been made with equal skill it was not in the florid style which mr eglantine loved in his own person but as the perfumer said a simple straightforward head of hair it seems as if it had grown there all your life mr woolsey nobody would tell that it was not your natral colour mr woolsey blushedit makes you look ten year younger and as for that scarecrow yonder youll never i think want to wear that again  woolsey looked in the glass and was delighted too the two rivals shook hands and straightway became friends and in the overflowing of his heart the perfumer mentioned to the tailor the party which he had arranged for the next day and offered him a seat in the carriage and at the dinner at the star and garter would you like to ride said eglantine with rather a consequential air snaffle will mount you and we can go one on each side of the ladies if you like  but woolsey humbly said he was not a riding man and gladly consented to take a place in the clarence carriage provided he was allowed to bear half the expenses of the entertainment this proposal was agreed to by mr eglantine and the two gentlemen parted to meet once more at the kidneys that night when everybody was edified by the friendly tone adopted between them  mr snaffle at the club meeting made the very same proposal to mr woolsey that the perfumer had made and stated that as eglantine was going to ride hemperor woolsey at least ought to mount too but he was met by the same modest refusal on the tailors part who stated that he had never mounted a horse yet and preferred greatly the use of a coach  eglantines character as a swell rose greatly with the club that evening  two oclock on sunday came the two beaux arrived punctually at the door to receive the two smiling ladies  bless us mr eglantine said miss crump quite struck by him i never saw you look so handsome in your life he could have flung his arms around her neck at the compliment and law ma what has happened to mr woolsey doesnt he look ten years younger than yesterday mamma assented and woolsey bowed gallantly and the two gentlemen exchanged a nod of hearty friendship  the day was delightful eglantine pranced along magnificently on his cantering armchair with his hat on one ear his left hand on his side and his head flung over his shoulder and throwing underglances at morgiana whenever the emperor was in advance of the clarence the emperor pricked up his ears a little uneasily passing the ebenezer chapel in richmond where the congregation were singing a hymn but beyond this no accident occurred nor was mr eglantine in the least stiff or fatigued by the time the party reached richmond where he arrived time enough to give his steed into the charge of an ostler and to present his elbow to the ladies as they alighted from the clarence carriage  what this jovial party ate for dinner at the star and garter need not here be set down if they did not drink champagne i am very much mistaken they were as merry as any four people in christendom and between the bewildering attentions of the perfumer and the manly courtesy of the tailor morgiana very likely forgot the gallant captain or at least was very happy in his absence  at eight oclock they began to drive homewards wont you come into the carriage said morgiana to eglantine with one of her tenderest looks dick can ride the horse but archibald was too great a lover of equestrian exercise im afraid to trust anybody on this horse said he with a knowing look and so he pranced away by the side of the little carriage the moon was brilliant and with the aid of the gaslamps illuminated the whole face of the country in a way inexpressibly lovely  presently in the distance the sweet and plaintive notes of a bugle were heard and the performer with great delicacy executed a religious air music too heavenly said morgiana throwing up her eyes to the stars the music came nearer and nearer and the delight of the company was only more intense the fly was going at about four miles an hour and the emperor began cantering to time at the same rapid pace  this must be some gallantry of yours mr woolsey said the romantic morgiana turning upon that gentleman mr eglantine treated us to the dinner and you have provided us with the music  now woolsey had been a little a very little dissatisfied during the course of the evenings entertainment by fancying that eglantine a much more voluble person than himself had obtained rather an undue share of the ladies favour and as he himself paid half of the expenses he felt very much vexed to think that the perfumer should take all the credit of the business to himself so when miss crump asked if he had provided the music he foolishly made an evasive reply to her query and rather wished her to imagine that he had performed that piece of gallantry if it pleases you miss morgiana said this artful schneider what more need any man ask wouldnt i have all drury lane orchestra to please you  the bugle had by this time arrived quite close to the clarence carriage and if morgiana had looked round she might have seen whence the music came behind her came slowly a drag or private stagecoach with four horses two grooms with cockades and folded arms were behind and driving on the box a little gentleman with a blue birdseye neckcloth and a white coat a bugleman was by his side who performed the melodies which so delighted miss crump he played very gently and sweetly and god save the king trembled so softly out of the brazen orifice of his bugle that the crumps the tailor and eglantine himself who was riding close by the carriage were quite charmed and subdued  thank you dear mr woolsey said the grateful morgiana which made eglantine stare and woolsey was just saying really upon my word ive nothing to do with it when the man on the dragbox said to the bugleman now  the bugleman began the tune of       heaven preserve our emperor fraancis       rum tumtitumtitittyti  at the sound the emperor reared himself with a roar from mr eglantinereared and beat the air with his forepaws eglantine flung his arms round the beasts neck still he kept beating time with his forepaws mrs crump screamed mr woolsey dick the clarence coachman lord vauxhall for it was he and his lordships two grooms burst into a shout of laughter morgiana cries mercy mercy eglantine yells stopwooh and a thousand ejaculations of hideous terror until at last down drops the emperor stone dead in the middle of the road as if carried off by a cannonball  fancy the situation ye callous souls who laugh at the misery of humanity fancy the situation of poor eglantine under the emperor he had fallen very easy the animal lay perfectly quiet and the perfumer was to all intents and purposes as dead as the animal he had not fainted but he was immovable with terror he lay in a puddle and thought it was his own blood gushing from him and he would have lain there until monday morning if my lords grooms descending had not dragged him by the coatcollar from under the beast who still lay quiet  play charming judy callaghan will ye says mr snaffles man the flydriver on which the bugler performed that lively air and up started the horse and the grooms who were rubbing mr eglantine down against a lamppost invited him to remount  but his heart was too broken for that the ladies gladly made room for him in the clarence dick mounted emperor and rode homewards the drag too drove away playing oh dear what can the matter be and with a scowl of furious hate mr eglantine sat and regarded his rival his pantaloons were split and his coat torn up the back  are you hurt much dear mr archibald said morgiana with unaffected compassion  nnot much said the poor fellow ready to burst into tears  oh mr woolsey added the goodnatured girl how could you play such a trick  upon my word woolsey began intending to plead innocence but the ludicrousness of the situation was once more too much for him and he burst out into a roar of laughter  you you cowardly beast howled out eglantine now driven to furyyou laugh at me you miserable cretur take that sir and he fell upon him with all his might and wellnigh throttled the tailor and pummelling his eyes his nose his ears with inconceivable rapidity wrenched finally his wig off his head and flung it into the road  morgiana saw that woolsey had red hair 2    chapter iv in which the heroine has a number more lovers and cuts a very dashing figure in the world  two years have elapsed since the festival at richmond which begun so peaceably ended in such general uproar morgiana never could be brought to pardon woolseys red hair nor to help laughing at eglantines disasters nor could the two gentlemen be reconciled to one another woolsey indeed sent a challenge to the perfumer to meet him with pistols which the latter declined saying justly that tradesmen had no business with such weapons on this the tailor proposed to meet him with coats off and have it out like men in the presence of their friends of the kidney club the perfumer said he would be party to no such vulgar transaction on which woolsey exasperated made an oath that he would tweak the perfumers nose so surely as he ever entered the clubroom and thus one member of the kidneys was compelled to vacate his armchair  woolsey himself attended every meeting regularly but he did not evince that gaiety and goodhumour which render mens company agreeable in clubs on arriving he would order the boy to tell him when that scoundrel eglantine came and hanging up his hat on a peg would scowl round the room and tuck up his sleeves very high and stretch and shake his fingers and wrists as if getting them ready for that pull of the nose which he intended to bestow upon his rival so prepared he would sit down and smoke his pipe quite silently glaring at all and jumping up and hitching up his coatsleeves when anyone entered the room  the kidneys did not like this behaviour clinker ceased to come bustard the poulterer ceased to come as for snaffle he also disappeared for woolsey wished to make him answerable for the misbehaviour of eglantine and proposed to him the duel which the latter had declined so snaffle went presently they all went except the tailor and tressle who lived down the street and these two would sit and pug their tobacco one on each side of crump the landlord as silent as indian chiefs in a wigwam there grew to be more and more room for poor old crump in his chair and in his clothes the kidneys were gone and why should he remain one saturday he did not come down to preside at the club as he still fondly called it and the saturday following tressle had made a coffin for him and woolsey with the undertaker by his side followed to the grave the father of the kidneys  mrs crump was now alone in the world how alone says some innocent and respected reader ah my dear sir do you know so little of human nature as not to be aware that one week after the richmond affair morgiana married captain walker that did she privately of course and after the ceremony came tripping back to her parents as young people do in plays and said forgive me dear pa and ma im married and here is my husband the captain papa and mamma did forgive her as why shouldnt they and papa paid over her fortune to her which she carried home delighted to the captain this happened several months before the demise of old crump and mrs captain walker was on the continent with her howard when that melancholy event took place hence mrs crumps loneliness and unprotected condition morgiana had not latterly seen much of the old people how could she moving in her exalted sphere receive at her genteel new residence in the edgware road the old publican and his wife  being then alone in the world mrs crump could not abear she said to live in the house where she had been so respected and happy so she sold the goodwill of the bootjack and with the money arising from this sale and her own private fortune being able to muster some sixty pounds per annum retired to the neighbourhood of her dear old sadlers wells where she boarded with one of mrs serles forty pupils her heart was broken she said but nevertheless about nine months after mr crumps death the wallflowers nasturtiums polyanthuses and convolvuluses began to blossom under her bonnet as usual in a year she was dressed quite as fine as ever and now never missed the wells or some other place of entertainment one single night but was as regular as the boxkeeper nay she was a buxom widow still and an old flame of hers fisk so celebrated as pantaloon in grimaldis time but now doing the heavy fathers at the wells proposed to her to exchange her name for his  but this proposal the worthy widow declined altogether to say truth she was exceedingly proud of her daughter mrs captain walker they did not see each other much at first but every now and then mrs crump would pay a visit to the folks in connaught square and on the days when the captains lady called in the city road there was not a single official at the wells from the first tragedian down to the callboy who was not made aware of the fact  it has been said that morgiana carried home her fortune in her own reticule and smiling placed the money in her husbands lap and hence the reader may imagine who knows mr walker to be an extremely selfish fellow that a great scene of anger must have taken place and many coarse oaths and epithets of abuse must have come from him when he found that five hundred pounds was all that his wife had although he had expected five thousand with her but to say the truth walker was at this time almost in love with his handsome rosy goodhumoured simple wife they had made a fortnights tour during which they had been exceedingly happy and there was something so frank and touching in the way in which the kind creature flung her all into his lap saluting him with a hearty embrace at the same time and wishing that it were a thousand billion billion times more so that her darling howard might enjoy it that the man would have been a ruffian indeed could he have found it in his heart to be angry with her and so he kissed her in return and patted her on the shining ringlets and then counted over the notes with rather a disconsolate air and ended by locking them up in his portfolio in fact she had never deceived him eglantine had and he in return had outtricked eglantine and so warm were his affections for morgiana at this time that upon my word and honour i dont think he repented of his bargain besides five hundred pounds in crisp banknotes was a sum of money such as the captain was not in the habit of handling every day a dashing sanguine fellow he fancied there was no end to it and already thought of a dozen ways by which it should increase and multiply into a plum woe is me has not many a simple soul examined five new hundredpound notes in this way and calculated their powers of duration and multiplication  this subject however is too painful to be dwelt on let us hear what walker did with his money why he furnished the house in the edgware road before mentioned he ordered a handsome service of plate he sported a phaeton and two ponies he kept a couple of smart maids and a groom footboyin fact he mounted just such a neat unpretending gentlemanlike establishment as becomes a respectable young couple on their outset in life ive sown my wild oats he would say to his acquaintances a few years since perhaps i would have longed to cut a dash but now prudence is the word and ive settled every farthing of mrs walkers fifteen thousand on herself and the best proof that the world had confidence in him is the fact that for the articles of plate equipage and furniture which have been mentioned as being in his possession he did not pay one single shilling and so prudent was he that but for turnpikes postagestamps and kings taxes he hardly had occasion to change a fivepound note of his wifes fortune  to tell the truth mr walker had determined to make his fortune and what is easier in london is not the sharemarket open to all do not spanish and columbian bonds rise and fall for what are companies invented but to place thousands in the pockets of shareholders and directors into these commercial pursuits the gallant captain now plunged with great energy and made some brilliant hits at first starting and bought and sold so opportunely that his name began to rise in the city as a capitalist and might be seen in the printed list of directors of many excellent and philanthropic schemes of which there is never any lack in london business to the amount of thousands was done at his agency shares of vast value were bought and sold under his management how poor mr eglantine used to hate him and envy him as from the door of his emporium the firm was eglantine and mossrose now he saw the captain daily arrive in his ponyphaeton and heard of the start he had taken in life  the only regret mrs walker had was that she did not enjoy enough of her husbands society his business called him away all day his business too obliged him to leave her of evenings very frequently alone whilst he always in pursuit of business was dining with his great friends at the club and drinking claret and champagne to the same end  she was a perfectly goodnatured and simple soul never made him a single reproach but when he could pass an evening at home with her she was delighted and when he could drive with her in the park she was happy for a week after on these occasions and in the fulness of her heart she would drive to her mother and tell her story howard drove with me in the park yesterday mamma and howard has promised to take me to the opera and so forth and that evening the manager mr gawler the first tragedian mrs serle and her forty pupils all the boxkeepers bonnetwomennay the gingerbeer girls themselves at the wells knew that captain and mrs walker were at kensington gardens or were to have the marchioness of billingsgates box at the opera one nighto joy of joysmrs captain walker appeared in a private box at the wells thats she with the black ringlets and cashmere shawl smellingbottle and blackvelvet gown and bird of paradise in her hat goodness gracious how they all acted at her gawler and all and how happy mrs crump was she kissed her daughter between all the acts she nodded to all her friends on the stage in the slips or in the real water she introduced her daughter mrs captain walker to the boxopener and melvil delamere the first comic canterfield the tyrant and jonesini the celebrated fontarabian statuesque were all on the steps and shouted for mrs captain walkers carriage and waved their hats and bowed as the little ponyphaeton drove away walker in his moustaches had come in at the end of the play and was not a little gratified by the compliments paid to himself and lady  among the other articles of luxury with which the captain furnished his house we must not omit to mention an extremely grand piano which occupied fourfifths of mrs walkers little back drawingroom and at which she was in the habit of practising continually all day and all night during walkers absences and these occurred all night and all day you might hearthe whole street might hearthe voice of the lady at no 23 gurgling and shaking and quavering as ladies do when they practise the street did not approve of the continuance of the noise but neighbours are difficult to please and what would morgiana have had to do if she had ceased to sing it would be hard to lock a blackbird in a cage and prevent him from singing too and so walkers blackbird in the snug little cage in the edgware road sang and was not unhappy  after the pair had been married for about a year the omnibus that passes both by mrs crumps house near the wells and by mrs walkers street off the edgware road brought up the formernamed lady almost every day to her daughter she came when the captain had gone to his business she stayed to a twooclock dinner with morgiana she drove with her in the ponycarriage round the park but she never stopped later than six had she not to go to the play at seven and besides the captain might come home with some of his great friends and he always swore and grumbled much if he found his motherinlaw on the premises as for morgiana she was one of those women who encourage despotism in husbands what the husband says must be right because he says it what he orders must be obeyed tremblingly mrs walker gave up her entire reason to her lord why was it before marriage she had been an independent little person she had far more brains than her howard i think it must have been his moustaches that frightened her and caused in her this humility  selfish husbands have this advantage in maintaining with easyminded wives a rigid and inflexible behaviour viz that if they do by any chance grant a little favour the ladies receive it with such transports of gratitude as they would never think of showing to a lord and master who was accustomed to give them everything they asked for and hence when captain walker signified his assent to his wifes prayer that she should take a singingmaster she thought his generosity almost divine and fell upon her mammas neck when that lady came the next day and said what a dear adorable angel her howard was and what ought she not to do for a man who had taken her from her humble situation and raised her to be what she was what she was poor soul she was the wife of a swindling parvenu gentleman she received visits from six ladies of her husbands acquaintancestwo attorneys ladies his billbrokers lady and one or two more of whose characters we had best if you please say nothing and she thought it an honour to be so distinguished as if walker had been a lord exeter to marry a humble maiden or a noble prince to fall in love with a humble cinderella or a majestic jove to come down from heaven and woo a semele look through the world respectable reader and among your honourable acquaintances and say if this sort of faith in women is not very frequent they will believe in their husbands whatever the latter do let john be dull ugly vulgar and a humbug his mary ann never finds it out let him tell his stories ever so many times there is she always ready with her kind smile let him be stingy she says he is prudent let him quarrel with his best friend she says he is always in the right let him be prodigal she says he is generous and that his health requires enjoyment let him be idle he must have relaxation and she will pinch herself and her household that he may have a guinea for his club yes and every morning as she wakes and looks at the face snoring on the pillow by her sideevery morning i say she blesses that dull ugly countenance and the dull ugly soul reposing there and thinks both are something divine i want to know how it is that women do not find out their husbands to be humbugs nature has so provided it and thanks to her when last year they were acting the midsummer nights dream and all the boxes began to roar with great coarse heehaws at titania hugging bottoms long long earsto me considering these things it seemed that there were a hundred other male brutes squatted round about and treated just as reasonably as bottom was their titanias lulled them to sleep in their laps summoned a hundred smiling delicate household fairies to tickle their gross intellects and minister to their vulgar pleasures and as the above remarks are only supposed to apply to honest women loving their own lawful spouses a mercy it is that no wicked puck is in the way to open their eyes and point out their folly cui bono let them live on in their deceit i know two lovely ladies who will read this and will say it is just very likely and not see in the least that it has been written regarding them  another point of sentiment and one curious to speculate on have you not remarked the immense works of art that women get through the worstedwork sofas the counterpanes patched or knitted but these are among the oldfashioned in the country the bushels of pincushions the albums they laboriously fill the tremendous pieces of music they practise the thousand other fiddlefaddles which occupy the attention of the dear soulsnay have we not seen them seated of evenings in a squad or company louisa employed at the worstedwork before mentioned eliza at the pincushions amelia at cardracks or filagree matches and in the midst theodosia with one of the candles reading out a novel aloud ah my dear sir mortal creatures must be very hard put to it for amusement be sure of that when they are forced to gather together in a company and hear novels read aloud they only do it because they cant help it depend upon it it is a sad life a poor pastime mr dickens in his american book tells of the prisoners at the silent prison how they had ornamented their rooms some of them with a frightful prettiness and elaboration womens fancywork is of this sort oftenonly prison work done because there was no other exercisingground for their poor little thoughts and fingers and hence these wonderful pincushions are executed these counterpanes woven these sonatas learned by everything sentimental when i see two kind innocent freshcheeked young women go to a piano and sit down opposite to it upon two chairs piled with more or less musicbooks according to their convenience and so seated go through a set of doublebarrelled variations upon this or that tune by herz or kalkbrenneri say far from receiving any satisfaction at the noise made by the performance my too susceptible heart is given up entirely to bleeding for the performers what hours and weeks nay preparatory years of study has that infernal jig cost them what sums has papa paid what scoldings has mamma administered lady bullblock does not play herself sir thomas says but she has naturally the finest ear for music ever known what evidences of slavery in a word are there it is the condition of the young ladys existence she breakfasts at eight she does mangnalls questions with the governess till ten she practises till one she walks in the square with bars round her till two then she practises again then she sews or hems or reads french or humes history then she comes down to play to papa because he likes music whilst he is asleep after dinner and then it is bedtime and the morrow is another day with what are called the same duties to be gone through a friend of mine went to call at a noblemans house the other day and one of the young ladies of the house came into the room with a tray on her head this tray was to give lady maria a graceful carriage mon dieu and who knows but at that moment lady bell was at work with a pair of her dumb namesakes and lady sophy lying flat on a stretchingboard i could write whole articles on this theme but peace we are keeping mrs walker waiting all the while  well then if the above disquisitions have anything to do with the story as no doubt they have i wish it to be understood that during her husbands absence and her own solitary confinement mrs howard walker bestowed a prodigious quantity of her time and energy on the cultivation of her musical talent and having as before stated a very fine loud voice speedily attained no ordinary skill in the use of it she first had for teacher little podmore the fat chorusmaster at the wells and who had taught her mother the tinkatink song which has been such a favourite since it first appeared he grounded her well and bade her eschew the singing of all those eagle tavern ballads in which her heart formerly delighted and when he had brought her to a certain point of skill the honest little chorusmaster said she should have a still better instructor and wrote a note to captain walker enclosing his own little account speaking in terms of the most flattering encomium of his ladys progress and recommending that she should take lessons of the celebrated baroski captain walker dismissed podmore then and engaged signor baroski at a vast expense as he did not fail to tell his wife in fact he owed baroski no less than two hundred and twenty guineas when he wasbut we are advancing matters  little baroski is the author of the opera of eliogabalo of the oratorio of purgatorio which made such an immense sensation of songs and balletmusics innumerable he is a german by birth and shows such an outrageous partiality for pork and sausages and attends at church so constantly that i am sure there cannot be any foundation in the story that he is a member of the ancient religion he is a fat little man with a hooked nose and jetty whiskers and coalblack shining eyes and plenty of rings and jewels on his fingers and about his person and a very considerable portion of his shirtsleeves turned over his coat to take the air his great hands which can sprawl over half a piano and produce those effects on the instrument for which he is celebrated are encased in lemoncoloured kids new or cleaned daily parenthetically let us ask why so many men with coarse red wrists and big hands persist in the white kid glove and wristband system baroskis gloves alone must cost him a little fortune only he says with a leer when asked the question get along vid you dont you know dere is a gloveress that lets me have dem very sheap he rides in the park has splendid lodgings in dover street and is a member of the regent club where he is a great source of amusement to the members to whom he tells astonishing stories of his successes with the ladies and for whom he has always play and opera tickets in store his eye glistens and his little heart beats when a lord speaks to him and he has been known to spend large sums of money in giving treats to young sprigs of fashion at richmond and elsewhere in my bolyticks he says i am consarevatiff to de bagbone in fine he is a puppy and withal a man of considerable genius in his profession  this gentleman then undertook to complete the musical education of mrs walker he expressed himself at once enshanted vid her gababilities found that the extent of her voice was brodigious and guaranteed that she should become a firstrate singer the pupil was apt the master was exceedingly skilful and accordingly mrs walkers progress was very remarkable although for her part honest mrs crump who used to attend her daughters lessons would grumble not a little at the new system and the endless exercises which she morgiana was made to go through it was very different in her time she said incledon knew no music and who could sing so well now give her a good english ballad it was a thousand times sweeter than your figaros and semiramides  in spite of these objections however and with amazing perseverance and cheerfulness mrs walker pursued the method of study pointed out to her by her master as soon as her husband went to the city in the morning her operations began if he remained away at dinner her labours still continued nor is it necessary for me to particularise her course of study nor indeed possible for between ourselves none of the male fitzboodles ever could sing a note and the jargon of scales and solfeggios is quite unknown to me but as no man can have seen persons addicted to music without remarking the prodigious energies they display in the pursuit as there is no father of daughters however ignorant but is aware of the pianorattling and voiceexercising which go on in his house from morning till night so let all fancy without further inquiry how the heroine of our story was at this stage of her existence occupied  walker was delighted with her progress and did everything but pay baroski her instructor we know why he didnt pay it was his nature not to pay bills except on extreme compulsion but why did not baroski employ that extreme compulsion because if he had received his money he would have lost his pupil and because he loved his pupil more than money rather than lose her he would have given her a guinea as well as her cachet he would sometimes disappoint a great personage but he never missed his attendance on her and the truth must out that he was in love with her as woolsey and eglantine had been before  by the immortel chofe he would say dat letell ding sents me mad vid her big ice but only vait avile in six veeks i can bring any voman in england on her knees to me and you shall see vat i vill do vid my morgiana he attended her for six weeks punctually and yet morgiana was never brought down on her knees he exhausted his best stock of gomblimends and she never seemed disposed to receive them with anything but laughter and as a matter of course he only grew more infatuated with the lovely creature who was so provokingly goodhumoured and so laughingly cruel  benjamin baroski was one of the chief ornaments of the musical profession in london he charged a guinea for a lesson of threequarters of an hour abroad and he had furthermore a school at his own residence where pupils assembled in considerable numbers and of that curious mixed kind which those may see who frequent these places of instruction there were very innocent young ladies with their mammas who would hurry them off trembling to the farther corner of the room when certain doubtful professional characters made their appearance there was miss grigg who sang at the foundling and mr johnson who sang at the eagle tavern and madame fioravanti a very doubtful character who sang nowhere but was always coming out at the italian opera there was lumley limpiter lord tweedledales son one of the most accomplished tenors in town and who we have heard sings with the professionals at a hundred concerts and with him too was captain guzzard of the guards with his tremendous bass voice which all the world declared to be as fine as portos and who shared the applause of baroskis school with mr bulger the dentist of sackville street who neglected his ivory and gold plates for his voice as every unfortunate individual will do who is bitten by the music mania then among the ladies there were a halfscore of dubious pale governesses and professionals with turned frocks and lank damp bandeaux of hair under shabby little bonnets luckless creatures these who were parting with their poor little store of halfguineas to be enabled to say they were pupils of signor baroski and so get pupils of their own among the british youths or employment in the choruses of the theatres  the prima donna of the little company was amelia larkins baroskis own articled pupil on whose future reputation the eminent master staked his own whose profits he was to share and whom he had farmed to this end from her father a most respectable sheriffs officers assistant and now by his daughters exertions a considerable capitalist amelia is blonde and blueeyed her complexion is as bright as snow her ringlets of the colour of straw her figurebut why describe her figure has not all the world seen her at the theatres royal and in america under the name of miss ligonier  until mrs walker arrived miss larkins was the undisputed princess of the baroski companythe semiramide the rosina the tamina the donna anna baroski vaunted her everywhere as the great rising genius of the day bade catalani look to her laurels and questioned whether miss stephens could sing a ballad like his pupil mrs howard walker arrived and created on the first occasion no small sensation she improved and the little society became speedily divided into walkerites and larkinsians and between these two ladies as indeed between guzzard and bulger before mentioned between miss brunck and miss horsman the two contraltos and between the chorussingers after their kind a great rivalry arose larkins was certainly the better singer but could her strawcoloured curls and dumpy highshouldered figure bear any comparison with the jetty ringlets and stately form of morgiana did not mrs walker too come to the musiclesson in her carriage and with a black velvet gown and cashmere shawl while poor larkins meekly stepped from bell yard temple bar in an old print gown and clogs which she left in the hall larkins sing said mrs crump sarcastically im sure she ought her mouths big enough to sing a duet poor larkins had no one to make epigrams in her behoof her mother was at home tending the younger ones her father abroad following the duties of his profession she had but one protector as she thought and that one was baroski mrs crump did not fail to tell lumley limpiter of her own former triumphs and to sing him tinkatink which we have previously heard and to state how in former days she had been called the ravenswing and lumley on this hint made a poem in which he compared morgianas hair to the plumage of the ravens wing and larkinissas to that of the canary by which two names the ladies began soon to be known in the school  ere long the flight of the ravenswing became evidently stronger whereas that of the canary was seen evidently to droop when morgiana sang all the room would cry bravo when amelia performed scarce a hand was raised for applause of her except morgianas own and that the larkinses thought was lifted in odious triumph rather than in sympathy for miss l was of an envious turn and little understood the generosity of her rival  at last one day the crowning victory of the ravenswing came in the trio of baroskis own opera of eliogabalo rosy lips and rosy wine miss larkins who was evidently unwell was taking the part of the english captive which she had sung in public concerts before royal dukes and with considerable applause and from some reason performed it so ill that baroski slapping down the music on the piano in a fury cried mrs howard walker as miss larkins cannot sing today will you favour us by taking the part of boadicetta mrs walker got up smilingly to obeythe triumph was too great to be withstood and as she advanced to the piano miss larkins looked wildly at her and stood silent for a while and at last shrieked out benjamin in a tone of extreme agony and dropped fainting down on the ground benjamin looked extremely red it must be confessed at being thus called by what we shall denominate his christian name and limpiter looked round at guzzard and miss brunck nudged miss horsman and the lesson concluded rather abruptly that day for miss larkins was carried off to the next room laid on a couch and sprinkled with water  goodnatured morgiana insisted that her mother should take miss larkins to bell yard in her carriage and went herself home on foot but i dont know that this piece of kindness prevented larkins from hating her i should doubt if it did  hearing so much of his wifes skill as a singer the astute captain walker determined to take advantage of it for the purpose of increasing his connection he had lumley limpiter at his house before long which was indeed no great matter for honest lum would go anywhere for a good dinnerand an opportunity to show off his voice afterwards and lumley was begged to bring any more clerks in the treasury of his acquaintance captain guzzard was invited and any officers of the guards whom he might choose to bring bulger received occasional cardsin a word and after a short time mrs howard walkers musical parties began to be considerably suivies her husband had the satisfaction to see his rooms filled by many great personages and once or twice in return indeed whenever she was wanted or when people could not afford to hire the first singers she was asked to parties elsewhere and treated with that killing civility which our english aristocracy knows how to bestow on artists clever and wise aristocracy it is sweet to mark your ways and study your commerce with inferior men  i was just going to commence a tirade regarding the aristocracy here and to rage against that cool assumption of superiority which distinguishes their lordships commerce with artists of all sorts that politeness which if it condescends to receive artists at all takes care to have them altogether so that there can be no mistake about their rankthat august patronage of art which rewards it with a silly flourish of knighthood to be sure but takes care to exclude it from any contact with its betters in societyi was i say just going to commence a tirade against the aristocracy for excluding artists from their company and to be extremely satirical upon them for instance for not receiving my friend morgiana when it suddenly came into my head to ask was mrs walker fit to move in the best societyto which query it must humbly be replied that she was not her education was not such as to make her quite the equal of baker street she was a kind honest and clever creature but it must be confessed not refined wherever she went she had if not the finest at any rate the most showy gown in the room her ornaments were the biggest her hats toques berets marabouts and other fallals always the most conspicuous she drops hs here and there i have seen her eat peas with a knife and walker scowling on the opposite side of the table striving in vain to catch her eye and i shall never forget lady smigsmags horror when she asked for porter at dinner at richmond and began to drink it out of the pewter pot it was a fine sight she lifted up the tankard with one of the finest arms covered with the biggest bracelets ever seen and had a bird of paradise on her head that curled round the pewter disc of the pot as she raised it like a halo these peculiarities she had and has still she is best away from the genteel world that is the fact when she says that the weather is so ot that it is quite debiliating when she laughs when she hits her neighbour at dinner on the side of the waistcoat as she will if he should say anything that amuses her she does what is perfectly natural and unaffected on her part but what is not customarily done among polite persons who can sneer at her odd manners and her vanity but dont know the kindness honesty and simplicity which distinguish her this point being admitted it follows of course that the tirade against the aristocracy would in the present instance be out of placeso it shall be reserved for some other occasion  the ravenswing was a person admirably disposed by nature to be happy she had a disposition so kindly that any small attention would satisfy it was pleased when alone was delighted in a crowd was charmed with a joke however old was always ready to laugh to sing to dance or to be merry was so tenderhearted that the smallest ballad would make her cry and hence was supposed by many persons to be extremely affected and by almost all to be a downright coquette several competitors for her favour presented themselves besides baroski young dandies used to canter round her phaeton in the park and might be seen haunting her doors in the mornings the fashionable artist of the day made a drawing of her which was engraved and sold in the shops a copy of it was printed in a song blackeyed maiden of araby the words by desmond mulligan esquire the music composed and dedicated to mrs howard walker by her most faithful and obliged servant benjamin baroski and at night her operabox was full her operabox yes the heiress of the bootjack actually had an operabox and some of the most fashionable manhood of london attended it  now in fact was the time of her greatest prosperity and her husband gathering these fashionable characters about him extended his agency considerably and began to thank his stars that he had married a woman who was as good as a fortune to him  in extending his agency however mr walker increased his expenses proportionably and multiplied his debts accordingly more furniture and more plate more wines and more dinnerparties became necessary the little ponyphaeton was exchanged for a brougham of evenings and we may fancy our old friend mr eglantines rage and disgust as he looked from the pit of the opera to see mrs walker surrounded by what he called the swell young nobs about london bowing to my lord and laughing with his grace and led to carriage by sir john  the ravenswings position at this period was rather an exceptional one she was an honest woman visited by that peculiar class of our aristocracy who chiefly associate with ladies who are not honest she laughed with all but she encouraged none old crump was constantly at her side now when she appeared in public the most watchful of mammas always awake at the opera though she seemed to be always asleep but no dandy debauchee could deceive her vigilance and for this reason walker who disliked her as every man naturally will must and should dislike his motherinlaw was contented to suffer her in his house to act as a chaperon to morgiana  none of the young dandies ever got admission of mornings to the little mansion in the edgware road the blinds were always down and though you might hear morgianas voice half across the park as she was practising yet the youthful hallporter in the sugarloaf buttons was instructed to deny her and always declared that his mistress was gone out with the most admirable assurance  after some two years of her life of splendour there were to be sure a good number of morning visitors who came with single knocks and asked for captain walker but these were no more admitted than the dandies aforesaid and were referred generally to the captains office whither they went or not at their convenience the only man who obtained admission into the house was baroski whose cab transported him thrice a week to the neighbourhood of connaught square and who obtained ready entrance in his professional capacity  but even then and much to the wicked little musicmasters disappointment the dragon crump was always at the piano with her endless worsted work or else reading her unfailing sunday times and baroski could only employ de langvitch of de ice as he called it with his fair pupil who used to mimic his manner of rolling his eyes about afterwards and perform baroski in love for the amusement of her husband and her mamma the former had his reasons for overlooking the attentions of the little musicmaster and as for the latter had she not been on the stage and had not many hundreds of persons in jest or earnest made love to her what else can a pretty woman expect who is much before the public and so the worthy mother counselled her daughter to bear these attentions with good humour rather than to make them a subject of perpetual alarm and quarrel  baroski then was allowed to go on being in love and was never in the least disturbed in his passion and if he was not successful at least the little wretch could have the pleasure of hinting that he was and looking particularly roguish when the ravenswing was named and assuring his friends at the club that upon his vort dere vas no trut in dat rebort  at last one day it happened that mrs crump did not arrive in time for her daughters lesson perhaps it rained and the omnibus was fulla smaller circumstance than that has changed a whole life ere nowmrs crump did not arrive and baroski did and morgiana seeing no great harm sat down to her lesson as usual and in the midst of it down went the musicmaster on his knees and made a declaration in the most eloquent terms he could muster  dont be a fool baroski said the ladyi cant help it if her language was not more choice and if she did not rise with cold dignity exclaiming unhand me sirdont be a fool said mrs walker but get up and lets finish the lesson  you hardhearted adorable little greature vill you not listen to me  no i vill not listen to you benjamin concluded the lady get up and take a chair and dont go on in that ridiklous way dont  but baroski having a speech by heart determined to deliver himself of it in that posture and begged morgiana not to turn avay her divine hice and to listen to de voice of his despair and so forth he seized the ladys hand and was going to press it to his lips when she said with more spirit perhaps than grace  leave go my hand sir ill box your ears if you dont  but baroski wouldnt release her hand and was proceeding to imprint a kiss upon it and mrs crump who had taken the omnibus at a quarterpast twelve instead of that at twelve had just opened the drawingroom door and was walking in when morgiana turning as red as a peony and unable to disengage her left hand which the musician held raised up her right hand and with all her might and main gave her lover such a tremendous slap in the face as caused him abruptly to release the hand which he held and would have laid him prostrate on the carpet but for mrs crump who rushed forward and prevented him from falling by administering right and left a whole shower of slaps such as he had never endured since the day he was at school  what imperence said that worthy lady youll lay hands on my daughter will you one two youll insult a woman in distress will you you little coward one two take that and mind your manners you filthy monster  baroski bounced up in a fury by chofe you shall hear of dis shouted he you shall pay me dis  as many more as you please little benjamin cried the widow augustus to the page was that the captains knock at this baroski made for his hat augustus show this imperence to the door and if he tries to come in again call a policeman do you hear  the musicmaster vanished very rapidly and the two ladies instead of being frightened or falling into hysterics as their betters would have done laughed at the odious monsters discomfiture as they called him such a man as that set himself up against my howard said morgiana with becoming pride but it was agreed between them that howard should know nothing of what had occurred for fear of quarrels or lest he should be annoyed so when he came home not a word was said and only that his wife met him with more warmth than usual you could not have guessed that anything extraordinary had occurred it is not my fault that my heroines sensibilities were not more keen that she had not the least occasion for salvolatile or symptom of a fainting fit but so it was and mr howard walker knew nothing of the quarrel between his wife and her instructor until  until he was arrested next day at the suit of benjamin baroski for two hundred and twenty guineas and in default of payment was conducted by mr tobias larkins to his principals lockup house in chancery lane    chapter v in which mr walker falls into difficulties and mrs walker makes many foolish attempts to rescue him  i hope the beloved reader is not silly enough to imagine that mr walker on finding himself inspunged for debt in chancery lane was so foolish as to think of applying to any of his friends those great personages who have appeared every now and then in the course of this little history and have served to give it a fashionable air no no he knew the world too well and that though billingsgate would give him as many dozen of claret as he could carry away under his belt as the phrase is i cant help it madam if the phrase is not more genteel and though vauxhall would lend him his carriage slap him on the back and dine at his housetheir lordships would have seen mr walker depending from a beam in front of the old bailey rather than have helped him to a hundred pounds  and why forsooth should we expect otherwise in the world i observe that men who complain of its selfishness are quite as selfish as the world is and no more liberal of money than their neighbours and i am quite sure with regard to captain walker that he would have treated a friend in want exactly as he when in want was treated there was only his lady who was in the least afflicted by his captivity and as for the club that went on we are bound to say exactly as it did on the day previous to his disappearance  by the way about clubscould we not but for fear of detaining the fair reader too long enter into a wholesome dissertation here on the manner of friendship established in those institutions and the noble feeling of selfishness which they are likely to encourage in the male race i put out of the question the stale topics of complaint such as leaving home encouraging gormandising and luxurious habits etc but look also at the dealings of clubmen with one another look at the rush for the evening paper see how shiverton orders a fire in the dogdays and swettenham opens the windows in february see how cramley takes the whole breast of the turkey on his plate and how many times jenkins sends away his beggarly halfpint of sherry clubbery is organised egotism club intimacy is carefully and wonderfully removed from friendship you meet smith for twenty years exchange the days news with him laugh with him over the last joke grow as well acquainted as two men may be togetherand one day at the end of the list of members of the club you read in a little paragraph by itself with all the honours       member deceased      smith john esq  or he on the other hand has the advantage of reading your own name selected for a similar typographical distinction there it is that abominable little exclusive list at the end of every clubcatalogueyou cant avoid it i belong to eight clubs myself and know that one year fitzboodle george savage esq unless it should please fate to remove my brother and his six sons when of course it would be fitzboodle sir george savage bart will appear in the dismal category there is that list down i must go in itthe day will come and i shant be seen in the bowwindow someone else will be sitting in the vacant armchair the rubber will begin as usual and yet somehow fitz will not be there wheres fitz says trumpington just arrived from the rhine dont you know says punter turning down his thumb to the carpet you led the club i think says ruff to his partner the other partner and the waiter snuffs the candles                        i hope in the course of the above little pause every single member of a club who reads this has profited by the perusal he may belong i say to eight clubs he will die and not be missed by any of the five thousand members peace be to him the waiters will forget him and his name will pass away and another greatcoat will hang on the hook whence his own used to be dependent  and this i need not say is the beauty of the clubinstitutions if it were otherwiseif forsooth we were to be sorry when our friends died or to draw out our purses when our friends were in want we should be insolvent and life would be miserable be it ours to button up our pockets and our hearts and to make merryit is enough to swim down this lifestream for ourselves if poverty is clutching hold of our heels or friendship would catch an arm kick them both off every man for himself is the word and plenty to do too  my friend captain walker had practised the above maxims so long and resolutely as to be quite aware when he came himself to be in distress that not a single soul in the whole universe would help him and he took his measures accordingly  when carried to mr bendigos lockup house he summoned that gentleman in a very haughty way took a blank bankers cheque out of his pocketbook and filling it up for the exact sum of the writ orders mr bendigo forthwith to open the door and let him go forth  mr bendigo smiling with exceeding archness and putting a finger covered all over with diamond rings to his extremely aquiline nose inquired of mr walker whether he saw anything green about his face intimating by this gay and goodhumoured interrogatory his suspicion of the unsatisfactory nature of the document handed over to him by mr walker  hang it sir says mr walker go and get the cheque cashed and be quick about it send your man in a cab and heres a halfcrown to pay for it the confident air somewhat staggers the bailiff who asked him whether he would like any refreshment while his man was absent getting the amount of the cheque and treated his prisoner with great civility during the time of the messengers journey  but as captain walker had but a balance of two pounds five and twopence this sum was afterwards divided among his creditors the law expenses being previously deducted from it the bankers of course declined to cash the captains draft for two hundred and odd pounds simply writing the words no effects on the paper on receiving which reply walker far from being cast down burst out laughing very gaily produced a real fivepound note and called upon his host for a bottle of champagne which the two worthies drank in perfect friendship and goodhumour the bottle was scarcely finished and the young israelitish gentleman who acts as waiter in cursitor street had only time to remove the flask and the glasses when poor morgiana with a flood of tears rushed into her husbands arms and flung herself on his neck and calling him her dearest blessed howard would have fainted at his feet but that he breaking out in a fury of oaths asked her how after getting him into that scrape through her infernal extravagance she dared to show her face before him this address speedily frightened the poor thing out of her fainting fitthere is nothing so good for female hysterics as a little conjugal sternness nay brutality as many husbands can aver who are in the habit of employing the remedy  my extravagance howard said she in a faint way and quite put off her purpose of swooning by the sudden attack made upon hersurely my love you have nothing to complain of  to complain of maam roared the excellent walker is two hundred guineas to a musicmaster nothing to complain of did you bring me such a fortune as to authorise your taking guinea lessons havent i raised you out of your sphere of life and introduced you to the best of the land havent i dressed you like a duchess havent i been for you such a husband as very few women in the world ever had madamanswer me that  indeed howard you were always very kind sobbed the lady  havent i toiled and slaved for youbeen out all day working for you havent i allowed your vulgar old mother to come to your houseto my house i say havent i done all this  she could not deny it and walker who was in a rage and when a man is in a rage for what on earth is a wife made but that he should vent his rage on her continued for some time in this strain and so abused frightened and overcame poor morgiana that she left her husband fully convinced that she was the most guilty of beings and bemoaning his double bad fortune that her howard was ruined and she the cause of his misfortunes  when she was gone mr walker resumed his equanimity for he was not one of those men whom a few months of the kings bench were likely to terrify and drank several glasses of punch in company with his host with whom in perfect calmness he talked over his affairs that he intended to pay his debt and quit the spunginghouse next day is a matter of course no one ever was yet put in a spunginghouse that did not pledge his veracity he intended to quit it tomorrow mr bendigo said he should be heartily glad to open the door to him and in the meantime sent out diligently to see among his friends if there were any more detainers against the captain and to inform the captains creditors to come forward against him  morgiana went home in profound grief it may be imagined and could hardly refrain from bursting into tears when the sugarloaf page asked whether master was coming home early or whether he had taken his key she lay awake tossing and wretched the whole night and very early in the morning rose up and dressed and went out  before nine oclock she was in cursitor street and once more joyfully bounced into her husbands arms who woke up yawning and swearing somewhat with a severe headache occasioned by the jollification of the previous night for strange though it may seem there are perhaps no places in europe where jollity is more practised than in prisons for debt and i declare for my own part i mean of course that i went to visit a friend i have dined at mr aminadabs as sumptuously as at longs  but it is necessary to account for morgianas joyfulness which was strange in her husbands perplexity and after her sorrow of the previous night well then when mrs walker went out in the morning she did so with a very large basket under her arm shall i carry the basket maam said the page seizing it with much alacrity  no thank you cried his mistress with equal eagerness its only  of course maam replied the boy sneering i knew it was that  glass continued mrs walker turning extremely red have the goodness to call a coach sir and not to speak till you are questioned  the young gentleman disappeared upon his errand the coach was called and came mrs walker slipped into it with her basket and the page went downstairs to his companions in the kitchen and said its acomin masters in quod and missus has gone out to pawn the plate when the cook went out that day she somehow had by mistake placed in her basket a dozen of tableknives and a plated eggstand when the ladysmaid took a walk in the course of the afternoon she found she had occasion for eight cambric pockethandkerchiefs marked with her mistresss cipher halfadozen pair of shoes gloves long and short some silk stockings and a goldheaded scentbottle both the new cashmeres is gone said she and theres nothing left in mrs walkers trinketbox but a paper of pins and an old coral bracelet as for the page he rushed incontinently to his masters dressingroom and examined every one of the pockets of his clothes made a parcel of some of them and opened all the drawers which walker had not locked before his departure he only found threehalfpence and a bill stamp and about fortyfive tradesmens accounts neatly labelled and tied up with red tape these three worthies a groom who was a great admirer of trimmer the ladysmaid and a policeman a friend of the cooks sat down to a comfortable dinner at the usual hour and it was agreed among them all that walkers ruin was certain the cook made the policeman a present of a china punchbowl which mrs walker had given her and the ladysmaid gave her friend the book of beauty for last year and the third volume of byrons poems from the drawingroom table  im dashd if she aint taken the little french clock too said the page and so indeed mrs walker had it slipped in the basket where it lay enveloped in one of her shawls and then struck madly and unnaturally a great number of times as morgiana was lifting her store of treasures out of the hackneycoach the coachman wagged his head sadly as he saw her walking as quick as she could under her heavy load and disappearing round the corner of the street at which mr ballss celebrated jewellery establishment is situated it is a grand shop with magnificent silver cups and salvers rare goldheaded canes flutes watches diamond brooches and a few fine specimens of the old masters in the window and under the words       balls jeweller  you read         money lent  in the very smallest type on the door  the interview with mr balls need not be described but it must have been a satisfactory one for at the end of half an hour morgiana returned and bounded into the coach with sparkling eyes and told the driver to gallop to cursitor street which smiling he promised to do and accordingly set off in that direction at the rate of four miles an hour i thought so said the philosophic charioteer when a mans in quod a woman dont mind her silver spoons and he was so delighted with her action that he forgot to grumble when she came to settle accounts with him even though she gave him only double his fare  take me to him said she to the young hebrew who opened the door  to whom says the sarcastic youth theres twenty hims here youre precious early  to captain walker young man replied morgiana haughtily whereupon the youth opening the second door and seeing mr bendigo in a flowered dressinggown descending the stairs exclaimed papa heres a lady for the captain im come to free him said she trembling and holding out a bundle of banknotes heres the amount of your claim sirtwo hundred and twenty guineas as you told me last night the jew took the notes and grinned as he looked at her and grinned double as he looked at his son and begged mrs walker to step into his study and take a receipt when the door of that apartment closed upon the lady and his father mr bendigo the younger fell back in an agony of laughter which it is impossible to describe in words and presently ran out into a court where some of the luckless inmates of the house were already taking the air and communicated something to them which made those individuals also laugh as uproariously as he had previously done  well after joyfully taking the receipt from mr bendigo how her cheeks flushed and her heart fluttered as she dried it on the blottingbook and after turning very pale again on hearing that the captain had had a very bad night and well he might poor dear said she at which mr bendigo having no person to grin at grinned at a marble bust of mr pitt which ornamented his sideboardmorgiana i say these preliminaries being concluded was conducted to her husbands apartment and once more flinging her arms round her dearest howards neck told him with one of the sweetest smiles in the world to make haste and get up and come home for breakfast was waiting and the carriage at the door  what do you mean love said the captain starting up and looking exceedingly surprised  i mean that my dearest is free that the odious little creature is paidat least the horrid bailiff is  have you been to baroski said walker turning very red  howard said his wife quite indignant  diddid your mother give you the money asked the captain  no i had it by me replies mrs walker with a very knowing look  walker was more surprised than ever have you any more by you said he  mrs walker showed him her purse with two guineas that is all love she said and i wish continued she you would give me a draft to pay a whole list of little bills that have somehow all come in within the last few days  well well you shall have the cheque continued mr walker and began forthwith to make his toilet which completed he rang for mr bendigo and his bill and intimated his wish to go home directly  the honoured bailiff brought the bill but with regard to his being free said it was impossible  how impossible said mrs walker turning very red and then very pale did i not pay just now  so you did and youve got the reshipt but theres another detainer against the captain for a hundred and fifty eglantine and mossrose of bond streetperfumery for five years you know  you dont mean to say you were such a fool as to pay without asking if there were any more detainers roared walker to his wife  yes she was though chuckled mr bendigo but shell know better the next time and besides captain whats a hundred and fifty pounds to you  though walker desired nothing so much in the world at that moment as the liberty to knock down his wife his sense of prudence overcame his desire for justice if that feeling may be called prudence on his part which consisted in a strong wish to cheat the bailiff into the idea that he walker was an exceedingly respectable and wealthy man many worthy persons indulge in this fond notion that they are imposing upon the world strive to fancy for instance that their bankers consider them men of property because they keep a tolerable balance pay little tradesmens bills with ostentatious punctuality and so forthbut the world let us be pretty sure is as wise as need be and guesses our real condition with a marvellous instinct or learns it with curious skill the london tradesman is one of the keenest judges of human nature extant and if a tradesman how much more a bailiff in reply to the ironic question whats a hundred and fifty pounds to you walker collecting himself answers it is an infamous imposition and i owe the money no more than you do but nevertheless i shall instruct my lawyers to pay it in the course of the morning under protest of course  oh of course said mr bendigo bowing and quitting the room and leaving mrs walker to the pleasure of a teteatete with her husband  and now being alone with the partner of his bosom the worthy gentleman began an address to her which cannot be put down on paper here because the world is exceedingly squeamish and does not care to hear the whole truth about rascals and because the fact is that almost every other word of the captains speech was a curse such as would shock the beloved reader were it put in print  fancy then in lieu of the conversation a scoundrel disappointed and in a fury wreaking his brutal revenge upon an amiable woman who sits trembling and pale and wondering at this sudden exhibition of wrath fancy how he clenches his fists and stands over her and stamps and screams out curses with a livid face growing wilder and wilder in his rage wrenching her hand when she wants to turn away and only stopping at last when she has fallen off the chair in a fainting fit with a heartbreaking sob that made the jewboy who was listening at the keyhole turn quite pale and walk away well it is best perhaps that such a conversation should not be told at lengthat the end of it when mr walker had his wife lifeless on the floor he seized a waterjug and poured it over her which operation pretty soon brought her to herself and shaking her black ringlets she looked up once more again timidly into his face and took his hand and began to cry  he spoke now in a somewhat softer voice and let her keep paddling on with his hand as before he couldnt speak very fiercely to the poor girl in her attitude of defeat and tenderness and supplication morgiana said he your extravagance and carelessness have brought me to ruin im afraid if you had chosen to have gone to baroski a word from you would have made him withdraw the writ and my property wouldnt have been sacrificed as it has now been for nothing it maynt be yet too late however to retrieve ourselves this bill of eglantines is a regular conspiracy i am sure between mossrose and bendigo here you must go to eglantinehes an oldan old flame of yours you know  she dropped his hand i cant go to eglantine after what has passed between us she said but walkers face instantly began to wear a certain look and she said with a shudder well well dear i will go you will go to eglantine and ask him to take a bill for the amount of this shameful demandat any date never mind what mind however to see him alone and im sure if you choose you can settle the business make haste set off directly and come back as there may be more detainers in  trembling and in a great flutter morgiana put on her bonnet and gloves and went towards the door its a fine morning said mr walker looking out a walk will do you good andmorgianadidnt you say you had a couple of guineas in your pocket  here it is said she smiling all at once and holding up her face to be kissed she paid the two guineas for the kiss was it not a mean act is it possible that people can love where they do not respect says miss prim i never would nobody asked you miss prim but recollect morgiana was not born with your advantages of education and breeding and was in fact a poor vulgar creature who loved mr walker not because her mamma told her nor because he was an exceedingly eligible and wellbroughtup young man but because she could not help it and knew no better nor is mrs walker set up as a model of virtue ah no when i want a model of virtue i will call in baker street and ask for a sitting of my dear if i may be permitted to say so miss prim  we have mr howard walker safely housed in mr bendigos establishment in cursitor street chancery lane and it looks like mockery and want of feeling towards the excellent hero of this story or as should rather be said towards the husband of the heroine to say what he might have been but for the unlucky little circumstance of baroskis passion for morgiana  if baroski had not fallen in love with morgiana he would not have given her two hundred guineas worth of lessons he would not have so far presumed as to seize her hand and attempt to kiss it if he had not attempted to kiss her she would not have boxed his ears he would not have taken out the writ against walker walker would have been free very possibly rich and therefore certainly respected he always said that a months more liberty would have set him beyond the reach of misfortune  the assertion is very likely a correct one for walker had a flashy enterprising genius which ends in wealth sometimes in the kings bench not seldom occasionally alas in van diemens land he might have been rich could he have kept his credit and had not his personal expenses and extravagances pulled him down he had gallantly availed himself of his wifes fortune nor could any man in london as he proudly said have made five hundred pounds go so far he had as we have seen furnished a house sideboard and cellar with it he had a carriage and horses in his stable and with the remainder he had purchased shares in four companiesof three of which he was founder and director had conducted innumerable bargains in the foreign stocks had lived and entertained sumptuously and made himself a very considerable income he had set up the capitol loan and life assurance company had discovered the chimborazo gold mines and the society for recovering and draining the pontine marshes capital ten millions patron his holiness the pope it certainly was stated in an evening paper that his holiness had made him a knight of the spur and had offered to him the rank of count and he was raising a loan for his highness the cacique of panama who had sent him by way of dividend the grand cordon of his highnesss order of the castle and falcon which might be seen any day at his office in bond street with the parchments signed and sealed by the grand master and falcon kingatarms of his highness in a week more walker would have raised a hundred thousand pounds on his highnesss twenty per cent loan he would have had fifteen thousand pounds commission for himself his companies would have risen to par he would have realised his shares he would have gone into parliament he would have been made a baronet who knows a peer probably and i appeal to you sir walker would say to his friends could any man have shown better proof of his affection for his wife than by laying out her little miserable money as i did they call me heartless sir because i didnt succeed sir my life has been a series of sacrifices for that woman such as no man ever performed before  a proof of walkers dexterity and capability for business may be seen in the fact that he had actually appeased and reconciled one of his bitterest enemiesour honest friend eglantine after walkers marriage eglantine who had now no mercantile dealings with his former agent became so enraged with him that as the only means of revenge in his power he sent him in his bill for goods supplied to the amount of one hundred and fifty guineas and sued him for the amount but walker stepped boldly over to his enemy and in the course of half an hour they were friends  eglantine promised to forego his claim and accepted in lieu of it three hundredpound shares of the expanama stock bearing twentyfive per cent payable halfyearly at the house of hocus brothers st swithins lane three hundredpound shares and the second class of the order of the castle and falcon with the riband and badge in four years eglantine my boy i hope to get you the grand cordon of the order said walker i hope to see you a knight grand cross with a grant of a hundred thousand acres reclaimed from the isthmus  to do my poor eglantine justice he did not care for the hundred thousand acresit was the star that delighted himah how his fat chest heaved with delight as he sewed on the cross and riband to his dresscoat and lighted up four wax candles and looked at himself in the glass he was known to wear a greatcoat after thatit was that he might wear the cross under it that year he went on a trip to boulogne he was dreadfully ill during the voyage but as the vessel entered the port he was seen to emerge from the cabin his coat open the star blazing on his chest the soldiers saluted him as he walked the streets he was called monsieur le chevalier and when he went home he entered into negotiations with walker to purchase a commission in his highnesss service walker said he would get him the nominal rank of captain the fees at the panama war office were fiveandtwenty pounds which sum honest eglantine produced and had his commission and a pack of visiting cards printed as captain archibald eglantine kcf many a time he looked at them as they lay in his desk and he kept the cross in his dressingtable and wore it as he shaved every morning  his highness the cacique it is well known came to england and had lodgings in regent street where he held a levee at which eglantine appeared in the panama uniform and was most graciously received by his sovereign his highness proposed to make captain eglantine his aidedecamp with the rank of colonel but the captains exchequer was rather low at that moment and the fees at the war office were peremptory meanwhile his highness left regent street was said by some to have returned to panama by others to be in his native city of cork by others to be leading a life of retirement in the new cut lambeth at any rate was not visible for some time so that captain eglantines advancement did not take place eglantine was somehow ashamed to mention his military and chivalric rank to mr mossrose when that gentleman came into partnership with him and kept these facts secret until they were detected by a very painful circumstance on the very day when walker was arrested at the suit of benjamin baroski there appeared in the newspapers an account of the imprisonment of his highness the prince of panama for a bill owing to a licensed victualler in ratcliff highway the magistrate to whom the victualler subsequently came to complain passed many pleasantries on the occasion he asked whether his highness did not drink like a swan with two necks whether he had brought any belles savages with him from panama and so forth and the whole court said the report was convulsed with laughter when boniface produced a green and yellow riband with a large star of the order of the castle and falcon with which his highness proposed to gratify him in lieu of paying his little bill  it was as he was reading the above document with a bleeding heart that mr mossrose came in from his daily walk to the city vell eglantine says he have you heard the newsh  about his highness  about your friend valker hes arrested for two hundred poundsh  eglantine at this could contain no more but told his story of how he had been induced to accept three hundred pounds of panama stock for his account against walker and cursed his stars for his folly vell youve only to bring in another bill said the younger perfumer swear he owes you a hundred and fifty pounds and well have a writ out against him this afternoon  and so a second writ was taken out against captain walker  youll have his wife here very likely in a day or two said mr mossrose to his partner them chaps always sends their wives and i hope you know how to deal with her  i dont value her a figs hend said eglantine ill treat her like the dust of the hearth after that womans conduct to me i should like to see her have the haudacity to come here and if she does youll see how ill serve her  the worthy perfumer was in fact resolved to be exceedingly hardhearted in his behaviour towards his old love and acted over at night in bed the scene which was to occur when the meeting should take place oh thought he but it will be a grand thing to see the proud morgiana on her knees to me and me apointing to the door and saying madam youve steeled this eart against you you havebury the recollection of old times of those old times when i thought my eart would have broke but it didntno earts are made of sterner stuff i didnt die as i thought i should i stood it and live to see the woman i despised at my feetha ha at my feet  in the midst of these thoughts mr eglantine fell asleep but it was evident that the idea of seeing morgiana once more agitated him considerably else why should he have been at the pains of preparing so much heroism his sleep was exceedingly fitful and troubled he saw morgiana in a hundred shapes he dreamed that he was dressing her hair that he was riding with her to richmond that the horse turned into a dragon and morgiana into woolsey who took him by the throat and choked him while the dragon played the keybugle and in the morning when mossrose was gone to his business in the city and he sat reading the morning post in his study ah what a thump his heart gave as the lady of his dreams actually stood before him  many a lady who purchased brushes at eglantines shop would have given ten guineas for such a colour as his when he saw her his heart beat violently he was almost choking in his stays he had been prepared for the visit but his courage failed him now it had come they were both silent for some minutes  you know what i am come for at last said morgiana from under her veil but she put it aside as she spoke  ithat isyesits a painful affair mem he said giving one look at her pale face and then turning away in a flurry i beg to refer you to blunt hone and sharpus my lawyers mem he added collecting himself  i didnt expect this from you mr eglantine said the lady and began to sob  and after whats appened i didnt expect a visit from you mem i thought mrs capting walker was too great a dame to visit poor harchibald eglantine though some of the first men in the country do visit him is there anything in which i can oblige you mem  o heavens cried the poor woman have i no friend left i never thought that you too would have deserted me mr archibald  the archibald pronounced in the old way had evidently an effect on the perfumer he winced and looked at her very eagerly for a moment what can i do for you mem at last said he  what is this bill against mr walker for which he is now in prison  perfumery supplied for five years that man used more airbrushes than any duke in the land and as for eaudecologne he must have bathed himself in it he hordered me about like a lord he never paid me one shillinghe stabbed me in my most vital partbut ah ah never mind that and i said i would be revenged and i am  the perfumer was quite in a rage again by this time and wiped his fat face with his pockethandkerchief and glared upon mrs walker with a most determined air  revenged on whom archibaldmr eglantine revenged on meon a poor woman whom you made miserable you would not have done so once  ha and a precious way you treated me once said eglantine dont talk to me mem of once bury the recollection of once for hever i thought my eart would have broke once but no earts are made of sterner stuff i didnt die as i thought i should i stood itand i live to see the woman who despised me at my feet  oh archibald was all the lady could say and she fell to sobbing again it was perhaps her best argument with the perfumer  oh harchibald indeed continued he beginning to swell dont call me harchibald morgiana think what a position you might have held if youd chose when whenyou might have called me harchibald now its no use added he with harrowing pathos but though ive been wronged i cant bear to see women in tearstell me what i can do  dear good mr eglantine send to your lawyers and stop this horrid prosecutiontake mr walkers acknowledgment for the debt if he is free he is sure to have a very large sum of money in a few days and will pay you all do not ruin himdo not ruin me by persisting now be the old kind eglantine you were  eglantine took a hand which morgiana did not refuse he thought about old times he had known her since childhood almost as a girl he dandled her on his knee at the kidneys as a woman he had adored herhis heart was melted  he did pay me in a sort of way reasoned the perfumer with himselfthese bonds though they are not worth much i took em for better or for worse and i cant bear to see her crying and to trample on a woman in distress morgiana he added in a loud cheerful voice cheer up ill give you a release for your husband i will be the old kind eglantine i was  be the old kind jackass you vash here roared a voice that made mr eglantine start vy vat an old fat fool you are eglantine to give up our just debts because a voman comes snivelling and crying to youand such a voman too exclaimed mr mossrose for his was the voice  such a woman sir cried the senior partner  yes such a womanvy didnt she jilt you herselfhasnt she been trying the same game with baroski and are you so green as to give up a hundred and fifty pounds because she takes a fancy to come vimpering here i wont i can tell you the moneys as much mine as it is yours and ill have it or keep walkers body thats what i will  at the presence of his partner the timid good genius of eglantine which had prompted him to mercy and kindness at once outspread its frightened wings and flew away  you see how it is mrs w said he looking down its an affair of businessin all these here affairs of business mr mossrose is the managing man aint you mr mossrose  a pretty business it would be if i wasnt replied mossrose doggedly come maam says he ill tell you vat i do i take fifty per shent not a farthing lessgive me that and out your husband goes  oh sir howard will pay you in a week  vell den let him stop at my uncle bendigos for a week and come out denhes very comfortable there said shylock with a grin hadnt you better go to the shop mr eglantine continued he and look after your business mrs walker cant want you to listen to her all day  eglantine was glad of the excuse and slunk out of the studio not into the shop but into his parlour where he drank off a great glass of maraschino and sat blushing and exceedingly agitated until mossrose came to tell him that mrs w was gone and wouldnt trouble him any more but although he drank several more glasses of maraschino and went to the play that night and to the cidercellars afterwards neither the liquor nor the play nor the delightful comic songs at the cellars could drive mrs walker out of his head and the memory of old times and the image of her pale weeping face  morgiana tottered out of the shop scarcely heeding the voice of mr mossrose who said ill take forty per shent and went back to his duty cursing himself for a softhearted fool for giving up so much of his rights to a puling woman morgiana i say tottered out of the shop and went up conduit street weeping weeping with all her eyes she was quite faint for she had taken nothing that morning but the glass of water which the pastrycook in the strand had given her and was forced to take hold of the railings of a house for support just as a little gentleman with a yellow handkerchief under his arm was issuing from the door  good heavens mrs walker said the gentleman it was no other than mr woolsey who was going forth to try a bodycoat for a customer are you illwhats the matterfor gods sake come in and he took her arm under his and led her into his backparlour and seated her and had some wine and water before her in one minute before she had said one single word regarding herself  as soon as she was somewhat recovered and with the interruption of a thousand sobs the poor thing told as well as she could her little story mr eglantine had arrested mr walker she had been trying to gain time for him eglantine had refused  the hardhearted cowardly brute to refuse her anything said loyal mr woolsey my dear says he ive no reason to love your husband and i know too much about him to respect him but i love and respect you and will spend my last shilling to serve you at which morgiana could only take his hand and cry a great deal more than ever she said mr walker would have a great deal of money in a week that he was the best of husbands and she was sure mr woolsey would think better of him when he knew him that mr eglantines bill was one hundred and fifty pounds but that mr mossrose would take forty per cent if mr woolsey could say how much that was  ill pay a thousand pound to do you good said mr woolsey bouncing up stay here for ten minutes my dear until my return and all shall be right as you will see he was back in ten minutes and had called a cab from the stand opposite all the coachmen there had seen and commented on mrs walkers woebegone looks and they were off for cursitor street in a moment theyll settle the whole debt for twenty pounds said he and showed an order to that effect from mr mossrose to mr bendigo empowering the latter to release walker on receiving mr woolseys acknowledgment for the above sum  theres no use paying it said mr walker doggedly it would only be robbing you mr woolseyseven more detainers have come in while my wife has been away i must go through the court now but he added in a whisper to the tailor my good sir my debts of honour are sacred and if you will have the goodness to lend me the twenty pounds i pledge you my word as a gentleman to return it when i come out of quod  it is probable that mr woolsey declined this for as soon as he was gone walker in a tremendous fury began cursing his wife for dawdling three hours on the road why the deuce maam didnt you take a cab roared he when he heard she had walked to bond street those writs have only been in half an hour and i might have been off but for you  oh howard said she didnt you takedidnt i give you mymy last shilling and fell back and wept again more bitterly than ever  well love said her amiable husband turning rather red never mind it wasnt your fault it is but going through the court it is no great odds i forgive you    chapter vi in which mr walker still remains in difficulties but shows great resignation under his misfortunes  the exemplary walker seeing that escape from his enemies was hopeless and that it was his duty as a man to turn on them and face them now determined to quit the splendid though narrow lodgings which mr bendigo had provided for him and undergo the martyrdom of the fleet accordingly in company with that gentleman he came over to her majestys prison and gave himself into the custody of the officers there and did not apply for the accommodation of the rules by which in those days the captivity of some debtors was considerably lightened because he knew perfectly well that there was no person in the wide world who would give a security for the heavy sums for which walker was answerable what these sums were is no matter and on this head we do not think it at all necessary to satisfy the curiosity of the reader he may have owed hundredsthousands his creditors only can tell he paid the dividend which has been formerly mentioned and showed thereby his desire to satisfy all claims upon him to the uttermost farthing  as for the little house in connaught square when after quitting her husband morgiana drove back thither the door was opened by the page who instantly thanked her to pay his wages and in the drawingroom on a yellow satin sofa sat a seedy man with a pot of porter beside him placed on an album for fear of staining the rosewood table and the seedy man signified that he had taken possession of the furniture in execution for a judgment debt another seedy man was in the diningroom reading a newspaper and drinking gin he informed mrs walker that he was the representative of another judgment debt and of another executiontheres another on em in the kitchen said the page taking an inwentory of the furniture and he swears hell have you took up for swindling for pawning the plate  sir said mr woolsey for that worthy man had conducted morgiana homesir said he shaking his stick at the young page if you give any more of your impudence ill beat every button off your jacket and as there were some four hundred of these ornaments the page was silent it was a great mercy for morgiana that the honest and faithful tailor had accompanied her the good fellow had waited very patiently for her for an hour in the parlour or coffeeroom of the lockup house knowing full well that she would want a protector on her way homewards and his kindness will be more appreciated when it is stated that during the time of his delay in the coffeeroom he had been subject to the entreaties nay to the insults of cornet fipkin of the blues who was in prison at the suit of linsey woolsey and co and who happened to be taking his breakfast in the apartment when his obdurate creditor entered it the cornet a hero of eighteen who stood at least five feet three in his boots and owed fifteen thousand pounds was so enraged at the obduracy of his creditor that he said he would have thrown him out of the window but for the bars which guarded it and entertained serious thoughts of knocking the tailors head off but that the latter putting his right leg forward and his fists in a proper attitude told the young officer to come on on which the cornet cursed the tailor for a snob and went back to his breakfast  the execution people having taken charge of mr walkers house mrs walker was driven to take refuge with her mamma near sadlers wells and the captain remained comfortably lodged in the fleet he had some ready money and with it managed to make his existence exceedingly comfortable he lived with the best society of the place consisting of several distinguished young noblemen and gentlemen he spent the morning playing at fives and smoking cigars the evening smoking cigars and dining comfortably cards came after dinner and as the captain was an experienced player and near a score of years older than most of his friends he was generally pretty successful indeed if he had received all the money that was owed to him he might have come out of prison and paid his creditors twenty shillings in the poundthat is if he had been minded to do so but there is no use in examining into that point too closely for the fact is young fipkin only paid him forty pounds out of seven hundred for which he gave him ious algernon deuceace not only did not pay him three hundred and twenty which he lost at blind hookey but actually borrowed seven and sixpence in money from walker which has never been repaid to this day and lord doublequits actually lost nineteen thousand pounds to him at heads and tails which he never paid pleading drunkenness and his minority the reader may recollect a paragraph which went the round of the papers entitled  affair of honour in the fleet prisonyesterday morning behind the pump in the second court lord dblquts and captain hwrd wlkr a near relative we understand of his grace the duke of nrflk had a hostile meeting and exchanged two shots these two young sprigs of nobility were attended to the ground by major flush who by the way is flush no longer and captain pam late of the  dragoons play is said to have been the cause of the quarrel and the gallant captain is reported to have handled the noble lords nose rather roughly at one stage of the transactions  when morgiana at sadlers wells heard these news she was ready to faint with terror and rushed to the fleet prison and embraced her lord and master with her usual expansion and fits of tears very much to that gentlemans annoyance who happened to be in company with pain and flush at the time and did not care that his handsome wife should be seen too much in the dubious precincts of the fleet he had at least so much shame about him and had always rejected her entreaties to be allowed to inhabit the prison with him  it is enough would he say casting his eyes heavenward and with a most lugubrious countenanceit is enough morgiana that i should suffer even though your thoughtlessness has been the cause of my ruin but enough of that i will not rebuke you for faults for which i know you are now repentant and i never could bear to see you in the midst of the miseries of this horrible place remain at home with your mother and let me drag on the weary days here alone if you can get me any more of that pale sherry my love do i require something to cheer me in solitude and have found my chest very much relieved by that wine put more pepper and eggs my dear into the next vealpie you make me i cant eat the horrible messes in the coffeeroom here  it was walkers wish i cant tell why except that it is the wish of a great number of other persons in this strange world to make his wife believe that he was wretched in mind and ill in health and all assertions to this effect the simple creature received with numberless tears of credulity she would go home to mrs crump and say how her darling howard was pining away how he was ruined for her and with what angelic sweetness he bore his captivity the fact is he bore it with so much resignation that no other person in the world could see that he was unhappy his life was undisturbed by duns his day was his own from morning till night his diet was good his acquaintances jovial his purse tolerably well supplied and he had not one single care to annoy him  mrs crump and woolsey perhaps received morgianas account of her husbands miseries with some incredulity the latter was now a daily visitor to sadlers wells his love for morgiana had become a warm fatherly generous regard for her it was out of the honest fellows cellar that the wine used to come which did so much good to mr walkers chest and he tried a thousand ways to make morgiana happy  a very happy day indeed it was when returning from her visit to the fleet she found in her mothers sittingroom her dear grand rosewood piano and every one of her musicbooks which the kindhearted tailor had purchased at the sale of walkers effects and i am not ashamed to say that morgiana herself was so charmed that when as usual mr woolsey came to drink tea in the evening she actually gave him a kiss which frightened mr woolsey and made him blush exceedingly she sat down and played him that evening every one of the songs which he likedthe old songsnone of your italian stuff podmore the old musicmaster was there too and was delighted and astonished at the progress in singing which morgiana had made and when the little party separated he took mr woolsey by the hand and said give me leave to tell you sir that youre a trump  that he is said canterfield the first tragic an honour to human nature a man whose hand is open as day to melting charity and whose heart ever melts at the tale of womans distress  pooh pooh stuff and nonsense sir said the tailor but upon my word mr canterfields words were perfectly correct i wish as much could be said in favour of woolseys old rival mr eglantine who attended the sale too but it was with a horrid kind of satisfaction at the thought that walker was ruined he bought the yellow satin sofa before mentioned and transferred it to what he calls his sittingroom where it is to this day bearing many marks of the best bears grease woolsey bid against baroski for the piano very nearly up to the actual value of the instrument when the artist withdrew from competition and when he was sneering at the ruin of mr walker the tailor sternly interrupted him by saying what the deuce are you sneering at you did it sir and youre paid every shilling of your claim aint you on which baroski turned round to miss larkins and said mr woolsey was a snop the very word though pronounced somewhat differently which the gallant cornet fipkin had applied to him  well so he was a snob but vulgar as he was i declare for my part that i have a greater respect for mr woolsey than for any single nobleman or gentleman mentioned in this true history  it will be seen from the names of messrs canterfield and podmore that morgiana was again in the midst of the widow crumps favourite theatrical society and this indeed was the case the widows little room was hung round with the pictures which were mentioned at the commencement of the story as decorating the bar of the bootjack and several times in a week she received her friends from the wells and entertained them with such humble refreshments of tea and crumpets as her modest means permitted her to purchase among these persons morgiana lived and sang quite as contentedly as she had ever done among the demireps of her husbands society and only she did not dare to own it to herself was a great deal happier than she had been for many a day mrs captain walker was still a great lady amongst them even in his ruin walker the director of three companies and the owner of the splendid ponychaise was to these simple persons an awful character and when mentioned they talked with a great deal of gravity of his being in the country and hoped mrs captain w had good news of him they all knew he was in the fleet but had he not in prison fought a duel with a viscount montmorency of the norfolk circuit was in the fleet too and when canterfield went to see poor montey the latter had pointed out walker to his friend who actually hit lord george tennison across the shoulders in play with a racketbat which event was soon made known to the whole greenroom  they had me up one day said montmorency to sing a comic song and give my recitations and we had champagne and lobstersalad such nobs added the player billingsgate and vauxhall were there too and left college at eight oclock  when morgiana was told of the circumstance by her mother she hoped her dear howard had enjoyed the evening and was thankful that for once he could forget his sorrows nor somehow was she ashamed of herself for being happy afterwards but gave way to her natural goodhumour without repentance or selfrebuke i believe indeed alas why are we made acquainted with the same fact regarding ourselves long after it is past and gonei believe these were the happiest days of morgianas whole life she had no cares except the pleasant one of attending on her husband an easy smiling temperament which made her regardless of tomorrow and add to this a delightful hope relative to a certain interesting event which was about to occur and which i shall not particularise further than by saying that she was cautioned against too much singing by mr squills her medical attendant and that widow crump was busy making up a vast number of little caps and diminutive cambric shirts such as delighted grandmothers are in the habit of fashioning i hope this is as genteel a way of signifying the circumstance which was about to take place in the walker family as miss prim herself could desire mrs walkers mother was about to become a grandmother theres a phrase the morning post which says this story is vulgar im sure cannot quarrel with that i dont believe the whole court guide would convey an intimation more delicately  well mrs crumps little grandchild was born entirely to the dissatisfaction i must say of his father who when the infant was brought to him in the fleet had him abruptly covered up in his cloak again from which he had been removed by the jealous prison doorkeepers why do you think walker had a quarrel with one of them and the wretch persisted in believing that the bundle mrs crump was bringing to her soninlaw was a bundle of disguised brandy  the brutes said the lady and the fathers a brute too said she he takes no more notice of me than if i was a kitchenmaid and of woolsey than if he was a leg of muttonthe dear blessed little cherub  mrs crump was a motherinlaw let us pardon her hatred of her daughters husband  the woolsey compared in the above sentence both to a leg of mutton and a cherub was not the eminent member of the firm of linsey woolsey and co but the little baby who was christened howard woolsey walker with the full consent of the father who said the tailor was a deuced good fellow and felt really obliged to him for the sherry for a frockcoat which he let him have in prison and for his kindness to morgiana the tailor loved the little boy with all his soul he attended his mother to her churching and the child to the font and as a present to his little godson on his christening he sent two yards of the finest white kerseymere in his shop to make him a cloak the duke had had a pair of inexpressibles off that very piece  housefurniture is bought and sold musiclessons are given children are born and christened ladies are confined and churchedtime in other words passesand yet captain walker still remains in prison does it not seem strange that he should still languish there between palisaded walls near fleet market and that he should not be restored to that active and fashionable world of which he was an ornament the fact is the captain had been before the court for the examination of his debts and the commissioner with a cruelty quite shameful towards a fallen man had qualified his ways of getting money in most severe language and had sent him back to prison again for the space of nine calendar months an indefinite period and until his accounts could be made up this delay walker bore like a philosopher and far from repining was still the gayest fellow of the tenniscourt and the soul of the midnight carouse  there is no use in raking up old stories and hunting through files of dead newspapers to know what were the specific acts which made the commissioner so angry with captain walker many a rogue has come before the court and passed through it since then and i would lay a wager that howard walker was not a bit worse than his neighbours but as he was not a lord and as he had no friends on coming out of prison and had settled no money on his wife and had as it must be confessed an exceedingly bad character it is not likely that the latter would be forgiven him when once more free in the world for instance when doublequits left the fleet he was received with open arms by his family and had twoandthirty horses in his stables before a week was over pam of the dragoons came out and instantly got a place as government couriera place found so good of late years and no wonder it is better pay than that of a colonel that our noblemen and gentry eagerly press for it frank hurricane was sent out as registrar of tobago or sago or ticonderago in fact for a younger son of good family it is rather advantageous to get into debt twenty or thirty thousand pounds you are sure of a good place afterwards in the colonies your friends are so anxious to get rid of you that they will move heaven and earth to serve you and so all the above companions of misfortune with walker were speedily made comfortable but he had no rich parents his old father was dead in york jail how was he to start in the world again what friendly hand was there to fill his pocket with gold and his cup with sparkling champagne he was in fact an object of the greatest pityfor i know of no greater than a gentleman of his habits without the means of gratifying them he must live well and he has not the means is there a more pathetic case as for a mere low beggarsome labourless labourer or some weaver out of placedont let us throw away our compassion upon them psha theyre accustomed to starve they can sleep upon boards or dine off a crust whereas a gentleman would die in the same situation i think this was poor morgianas way of reasoning for walkers cash in prison beginning presently to run low and knowing quite well that the dear fellow could not exist there without the luxuries to which he had been accustomed she borrowed money from her mother until the poor old lady was a sec she even confessed with tears to woolsey that she was in particular want of twenty pounds to pay a poor milliner whose debt she could not bear to put in her husbands schedule and i need not say she carried the money to her husband who might have been greatly benefited by itonly he had a bad run of luck at the cards and how the deuce can a man help that  woolsey had repurchased for her one of the cashmere shawls she left it behind her one day at the fleet prison and some rascal stole it there having the grace however to send woolsey the ticket signifying the place where it had been pawned who could the scoundrel have been woolsey swore a great oath and fancied he knew but if it was walker himself as woolsey fancied and probably as was the case who made away with the shawl being pressed thereto by necessity was it fair to call him a scoundrel for so doing and should we not rather laud the delicacy of his proceeding he was poor who can command the cards but he did not wish his wife should know how poor he could not bear that she should suppose him arrived at the necessity of pawning a shawl  she who had such beautiful ringlets of a sudden pleaded cold in the head and took to wearing caps one summer evening as she and the baby and mrs crump and woolsey let us say all four babies together were laughing and playing in mrs crumps drawingroomplaying the most absurd gambols fat mrs crump for instance hiding behind the sofa woolsey chuckchucking cockadoodledooing and performing those indescribable freaks which gentlemen with philoprogenitive organs will execute in the company of childrenin the midst of their play the baby gave a tug at his mothers cap off it cameher hair was cut close to her head  morgiana turned as red as sealingwax and trembled very much mrs crump screamed my child where is your hair and woolsey bursting out with a most tremendous oath against walker that would send miss prim into convulsions put his handkerchief to his face and actually wept the infernal bubbleubbleackguard said he roaring and clenching his fists  as he had passed the bower of bloom a few days before he saw mossrose who was combing out a jetblack ringlet and held it up as if for woolseys examination with a peculiar grin the tailor did not understand the joke but he saw now what had happened morgiana had sold her hair for five guineas she would have sold her arm had her husband bidden her on looking in her drawers it was found she had sold almost all her wearing apparel the childs clothes were all there however it was because her husband talked of disposing of a gilt coral that the child had that she had parted with the locks which had formed her pride  ill give you twenty guineas for that hair you infamous fat coward roared the little tailor to eglantine that evening give it up or ill kill you  mr mossrose mr mossrose shouted the perfumer  vell vatsh de matter vatsh de row fight avay my boys two to one on the tailor said mr mossrose much enjoying the sport for woolsey striding through the shop without speaking to him had rushed into the studio where he plumped upon eglantine  tell him about that hair sir  that hair now keep yourself quiet mister timble and dont tink for to bully me you mean mrs valkers air vy she sold it me  and the more blackguard you for buying it will you take twenty guineas for it  no said mossrose  twentyfive  cant said mossrose  hang it will you take forty there  i vish id kep it said the hebrew gentleman with unfeigned regret eglantine dressed it this very night  for countess baldenstiern the swedish hambassadors lady says eglantine his hebrew partner was by no means a favourite with the ladies and only superintended the accounts of the concern its this very night at devonshire ouse with four hostrich plumes lappets and trimmings and now mr woolsey ill trouble you to apologise  mr woolsey did not answer but walked up to mr eglantine and snapped his fingers so close under the perfumers nose that the latter started back and seized the bellrope mossrose burst out laughing and the tailor walked majestically from the shop with both hands stuck between the lappets of his coat  my dear said he to morgiana a short time afterwards you must not encourage that husband of yours in his extravagance and sell the clothes off your poor back that he may feast and act the fine gentleman in prison  it is his health poor dear soul interposed mrs walker his chest every farthing of the money goes to the doctors poor fellow  well now listen i am a rich man it was a great fib for woolseys income as a junior partner of the firm was but a small one i can very well afford to make him an allowance while he is in the fleet and have written to him to say so but if you ever give him a penny or sell a trinket belonging to you upon my word and honour i will withdraw the allowance and though it would go to my heart ill never see you again you wouldnt make me unhappy would you  id go on my knees to serve you and heaven bless you said the wife  well then you must give me this promise and she did and now said he your mother and podmore and i have been talking over matters and weve agreed that you may make a very good income for yourself though to be sure i wish it could have been managed any other way but needs must you know youre the finest singer in the universe  la said morgiana highly delighted  i never heard anything like you though im no judge podmore says he is sure you will do very well and has no doubt you might get very good engagements at concerts or on the stage and as that husband will never do any good and you have a child to support sing you must  oh how glad i should be to pay his debts and repay all he has done for me cried mrs walker think of his giving two hundred guineas to mr baroski to have me taught was not that kind of him do you really think i should succeed  theres miss larkins has succeeded  the little highshouldered vulgar thing says morgiana im sure i ought to succeed if she did  she sing against morgiana said mrs crump id like to see her indeed she aint fit to snuff a candle to her  i dare say not said the tailor though i dont understand the thing myself but if morgiana can make a fortune why shouldnt she  heaven knows we want it woolsey cried mrs crump and to see her on the stage was always the wish of my heart and so it had formerly been the wish of morgiana and now with the hope of helping her husband and child the wish became a duty and she fell to practising once more from morning till night  one of the most generous of men and tailors who ever lived now promised if further instruction should be considered necessary though that he could hardly believe possible that he would lend morgiana any sum required for the payment of lessons and accordingly she once more betook herself under podmores advice to the singing school baroskis academy was after the passages between them out of the question and she placed herself under the instruction of the excellent english composer sir george thrum whose large and awful wife lady thrum dragon of virtue and propriety kept watch over the master and the pupils and was the sternest guardian of female virtue on or off any stage  morgiana came at a propitious moment baroski had launched miss larkins under the name of ligonier the ligonier was enjoying considerable success and was singing classical music to tolerable audiences whereas miss butts sir georges last pupil had turned out a complete failure and the rival house was only able to make a faint opposition to the new star with miss mwhirter who though an old favourite had lost her upper notes and her front teeth and the fact was drew no longer  directly sir george heard mrs walker he tapped podmore who accompanied her on the waistcoat and said poddy thank you well cut the orange boys throat with that voice it was by the familiar title of orange boy that the great baroski was known among his opponents  well crush him podmore said lady thrum in her deep hollow voice you may stop and dine and podmore stayed to dinner and ate cold mutton and drank marsala with the greatest reverence for the great english composer the very next day lady thrum hired a pair of horses and paid a visit to mrs crump and her daughter at sadlers wells  all these things were kept profoundly secret from walker who received very magnanimously the allowance of two guineas a week which woolsey made him and with the aid of the few shillings his wife could bring him managed to exist as best he might he did not dislike gin when he could get no claret and the former liquor under the name of tape used to be measured out pretty liberally in what was formerly her majestys prison of the fleet  morgiana pursued her studies under thrum and we shall hear in the next chapter how it was she changed her name to ravenswing    chapter vii in which morgiana advances towards fame and honour and in which several great literary characters make their appearance  we must begin my dear madam said sir george thrum by unlearning all that mr baroski of whom i do not wish to speak with the slightest disrespect has taught you  morgiana knew that every professor says as much and submitted to undergo the study requisite for sir georges system with perfect good grace au fond as i was given to understand the methods of the two artists were pretty similar but as there was rivalry between them and continual desertion of scholars from one school to another it was fair for each to take all the credit he could get in the success of any pupil if a pupil failed for instance thrum would say baroski had spoiled her irretrievably while the german would regret dat dat yong voman who had a good organ should have trown away her dime wid dat old drum when one of these deserters succeeded yes yes would either professor cry i formed her she owes her fortune to me both of them thus in future days claimed the education of the famous ravenswing and even sir george thrum though he wished to ecraser the ligonier pretended that her present success was his work because once she had been brought by her mother mrs larkins to sing for sir georges approval  when the two professors met it was with the most delighted cordiality on the part of both mein lieber herr thrum would say with some malice your sonata in x flat is divine chevalier baroski would reply dat andante movement in w is worthy of beethoven i gif you my sacred honour and so forth in fact they loved each other as gentlemen in their profession always do  the two famous professors conduct their academies on very opposite principles baroski writes ballet music thrum on the contrary says he cannot but deplore the dangerous fascinations of the dance and writes more for exeter hall and birmingham while baroski drives a cab in the park with a very suspicious mademoiselle leocadie or amenaide by his side you may see thrum walking to evening church with his lady and hymns are sung there of his own composition he belongs to the athenaeum club he goes to the levee once a year he does everything that a respectable man should and if by the means of this respectability he manages to make his little trade far more profitable than it otherwise would be are we to quarrel with him for it  sir george in fact had every reason to be respectable he had been a choirboy at windsor had played to the old kings violoncello had been intimate with him and had received knighthood at the hand of his revered sovereign he had a snuffbox which his majesty gave him and portraits of him and the young princes all over the house he had also a foreign order no other indeed than the elephant and castle of kalbsbratenpumpernickel conferred upon him by the grand duke when here with the allied sovereigns in 1814 with this ribbon round his neck on gala days and in a white waistcoat the old gentleman looked splendid as he moved along in a blue coat with the windsor button and neat black smallclothes and silk stockings he lived in an old tall dingy house furnished in the reign of george iii his beloved master and not much more cheerful now than a family vault they are awfully funereal those ornaments of the close of the last centurytall gloomy horsehair chairs mouldy turkey carpets with wretched druggets to guard them little cracked stickingplaster miniatures of people in tours and pigtails over highshouldered mantelpieces two dismal urns on each side of a lanky sideboard and in the midst a queer twisted receptacle for wornout knives with green handles under the sideboard stands a cellaret that looks as if it held half a bottle of currant wine and a shivering platewarmer that never could get any comfort out of the wretched old cramped grate yonder dont you know in such houses the grey gloom that hangs over the stairs the dullcoloured old carpet that winds its way up the same growing thinner duller and more threadbare as it mounts to the bedroom floors there is something awful in the bedroom of a respectable old couple of sixtyfive think of the old feathers turbans bugles petticoats pomatumpots spencers white satin shoes false fronts the old flaccid boneless stays tied up in faded riband the dusky fans the old fortyyearsold baby linen the letters of sir george when he was young the doll of poor maria who died in 1803 fredericks first corduroy breeches and the newspaper which contains the account of his distinguishing himself at the siege of seringapatam all these lie somewhere damp and squeezed down into glum old presses and wardrobes at that glass the wife has sat many times these fifty years in that old morocco bed her children were born where are they now fred the brave captain and charles the saucy colleger there hangs a drawing of him done by mr beechey and that sketch by cosway was the very likeness of louisa before  mr fitzboodle for heavens sake come down what are you doing in a ladys bedroom  the fact is madam i had no business there in life but having had quite enough wine with sir george my thoughts had wandered upstairs into the sanctuary of female excellence where your ladyship nightly reposes you do not sleep so well now as in old days though there is no patter of little steps to wake you overhead  they call that room the nursery still and the little wicket still hangs at the upper stairs it has been there for forty yearsbon dieu cant you see the ghosts of little faces peering over it i wonder whether they get up in the night as the moonlight shines into the blank vacant old room and play there solemnly with little ghostly horses and the spirits of dolls and tops that turn and turn but dont hum  once more sir come down to the lower storeythat is to the morgiana storywith which the above sentences have no more to do than this mornings leading article in the times only it was at this house of sir george thrums that i met morgiana sir george in old days had instructed some of the female members of our family and i recollect cutting my fingers as a child with one of those attenuated greenhandled knives in the queer box yonder  in those days sir george thrum was the first great musical teacher of london and the royal patronage brought him a great number of fashionable pupils of whom lady fitzboodle was one it was a long long time ago in fact sir george thrum was old enough to remember persons who had been present at mr brahams first appearance and the old gentlemans days of triumph had been those of billington and incledon catalani and madame storace  he was the author of several operas the camel driver britons alarmed or the siege of bergenopzoom etc etc and of course of songs which had considerable success in their day but are forgotten now and are as much faded and out of fashion as those old carpets which we have described in the professors house and which were doubtless very brilliant once but such is the fate of carpets of flowers of music of men and of the most admirable novelseven this story will not be alive for many centuries well well why struggle against fate  but though his heyday of fashion was gone sir george still held his place among the musicians of the old school conducted occasionally at the ancient concerts and the philharmonic and his glees are still favourites after public dinners and are sung by those old bacchanalians in chestnut wigs who attend for the purpose of amusing the guests on such occasions of festivity the great old people at the gloomy old concerts before mentioned always pay sir george marked respect and indeed from the old gentlemans peculiar behaviour to his superiors it is impossible they should not be delighted with him so he leads at almost every one of the concerts in the oldfashioned houses in town  becomingly obsequious to his superiors he is with the rest of the world properly majestic and has obtained no small success by his admirable and undeviating respectability respectability has been his great card through life ladies can trust their daughters at sir george thrums academy a good musician madam says he to the mother of a new pupil should not only have a fine ear a good voice and an indomitable industry but above all a faultless characterfaultless that is as far as our poor nature will permit and you will remark that those young persons with whom your lovely daughter miss smith will pursue her musical studies are all in a moral point of view as spotless as that charming young lady how should it be otherwise i have been myself the father of a family i have been honoured with the intimacy of the wisest and best of kings my late sovereign george iii and i can proudly show an example of decorum to my pupils in my sophia mrs smith i have the honour of introducing to you my lady thrum  the old lady would rise at this and make a gigantic curtsey such a one as had begun the minuet at ranelagh fifty years ago and the introduction ended mrs smith would retire after having seen the portraits of the princes his late majestys snuffbox and a piece of music which he used to play noted by himselfmrs smith i say would drive back to baker street delighted to think that her frederica had secured so eligible and respectable a master i forgot to say that during the interview between mrs smith and sir george the latter would be called out of his study by his black servant and my lady thrum would take that opportunity of mentioning when he was knighted and how he got his foreign order and deploring the sad condition of other musical professors and the dreadful immorality which sometimes arose in consequence of their laxness sir george was a good deal engaged to dinners in the season and if invited to dine with a nobleman as he might possibly be on the day when mrs smith requested the honour of his company he would write back that he should have had the sincerest happiness in waiting upon mrs smith in baker street if previously my lord tweedledale had not been so kind as to engage him this letter of course shown by mrs smith to her friends was received by them with proper respect and thus in spite of age and new fashions sir george still reigned preeminent for a mile round cavendish square by the young pupils of the academy he was called sir charles grandison and indeed fully deserved this title on account of the indomitable respectability of his whole actions  it was under this gentleman that morgiana made her debut in public life i do not know what arrangements may have been made between sir george thrum and his pupil regarding the profits which were to accrue to the former from engagements procured by him for the latter but there was no doubt an understanding between them for sir george respectable as he was had the reputation of being extremely clever at a bargain and lady thrum herself in her great hightragedy way could purchase a pair of soles or select a leg of mutton with the best housekeeper in london  when however morgiana had been for some six months under his tuition he began for some reason or other to be exceedingly hospitable and invited his friends to numerous entertainments at one of which as i have said i had the pleasure of meeting mrs walker  although the worthy musicians dinners were not good the old knight had some excellent wine in his cellar and his arrangement of his party deserves to be commended  for instance he meets me and bob fitzurse in pall mall at whose paternal house he was also a visitor my dear young gentlemen says he will you come and dine with a poor musical composer i have some comet hock and what is more curious to you perhaps as men of wit one or two of the great literary characters of london whom you would like to seequite curiosities my dear young friends and we agreed to go  to the literary men he says i have a little quiet party at home lord roundtowers the honourable mr fitzurse of the life guards and a few more can you tear yourself away from the war of wits and take a quiet dinner with a few mere men about town  the literary men instantly purchase new satin stocks and white gloves and are delighted to fancy themselves members of the world of fashion instead of inviting twelve royal academicians or a dozen authors or a dozen men of science to dinner as his grace the duke of  and the right honourable sir robert  are in the habit of doing once a year this plan of fusion is the one they should adopt not invite all artists as they would invite all farmers to a rent dinner but they should have a proper commingling of artists and men of the world there is one of the latter whose name is george savage fitzboodle who but let us return to sir george thrum  fitzurse and i arrive at the dismal old house and are conducted up the staircase by a black servant who shouts out missa fissboodlethe honourable missa fissurse it was evident that lady thrum had instructed the swarthy groom of the chambers for there is nothing particularly honourable in my friend fitzs face that i know of unless an abominable squint may be said to be so lady thrum whose figure is something like that of the shottower opposite waterloo bridge makes a majestic inclination and a speech to signify her pleasure at receiving under her roof two of the children of sir georges best pupils a lady in black velvet is seated by the old fireplace with whom a stout gentleman in an exceedingly light coat and ornamental waistcoat is talking very busily the great star of the night whispers our host mrs walker gentlementhe ravenswing she is talking to the famous mr slang of the  theatre  is she a fine singer says fitzurse shes a very fine woman  my dear young friends you shall hear tonight i who have heard every fine voice in europe confidently pledge my respectability that the ravenswing is equal to them all she has the graces sir of a venus with the mind of a muse she is a siren sir without the dangerous qualities of one she is hallowed sir by her misfortunes as by her genius and i am proud to think that my instructions have been the means of developing the wondrous qualities that were latent within her until now  you dont say so says gobemouche fitzurse  having thus indoctrinated mr fitzurse sir george takes another of his guests and proceeds to work upon him my dear mr bludyer how do you do mr fitzboodle mr bludyer the brilliant and accomplished wit whose sallies in the tomahawk delight us every saturday nay no blushes my dear sir you are very wicked but oh so pleasant well mr bludyer i am glad to see you sir and hope you will have a favourable opinion of our genius sir as i was saying to mr fitzboodle she has the graces of a venus with the mind of a muse she is a siren without the dangerous qualities of one etc this little speech was made to halfadozen persons in the course of the eveningpersons for the most part connected with the public journals or the theatrical world there was mr squinny the editor of the flowers of fashion mr desmond mulligan the poet and reporter for a morning paper and other worthies of their calling for though sir george is a respectable man and as highminded and moral an old gentleman as ever wore kneebuckles he does not neglect the little arts of popularity and can condescend to receive very queer company if need be  for instance at the dinnerparty at which i had the honour of assisting and at which on the right hand of lady thrum sat the oblige nobleman whom the thrums were a great deal too wise to omit the sight of a lord does good to us commoners or why else should we be so anxious to have one in the second place of honour and on her ladyships left hand sat mr slang the manager of one of the theatres a gentleman whom my lady thrum would scarcely but for a great necessitys sake have been induced to invite to her table he had the honour of leading mrs walker to dinner who looked splendid in black velvet and turban full of health and smiles  lord roundtowers is an old gentleman who has been at the theatres five times a week for these fifty years a living dictionary of the stage recollecting every actor and actress who has appeared upon it for half a century he perfectly well remembered miss delancy in morgiana he knew what had become of ali baba and how cassim had left the stage and was now the keeper of a publichouse all this store of knowledge he kept quietly to himself or only delivered in confidence to his next neighbour in the intervals of the banquet which he enjoys prodigiously he lives at an hotel if not invited to dine eats a muttonchop very humbly at his club and finishes his evening after the play at crockfords whither he goes not for the sake of the play but of the supper there he is described in the court guide as of simmers hotel and of roundtowers county cork it is said that the round towers really exist but he has not been in ireland since the rebellion and his property is so hampered with ancestral mortgages and rentcharges and annuities that his income is barely sufficient to provide the modest muttonchop before alluded to he has any time these fifty years lived in the wickedest company in london and is withal as harmless mild goodnatured innocent an old gentleman as can readily be seen  roundy shouts the elegant mr slang across the table with a voice which makes lady thrum shudder tuff a glass of wine  my lord replies meekly mr slang i shall have very much pleasure what shall it be  there is madeira near you my lord says my lady pointing to a tall thin decanter of the fashion of the year  madeira marsala by jove your ladyship means shouts mr slang no no old birds are not caught with chaff thrum old boy lets have some of your comet hock  my lady thrum i believe that is marsala says the knight blushing a little in reply to a question from his sophia ajax the hock to mr slang  im in that yells bludyer from the end of the table my lord ill join you  mr  i beg your pardoni shall be very happy to take wine with you sir  it is mr bludyer the celebrated newspaper writer whispers lady thrum  bludyer bludyer a very clever man i dare say he has a very loud voice and reminds me of brett does your ladyship remember brett who played the fathers at the haymarket in 1802  what an old stupid roundtowers is says slang archly nudging mrs walker in the side hows walker eh  my husband is in the country replied mrs walker hesitatingly  gammon i know where he is law bless youdont blush ive been there myself a dozen times we were talking about quod lady thrum were you ever in college  i was at the commemoration at oxford in 1814 when the sovereigns were there and at cambridge when sir george received his degree of doctor of music  laud laud thats not the college we mean  there is also the college in gower street where my grandson  this is the college in queer street maam haw haw mulligan you divvle in an irish accent a glass of wine with you wine here you waiter whats your name you black nigger possum up a gumtree eh fill him up dere he go imitating the mandingo manner of speaking english  in this agreeable way would mr slang rattle on speedily making himself the centre of the conversation and addressing graceful familiarities to all the gentlemen and ladies round him  it was good to see how the little knight the most moral and calm of men was compelled to receive mr slangs stories and the frightened air with which at the conclusion of one of them he would venture upon a commendatory grin his lady on her part too had been laboriously civil and on the occasion on which i had the honour of meeting this gentleman and mrs walker it was the latter who gave the signal for withdrawing to the lady of the house by saying i think lady thrum it is quite time for us to retire some exquisite joke of mr slangs was the cause of this abrupt disappearance but as they went upstairs to the drawingroom lady thrum took occasion to say my dear in the course of your profession you will have to submit to many such familiarities on the part of persons of low breeding such as i fear mr slang is but let me caution you against giving way to your temper as you did did you not perceive that i never allowed him to see my inward dissatisfaction and i make it a particular point that you should be very civil to him tonight your interestsour interests depend upon it  and are my interests to make me civil to a wretch like that  mrs walker would you wish to give lessons in morality and behaviour to lady thrum said the old lady drawing herself up with great dignity it was evident that she had a very strong desire indeed to conciliate mr slang and hence i have no doubt that sir george was to have a considerable share of morgianas earnings  mr bludyer the famous editor of the tomahawk whose jokes sir george pretended to admire so much sir george who never made a joke in his life was a press bravo of considerable talent and no principle and who to use his own words would back himself for a slashing article against any man in england he would not only write but fight on a pinch was a good scholar and as savage in his manner as with his pen mr squinny is of exactly the opposite school as delicate as milkandwater harmless in his habits fond of the flute when the state of his chest will allow him a great practiser of waltzing and dancing in general and in his journal mildly malicious he never goes beyond the bounds of politeness but manages to insinuate a great deal that is disagreeable to an author in the course of twenty lines of criticism personally he is quite respectable and lives with two maiden aunts at brompton nobody on the contrary knows where mr bludyer lives he has houses of call mysterious taverns where he may be found at particular hours by those who need him and where panting publishers are in the habit of hunting him up for a bottle of wine and a guinea he will write a page of praise or abuse of any man living or on any subject or on any line of politics hang it sir says he pay me enough and i will write down my own father according to the state of his credit he is dressed either almost in rags or else in the extremest flush of the fashion with the latter attire he puts on a haughty and aristocratic air and would slap a duke on the shoulder if there is one thing more dangerous than to refuse to lend him a sum of money when he asks for it it is to lend it to him for he never pays and never pardons a man to whom he owes walker refused to cash a bill for me he had been heard to say and ill do for his wife when she comes out on the stage mrs walker and sir george thrum were in an agony about the tomahawk hence the latters invitation to mr bludyer sir george was in a great tremor about the flowers of fashion hence his invitation to mr squinny mr squinny was introduced to lord roundtowers and mr fitzurse as one of the most delightful and talented of our young men of genius and fitz who believes everything anyone tells him was quite pleased to have the honour of sitting near the live editor of a paper i have reason to think that mr squinny himself was no less delighted i saw him giving his card to fitzurse at the end of the second course  no particular attention was paid to mr desmond mulligan political enthusiasm is his forte he lives and writes in a rapture he is of course a member of an inn of court and greatly addicted to afterdinner speaking as a preparation for the bar where as a young man of genius he hopes one day to shine he is almost the only man to whom bludyer is civil for if the latter will fight doggedly when there is a necessity for so doing the former fights like an irishman and has a pleasure in it he has been on the ground i dont know how many times and quitted his country on account of a quarrel with government regarding certain articles published by him in the phoenix newspaper with the third bottle he becomes overpoweringly great on the wrongs of ireland and at that period generally volunteers a couple or more of irish melodies selecting the most melancholy in the collection at five in the afternoon you are sure to see him about the house of commons and he knows the reform club he calls it the refawrum as well as if he were a member it is curious for the contemplative mind to mark those mysterious hangerson of irish members of parliamentstrange runners and aidesdecamp which all the honourable gentlemen appear to possess desmond in his political capacity is one of these and besides his calling as reporter to a newspaper is our wellinformed correspondent of that famous munster paper the green flag of skibbereen  with mr mulligans qualities and history i only became subsequently acquainted on the present evening he made but a brief stay at the dinnertable being compelled by his professional duties to attend the house of commons  the above formed the party with whom i had the honour to dine what other repasts sir george thrum may have given what assemblies of men of mere science he may have invited to give their opinion regarding his prodigy what other editors of papers he may have pacified or rendered favourable who knows on the present occasion we did not quit the dinnertable until mr slang the manager was considerably excited by wine and music had been heard for some time in the drawingroom overhead during our absence an addition had been made to the thrum party by the arrival of several persons to spend the eveninga man to play on the violin between the singing a youth to play on the piano miss horsman to sing with mrs walker and other scientific characters in a corner sat a redfaced old lady of whom the mistress of the mansion took little notice and a gentleman with a royal button who blushed and looked exceedingly modest  hang me says mr bludyer who had perfectly good reasons for recognising mr woolsey and who on this day chose to assume his aristocratic air theres a tailor in the room what do they mean by asking me to meet tradesmen  delancy my dear cries slang entering the room with a reel hows your precious health give us your hand when are we to be married make room for me on the sofa thats a duck  get along slang says mrs crump addressed by the manager by her maiden name artists generally drop the title of honour which people adopt in the world and call each other by their simple surnamesget along slang or ill tell mrs s the enterprising manager replies by sportively striking mrs crump on the side a blow which causes a great giggle from the lady insulted and a most goodhumoured threat to box slangs ears i fear very much that morgianas mother thought mr slang an exceedingly gentlemanlike and agreeable person besides she was eager to have his good opinion of mrs walkers singing  the manager stretched himself out with much gracefulness on the sofa supporting two little dumpy legs encased in varnished boots on a chair  ajax some tea to mr slang said my lady looking towards that gentleman with a countenance expressive of some alarm i thought  thats right ajax my black prince exclaimed slang when the negro brought the required refreshment and now i suppose youll be wanted in the orchestra yonder dont ajax play the cymbals sir george  ha ha ha very goodcapital answered the knight exceedingly frightened but ours is not a military band miss horsman mr craw my dear mrs ravenswing shall we begin the trio silence gentlemen if you please it is a little piece from my opera of the brigands bride miss horsman takes the pages part mr craw is stiletto the brigand my accomplished pupil is the bride and the music began            the bride       my heart with joy is beating         my eyes with tears are dim            the page       her heart with joy is beating         her eyes are fixed on him            the brigand       my heart with rage is beating         in blood my eyeballs swim  what may have been the merits of the music or the singing i of course cannot guess lady thrum sat opposite the teacups nodding her head and beating time very gravely lord roundtowers by her side nodded his head too for awhile and then fell asleep i should have done the same but for the manager whose actions were worth of remark he sang with all the three singers and a great deal louder than any of them he shouted bravo or hissed as he thought proper he criticised all the points of mrs walkers person shell do crump shell doa splendid armyoull see her eyes in the shilling gallery what sort of a foot has she shes five feet three if shes an inch bravoslap upcapitalhurrah and he concluded by saying with the aid of the ravenswing he would put ligoniers nose out of joint  the enthusiasm of mr slang almost reconciled lady thrum to the abruptness of his manners and even caused sir george to forget that his chorus had been interrupted by the obstreperous familiarity of the manager  and what do you think mr bludyer said the tailor delighted that his protegee should be thus winning all hearts isnt mrs walker a tiptop singer eh sir  i think shes a very bad one mr woolsey said the illustrious author wishing to abbreviate all communications with a tailor to whom he owed forty pounds  then sir says mr woolsey fiercely illill thank you to pay me my little bill  it is true there was no connection between mrs walkers singing and woolseys little bill that the then sir was perfectly illogical on woolseys part but it was a very happy hit for the future fortunes of mrs walker who knows what would have come of her debut but for that then sir and whether a smashing article from the tomahawk might not have ruined her for ever  are you a relation of mrs walkers said mr bludyer in reply to the angry tailor  whats that to you whether i am or not replied woolsey fiercely but im the friend of mrs walker sir proud am i to say so sir and as the poet says sir a little learnings a dangerous thing sir and i think a man who dont pay his bills may keep his tongue quiet at least sir and not abuse a lady sir whom everybody else praises sir you shant humbug me any more sir you shall hear from my attorney tomorrow so mark that  hush my dear mr woolsey cried the literary man dont make a noise come into this window is mrs walker really a friend of yours  ive told you so sir  well in that case i shall do my utmost to serve her and look you woolsey any article you choose to send about her to the tomahawk i promise you ill put in  will you though then well say nothing about the little bill  you may do on that point answered bludyer haughtily exactly as you please i am not to be frightened from my duty mind that and mind too that i can write a slashing article better than any man in england i could crush her by ten lines  the tables were now turned and it was woolseys turn to be alarmed  pooh pooh i was angry said he because you abuse mrs walker whos an angel on earth but im very willing to apologise i saycomelet me take your measure for some new clothes eh mr b  ill come to your shop answered the literary man quite appeased silence theyre beginning another song  the songs which i dont attempt to describe and upon my word and honour as far as i can understand matters i believe to this day that mrs walker was only an ordinary singerthe songs lasted a great deal longer than i liked but i was nailed as it were to the spot having agreed to sup at knightsbridge barracks with fitzurse whose carriage was ordered at eleven oclock  my dear mr fitzboodle said our old host to me you can do me the greatest service in the world  speak sir said i  will you ask your honourable and gallant friend the captain to drive home mr squinny to brompton  cant mr squinny get a cab  sir george looked particularly arch generalship my dear young frienda little harmless generalship mr squinny will not give much for my opinion of my pupil but he will value very highly the opinion of the honourable mr fitzurse  for a moral man was not the little knight a clever fellow he had bought mr squinny for a dinner worth ten shillings and for a ride in a carriage with a lords son squinny was carried to brompton and set down at his aunts door delighted with his new friends and exceedingly sick with a cigar they had made him smoke    chapter viii in which mr walker shows great prudence and forbearance  the describing of all these persons does not advance morgianas story much but perhaps some country readers are not acquainted with the class of persons by whose printed opinions they are guided and are simple enough to imagine that mere merit will make a reputation on the stage or elsewhere the making of a theatrical success is a much more complicated and curious thing than such persons fancy it to be immense are the pains taken to get a good word from mr this of the star or mr that of the courier to propitiate the favour of the critic of the day and get the editors of the metropolis into a good humourabove all to have the name of the person to be puffed perpetually before the public artists cannot be advertised like macassar oil or blacking and they want it to the full as much hence endless ingenuity must be practised in order to keep the popular attention awake suppose a great actor moves from london to windsor the brentford champion must state that yesterday mr blazes and suite passed rapidly through our city the celebrated comedian is engaged we hear at windsor to give some of his inimitable readings of our great national bard to the most illustrious audience in the realm this piece of intelligence the hammersmith observer will question the next week as thusa contemporary the brentford champion says that blazes is engaged to give shakspearian readings at windsor to the most illustrious audience in the realm we question this fact very much we would indeed that it were true but the most illustrious audience in the realm prefer foreign melodies to the native woodnotes wild of the sweet songbird of avon mr blazes is simply gone to eton where his son master massinger blazes is suffering we regret to hear under a severe attack of the chickenpox this complaint incident to youth has raged we understand with frightful virulence in eton school  and if after the above paragraphs some london paper chooses to attack the folly of the provincial press which talks of mr blazes and chronicles his movements as if he were a crowned head what harm is done blazes can write in his own name to the london journal and say that it is not his fault if provincial journals choose to chronicle his movements and that he was far from wishing that the afflictions of those who are dear to him should form the subject of public comment and be held up to public ridicule we had no intention of hurting the feelings of an estimable public servant writes the editor and our remarks on the chickenpox were general not personal we sincerely trust that master massinger blazes has recovered from that complaint and that he may pass through the measles the whoopingcough the fourth form and all other diseases to which youth is subject with comfort to himself and credit to his parents and teachers at his next appearance on the stage after this controversy a british public calls for blazes three times after the play and somehow there is sure to be someone with a laurelwreath in a stagebox who flings that chaplet at the inspired artists feet  i dont know how it was but before the debut of morgiana the english press began to heave and throb in a convulsive manner as if indicative of the near birth of some great thing for instance you read in one paper  anecdote of karl maria von weberwhen the author of oberon was in england he was invited by a noble duke to dinner and some of the most celebrated of our artists were assembled to meet him the signal being given to descend to the salleamanger the german composer was invited by his noble host a bachelor to lead the way is it not the fashion in your country said he simply for the man of the first eminence to take the first place here is one whose genius entitles him to be first anywhere and so saying he pointed to our admirable english composer sir george thrum the two musicians were friends to the last and sir george has still the identical piece of rosin which the author of the freischutz gave himthe moon morning paper june 2  george iii a composersir george thrum has in his possession the score of an air the words from samson agonistes an autograph of the late revered monarch we hear that that excellent composer has in store for us not only an opera but a pupil with whose transcendent merits the elite of our aristocracy are already familiaribid june 5  music with a vengeancethe march to the sound of which the 49th and 75th regiments rushed up the breach of badajoz was the celebrated air from britons alarmed or the siege of bergenopzoom by our famous english composer sir george thrum marshal davoust said that the french line never stood when that air was performed to the charge of the bayonet we hear the veteran musician has an opera now about to appear and have no doubt that old england will now as then show its superiority over all foreign opponentsalbion  we have been accused of preferring the produit of the etranger to the talent of our own native shores but those who speak so little know us we are fanatici per la musica wherever it be and welcome merit dans chaque pays du monde what do we say le merite na point de pays as napoleon said and sir george thrum chevalier de lordre de lelephant et chateau de kalbsbratenpumpernickel is a maestro whose fame appartient a leurope  we have just heard the lovely eleve whose rare qualities the cavaliere has brought to perfectionwe have heard the ravenswing pourquoi cacher un nom que demain un monde va saluer and a creature more beautiful and gifted never bloomed before dans nos climats she sang the delicious duet of the nabucodonosore with count pizzicato with a bellezza a grandezza a raggio that excited in the bosom of the audience a corresponding furore her scherzando was exquisite though we confess we thought the concluding fioritura in the passage in y flat a leetle a very leetle sforzata surely the words       giorno dorrore       delire dolore       nabucodonosore  should be given andante and not con strepito but this is a faute bien legere in the midst of such unrivalled excellence and only mentioned here that we may have something to criticise  we hear that the enterprising impresario of one of the royal theatres has made an engagement with the diva and if we have a regret it is that she should be compelled to sing in the unfortunate language of our rude northern clime which does not preter itself near so well to the bocca of the cantatrice as do the mellifluous accents of the lingua toscana the langue par excellence of song  the ravenswings voice is a magnificent contrabasso of nine octaves etcflowers of fashion june 10  old thrum the composer is bringing out an opera and a pupil the opera is good the pupil firstrate the opera will do much more than compete with the infernal twaddle and disgusting slipslop of donizetti and the milkandwater fools who imitate him it will and we ask the readers of the tomahawk were we ever mistaken surpass all these it is good of downright english stuff the airs are fresh and pleasing the choruses large and noble the instrumentation solid and rich the music is carefully written we wish old thrum and his opera well  his pupil is a sure card a splendid woman and a splendid singer she is so handsome that she might sing as much out of tune as miss ligonier and the public would forgive her and sings so well that were she as ugly as the aforesaid ligonier the audience would listen to her the ravenswing that is her fantastical theatrical name her real name is the same with that of a notorious scoundrel in the fleet who invented the panama swindle the pontine marshes swindle the soap swindlehow are you off for soap now mr wlkrthe ravenswing we say will do slang has engaged her at thirty guineas per week and she appears next month in thrums opera of which the words are written by a great ass with some talentwe mean mr mulligan  there is a foreign fool in the flowers of fashion who is doing his best to disgust the public by his filthy flattery it is enough to make one sick why is the foreign beast not kicked out of the paperthe tomahawk june 17  the first three anecdotes were supplied by mulligan to his paper with many others which need not here be repeated he kept them up with amazing energy and variety anecdotes of sir george thrum met you unexpectedly in queer corners of country papers puffs of the english school of music appeared perpetually in notices to correspondents in the sunday prints some of which mr slang commanded and in others over which the indefatigable mulligan had a control this youth was the soul of the little conspiracy for raising morgiana into fame and humble as he is and great and respectable as is sir george thrum it is my belief that the ravenswing would never have been the ravenswing she is but for the ingenuity and energy of the honest hibernian reporter  it is only the business of the great man who writes the leading articles which appear in the large type of the daily papers to compose those astonishing pieces of eloquence the other parts of the paper are left to the ingenuity of the subeditor whose duty it is to select paragraphs reject or receive horrid accidents police reports etc with which occupied as he is in the exercise of his tremendous functions the editor himself cannot be expected to meddle the fate of europe is his province the rise and fall of empires and the great questions of state demand the editors attention the humble puff the paragraph about the last murder or the state of the crops or the sewers in chancery lane is confided to the care of the sub and it is curious to see what a prodigious number of irishmen exist among the subeditors of london when the liberator enumerates the services of his countrymen how the battle of fontenoy was won by the irish brigade how the battle of waterloo would have been lost but for the irish regiments and enumerates other acts for which we are indebted to milesian heroism and geniushe ought at least to mention the irish brigade of the press and the amazing services they do to this country  the truth is the irish reporters and soldiers appear to do their duty right well and my friend mr mulligan is one of the former having the interests of his opera and the ravenswing strongly at heart and being amongst his brethren an exceedingly popular fellow he managed matters so that never a day passed but some paragraph appeared somewhere regarding the new singer in whom for their countrymans sake all his brothers and subeditors felt an interest  these puffs destined to make known to all the world the merits of the ravenswing of course had an effect upon a gentleman very closely connected with that lady the respectable prisoner in the fleet captain walker as long as he received his weekly two guineas from mr woolsey and the occasional halfcrowns which his wife could spare in her almost daily visits to him he had never troubled himself to inquire what her pursuits were and had allowed her though the worthy woman longed with all her might to betray herself to keep her secret he was far from thinking indeed that his wife would prove such a treasure to him  but when the voice of fame and the columns of the public journals brought him each day some new story regarding the merits genius and beauty of the ravenswing when rumours reached him that she was the favourite pupil of sir george thrum when she brought him five guineas after singing at the philharmonic other five the good soul had spent in purchasing some smart new cockades hats cloaks and laces for her little son when finally it was said that slang the great manager offered her an engagement at thirty guineas per week mr walker became exceedingly interested in his wifes proceedings of which he demanded from her the fullest explanation  using his marital authority he absolutely forbade mrs walkers appearance on the public stage he wrote to sir george thrum a letter expressive of his highest indignation that negotiations so important should ever have been commenced without his authorisation and he wrote to his dear slang for these gentlemen were very intimate and in the course of his transactions as an agent mr w had had many dealings with mr s asking his dear slang whether the latter thought his friend walker would be so green as to allow his wife to appear on the stage and he remain in prison with all his debts on his head  and it was a curious thing now to behold how eager those very creditors who but yesterday and with perfect correctness had denounced mr walker as a swindler who had refused to come to any composition with him and had sworn never to release him how they on a sudden became quite eager to come to an arrangement with him and offered nay begged and prayed him to go freeonly giving them his own and mrs walkers acknowledgment of their debt with a promise that a part of the ladys salary should be devoted to the payment of the claim  the ladys salary said mr walker indignantly to these gentlemen and their attorneys do you suppose i will allow mrs walker to go on the stagedo you suppose i am such a fool as to sign bills to the full amount of these claims against me when in a few months more i can walk out of prison without paying a shilling gentlemen you take howard walker for an idiot i like the fleet and rather than pay ill stay here for these ten years  in other words it was the captains determination to make some advantageous bargain for himself with his creditors and the gentlemen who were interested in bringing forward mrs walker on the stage and who can say that in so determining he did not act with laudable prudence and justice  you do not surely consider my very dear sir that half the amount of mrs walkers salaries is too much for my immense trouble and pains in teaching her cried sir george thrum who in reply to walkers note thought it most prudent to wait personally on that gentleman remember that i am the first master in england that i have the best interest in england that i can bring her out at the palace and at every concert and musical festival in england that i am obliged to teach her every single note that she utters and that without me she could no more sing a song than her little baby could walk without its nurse  i believe about half what you say said mr walker  my dear captain walker would you question my integrity who was it that made mrs millingtons fortunethe celebrated mrs millington who has now got a hundred thousand pounds who was it that brought out the finest tenor in europe poppleton ask the musical world ask those great artists themselves and they will tell you they owe their reputation their fortune to sir george thrum  it is very likely replied the captain coolly you are a good master i dare say sir george but i am not going to article mrs walker to you for three years and sign her articles in the fleet mrs walker shant sing till im a free man thats flat if i stay here till youre dead she shant  gracious powers sir exclaimed sir george do you expect me to pay your debts  yes old boy answered the captain and to give me something handsome in hand too and thats my ultimatum and so i wish you good morning for im engaged to play a match at tennis below  this little interview exceedingly frightened the worthy knight who went home to his lady in a delirious state of alarm occasioned by the audacity of captain walker  mr slangs interview with him was scarcely more satisfactory he owed he said four thousand pounds his creditors might be brought to compound for five shillings in the pound he would not consent to allow his wife to make a single engagement until the creditors were satisfied and until he had a handsome sum in hand to begin the world with unless my wife comes out youll be in the gazette yourself you know you will so you may take her or leave her as you think fit  let her sing one night as a trial said mr slang  if she sings one night the creditors will want their money in full replied the captain i shant let her labour poor thing for the profit of those scoundrels added the prisoner with much feeling and slang left him with a much greater respect for walker than he had ever before possessed he was struck with the gallantry of the man who could triumph over misfortunes nay make misfortune itself an engine of good luck  mrs walker was instructed instantly to have a severe sore throat the journals in mr slangs interest deplored this illness pathetically while the papers in the interest of the opposition theatre magnified it with great malice the new singer said one the great wonder which slang promised us is as hoarse as a raven doctor thorax pronounces wrote another paper that the quinsy which has suddenly prostrated mrs ravenswing whose singing at the philharmonic previous to her appearance at the tr excited so much applause has destroyed the ladys voice for ever we luckily need no other prima donna when that place as nightly thousands acknowledge is held by miss ligonier the lookeron said that although some wellinformed contemporaries had declared mrs w ravenswings complaint to be a quinsy others on whose authority they could equally rely had pronounced it to be a consumption at all events she was in an exceedingly dangerous state from which though we do not expect we heartily trust she may recover opinions differ as to the merits of this lady some saying that she was altogether inferior to miss ligonier while other connoisseurs declare the latter lady to be by no means so accomplished a person this point we fear continued the lookeron can never now be settled unless which we fear is improbable mrs ravenswing should ever so far recover as to be able to make her debut and even then the new singer will not have a fair chance unless her voice and strength shall be fully restored this information which we have from exclusive resources may be relied on concluded the lookeron as authentic  it was mr walker himself that artful and audacious fleet prisoner who concocted those very paragraphs against his wifes health which appeared in the journals of the ligonier party the partisans of that lady were delighted the creditors of mr walker astounded at reading them even sir george thrum was taken in and came to the fleet prison in considerable alarm  mums the word my good sir said mr walker now is the time to make arrangements with the creditors  well these arrangements were finally made it does not matter how many shillings in the pound satisfied the rapacious creditors of morgianas husband but it is certain that her voice returned to her all of a sudden upon the captains release the papers of the mulligan faction again trumpeted her perfections the agreement with mr slang was concluded that with sir george thrum the great composer satisfactorily arranged and the new opera underlined in immense capitals in the bills and put in rehearsal with immense expenditure on the part of the scenepainter and costumier  need we tell with what triumphant success the brigands bride was received all the irish subeditors the next morning took care to have such an account of it as made miss ligonier and baroski die with envy all the reporters who could spare time were in the boxes to support their friends work all the journeymen tailors of the establishment of linsey woolsey and co had pit tickets given to them and applauded with all their might all mr walkers friends of the regent club lined the sideboxes with white kid gloves and in a little box by themselves sat mrs crump and mr woolsey a great deal too much agitated to applaudso agitated that woolsey even forgot to fling down the bouquet he had brought for the ravenswing  but there was no lack of those horticultural ornaments the theatre servants wheeled away a wheelbarrowfull which were flung on the stage the next night over again and morgiana blushing panting weeping was led off by mr poppleton the eminent tenor who had crowned her with one of the most conspicuous of the chaplets  here she flew to her husband and flung her arms round his neck he was flirting behind the sidescenes with mademoiselle flicflac who had been dancing in the divertissement and was probably the only man in the theatre of those who witnessed the embrace that did not care for it even slang was affected and said with perfect sincerity that he wished he had been in walkers place the managers fortune was made at least for the season he acknowledged so much to walker who took a weeks salary for his wife in advance that very night  there was as usual a grand supper in the greenroom the terrible mr bludyer appeared in a new coat of the wellknown woolsey cut and the little tailor himself and mrs crump were not the least happy of the party but when the ravenswing took woolseys hand and said she never would have been there but for him mr walker looked very grave and hinted to her that she must not in her position encourage the attentions of persons in that rank of life i shall pay said he proudly every farthing that is owing to mr woolsey and shall employ him for the future but you understand my love that one cannot at ones own table receive ones own tailor  slang proposed morgianas health in a tremendous speech which elicited cheers and laughter and sobs such as only managers have the art of drawing from the theatrical gentlemen and ladies in their employ it was observed especially among the chorussingers at the bottom of the table that their emotion was intense they had a meeting the next day and voted a piece of plate to adolphus slang esquire for his eminent services in the cause of the drama  walker returned thanks for his lady that was he said the proudest moment of his life he was proud to think that he had educated her for the stage happy to think that his sufferings had not been in vain and that his exertions in her behalf were crowned with full success in her name and his own he thanked the company and sat down and was once more particularly attentive to mademoiselle flicflac  then came an oration from sir george thrum in reply to slangs toast to him it was very much to the same effect as the speech by walker the two gentlemen attributing to themselves individually the merit of bringing out mrs walker he concluded by stating that he should always hold mrs walker as the daughter of his heart and to the last moment of his life should love and cherish her it is certain that sir george was exceedingly elated that night and would have been scolded by his lady on his return home but for the triumph of the evening  mulligans speech of thanks as author of the brigands bride was it must be confessed extremely tedious it seemed there would be no end to it when he got upon the subject of ireland especially which somehow was found to be intimately connected with the interests of music and the theatre even the choristers poohpoohed this speech coming though it did from the successful author whose songs of wine love and battle they had been repeating that night  the brigands bride ran for many nights its choruses were tuned on the organs of the day morgianas airs the rose upon my balcony and the lightning on the cataract recitative and scena were on everybodys lips and brought so many guineas to sir george thrum that he was encouraged to have his portrait engraved which still may be seen in the musicshops not many persons i believe bought proof impressions of the plate price two guineas whereas on the contrary all the young clerks in banks and all the fast young men of the universities had pictures of the ravenswing in their apartmentsas biondetta the brigands bride as zelyma in the nuptials of benares as barbareska in the mine of tobolsk and in all her famous characters in the latter she disguises herself as a uhlan in order to save her father who is in prison and the ravenswing looked so fascinating in this costume in pantaloons and yellow boots that slang was for having her instantly in captain macheath whence arose their quarrel  she was replaced at slangs theatre by snooks the rhinocerostamer with his breed of wild buffaloes their success was immense slang gave a supper at which all the company burst into tears and assembling in the greenroom next day they as usual voted a piece of plate to adolphus slang esquire for his eminent services to the drama  in the captain macheath dispute mr walker would have had his wife yield but on this point and for once she disobeyed her husband and left the theatre and when walker cursed her according to his wont for her abominable selfishness and disregard of his property she burst into tears and said she had spent but twenty guineas on herself and baby during the year that her theatrical dressmakers bills were yet unpaid and that she had never asked him how much he spent on that odious french figurante  all this was true except about the french figurante walker as the lord and master received all morgianas earnings and spent them as a gentleman should he gave very neat dinners at a cottage in regents park mr and mrs walker lived at green street grosvenor square he played a good deal at the regent but as to the french figurante it must be confessed that mrs walker was in a sad error that lady and the captain had parted long ago it was madame dolores de trasosmontes who inhabited the cottage in st johns wood now  but if some little errors of this kind might be attributable to the captain on the other hand when his wife was in the provinces he was the most attentive of husbands made all her bargains and received every shilling before he would permit her to sing a note thus he prevented her from being cheated as a person of her easy temper doubtless would have been by designing managers and needy concertgivers they always travelled with four horses and walker was adored in every one of the principal hotels in england the waiters flew at his bell the chambermaids were afraid he was a sad naughty man and thought his wife no such great beauty the landlords preferred him to any duke he never looked at their bills not he in fact his income was at least four thousand a year for some years of his life  master woolsey walker was put to doctor wapshots seminary whence after many disputes on the doctors part as to getting his halfyears accounts paid and after much complaint of illtreatment on the little boys side he was withdrawn and placed under the care of the reverend mr swishtail at turnham green where all his bills are paid by his godfather now the head of the firm of woolsey and co  as a gentleman mr walker still declines to see him but he has not as far as i have heard paid the sums of money which he threatened to refund and as he is seldom at home the worthy tailor can come to green street at his leisure he and mrs crump and mrs walker often take the omnibus to brentford and a cake with them to little woolsey at school to whom the tailor says he will leave every shilling of his property  the walkers have no other children but when she takes her airing in the park she always turns away at the sight of a low phaeton in which sits a woman with rouged cheeks and a great number of overdressed children and a french bonne whose name i am given to understand is madame dolores de trasosmontes madame de trasosmontes always puts a great gold glass to her eye as the ravenswings carriage passes and looks into it with a sneer the two coachmen used always to exchange queer winks at each other in the ring until madame de trasosmontes lately adopted a tremendous chasseur with huge whiskers and a green and gold livery since which time the formerly named gentlemen do not recognise each other  the ravenswings life is one of perpetual triumph on the stage and as every one of the fashionable men about town have been in love with her you may fancy what a pretty character she has lady thrum would die sooner than speak to that unhappy young woman and in fact the thrums have a new pupil who is a siren without the dangerous qualities of one who has the person of venus and the mind of a muse and who is coming out at one of the theatres immediately baroski says de liddle rafenschwing is just as font of me as effer people are very shy about receiving her in society and when she goes to sing at a concert miss prim starts up and skurries off in a state of the greatest alarm lest that person should speak to her  walker is voted a good easy rattling gentlemanly fellow and nobodys enemy but his own his wife they say is dreadfully extravagant and indeed since his marriage and in spite of his wifes large income he has been in the bench several times but she signs some bills and he comes out again and is as gay and genial as ever all mercantile speculations he has wisely long since given up he likes to throw a main of an evening as i have said and to take his couple of bottles at dinner on friday he attends at the theatre for his wifes salary and transacts no other business during the week he grows exceedingly stout dyes his hair and has a bloated purple look about the nose and cheeks very different from that which first charmed the heart of morgiana  by the way eglantine has been turned out of the bower of bloom and now keeps a shop at tunbridge wells going down thither last year without a razor i asked a fat seedy man lolling in a faded nankeen jacket at the door of a tawdry little shop in the pantiles to shave me he said in reply sir i do not practise in that branch of the profession and turned back into the little shop it was archibald eglantine but in the wreck of his fortunes he still has his captains uniform and his grand cross of the order of the castle and falcon of panama                        postscript  g fitzboodle esq to o yorke esq  zum trierischen hop coblenz july 10 1843  my dear yorkethe story of the ravenswing was written a long time since and i never could account for the bad taste of the publishers of the metropolis who refused it an insertion in their various magazines this fact would never have been alluded to but for the following circumstance  only yesterday as i was dining at this excellent hotel i remarked a baldheaded gentleman in a blue coat and brass buttons who looked like a colonel on halfpay and by his side a lady and a little boy of twelve whom the gentleman was cramming with an amazing quantity of cherries and cakes a stout old dame in a wonderful cap and ribands was seated by the ladys side and it was easy to see they were english and i thought i had already made their acquaintance elsewhere  the younger of the ladies at last made a bow with an accompanying blush  surely said i i have the honour of speaking to mrs ravenswing  mrs woolsey sir said the gentleman my wife has long since left the stage and at this the old lady in the wonderful cap trod on my toes very severely and nodded her head and all her ribands in a most mysterious way presently the two ladies rose and left the table the elder declaring that she heard the baby crying  woolsey my dear go with your mamma said mr woolsey patting the boy on the head the young gentleman obeyed the command carrying off a plate of macaroons with him  your son is a fine boy sir said i  my stepson sir answered mr woolsey and added in a louder voice i knew you mr fitzboodle at once but did not mention your name for fear of agitating my wife she dont like to have the memory of old times renewed sir her former husband whom you know captain walker made her very unhappy he died in america sir of this i fear pointing to the bottle and mrs w quitted the stage a year before i quitted business are you going on to wiesbaden  they went off in their carriage that evening the boy on the box making great efforts to blow out of the postilions tasselled horn  i am glad that poor morgiana is happy at last and hasten to inform you of the fact i am going to visit the old haunts of my youth at pumpernickel adieu  yours  g fb     mr and mrs frank berry    chapter i the fight at slaughter house  i am very fond of reading about battles and have most of marlboroughs and wellingtons at my fingers ends but the most tremendous combat i ever saw and one that interests me to think of more than malplaquet or waterloo which by the way has grown to be a downright nuisance so much do men talk of it after dinner prating most disgustingly about the prussians coming up and what noti say the most tremendous combat ever known was that between berry and biggs the gownboy which commenced in a certain place called middle briars situated in the midst of the cloisters that run along the side of the playground of slaughter house school near smithfield london it was there madam that your humble servant had the honour of acquiring after six years labour that immense fund of classical knowledge which in after life has been so exceedingly useful to him  the circumstances of the quarrel were thesebiggs the gownboy a man who in those days i thought was at least seven feet high and was quite thunderstruck to find in after life that he measured no more than five feet four was what we called second cock of the school the first cock was a great big goodhumoured lazy fairhaired fellow old hawkins by name who because he was large and goodhumoured hurt nobody biggs on the contrary was a sad bully he had halfadozen fags and beat them all unmercifully moreover he had a little brother a boarder in potkys house whom as a matter of course he hated and maltreated worse than anyone else  well one day because young biggs had not brought his brother his hoops or had not caught a ball at cricket or for some other equally good reason biggs the elder so belaboured the poor little fellow that berry who was sauntering by and saw the dreadful blows which the elder brother was dealing to the younger with his hockeystick felt a compassion for the little fellow perhaps he had a jealousy against biggs and wanted to try a few rounds with him but that i cant vouch for however berry passing by stopped and said dont you think you have thrashed the boy enough biggs he spoke this in a very civil tone for he never would have thought of interfering rudely with the sacred privilege that an upper boy at a public school always has of beating a junior especially when they happen to be brothers  the reply of biggs as might be expected was to hit young biggs with the hockeystick twice as hard as before until the little wretch howled with pain i suppose its no business of yours berry said biggs thumping away all the while and laid on worse and worse  until berry and indeed little biggs could bear it no longer and the former bouncing forward wrenched the stick out of old biggss hands and sent it whirling out of the cloister window to the great wonder of a crowd of us small boys who were looking on little boys always like to see a little companion of their own soundly beaten  there said berry looking into biggss face as much as to say ive gone and done it and he added to the brother scud away you little thief ive saved you this time  stop young biggs roared out his brother after a pause or ill break every bone in your infernal scoundrelly skin  young biggs looked at berry then at his brother then came at his brothers order as if back to be beaten again but lost heart and ran away as fast as his little legs could carry him  ill do for him another time said biggs here underboy take my coat and we all began to gather round and formed a ring  we had better wait till after school biggs cried berry quite cool but looking a little pale there are only five minutes now and it will take you more than that to thrash me  biggs upon this committed a great error for he struck berry slightly across the face with the back of his hand saying you are in a funk but this was a feeling which frank berry did not in the least entertain for in reply to biggss backhander and as quick as thought and with all his might and mainpong he delivered a blow upon old biggss nose that made the claret spirt and sent the second cock down to the ground as if he had been shot  he was up again however in a minute his face white and gashed with blood his eyes glaring a ghastly spectacle and berry meanwhile had taken his coat off and by this time there were gathered in the cloisters on all the windows and upon each others shoulders one hundred and twenty young gentlemen at the very least for the news had gone out through the playground of a fight between berry and biggs  but berry was quite right in his remark about the propriety of deferring the business for at this minute mr chip the second master came down the cloisters going into school and grinned in his queer way as he saw the state of biggss face holloa mr biggs said he i suppose you have run against a fingerpost that was the regular joke with us at school and you may be sure we all laughed heartily as we always did when mr chip made a joke or anything like a joke you had better go to the pump sir and get yourself washed and not let doctor buckle see you in that condition so saying mr chip disappeared to his duties in the underschool whither all we little boys followed him  it was wednesday a halfholiday as everybody knows and boiledbeef day at slaughter house i was in the same boardinghouse with berry and we all looked to see whether he ate a good dinner just as one would examine a man who was going to be hanged i recollected in afterlife in germany seeing a friend who was going to fight a duel eat five larks for his breakfast and thought i had seldom witnessed greater courage berry ate moderately of the boiled beefboiled child we used to call it at school in our elegant jocular way he knew a great deal better than to load his stomach upon the eve of such a contest as was going to take place  dinner was very soon over and mr chip who had been all the while joking berry and pressing him to eat called him up into his study to the great disappointment of us all for we thought he was going to prevent the fight but no such thing the reverend edward chip took berry into his study and poured him out two glasses of portwine which he made him take with a biscuit and patted him on the back and went off i have no doubt he was longing like all of us to see the battle but etiquette you know forbade  when we went out into the green old hawkins was therethe great hawkins the cock of the school i have never seen the man since but still think of him as of something awful gigantic mysterious he who could thrash everybody who could beat all the masters how we longed for him to put in his hand and lick buckle he was a dull boy not very high in the school and had all his exercises written for him buckle knew this but respected him never called him up to read greek plays passed over all his blunders which were many let him go out of halfholidays into the town as he pleased how should any man dare to stop himthe great calm magnanimous silent strength they say he licked a lifeguardsman i wonder whether it was shaw who killed all those frenchmen no it could not be shaw for he was dead au champ dhonneur but he would have licked shaw if he had been alive a bargeman i know he licked at jack randalls in slaughter house lane old hawkins was too lazy to play at cricket he sauntered all day in the sunshine about the green accompanied by little tippins who was in the sixth form laughed and joked at hawkins eternally and was the person who wrote all his exercises  instead of going into town this afternoon hawkins remained at slaughter house to see the great fight between the second and third cocks  the different masters of the school kept boardinghouses such as potkys chips wickenss pinneys and so on and the playground or green as it was called although the only thing green about the place was the broken glass on the walls that separate slaughter house from wilderness row and goswell streetmany a time have i seen mr pickwick look out of his window in that street though we did not know him thenthe playground or green was common to all but if any stray boy from potkys was found for instance in or entering into chips house the most dreadful tortures were practised upon him as i can answer in my own case  fancy then our astonishment at seeing a little threefoot wretch of the name of wills one of hawkinss fags they were both in potkys walk undismayed amongst us lions at chips house as the rich and rare young lady did in ireland we were going to set upon him and devour or otherwise maltreat him when he cried out in a little shrill impertinent voice tell berry i want him  we all roared with laughter berry was in the sixth form and wills or any underboy would as soon have thought of wanting him as i should of wanting the duke of wellington  little wills looked round in an imperious kind of way well says he stamping his foot do you hear tell berry that hawkins wants him  as for resisting the law of hawkins you might as soon think of resisting immortal jove berry and tolmash who was to be his bottleholder made their appearance immediately and walked out into the green where hawkins was waiting and with an irresistible audacity that only belonged to himself in the face of nature and all the regulations of the place was smoking a cigar when berry and tolmash found him the three began slowly pacing up and down in the sunshine and we little boys watched them  hawkins moved his arms and hands every now and then and was evidently laying down the law about boxing we saw his fists darting out every now and then with mysterious swiftness hitting one two quick as thought as if in the face of an adversary now his left hand went up as if guarding his own head now his immense right fist dreadfully flapped the air as if punishing his imaginary opponents miserable ribs the conversation lasted for some ten minutes about which time gownboys dinner was over and we saw these youths in their black hornedbutton jackets and kneebreeches issuing from their door in the cloisters there were no hoops no cricketbats as usual on a halfholiday who would have thought of play in expectation of such tremendous sport as was in store for us  towering among the gownboys of whom he was the head and the tyrant leaning upon bushbys arm and followed at a little distance by many curious pale awestricken boys dressed in his black silk stockings which he always sported and with a crimson bandanna tied round his waist came biggs his nose was swollen with the blow given before school but his eyes flashed fire he was laughing and sneering with bushby and evidently intended to make minced meat of berry  the betting began pretty freely the bets were against poor berry five to three were offeredin gingerbeer i took six to four in raspberry open tarts the upper boys carried the thing farther still and i know for a fact that swangs book amounted to four pound three but he hedged a good deal and tittery lost seventeen shillings in a single bet to pitts who took the odds  as biggs and his party arrived i heard hawkins say to berry for heavens sake my boy fib with your right and mind his left hand  middle briars was voted to be too confined a space for the combat and it was agreed that it should take place behind the underschool in the shade whither we all went hawkins with his immense silver huntingwatch kept the time and water was brought from the pump close to notleys the pastrycooks who did not admire fisticuffs at all on halfholidays for the fights kept the boys away from his shop gutley was the only fellow in the school who remained faithful to him and he sat on the counterthe great gormandising bruteeating tarts the whole day  this famous fight as every slaughter house man knows lasted for two hours and twentynine minutes by hawkinss immense watch all this time the air resounded with cries of go it berry go it biggs pitch into him give it him and so on shall i describe the hundred and two rounds of the combatnoit would occupy too much space and the taste for such descriptions has passed away 3  1st round both the combatants fresh and in prime order the weight and inches somewhat on the gownboys side berry goes gallantly in and delivers a clinker on the gownboys jaw biggs makes play with his left berry down                        4th round claret drawn in profusion from the gownboys grogshop he went down and had his front tooth knocked out but the blow cut berrys knuckles a great deal                        15th round chancery fibbing biggs makes dreadful work with his left break away rally biggs down betting still six to four on the gownboy                        20th round the men both dreadfully punished berry somewhat shy of his adversarys left hand                        29th to 42nd round the chipsite all this while breaks away from the gownboys left and goes down on a knee six to four on the gownboy until the fortieth round when the bets became equal                        102nd and last round for halfanhour the men had stood up to each other but were almost too weary to strike the gownboys face hardly to be recognised swollen and streaming with blood the chipsite in a similar condition and still more punished about his side from his enemys left hand berry gives a blow at his adversarys face and falls over him as he falls  the gownboy cant come up to time and thus ended the great fight of berry and biggs  and what pray has this horrid description of a battle and parcel of schoolboys to do with mens wives  what has it to do with mens wivesa great deal more madam than you think for only read chapter ii and you shall hear    chapter ii the combat at versailles  i afterwards came to be berrys fag and though beaten by him daily he allowed of course no one else to lay a hand upon me and i got no more thrashing than was good for me thus an intimacy grew up between us and after he left slaughter house and went into the dragoons the honest fellow did not forget his old friend but actually made his appearance one day in the playground in moustaches and a braided coat and gave me a gold pencilcase and a couple of sovereigns i blushed when i took them but take them i did and i think the thing i almost best recollect in my life is the sight of berry getting behind an immense bay cabhorse which was held by a correct little groom and was waiting near the school in slaughter house square he proposed too to have me to longs where he was lodging for the time but this invitation was refused on my behalf by doctor buckle who said and possibly with correctness that i should get little good by spending my holiday with such a scapegrace  once afterwards he came to see me at christ church and we made a show of writing to one another and didnt and always had a hearty mutual goodwill and though we did not quite burst into tears on parting were yet quite happy when occasion threw us together and so almost lost sight of each other i heard lately that berry was married and am rather ashamed to say that i was not so curious as even to ask the maiden name of his lady  last summer i was at paris and had gone over to versailles to meet a party one of which was a young lady to whom i was tenderlybut never mind the day was rainy and the party did not keep its appointment and after yawning through the interminable palace picturegalleries and then making an attempt to smoke a cigar in the palace gardenfor which crime i was nearly run through the body by a rascally sentineli was driven perforce into the great bleak lonely place before the palace with its roads branching off to all the towns in the world which louis and napoleon once intended to conquer and there enjoyed my favourite pursuit at leisure and was meditating whether i should go back to vefours for dinner or patronise my friend m duboux of the hotel des reservoirs who gives not only a good dinner but as dear a one as heart can desire i was i say meditating these things when a carriage passed by it was a smart low calash with a pair of bay horses and a postilion in a drab jacket that twinkled with innumerable buttons and i was too much occupied in admiring the build of the machine and the extreme tightness of the fellows inexpressibles to look at the personages within the carriage when the gentleman roared out fitz and the postilion pulled up and the lady gave a shrill scream and a little blackmuzzled spaniel began barking and yelling with all his might and a man with moustaches jumped out of the vehicle and began shaking me by the hand  drive home john said the gentleman ill be with you my love in an instantits an old friend fitz let me present you to mrs berry  the lady made an exceedingly gentle inclination of her blackvelvet bonnet and said pray my love remember that it is just dinnertime however never mind me and with another slight toss and a nod to the postilion that individuals white leather breeches began to jump up and down again in the saddle and the carriage disappeared leaving me shaking my old friend berry by the hand  he had long quitted the army but still wore his military beard which gave to his fair pink face a fierce and lionlike look he was extraordinarily glad to see me as only men are glad who live in a small town or in dull company there is no destroyer of friendships like london where a man has no time to think of his neighbour and has far too many friends to care for them he told me in a breath of his marriage and how happy he was and straight insisted that i must come home to dinner and see more of angelica who had invited me herselfdidnt i hear her  mrs berry asked you frank but i certainly did not hear her ask me  she would not have mentioned the dinner but that she meant me to ask you i know she did cried frank berry and besideshang itim master of the house so come you shall no ceremony old boyone or two friendssnug family partyand well talk of old times over a bottle of claret  there did not seem to me to be the slightest objection to this arrangement except that my boots were muddy and my coat of the morning sort but as it was quite impossible to go to paris and back again in a quarter of an hour and as a man may dine with perfect comfort to himself in a frockcoat it did not occur to me to be particularly squeamish or to decline an old friends invitation upon a pretext so trivial  accordingly we walked to a small house in the avenue de paris and were admitted first into a small garden ornamented by a grotto a fountain and several nymphs in plasterofparis then up a mouldy old steep stair into a hall where a statue of cupid and another of venus welcomed us with their eternal simper then through a salleamanger where covers were laid for six and finally to a little saloon where fido the dog began to howl furiously according to his wont  it was one of the old pavilions that had been built for a pleasurehouse in the gay days of versailles ornamented with abundance of damp cupids and cracked gilt cornices and old mirrors let into the walls and gilded once but now painted a dingy french white the long low windows looked into the court where the fountain played its ceaseless dribble surrounded by numerous rank creepers and weedy flowers but in the midst of which the statues stood with their bases quite moist and green  i hate fountains and statues in dark confined places that cheerless endless plashing of water is the most inhospitable sound ever heard the stiff grin of those french statues or ogling canova graces is by no means more happy i think than the smile of a skeleton and not so natural those little pavilions in which the old roues sported were never meant to be seen by daylight depend ont they were lighted up with a hundred waxcandles and the little fountain yonder was meant only to cool their claret and so my first impression of berrys place of abode was rather a dismal one however i heard him in the salleamanger drawing the corks which went off with a cloop and that consoled me  as for the furniture of the rooms appertaining to the berrys there was a harp in a leather case and a piano and a flutebox and a huge tambour with a saracens nose just begun and likewise on the table a multiplicity of those little gilt books half sentimental and half religious which the wants of the age and of our young ladies have produced in such numbers of late i quarrel with no ladys taste in that way but heigho i had rather that mrs fitzboodle should read humphry clinker  besides these works there was a peerage of course what genteel family was ever without one  i was making for the door to see frank drawing the corks and was bounced at by the amiable little blackmuzzled spaniel who fastened his teeth in my pantaloons and received a polite kick in consequence which sent him howling to the other end of the room and the animal was just in the act of performing that feat of agility when the door opened and madame made her appearance frank came behind her peering over her shoulder with rather an anxious look  mrs berry is an exceedingly white and lean person she has thick eyebrows which meet rather dangerously over her nose which is grecian and a small mouth with no lipsa sort of feeble pucker in the face as it were under her eyebrows are a pair of enormous eyes which she is in the habit of turning constantly ceilingwards her hair is rather scarce and worn in bandeaux and she commonly mounts a sprig of laurel or a dark flower or two which with the sham touri believe that is the name of the knob of artificial hair that many ladies sportgives her a rigid and classical look she is dressed in black and has invariably the neatest of silk stockings and shoes for forsooth her foot is a fine one and she always sits with it before her looking at it stamping it and admiring it a great deal fido she says to her spaniel you have almost crushed my poor foot or frank to her husband bring me a footstool or i suffer so from cold in the feet and so forth but be the conversation what it will she is always sure to put her foot into it  she invariably wears on her neck the miniature of her late father sir george catacomb apothecary to george iii and she thinks those two men the greatest the world ever saw she was born in baker street portman square and that is saying almost enough of her she is as long as genteel and as dreary as that deadlylively place and sports by way of ornament her papas hatchment as it were as every tenth baker street house has taught her  what induced such a jolly fellow as frank berry to marry miss angelica catacomb no one can tell he met her he says at a ball at hampton court where his regiment was quartered and where to this day lives her aunt lady pash she alludes perpetually in conversation to that celebrated lady and if you look in the baronetage to the pedigree of the pash family you may see manuscript notes by mrs frank berry relative to them and herself thus when you see in print that sir john pash married angelica daughter of graves catacomb esquire in a neat hand you find written and sister of the late sir george catacomb of baker street portman square ab follows of course it is a wonder how fond ladies are of writing in books and signing their charming initials mrs berrys beforementioned little gilt books are scored with pencilmarks or occasionally at the margin with anote of interjection or the words too true ab and so on much may be learned with regard to lovely woman by a look at the books she reads in and i had gained no inconsiderable knowledge of mrs berry by the ten minutes spent in the drawingroom while she was at her toilet in the adjoining bedchamber  you have often heard me talk of george fitz says berry with an appealing look to madame  very often answered his lady in a tone which clearly meant a great deal too much pray sir continued she looking at my boots with all her might are we to have your company at dinner  of course you are my dear what else do you think he came for you would not have the man go back to paris to get his evening coat would you  at least my love i hope you will go and put on yours and change those muddy boots lady pash will be here in five minutes and you know dobus is as punctual as clockwork then turning to me with a sort of apology that was as consoling as a box on the ear we have some friends at dinner sir who are rather particular persons but i am sure when they hear that you only came on a sudden invitation they will excuse your morning dressbah what a smell of smoke  with this speech madame placed herself majestically on a sofa put out her foot called fido and relapsed into an icy silence frank had long since evacuated the premises with a rueful look at his wife but never daring to cast a glance at me i saw the whole business at once here was this lion of a fellow tamed down by a she van amburgh and fetching and carrying at her orders a great deal more obediently than her little yowling blackmuzzled darling of a fido  i am not however to be tamed so easily and was determined in this instance not to be in the least disconcerted or to show the smallest sign of illhumour so to renouer the conversation i began about lady pash  i heard you mention the name of pash i think said i i know a lady of that name and a very ugly one it is too  it is most probably not the same person answered mrs berry with a look which intimated that a fellow like me could never have had the honour to know so exalted a person  i mean old lady pash of hampton court fat womanfair aint sheand wears an amethyst in her forehead has one eye a blond wig and dresses in light green  lady pash sir is my aunt answered mrs berry not altogether displeased although she expected money from the old lady but you know we love to hear our friends abused when it can be safely done  oh indeed she was a daughter of old catacombs of windsor i remember the undertaker they called her husband callipash and her ladyship pishpash so you see madam that i know the whole family  mr fitzsimons exclaimed mrs berry rising i am not accustomed to hear nicknames applied to myself and my family and must beg you when you honour us with your company to spare our feelings as much as possible mr catacomb had the confidence of his sovereign sir and sir john pash was of charles iis creation the one was my uncle sir the other my grandfather  my dear madam i am extremely sorry and most sincerely apologise for my inadvertence but you owe me an apology too my name is not fitzsimons but fitzboodle  what of boodle hallmy husbands old friend of charles is creation my dear sir i beg you a thousand pardons and am delighted to welcome a person of whom i have heard frank say so much frank to berry who soon entered in very glossy boots and a white waistcoat do you know darling i mistook mr fitzboodle for mr fitzsimonsthat horrid irish horsedealing person and i never never never can pardon myself for being so rude to him  the big eyes here assumed an expression that was intended to kill me outright with kindness from being calm still reserved angelica suddenly became gay smiling confidential and folatre she told me she had heard i was a sad creature and that she intended to reform me and that i must come and see frank a great deal  now although mr fitzsimons for whom i was mistaken is as low a fellow as ever came out of dublin and having been a captain in somebodys army is now a blackleg and horsedealer by profession yet if i had brought him home to mrs fitzboodle to dinner i should have liked far better that that imaginary lady should have received him with decent civility and not insulted the stranger within her husbands gates and although it was delightful to be received so cordially when the mistake was discovered yet i found that all berrys old acquaintances were by no means so warmly welcomed for another old schoolchum presently made his appearance who was treated in a very different manner  this was no other than poor jack butts who is a sort of small artist and picturedealer by profession and was a dayboy at slaughter house when we were there and very serviceable in bringing in sausages pots of pickles and other articles of merchandise which we could not otherwise procure the poor fellow has been employed seemingly in the same office of fetcher and carrier ever since and occupied that post for mrs berry it was mr butts have you finished that drawing for lady pashs album and butts produced it and did you match the silk for me at delilles and there was the silk bought no doubt with the poor fellows last five francs and did you go to the furnitureman in the rue st jacques and bring the canaryseed and call about my shawl at that odious dawdling madame fichets and have you brought the guitarstrings  butts hadnt brought the guitarstrings and thereupon mrs berrys countenance assumed the same terrible expression which i had formerly remarked in it and which made me tremble for berry  my dear angelica though said he with some spirit jack butts isnt a baggagewaggon nor a jackofalltrades you make him paint pictures for your womens albums and look after your upholsterer and your canarybird and your milliners and turn rusty because he forgets your last message  i did not turn rusty frank as you call it elegantly im very much obliged to mr butts for performing my commissionsvery much obliged and as for not paying for the pictures to which you so kindly allude frank i should never have thought of offering payment for so paltry a service but im sure i shall be happy to pay if mr butts will send me in his bill  by jove angelica this is too much bounced out berry but the little matrimonial squabble was abruptly ended by berrys french man flinging open the door and announcing miladi pash and doctor dobus which two personages made their appearance  the person of old pash has been already parenthetically described but quite different from her dismal niece in temperament she is as jolly an old widow as ever wore weeds she was attached somehow to the court and has a multiplicity of stories about the princesses and the old king to which mrs berry never fails to call your attention in her grave important way lady pash has ridden many a time to the windsor hounds she made her husband become a member of the fourinhand club and has numberless stories about sir godfrey webster sir john lade and the old heroes of those times she has lent a rouleau to dick sheridan and remembers lord byron when he was a sulky slim young lad she says charles fox was the pleasantest fellow she ever met with and has not the slightest objection to inform you that one of the princes was very much in love with her yet somehow she is only fiftytwo years old and i have never been able to understand her calculation one day or other before her eye went out and before those pearly teeth of hers were stuck to her gums by gold she must have been a prettylooking body enough yet in spite of the latter inconvenience she eats and drinks too much every day and tosses off a glass of maraschino with a trembling pudgy hand every finger of which twinkles with a dozen at least of old rings she has a story about every one of those rings and a stupid one too but there is always something pleasant i think in stupid family stories they are goodhearted people who tell them  as for mrs muchit nothing need be said of her she is pashs companion she has lived with lady pash since the peace nor does my lady take any more notice of her than of the dust of the earth she calls her poor muchit and considers her a halfwitted creature mrs berry hates her cordially and thinks she is a designing toadeater who has formed a conspiracy to rob her of her aunts fortune she never spoke a word to poor muchit during the whole of dinner or offered to help her to anything on the table  in respect to dobus he is an old peninsular man as you are made to know before you have been very long in his company and like most army surgeons is a great deal more military in his looks and conversation than the combatant part of the forces he has adopted the shamdukeofwellington air which is by no means uncommon in veterans and though one of the easiest and softest fellows in existence speaks slowly and briefly and raps out an oath or two occasionally as it is said a certain great captain does besides the above we sat down to table with captain goff late of the  highlanders the reverend lemuel whey who preaches at st germains little cutler and the frenchman who always will be at english parties on the continent and who after making some frightful efforts to speak english subsides and is heard no more young married ladies and heads of families generally have him for the purpose of waltzing and in return he informs his friends of the club or the cafe that he has made the conquest of a charmante anglaise listen to me all family men who read this and never let an unmarried frenchman into your doors this lecture alone is worth the price of the book it is not that they do any harm in one case out of a thousand heaven forbid but they mean harm they look on our susannas with unholy dishonest eyes hearken to two of the grinning rogues chattering together as they clink over the asphalte of the boulevard with lacquered boots and plastered hair and waxed moustaches and turneddown shirtcollars and stays and goggling eyes and hear how they talk of a good simple giddy vain dull baker street creature and canvass her points and show her letters and insinuatenever mind but i tell you my soul grows angry when i think of the same and i cant hear of an englishwoman marrying a frenchman without feeling a sort of shame and pity for her 4  to return to the guests the reverend lemuel whey is a teaparty man with a curl on his forehead and a scented pockethandkerchief he ties his white neckcloth to a wonder and i believe sleeps in it he brings his flute with him and prefers handel of course but has one or two pet profane songs of the sentimental kind and will occasionally lift up his little pipe in a glee he does not dance but the honest fellow would give the world to do it and he leaves his clogs in the passage though it is a wonder he wears them for in the muddiest weather he never has a speck on his foot he was at st johns college cambridge and was rather gay for a term or two he says he is in a word full of the milkandwater of human kindness and his family lives near hackney  as for goff he has a huge shining bald forehead and immense bristling indianred whiskers he wears white washleather gloves drinks fairly likes a rubber and has a story for after dinner beginning doctor ye racklackt sandy mlellan who joined us in the west indies wal sir etc these and little cutler made up the party  now it may not have struck all readers but any sharp fellow conversant with writing must have found out long ago that if there had been something exceedingly interesting to narrate with regard to this dinner at frank berrys i should have come out with it a couple of pages since nor have kept the public looking for so long a time at the dishcovers and ornaments of the table  but the simple fact must now be told that there was nothing of the slightest importance occurred at this repast except that it gave me an opportunity of studying mrs berry in many different ways and in spite of the extreme complaisance which she now showed me of forming i am sorry to say a most unfavourable opinion of that fair lady truth to tell i would much rather she should have been civil to mrs muchit than outrageously complimentary to your humble servant and as she professed not to know what on earth there was for dinner would it not have been much more natural for her not to frown and bob and wink and point and pinch her lips as often as monsieur anatole her french domestic not knowing the ways of english dinnertables placed anything out of its due order the allusions to boodle hall were innumerable and i dont know any greater bore than to be obliged to talk of a place which belongs to ones elder brother many questions were likewise asked about the dowager and her scotch relatives the plumduffs about whom lady pash knew a great deal having seen them at court and at lord melvilles of course she had seen them at court and at lord melvilles as she might have seen thousands of scotchmen besides but what mattered it to me who care not a jot for old lady fitzboodle when you write youll say you met an old friend of her ladyships says mrs berry and i faithfully promised i would when i wrote but if the new post office paid us for writing letters as very possibly it will soon i could not be bribed to send a line to old lady fitz  in a word i found that berry like many simple fellows before him had made choice of an imperious illhumoured and underbred female for a wife and could see with half an eye that he was a great deal too much her slave  the struggle was not over yet however witness that little encounter before dinner and once or twice the honest fellow replied rather smartly during the repast taking especial care to atone as much as possible for his wifes inattention to jack and mrs muchit by particular attention to those personages whom he helped to everything round about and pressed perpetually to champagne he drank but little himself for his amiable wifes eye was constantly fixed on him  just at the conclusion of the dessert madame who had bouded berry during dinnertime became particularly gracious to her lord and master and tenderly asked me if i did not think the french custom was a good one of men leaving table with the ladies  upon my word maam says i i think its a most abominable practice  and so do i says cutler  a most abominable practice do you hear that cries berry laughing and filling his glass  im sure frank when we are alone you always come to the drawingroom replies the lady sharply  oh yes when were alone darling says berry blushing but now were not aloneha ha anatole du bordeaux  im sure they sat after the ladies at carlton house didnt they lady pash says dobus who likes his glass  that they did says my lady giving him a jolly nod  i racklackt exclaims captain goff when i was in the mauritius that mestress macwhirter who commanded the saxtysackond used to say mac if ye want to get lively yell not stop for more than two hours after the leddies have laft ye if ye want to get drunk yell just dine at the mass so ye see mestress barry what was macs allowancehaw haw mester whey ill trouble ye for the olives  but although we were in a clear majority that indomitable woman mrs berry determined to make us all as uneasy as possible and would take the votes all round poor jack of course sided with her and whey said he loved a cup of tea and a little music better than all the wine of bordeaux as for the frenchman when mrs berry said and what do you think m le vicomte  vat you speak said m de blagueval breaking silence for the first time during two hours yaseeh to me you speak  apry deeny aimyvoo ally avec les dam  comment avec les dames  ally avec les dam com a parry ou resty avec les messew com on onglyterre  ah madame vous me le demandez cries the little wretch starting up in a theatrical way and putting out his hand which mrs berry took and with this the ladies left the room old lady pash trotted after her niece with her hand in wheys very much wondering at such practices which were not in the least in vogue in the reign of george iii  mrs berry cast a glance of triumph at her husband at the defection and berry was evidently annoyed that threeeighths of his male forces had left him  but fancy our delight and astonishment when in a minute they all three came back again the frenchman looking entirely astonished and the parson and the painter both very queer the fact is old downright lady pash who had never been in paris in her life before and had no notion of being deprived of her usual hours respite and nap said at once to mrs berry my dear angelica youre surely not going to keep these three men here send them back to the diningroom for ive a thousand things to say to you and angelica who expects to inherit her aunts property of course did as she was bid on which the old lady fell into an easy chair and fell asleep immediatelyso soon that is as the shout caused by the reappearance of the three gentlemen in the diningroom had subsided  i had meanwhile had some private conversation with little cutler regarding the character of mrs berry shes a regular screw whispered he a regular tartar berry shows fight though sometimes and ive known him have his own way for a week together after dinner he is his own master and hers when he has had his share of wine and thats why she will never allow him to drink any  was it a wicked or was it a noble and honourable thought which came to us both at the same minute to rescue berry from his captivity the ladies of course will give their verdict according to their gentle natures but i know what men of courage will think and by their jovial judgment will abide  we received then the three lost sheep back into our innocent fold again with the most joyous shouting and cheering we made berry who was in truth nothing loth order up i dont know how much more claret we obliged the frenchman to drink malgre lui and in the course of a short time we had poor whey in such a state of excitement that he actually volunteered to sing a song which he said he had heard at some very gay supperparty at cambridge and which begins       a pye sat on a peartree       a pye sat on a peartree       a pye sat on a peartree         heighho heighho heighho  fancy mrs berrys face as she looked in in the midst of that bacchanalian ditty when she saw no less a person than the reverend lemuel whey carolling it  is it you my dear cries berry as brave now as any petruchio come in and sit down and hear wheys song  lady pash is asleep frank said she  well darling thats the very reason give mrs berry a glass jack will you  would you wake your aunt sir hissed out madame  never mind me love im awake and like it cried the venerable lady pash from the salon sing away gentlemen  at which we all set up an audacious cheer and mrs berry flounced back to the drawingroom but did not leave the door open that her aunt might hear our melodies  berry had by this time arrived at that confidential state to which a third bottle always brings the wellregulated mind and he made a clean confession to cutler and myself of his numerous matrimonial annoyances he was not allowed to dine out he said and but seldom to ask his friends to meet him at home he never dared smoke a cigar for the life of him not even in the stables he spent the mornings dawdling in eternal shops the evenings at endless teaparties or in reading poems or missionary tracts to his wife he was compelled to take physic whenever she thought he looked a little pale to change his shoes and stockings whenever he came in from a walk look here said he opening his chest and shaking his fist at dobus look what angelica and that infernal dobus have brought me to  i thought it might be a flannel waistcoat into which madame had forced him but it was worse i give you my word of honour it was a pitchplaster  we all roared at this and the doctor as loud as anyone but he vowed that he had no hand in the pitchplaster it was a favourite family remedy of the late apothecary sir george catacomb and had been put on by mrs berrys own fair hands  when anatole came in with coffee berry was in such high courage that he told him to go to the deuce with it and we never caught sight of lady pash more except when muffled up to the nose she passed through the salleamanger to go to her carriage in which dobus and the parson were likewise to be transported to paris be a man frank says she and hold your ownfor the good old lady had taken her nephews part in the matrimonial businessand you mr fitzboodle come and see him often youre a good fellow take old oneeyed callipashs word for it shall i take you to paris  dear kind angelica she had told her aunt all i said  dont go george says berry squeezing me by the hand so i said i was going to sleep at versailles that night but if she would give a convoy to jack butts it would be conferring a great obligation on him with which favour the old lady accordingly complied saying to him with great coolness get up and sit with john in the rumble mr whatdyecallim the fact is the good old soul despises an artist as much as she does a tailor  jack tripped to his place very meekly and remember saturday cried the doctor and dont forget thursday exclaimed the divinea bachelors party you know and so the cavalcade drove thundering down the gloomy old avenue de paris  the frenchman i forgot to say had gone away exceedingly ill long before and the reminiscences of thursday and saturday evoked by dobus and whey were to tell the truth parts of our conspiracy for in the heat of berrys courage we had made him promise to dine with us all round en garcon with all except captain goff who racklacted that he was engaged every day for the next three weeks as indeed he is to a thirtysous ordinary which the gallant officer frequents when not invited elsewhere  cutler and i then were the last on the field and though we were for moving away berry whose vigour had if possible been excited by the bustle and colloquy in the night air insisted upon dragging us back again and actually proposed a grill for supper  we found in the salleamanger a strong smell of an extinguished lamp and mrs berry was snuffing out the candles on the sideboard  hullo my dear shouts berry easy if you please weve not done yet  not done yet mr berry groans the lady in a hollow sepulchral tone  no mrs b not done yet we are going to have some supper aint we george  i think its quite time to go home said mr fitzboodle who to say the truth began to tremble himself  i think it is sir you are quite right sir you will pardon me gentlemen i have a bad headache and will retire  goodnight my dear said that audacious berry anatole tell the cook to broil a fowl and bring some wine  if the loving couple had been alone or if cutler had not been an attache to the embassy before whom she was afraid of making herself ridiculous i am confident that mrs berry would have fainted away on the spot and that all berrys courage would have tumbled down lifeless by the side of her so she only gave a martyrised look and left the room and while we partook of the very unnecessary repast was good enough to sing some hymntunes to an exceedingly slow movement in the next room intimating that she was awake and that though suffering she found her consolations in religion  these melodies did not in the least add to our friends courage the devilled fowl had somehow no devil in it the champagne in the glasses looked exceedingly flat and blue the fact is that cutler and i were now both in a state of dire consternation and soon made a move for our hats and lighting each a cigar in the hall made across the little green where the cupids and nymphs were listening to the dribbling fountain in the dark  im hanged if i dont have a cigar too says berry rushing after us and accordingly putting in his pocket a key about the size of a shovel which hung by the little handle of the outer grille forth he sallied and joined us in our fumigation  he stayed with us a couple of hours and returned homewards in perfect good spirits having given me his word of honour he would dine with us the next day he put his immense key into the grille and unlocked it but the gate would not open it was bolted within  he began to make a furious jangling and ringing at the bell and in oaths both french and english called upon the recalcitrant anatole  after much tolling of the bell a light came cutting across the crevices of the inner door it was thrown open and a figure appeared with a lampa tall slim figure of a woman clothed in white from head to foot  it was mrs berry and when cutler and i saw her we both ran away as fast as our legs could carry us  berry at this shrieked with a wild laughter remember tomorrow old boys shouted hesix oclock and we were a quarter of a mile off when the gate closed and the little mansion of the avenue de paris was once more quiet and dark  the next afternoon as we were playing at billiards cutler saw mrs berry drive by in her carriage and as soon as rather a long rubber was over i thought i would go and look for our poor friend and so went down to the pavilion every door was open as the wont is in france and i walked in unannounced and saw this  he was playing a duet with her on the flute she had been out but for halfanhour after not speaking all the morning and having seen cutler at the billiardroom window and suspecting we might take advantage of her absence she had suddenly returned home again and had flung herself weeping into her franks arms and said she could not bear to leave him in anger and so after sitting for a little while sobbing on his knee she had forgotten and forgiven every thing  the dear angel i met poor frank in bond street only yesterday but he crossed over to the other side of the way he had on goloshes and is grown very fat and pale he has shaved off his moustaches and instead wears a respirator he has taken his name off all his clubs and lives very grimly in baker street well ladies no doubt you say he is right and what are the odds so long as you are happy     dennis haggartys wife   there was an odious irishwoman who with her daughter used to frequent the royal hotel at leamington some years ago and who went by the name of mrs major gam gam had been a distinguished officer in his majestys service whom nothing but death and his own amiable wife could overcome the widow mourned her husband in the most becoming bombazeen she could muster and had at least half an inch of lampblack round the immense visiting tickets which she left at the houses of the nobility and gentry her friends  some of us i am sorry to say used to call her mrs major gammon for if the worthy widow had a propensity it was to talk largely of herself and family of her own family for she held her husbands very cheap and of the wonders of her paternal mansion molloyville county of mayo she was of the molloys of that county and though i never heard of the family before i have little doubt from what mrs major gam stated that they were the most ancient and illustrious family of that part of ireland i remember there came down to see his aunt a young fellow with huge red whiskers and tight nankeens a green coat and an awful breastpin who after two days stay at the spa proposed marriage to miss s or in default a duel with her father and who drove a flash curricle with a bay and a grey and who was presented with much pride by mrs gam as castlereagh molloy of molloyville we all agreed that he was the most insufferable snob of the whole season and were delighted when a bailiff came down in search of him  well this is all i know personally of the molloyville family but at the house if you met the widow gam and talked on any subject in life you were sure to hear of it if you asked her to have peas at dinner she would say oh sir after the peas at molloyville i really dont care for any othersdo i dearest jemima we always had a dish in the month of june when my father gave his head gardener a guinea we had three at molloyville and sent him with his compliments and a quart of peas to our neighbour dear lord marrowfat what a sweet place marrowfat park is isnt it jemima if a carriage passed by the window mrs major gammon would be sure to tell you that there were three carriages at molloyville the barouche the chawiot and the covered cyar in the same manner she would favour you with the number and names of the footmen of the establishment and on a visit to warwick castle for this bustling woman made one in every party of pleasure that was formed from the hotel she gave us to understand that the great walk by the river was altogether inferior to the principal avenue of molloyville park i should not have been able to tell so much about mrs gam and her daughter but that between ourselves i was particularly sweet upon a young lady at the time whose papa lived at the royal and was under the care of doctor jephson  the jemima appealed to by mrs gam in the above sentence was of course her daughter apostrophised by her mother jemima my souls darling or jemima my blessed child or jemima my own love the sacrifices that mrs gam had made for that daughter were she said astonishing the money she had spent in masters upon her the illnesses through which she had nursed her the ineffable love the mother bore her were only known to heaven mrs gam said they used to come into the room with their arms round each others waists at dinner between the courses the mother would sit with one hand locked in her daughters and if only two or three young men were present at the time would be pretty sure to kiss her jemima more than once during the time whilst the bohea was poured out  as for miss gam if she was not handsome candour forbids me to say she was ugly she was neither one nor tother she was a person who wore ringlets and a band round her forehead she knew four songs which became rather tedious at the end of a couple of months acquaintance she had excessively bare shoulders she inclined to wear numbers of cheap ornaments rings brooches ferronnieres smellingbottles and was always we thought very smartly dressed though old mrs lynx hinted that her gowns and her mothers were turned over and over again and that her eyes were almost put out by darning stockings  these eyes miss gam had very large though rather red and weak and used to roll them about at every eligible unmarried man in the place but though the widow subscribed to all the balls though she hired a fly to go to the meet of the hounds though she was constant at church and jemima sang louder than any person there except the clerk and though probably any person who made her a happy husband would be invited down to enjoy the three footmen gardeners and carriages at molloyville yet no english gentleman was found sufficiently audacious to propose old lynx used to say that the pair had been at tunbridge harrogate brighton ramsgate cheltenham for this eight years past where they had met it seemed with no better fortune indeed the widow looked rather high for her blessed child and as she looked with the contempt which no small number of irish people feel upon all persons who get their bread by labour or commerce and as she was a person whose energetic manners costume and brogue were not much to the taste of quiet english country gentlemen jemimasweet spotless flowerstill remained on her hands a thought withered perhaps and seedy  now at this time the 120th regiment was quartered at weedon barracks and with the corps was a certain assistantsurgeon haggarty a large lean tough rawboned man with big hands knockknees and carroty whiskers and withal as honest a creature as ever handled a lancet haggarty as his name imports was of the very same nation as mrs gam and what is more the honest fellow had some of the peculiarities which belonged to the widow and bragged about his family almost as much as she did i do not know of what particular part of ireland they were kings but monarchs they must have been as have been the ancestors of so many thousand hibernian families but they had been men of no small consideration in dublin where my father haggarty said is as well known as king williams statue and where he rowls his carriage too let me tell ye  hence haggarty was called by the wags rowl the carriage and several of them made inquiries of mrs gam regarding him mrs gam when you used to go up from molloyville to the lord lieutenants balls and had your townhouse in fitzwilliam square used you to meet the famous doctor haggarty in society  is it surgeon haggarty of gloucester street ye mean the black papist dye suppose that the molloys would sit down to table with a creature of that sort  why isnt he the most famous physician in dublin and doesnt he rowl his carriage there  the horrid wretch he keeps a shop i tell ye and sends his sons out with the medicine hes got four of them off into the army ulick and phil and terence and denny and now its charles that takes out the physic but how should i know about these odious creatures their mother was a burke of burkes town county cavan and brought surgeon haggarty two thousand pounds she was a protestant and i am surprised how she could have taken up with a horrid odious popish apothecary  from the extent of the widows information i am led to suppose that the inhabitants of dublin are not less anxious about their neighbours than are the natives of english cities and i think it is very probable that mrs gams account of the young haggartys who carried out the medicine is perfectly correct for a lad in the 120th made a caricature of haggarty coming out of a chemists shop with an oilcloth basket under his arm which set the worthy surgeon in such a fury that there would have been a duel between him and the ensign could the fiery doctor have had his way  now dionysius haggarty was of an exceedingly inflammable temperament and it chanced that of all the invalids the visitors the young squires of warwickshire the young manufacturers from birmingham the young officers from the barracksit chanced unluckily for miss gam and himself that he was the only individual who was in the least smitten by her personal charms he was very tender and modest about his love however for it must be owned that he respected mrs gam hugely and fully admitted like a good simple fellow as he was the superiority of that ladys birth and breeding to his own how could he hope that he a humble assistantsurgeon with a thousand pounds his aunt kitty left him for all his fortunehow could he hope that one of the race of molloyville would ever condescend to marry him  inflamed however by love and inspired by wine one day at a picnic at kenilworth haggarty whose love and raptures were the talk of the whole regiment was induced by his waggish comrades to make a proposal in form  are you aware mr haggarty that you are speaking to a molloy was all the reply majestic mrs gam made when according to the usual formula the fluttering jemima referred her suitor to mamma she left him with a look which was meant to crush the poor fellow to earth she gathered up her cloak and bonnet and precipitately called for her fly she took care to tell every single soul in leamington that the son of the odious papist apothecary had had the audacity to propose for her daughter indeed a proposal coming from whatever quarter it may does no harm and left haggarty in a state of extreme depression and despair  his downheartedness indeed surprised most of his acquaintances in and out of the regiment for the young lady was no beauty and a doubtful fortune and dennis was a man outwardly of an unromantic turn who seemed to have a great deal more liking for beefsteak and whiskypunch than for women however fascinating  but there is no doubt this shy uncouth rough fellow had a warmer and more faithful heart hid within him than many a dandy who is as handsome as apollo i for my part never can understand why a man falls in love and heartily give him credit for so doing never mind with what or whom that i take to be a point quite as much beyond an individuals own control as the catching of the smallpox or the colour of his hair to the surprise of all assistantsurgeon dionysius haggarty was deeply and seriously in love and i am told that one day he very nearly killed the beforementioned young ensign with a carvingknife for venturing to make a second caricature representing lady gammon and jemima in a fantastical park surrounded by three gardeners three carriages three footmen and the covered cyar he would have no joking concerning them he became moody and quarrelsome of habit he was for some time much more in the surgery and hospital than in the mess he gave up the eating for the most part of those vast quantities of beef and pudding for which his stomach used to afford such ample and swift accommodation and when the cloth was drawn instead of taking twelve tumblers and singing irish melodies as he used to do in a horrible cracked yelling voice he would retire to his own apartment or gloomily pace the barrackyard or madly whip and spur a grey mare he had on the road to leamington where his jemima although invisible for him still dwelt  the season at leamington coming to a conclusion by the withdrawal of the young fellows who frequented that wateringplace the widow gam retired to her usual quarters for the other months of the year where these quarters were i think we have no right to ask for i believe she had quarrelled with her brother at molloyville and besides was a great deal too proud to be a burden on anybody  not only did the widow quit leamington but very soon afterwards the 120th received its marching orders and left weedon and warwickshire haggartys appetite was by this time partially restored but his love was not altered and his humour was still morose and gloomy i am informed that at this period of his life he wrote some poems relative to his unhappy passion a wild set of verses of several lengths and in his handwriting being discovered upon a sheet of paper in which a pitchplaster was wrapped up which lieutenant and adjutant wheezer was compelled to put on for a cold  fancy then three years afterwards the surprise of all haggartys acquaintances on reading in the public papers the following announcement  married at monkstown on the 12th instant dionysius haggarty esq of hm 120th foot to jemima amelia wilhelmina molloy daughter of the late major lancelot gam rm and granddaughter of the late and niece of the present burke bodkin blake molloy esq molloyville county mayo  has the course of true love at last begun to run smooth thought i as i laid down the paper and the old times and the old leering bragging widow and the high shoulders of her daughter and the jolly days with the 120th and doctor jephsons onehorse chaise and the warwickshire hunt andand louisa s but never mind hercame back to my mind has that goodnatured simple fellow at last met with his reward well if he has not to marry the motherinlaw too he may get on well enough  another year announced the retirement of assistantsurgeon haggarty from the 120th where he was replaced by assistantsurgeon angus rothsay leech a scotchman probably with whom i have not the least acquaintance and who has nothing whatever to do with this little history  still more years passed on during which time i will not say that i kept a constant watch upon the fortunes of mr haggarty and his lady for perhaps if the truth were known i never thought for a moment about them until one day being at kingstown near dublin dawdling on the beach and staring at the hill of howth as most people at that wateringplace do i saw coming towards me a tall gaunt man with a pair of bushy red whiskers of which i thought i had seen the like in former years and a face which could be no other than haggartys it was haggarty ten years older than when we last met and greatly more grim and thin he had on one shoulder a young gentleman in a dirty tartan costume and a face exceedingly like his own peeping from under a battered plume of black feathers while with his other hand he was dragging a light green gocart in which reposed a female infant of some two years old both were roaring with great power of lungs  as soon as dennis saw me his face lost the dull puzzled expression which had seemed to characterise it he dropped the pole of the gocart from one hand and his son from the other and came jumping forward to greet me with all his might leaving his progeny roaring in the road  bless my sowl says he sure its fitzboodle fitz dont you remember me dennis haggarty of the 120th leamington you know molloy my boy hould your tongue and stop your screeching and jemimas too dye hear well it does good to sore eyes to see an old face how fat youre grown fitz and were ye ever in ireland before and ant ye delighted with it confess now isnt it beautiful  this question regarding the merits of their country which i have remarked is put by most irish persons being answered in a satisfactory manner and the shouts of the infants appeased from an applestall hard by dennis and i talked of old times i congratulated him on his marriage with the lovely girl whom we all admired and hoped he had a fortune with her and so forth his appearance however did not bespeak a great fortune he had an old grey hat short old trousers an old waistcoat with regimental buttons and patched blucher boots such as are not usually sported by persons in easy life  ah says he with a sigh in reply to my queries times are changed since them days fitzboodle my wifes not what she wasthe beautiful creature you knew her molloy my boy run off in a hurry to your mamma and tell her an english gentleman is coming home to dine for youll dine with me fitz in course and i agreed to partake of that meal though master molloy altogether declined to obey his papas orders with respect to announcing the stranger  well i must announce you myself said haggarty with a smile come its just dinnertime and my little cottage is not a hundred yards off accordingly we all marched in procession to denniss little cottage which was one of a row and a half of onestoried houses with little courtyards before them and mostly with very fine names on the doorposts of each surgeon haggarty was emblazoned on denniss gate on a stained green copperplate and not content with this on the doorpost above the bell was an oval with the inscription of new molloyville the bell was broken of course the court or gardenpath was mouldy weedy seedy there were some dirty rocks by way of ornament round a faded glassplat in the centre some clothes and rags hanging out of most part of the windows of new molloyville the immediate entrance to which was by a battered scraper under a broken trelliswork up which a withered creeper declined any longer to climb  small but snug says haggarty ill lead the way fitz put your hat on the flowerpot there and turn to the left into the drawingroom a fog of onions and turfsmoke filled the whole of the house and gave signs that dinner was not far off far off you could hear it frizzling in the kitchen where the maid was also endeavouring to hush the crying of a third refractory child but as we entered all three of haggartys darlings were in full roar  is it you dennis cried a sharp raw voice from a dark corner in the drawingroom to which we were introduced and in which a dirty tablecloth was laid for dinner some bottles of porter and a cold muttonbone being laid out on a rickety grand piano hard by yere always late mr haggarty have you brought the whisky from nowlans ill go bail yeve not now  my dear ive brought an old friend of yours and mine to take potluck with us today said dennis  when is he to come said the lady at which speech i was rather surprised for i stood before her  here he is jemima my love answered dennis looking at me mr fitzboodle dont you remember him in warwickshire darling  mr fitzboodle i am very glad to see him said the lady rising and curtseying with much cordiality  mrs haggarty was blind  mrs haggarty was not only blind but it was evident that smallpox had been the cause of her loss of vision her eyes were bound with a bandage her features were entirely swollen scarred and distorted by the horrible effects of the malady she had been knitting in a corner when we entered and was wrapped in a very dirty bedgown her voice to me was quite different to that in which she addressed her husband she spoke to haggarty in broad irish she addressed me in that most odious of all languagesirishenglish endeavouring to the utmost to disguise her brogue and to speak with the true dawdling distingue english air  are you long in ialand said the poor creature in this accent you must faind it a sad babaous place mr fitzboodle im shuah it was vary kaind of you to come upon us en famille and accept a dinner sans ceremonie mr haggarty i hope youll put the waine into aice mr fitzboodle must be melted with this hot weathah  for some time she conducted the conversation in this polite strain and i was obliged to say in reply to a query of hers that i did not find her the least altered though i should never have recognised her but for this rencontre she told haggarty with a significant air to get the wine from the cellah and whispered to me that he was his own butlah and the poor fellow taking the hint scudded away into the town for a pound of beefsteak and a couple of bottles of wine from the tavern  will the childhren get their potatoes and butther here said a barefoot girl with long black hair flowing over her face which she thrust in at the door  let them sup in the nursery elizabeth and sendah edwards to me  is it cook you mane maam said the girl  send her at once shrieked the unfortunate woman and the noise of frying presently ceasing a hot woman made her appearance wiping her brows with her apron and asking with an accent decidedly hibernian what the misthress wanted  lead me up to my dressingroom edwards i really am not fit to be seen in this dishabille by mr fitzboodle  fait i cant says edwards sure the masthers at the butchers and cant look to the kitchenfire  nonsense i must go cried mrs haggarty and edwards putting on a resigned air and giving her arm and face a further rub with her apron held out her arm to mrs dennis and the pair went upstairs  she left me to indulge my reflections for halfanhour at the end of which period she came downstairs dressed in an old yellow satin with the poor shoulders exposed just as much as ever she had mounted a tawdry cap which haggarty himself must have selected for her she had all sorts of necklaces bracelets and earrings in gold in garnets in motherofpearl in ormolu she brought in a furious savour of musk which drove the odours of onions and turfsmoke before it and she waved across her wretched angular mean scarred features an old cambric handkerchief with a yellow laceborder  and so you would have known me anywhere mr fitzboodle said she with a grin that was meant to be most fascinating i was sure you would for though my dreadful illness deprived me of my sight it is a mercy that it did not change my features or complexion at all  this mortification had been spared the unhappy woman but i dont know whether with all her vanity her infernal pride folly and selfishness it was charitable to leave her in her error  yet why correct her there is a quality in certain people which is above all advice exposure or correction only let a man or woman have dulness sufficient and they need bow to no extant authority a dullard recognises no betters a dullard cant see that he is in the wrong a dullard has no scruples of conscience no doubts of pleasing or succeeding or doing right no qualms for other peoples feelings no respect but for the fool himself how can you make a fool perceive he is a fool such a personage can no more see his own folly than he can see his own ears and the great quality of dulness is to be unalterably contented with itself what myriads of souls are there of this admirable sortselfish stingy ignorant passionate brutal bad sons mothers fathers never known to do kind actions  to pause however in this disquisition which was carrying us far off kingstown new molloyville irelandnay into the wide world wherever dulness inhabitslet it be stated that mrs haggarty from my brief acquaintance with her and her mother was of the order of persons just mentioned there was an air of conscious merit about her very hard to swallow along with the infamous dinner poor dennis managed after much delay to get on the table she did not fail to invite me to molloyville where she said her cousin would be charmed to see me and she told me almost as many anecdotes about that place as her mother used to impart in former days i observed moreover that dennis cut her the favourite pieces of the beefsteak that she ate thereof with great gusto and that she drank with similar eagerness of the various strong liquors at table we irish ladies are all fond of a leetle glass of punch she said with a playful air and dennis mixed her a powerful tumbler of such violent grog as i myself could swallow only with some difficulty she talked of her suffering a great deal of her sacrifices of the luxuries to which she had been accustomed before marriagein a word of a hundred of those themes on which some ladies are in the custom of enlarging when they wish to plague some husbands  but honest dennis far from being angry at this perpetual wearisome impudent recurrence to her own superiority rather encouraged the conversation than otherwise it pleased him to hear his wife discourse about her merits and family splendours he was so thoroughly beaten down and henpecked that he as it were gloried in his servitude and fancied that his wifes magnificence reflected credit on himself he looked towards me who was half sick of the woman and her egotism as if expecting me to exhibit the deepest sympathy and flung me glances across the table as much as to say what a gifted creature my jemima is and what a fine fellow i am to be in possession of her when the children came down she scolded them of course and dismissed them abruptly for which circumstance perhaps the writer of these pages was not in his heart very sorry and after having sat a preposterously long time left us asking whether we would have coffee there or in her boudoir  oh here of course said dennis with rather a troubled air and in about ten minutes the lovely creature was led back to us again by edwards and the coffee made its appearance after coffee her husband begged her to let mr fitzboodle hear her voice he longs for some of his old favourites  no do you said she and was led in triumph to the jingling old piano and with a screechy wiry voice sang those very abominable old ditties which i had heard her sing at leamington ten years back  haggarty as she sang flung himself back in the chair delighted husbands always are and with the same song one that they have heard when they were nineteen years old probably most englishmens tunes have that date and it is rather affecting i think to hear an old gentleman of sixty or seventy quavering the old ditty that was fresh when he was fresh and in his prime if he has a musical wife depend on it he thinks her old songs of 1788 are better than any he has heard since in fact he has heard none since when the old couple are in high goodhumour the old gentleman will take the old lady round the waist and say my dear do sing me one of your own songs and she sits down and sings with her old voice and as she sings the roses of her youth bloom again for a moment ranelagh resuscitates and she is dancing a minuet in powder and a train  this is another digression it was occasioned by looking at poor denniss face while his wife was screeching and believe me the former was the more pleasant occupation bottom tickled by the fairies could not have been in greater ecstasies he thought the music was divine and had further reason for exulting in it which was that his wife was always in a good humour after singing and never would sing but in that happy frame of mind dennis had hinted so much in our little colloquy during the ten minutes of his ladys absence in the boudoir so at the conclusion of each piece we shouted bravo and clapped our hands like mad  such was my insight into the life of surgeon dionysius haggarty and his wife and i must have come upon him at a favourable moment too for poor dennis has spoken subsequently of our delightful evening at kingstown and evidently thinks to this day that his friend was fascinated by the entertainment there his inward economy was as follows he had his halfpay a thousand pounds about a hundred a year that his father left and his wife had sixty pounds a year from the mother which the mother of course never paid he had no practice for he was absorbed in attention to his jemima and the children whom he used to wash to dress to carry out to walk or to ride as we have seen and who could not have a servant as their dear blind mother could never be left alone mrs haggarty a great invalid used to lie in bed till one and have breakfast and hot luncheon there a fifth part of his income was spent in having her wheeled about in a chair by which it was his duty to walk daily for an allotted number of hours dinner would ensue and the amateur clergy who abound in ireland and of whom mrs haggarty was a great admirer lauded her everywhere as a model of resignation and virtue and praised beyond measure the admirable piety with which she bore her sufferings  well every man to his taste it did not certainly appear to me that she was the martyr of the family  the circumstances of my marriage with jemima dennis said to me in some after conversations we had on this interesting subject were the most romantic and touching you can conceive you saw what an impression the dear girl had made upon me when we were at weedon for from the first day i set eyes on her and heard her sing her delightful song of darkeyed maiden of araby i felt and said to turniquet of ours that very night that she was the darkeyed maid of araby for menot that she was you know for she was born in shropshire but i felt that i had seen the woman who was to make me happy or miserable for life you know how i proposed for her at kenilworth and how i was rejected and how i almost shot myself in consequenceno you dont know that for i said nothing about it to anyone but i can tell you it was a very near thing and a very lucky thing for me i didnt do it forwould you believe itthe dear girl was in love with me all the time  was she really said i who recollected that miss gams love of those days showed itself in a very singular manner but the fact is when women are most in love they most disguise it  over head and ears in love with poor dennis resumed that worthy fellow whod ever have thought it but i have it from the best authority from her own mother with whom im not over and above good friends now but of this fact she assured me and ill tell you when and how  we were quartered at cork three years after we were at weedon and it was our last year at home and a great mercy that my dear girl spoke in time or where should we have been now well one day marching home from parade i saw a lady seated at an open window by another who seemed an invalid and the lady at the window who was dressed in the profoundest mourning cried out with a scream gracious heavens its mr haggarty of the 120th  sure i know that voice says i to whiskerton  its a great mercy you dont know it a deal too well says he its lady gammon shes on some husbandhunting scheme depend on it for that daughter of hers she was at bath last year on the same errand and at cheltenham the year before where heaven bless you shes as well known as the hen and chickens  ill thank you not to speak disrespectfully of miss jemima gam said i to whiskerton shes of one of the first families in ireland and whoever says a word against a woman i once proposed for insults medo you understand  well marry her if you like says whiskerton quite peevish marry her and be hanged  marry her the very idea of it set my brain awhirling and made me a thousand times more mad than i am by nature  you may be sure i walked up the hill to the paradeground that afternoon and with a beating heart too i came to the widows house it was called new molloyville as this is wherever she takes a house for six months she calls it new molloyville and has had one in mallow in bandon in sligo in castlebar in fermoy in drogheda and the deuce knows where besides but the blinds were down and though i thought i saw somebody behind em no notice was taken of poor denny haggarty and i paced up and down all messtime in hopes of catching a glimpse of jemima but in vain the next day i was on the ground again i was just as much in love as ever thats the fact id never been in that way before look you and when once caught i knew it was for life  theres no use in telling you how long i beat about the bush but when i did get admittance to the house it was through the means of young castlereagh molloy whom you may remember at leamington and who was at cork for the regatta and used to dine at our mess and had taken a mighty fancy to mewhen i did get into the house i say i rushed in medias res at once i couldnt keep myself quiet my heart was too full  oh fitz i shall never forget the daythe moment i was inthrojuiced into the dthrawingroom as he began to be agitated denniss brogue broke out with greater richness than ever but though a stranger may catch and repeat from memory a few words it is next to impossible for him to keep up a conversation in irish so that we had best give up all attempts to imitate dennis when i saw old mother gam said he my feelings overcame me all at once i rowled down on the ground sir as if id been hit by a musketball dearest madam says i ill die if you dont give me jemima  heavens mr haggarty says she how you seize me with surprise castlereagh my dear nephew had you not better leave us and away he went lighting a cigar and leaving me still on the floor  rise mr haggarty continued the widow i will not attempt to deny that this constancy towards my daughter is extremely affecting however sudden your present appeal may be i will not attempt to deny that perhaps jemima may have a similar feeling but as i said i never could give my daughter to a catholic  im as good a protestant as yourself maam says i my mother was an heiress and we were all brought up her way  that makes the matter very different says she turning up the whites of her eyes how could i ever have reconciled it to my conscience to see my blessed child married to a papist how could i ever have taken him to molloyville well this obstacle being removed i must put myself no longer in the way between two young people i must sacrifice myself as i always have when my darling girl was in question you shall see her the poor dear lovely gentle sufferer and learn your fate from her own lips  the sufferer maam says i has miss gam been ill  what havent you heard cried the widow havent you heard of the dreadful illness which so nearly carried her from me for nine weeks mr haggarty i watched her day and night without taking a wink of sleepfor nine weeks she lay trembling between death and life and i paid the doctor eightythree guineas she is restored now but she is the wreck of the beautiful creature she was suffering and perhaps another disappointmentbut we wont mention that nowhave so pulled her down but i will leave you and prepare my sweet girl for this strange this entirely unexpected visit  i wont tell you what took place between me and jemima to whom i was introduced as she sat in the darkened room poor sufferer nor describe to you with what a thrill of joy i seized after groping about for it her poor emaciated hand she did not withdraw it i came out of that room an engaged man sir and now i was enabled to show her that i had always loved her sincerely for there was my will made three years back in her favour that night she refused me as i told ye i would have shot myself but theyd have brought me in non compos and my brother mick would have contested the will and so i determined to live in order that she might benefit by my dying i had but a thousand pounds then since that my father has left me two more i willed every shilling to her as you may fancy and settled it upon her when we married as we did soon after it was not for some time that i was allowed to see the poor girls face or indeed was aware of the horrid loss she had sustained fancy my agony my dear fellow when i saw that beautiful wreck  there was something not a little affecting to think in the conduct of this brave fellow that he never once as he told his story seemed to allude to the possibility of his declining to marry a woman who was not the same as the woman he loved but that he was quite as faithful to her now as he had been when captivated by the poor tawdry charms of the silly miss of leamington it was hard that such a noble heart as this should be flung away upon yonder foul mass of greedy vanity was it hard or not that he should remain deceived in his obstinate humility and continue to admire the selfish silly being whom he had chosen to worship  i should have been appointed surgeon of the regiment continued dennis soon after when it was ordered abroad to jamaica where it now is but my wife would not hear of going and said she would break her heart if she left her mother so i retired on halfpay and took this cottage and in case any practice should fall in my waywhy there is my name on the brass plate and im ready for anything that comes but the only case that ever did come was one day when i was driving my wife in the chaise and another one night of a beggar with a broken head my wife makes me a present of a baby every year and weve no debts and between you and me and the post as long as my motherinlaw is out of the house im as happy as i need be  what you and the old lady dont get on well said i  i cant say we do its not in nature you know said dennis with a faint grin she comes into the house and turns it topsyturvy when shes here im obliged to sleep in the scullery shes never paid her daughters income since the first year though she brags about her sacrifices as if she had ruined herself for jemima and besides when shes here theres a whole clan of the molloys horse foot and dragoons that are quartered upon us and eat me out of house and home  and is molloyville such a fine place as the widow described it asked i laughing and not a little curious  oh a mighty fine place entirely said dennis theres the oak park of two hundred acres the finest land ye ever saw only theyve cut all the wood down the garden in the old molloys time they say was the finest ever seen in the west of ireland but theyve taken all the glass to mend the house windows and small blame to them either theres a clear rentroll of thirtyfive hundred a year only its in the hand of receivers besides other debts for which there is no land security  your cousininlaw castlereagh molloy wont come into a large fortune  oh hell do very well said dennis as long as he can get credit hes not the fellow to stint himself faith i was fool enough to put my name to a bit of paper for him and as they could not catch him in mayo they laid hold of me at kingstown here and there was a pretty to do didnt mrs gam say i was ruining her family thats all i paid it by instalments for all my money is settled on jemima and castlereagh whos an honourable fellow offered me any satisfaction in life anyhow he couldnt do more than that  of course not and now youre friends  yes and he and his aunt have had a tiff too and he abuses her properly i warrant ye he says that she carried about jemima from place to place and flung her at the head of every unmarried man in england amostmy poor jemima and she all the while dying in love with me as soon as she got over the smallpoxshe took it at fermoygod bless her i wish id been by to be her nursetenderas soon as she was rid of it the old lady said to castlereagh castlereagh go to the barcks and find out in the army list where the 120th is off she came to cork hot foot it appears that while she was ill jemimas love for me showed itself in such a violent way that her mother was overcome and promised that should the dear child recover she would try and bring us together castlereagh says she would have gone after us to jamaica  i have no doubt she would said i  could you have a stronger proof of love than that cried dennis my dear girls illness and frightful blindness have of course injured her health and her temper she cannot in her position look to the children you know and so they come under my charge for the most part and her temper is unequal certainly but you see what a sensitive refined elegant creature she is and may fancy that shes often put out by a rough fellow like me  here dennis left me saying it was time to go and walk out the children and i think his story has matter of some wholesome reflection in it for bachelors who are about to change their condition or may console some who are mourning their celibacy marry gentlemen if you like leave your comfortable dinner at the club for coldmutton and curlpapers at your home give up your books or pleasures and take to yourselves wives and children but think well on what you do first as i have no doubt you will after this advice and example advice is always useful in matters of love men always take it they always follow other peoples opinions not their own they always profit by example when they see a pretty woman and feel the delicious madness of love coming over them they always stop to calculate her temper her money their own money or suitableness for the married life ha ha ha let us fool in this way no more i have been in love fortythree times with all ranks and conditions of women and would have married every time if they would have let me how many wives had king solomon the wisest of men and is not that story a warning to us that love is master of the wisest it is only fools who defy him  i must come however to the last and perhaps the saddest part of poor denny haggartys history i met him once more and in such a condition as made me determine to write this history  in the month of june last i happened to be at richmond a delightful little place of retreat and there sunning himself upon the terrace was my old friend of the 120th he looked older thinner poorer and more wretched than i had ever seen him what you have given up kingstown said i shaking him by the hand  yes says he  and is my lady and your family here at richmond  no says he with a sad shake of the head and the poor fellows hollow eyes filled with tears  good heavens denny whats the matter said i he was squeezing my hand like a vice as i spoke  theyve left me he burst out with a dreadful shout of passionate griefa horrible scream which seemed to be wrenched out of his heart left me said he sinking down on a seat and clenching his great fists and shaking his lean arms wildly im a wise man now mr fitzboodle jemima has gone away from me and yet you know how i loved her and how happy we were ive got nobody now but ill die soon thats one comfort and to think its she thatll kill me after all  the story which he told with a wild and furious lamentation such as is not known among men of our cooler country and such as i dont like now to recall was a very simple one the motherinlaw had taken possession of the house and had driven him from it his property at his marriage was settled on his wife she had never loved him and told him this secret at last and drove him out of doors with her selfish scorn and illtemper the boy had died the girls were better he said brought up among the molloys than they could be with him and so he was quite alone in the world and was living or rather dying on forty pounds a year  his troubles are very likely over by this time the two fools who caused his misery will never read this history of him they never read godless stories in magazines and i wish honest reader that you and i went to church as much as they do these people are not wicked because of their religious observances but in spite of them they are too dull to understand humility too blind to see a tender and simple heart under a rough ungainly bosom they are sure that all their conduct towards my poor friend here has been perfectly righteous and that they have given proofs of the most christian virtue haggartys wife is considered by her friends as a martyr to a savage husband and her mother is the angel that has come to rescue her all they did was to cheat him and desert him and safe in that wonderful selfcomplacency with which the fools of this earth are endowed they have not a single pang of conscience for their villany towards him consider their heartlessness as a proof and consequence of their spotless piety and virtue     footnotes  footnote 1 the words of this song are copyright nor will the copyright be sold for less than twopencehalfpenny  footnote 2 a french proverbe furnished the author with the notion of the rivalry between the barber and the tailor  footnote 3 as it is very probable that many fair readers may not approve of the extremely forcible language in which the combat is depicted i beg them to skip it and pass on to the next chapter and to remember that it has been modelled on the style of the very best writers of the sporting papers  footnote 4 every person who has lived abroad can of course point out a score of honourable exceptions to the case above hinted at and knows many such unions in which it is the frenchman who honours the english lady by marrying her but it must be remembered that marrying in france means commonly fortunehunting and as for the respect in which marriage is held in france let all the french novels in m rolandis library be perused by those who wish to come to a decision upon the question
