75930920	waifs and strays   by  o henry     part i  twelve stories    contents    the red roses of tonia   round the circle   the rubber plants story   out of nazareth   confessions of a humorist   the sparrows in madison square   hearts and hands   the cactus   the detective detector   the dog and the playlet   a little talk about mobs   the snow man     the red roses of tonia  a trestle burned down on the international railroad  the southbound from san antonio was cut off for the next fortyeight hours on that train was tonia weavers easter hat  espirition the mexican who had been sent forty miles in a buckboard from the espinosa ranch to fetch it returned with a shrugging shoulder and hands empty except for a cigarette  at the small station nopal he had learned of the delayed train and having no commands to wait turned his ponies toward the ranch again  now if one supposes that easter the goddess of spring cares any more for the afterchurch parade on fifth avenue than she does for her loyal outfit of subjects that assemble at the meetinghouse at cactus tex a mistake has been made  the wives and daughters of the ranchmen of the frio country put forth easter blossoms of new hats and gowns as faithfully as is done anywhere and the southwest is for one day a mingling of prickly pear paris and paradise and now it was good friday and tonia weavers easter hat blushed unseen in the desert air of an impotent express car beyond the burned trestle  on saturday noon the rogers girls from the shoestring ranch and ella reeves from the anchoro and mrs bennet and ida from green valley would convene at the espinosa and pick up tonia  with their easter hats and frocks carefully wrapped and bundled against the dust the fair aggregation would then merrily jog the ten miles to cactus where on the morrow they would array themselves subjugate man do homage to easter and cause jealous agitation among the lilies of the field  tonia sat on the steps of the espinosa ranch house flicking gloomily with a quirt at a tuft of curly mesquite  she displayed a frown and a contumelious lip and endeavored to radiate an aura of disagreeableness and tragedy  i hate railroads she announced positively  and men  men pretend to run them  can you give any excuse why a trestle should burn  ida bennets hat is to be trimmed with violets  i shall not go one step toward cactus without a new hat  if i were a man i would get one  two men listened uneasily to this disparagement of their kind one was wells pearson foreman of the mucho calor cattle ranch  the other was thompson burrows the prosperous sheepman from the quintana valley both thought tonia weaver adorable especially when she railed at railroads and menaced men  either would have given up his epidermis to make for her an easter hat more cheerfully than the ostrich gives up his tip or the aigrette lays down its life  neither possessed the ingenuity to conceive a means of supplying the sad deficiency against the coming sabbath  pearsons deep brown face and sunburned light hair gave him the appearance of a schoolboy seized by one of youths profound and insolvable melancholies  tonias plight grieved him through and through  thompson burrows was the more skilled and pliable  he hailed from somewhere in the east originally and he wore neckties and shoes and was made dumb by womans presence  the big waterhole on sandy creek said pearson scarcely hoping to make a hit was filled up by that last rain  oh  was it said tonia sharply  thank you for the information i suppose a new hat is nothing to you mr pearson  i suppose you think a woman ought to wear an old stetson five years without a change as you do  if your old waterhole could have put out the fire on that trestle you might have some reason to talk about it  i am deeply sorry said burrows warned by pearsons fate that you failed to receive your hat miss weaverdeeply sorry indeed if there was anything i could do  dont bother interrupted tonia with sweet sarcasm  if there was anything you could do youd be doing it of course  there isnt  tonia paused  a sudden sparkle of hope had come into her eye  her frown smoothed away  she had an inspiration  theres a store over at lone elm crossing on the nueces she said that keeps hats  eva rogers got hers there  she said it was the latest style  it might have some left  but its twentyeight miles to lone elm  the spurs of two men who hastily arose jingled and tonia almost smiled  the knights then were not all turned to dust nor were their rowels rust  of course said tonia looking thoughtfully at a white gulf cloud sailing across the cerulean dome nobody could ride to lone elm and back by the time the girls call by for me tomorrow  so i reckon ill have to stay at home this easter sunday  and then she smiled  well miss tonia said pearson reaching for his hat as guileful as a sleeping babe  i reckon ill be trotting along back to mucho calor theres some cutting out to be done on dry branch first thing in the morning and me and road runner has got to be on hand  its too bad your hat got sidetracked  maybe theyll get that trestle mended yet in time for easter  i must be riding too miss tonia announced burrows looking at his watch  i declare its nearly five oclock  i must be out at my lambing camp in time to help pen those crazy ewes  tonias suitors seemed to have been smitten with a need for haste they bade her a ceremonious farewell and then shook each others hands with the elaborate and solemn courtesy of the southwesterner  hope ill see you again soon mr pearson said burrows  same here said the cowman with the serious face of one whose friend goes upon a whaling voyage  be gratified to see you ride over to mucho calor any time you strike that section of the range  pearson mounted road runner the soundest cowpony on the frio and let him pitch for a minute as he always did on being mounted even at the end of a days travel  what kind of a hat was that miss tonia he called that you ordered from san antone  i cant help but be sorry about that hat  a straw said tonia the latest shape of course trimmed with red roses  thats what i likered roses  theres no color more becoming to your complexion and hair said burrows admiringly  its what i like said tonia  and of all the flowers give me red roses  keep all the pinks and blues for yourself  but whats the use when trestles burn and leave you without anything  itll be a dry old easter for me  pearson took off his hat and drove road runner at a gallop into the chaparral east of the espinosa ranch house  as his stirrups rattled against the brush burrowss longlegged sorrel struck out down the narrow stretch of open prairie to the southwest  tonia hung up her quirt and went into the sittingroom  im mighty sorry daughter that you didnt get your hat said her mother  oh dont worry mother said tonia coolly  ill have a new hat all right in time tomorrow   when burrows reached the end of the strip of prairie he pulled his sorrel to the right and let him pick his way daintily across a sacuista flat through which ran the ragged dry bed of an arroyo then up a gravelly hill matted with bush the hoarse scrambled and at length emerged with a snort of satisfaction into a stretch of high level prairie grassy and dotted with the lighter green of mesquites in their fresh spring foliage  always to the right burrows bore until in a little while he struck the old indian trail that followed the nueces southward and that passed twentyeight miles to the southeast through lone elm  here burrows urged the sorrel into a steady lope  as he settled himself in the saddle for a long ride he heard the drumming of hoofs the hollow thwack of chaparral against wooden stirrups the whoop of a  comanche and wells pearson burst out of the brush at the right of the trail like a precocious yellow chick from a dark green easter egg  except in the presence of awing femininity melancholy found no place in pearsons bosom  in tonias presence his voice was as soft as a summer bullfrogs in his reedy nest  now at his gleesome yawp rabbits a mile away ducked their ears and sensitive plants closed their fearful fronds  moved your lambing camp pretty far from the ranch havent you neighbor asked pearson as road runner fell in at the sorrels side  twentyeight miles said burrows looking a little grim  pearsons laugh woke an owl one hour too early in his waterelm on the river bank half a mile away  all right for you sheepman  i like an open game myself  were two locoed hemilliners hathunting in the wilderness  i notify you burr to mind your corrals  weve got an even start and the one that gets the headgear will stand some higher at the espinosa  youve got a good pony said burrows eyeing road runners barrellike body and tapering legs that moved as regularly as the pistonrod of an engine  its a race of course but youre too much of a horseman to whoop it up this soon  say we travel together till we get to the home stretch  im your company agreed pearson and i admire your sense  if theres hats at lone elm one of em shall set on miss tonias brow tomorrow and you wont be at the crowning  i aint bragging burr but that sorrel of yours is weak in the forelegs  my horse against yours offered burrows that miss tonia wears the hat i take her to cactus tomorrow  ill take you up shouted pearson  but oh its just like horsestealing for me  i can use that sorrel for a ladys animal whenwhen somebody comes over to mucho calor and  burrows dark face glowered so suddenly that the cowman broke off his sentence  but pearson could never feel any pressure for long  whats all this easter business about burr he asked cheerfully why do the women folks have to have new hats by the almanac or bust all cinches trying to get em  its a seasonable statute out of the testaments explained burrows its ordered by the pope or somebody  and it has something to do with the zodiac i dont know exactly but i think it was invented by the egyptians  its an allright jubilee if the heathens did put their brand on it said pearson or else tonia wouldnt have anything to do with it  and they pull it off at church too  suppose there aint but one hat in the lone elm store burr  then said burrows darkly the best man of usll take it back to the espinosa  oh man cried pearson throwing his hat high and catching it again theres nothing like you come off the sheep ranges before you talk good and collateral to the occasion  and if theres more than one  then said burrows well pick our choice and one of usll get back first with his and the other wont  there never was two souls proclaimed pearson to the stars that beat more like one heart than yourn and mine  me and you might be riding on a unicorn and thinking out of the same piece of mind  at a little past midnight the riders loped into lone elm the half a hundred houses of the big village were dark  on its only street the big wooden store stood barred and shuttered  in a few moments the horses were fastened and pearson was pounding cheerfully on the door of old sutton the storekeeper  the barrel of a winchester came through a cranny of a solid window shutter followed by a short inquiry  wells pearson of the mucho calor and burrows of green valley was the response  we want to buy some goods in the store  sorry to wake you up but we must have em  come on out uncle tommy and get a move on you  uncle tommy was slow but at length they got him behind his counter with a kerosene lamp lit and told him of their dire need  easter hats said uncle tommy sleepily  why yes i believe i have got just a couple left  i only ordered a dozen this spring ill show em to you  now uncle tommy sutton was a merchant half asleep or awake  in dusty pasteboard boxes under the counter he had two leftover spring hats but alas for his commercial probity on that early saturday mornthey were hats of two springs ago and a womans eye would have detected the fraud at half a glance  but to the unintelligent gaze of the cowpuncher and the sheepman they seemed fresh from the mint of contemporaneous april  the hats were of a variety once known as cartwheels  they were of stiff straw colored red and flat brimmed  both were exactly alike and trimmed lavishly around their crowns with full blown immaculate artificial white roses  that all you got uncle tommy said pearson  all right not much choice here burr  take your pick  theyre the latest styles lied uncle tommy  youd see em on fifth avenue if you was in new york  uncle tommy wrapped and tied each hat in two yards of dark calico for a protection  one pearson tied carefully to his calfskin saddlethongs and the other became part of road runners burden  they shouted thanks and farewells to uncle tommy and cantered back into the night on the home stretch  the horsemen jockeyed with all their skill  they rode more slowly on their way back  the few words they spoke were not unfriendly burrows had a winchester under his left leg slung over his saddle horn pearson had a six shooter belted around him  thus men rode in the frio country  at halfpast seven in the morning they rode to the top of a hill and saw the espinosa ranch a white spot under a dark patch of liveoaks five miles away  the sight roused pearson from his drooping pose in the saddle he knew what road runner could do  the sorrel was lathered and stumbling frequently road runner was pegging away like a donkey engine  pearson turned toward the sheepman and laughed  goodbye burr he cried with a wave of his hand  its a race now  were on the home stretch  he pressed road runner with his knees and leaned toward the espinosa road runner struck into a gallop with tossing head and snorting nostrils as if he were fresh from a month in pasture  pearson rode twenty yards and heard the unmistakable sound of a winchester lever throwing a cartridge into the barrel  he dropped flat along his horses back before the crack of the rifle reached his ears  it is possible that burrows intended only to disable the horsehe was a good enough shot to do that without endangering his rider but as pearson stooped the ball went through his shoulder and then through road runners neck  the horse fell and the cowman pitched over his head into the hard road and neither of them tried to move  burrows rode on without stopping  in two hours pearson opened his eyes and took inventory he managed to get to his feet and staggered back to where road runner was lying  road runner was lying there but he appeared to be comfortable pearson examined him and found that the bullet had creased him he had been knocked out temporarily but not seriously hurt  but he was tired and he lay there on miss tonias hat and ate leaves from a mesquite branch that obligingly hung over the road  pearson made the horse get up  the easter hat loosed from the saddlethongs lay there in its calico wrappings a shapeless thing from its sojourn beneath the solid carcass of road runner  then pearson fainted and fell head long upon the poor hat again crumpling it under his wounded shoulders  it is hard to kill a cowpuncher in half an hour he revivedlong enough for a woman to have fainted twice and tried icecream for a restorer he got up carefully and found road runner who was busy with the nearby grass he tied the unfortunate hat to the saddle again and managed to get himself there too after many failures  at noon a gay and fluttering company waited in front of the espinosa ranch  the rogers girls were there in their new buckboard and the anchoro outfit and the green valley folksmostly women  and each and every one wore her new easter hat even upon the lonely prairies for they greatly desired to shine forth and do honor to the coming festival  at the gate stood tonia with undisguised tears upon her cheeks in her hand she held burrows lone elm hat and it was at its white roses hated by her that she wept  for her friends were telling her with the ecstatic joy of true friends that cartwheels could not be worn being three seasons passed into oblivion  put on your old hat and come tonia they urged  for easter sunday she answered  ill die first  and wept again  the hats of the fortunate ones were curved and twisted into the style of springs latest proclamation  a strange being rode out of the brush among them and there sat his horse languidly  he was stained and disfigured with the green of the grass and the limestone of rocky roads  hallo pearson said daddy weaver  look like youve been breaking a mustang  whats that youve got tied to your saddlea pig in a poke  oh come on tonia if youre going said betty rogers  we mustnt wait any longer  weve saved a seat in the buckboard for you  never mind the hat  that lovely muslin youve got on looks sweet enough with any old hat  pearson was slowly untying the queer thing on his saddle  tonia looked at him with a sudden hope  pearson was a man who created hope  he got the thing loose and handed it to her  her quick fingers tore at the strings  best i could do said pearson slowly  what road runner and me done to it will be about all it needs  oh oh its just the right shape shrieked tonia  and red roses wait till i try it on  she flew in to the glass and out again beaming radiating blossomed  oh dont red become her chanted the girls in recitative  hurry up tonia  tonia stopped for a moment by the side of road runner  thank you thank you wells she said happily  its just what i wanted  wont you come over to cactus tomorrow and go to church with me  if i can said pearson  he was looking curiously at her hat and then he grinned weakly  tonia flew into the buckboard like a bird  the vehicles sped away for cactus  what have you been doing pearson asked daddy weaver  you aint looking so well as common  me said pearson  ive been painting flowers  them roses was white when i left lone elm  help me down daddy weaver for i havent got any more paint to spare    round the circle  this story is especially interesting as an early treatment 1902 of the theme afterward developed with a surer hand in the pendulum   find yo shirt all right sam asked mrs webber from her chair under the liveoak where she was comfortably seated with a paperback volume for company  it balances perfeckly marthy answered sam with a suspicious pleasantness in his tone  at first i was about ter be a little reckless and kick cause ther buttons was all off but since i diskiver that the button holes is all busted out why i wouldnt go so fur as to say the buttons is any loss to speak of  oh well said his wife carelessly put on your necktiethatll keep it together  sam webbers sheep ranch was situated in the loneliest part of the country between the nueces and the frio  the ranch housea tworoom box structurewas on the rise of a gently swelling hill in the midst of a wilderness of high chaparral  in front of it was a small clearing where stood the sheep pens shearing shed and wool house only a few feet back of it began the thorny jungle  sam was going to ride over to the chapman ranch to see about buying some more improved merino rams  at length he came out ready for his ride  this being a business trip of some importance and the chapman ranch being almost a small town in population and size sam had decided to dress up accordingly  the result was that he had transformed himself from a graceful picturesque frontiersman into something much less pleasing to the sight  the tight white collar awkwardly constricted his muscular mahoganycolored neck  the buttonless shirt bulged in stiff waves beneath his unbuttoned vest the suit of readymade effectually concealed the fine lines of his straight athletic figure  his berrybrown face was set to the melancholy dignity befitting a prisoner of state  he gave randy his threeyearold son a pat on the head and hurried out to where mexico his favorite saddle horse was standing  marthy leisurely rocking in her chair fixed her place in the book with her finger and turned her head smiling mischievously as she noted the havoc sam had wrought with his appearance in trying to fix up  well ef i must say it sam she drawled you look jest like one of them hayseeds in the picture papers stead of a free and independent sheepman of the state o texas  sam climbed awkwardly into the saddle  youre the one ought to be shamed to say so he replied hotly stead of tendin to a mans clothes youre alays setting around areadin them billybydam yallerback novils  oh shet up and ride along said mrs webber with a little jerk at the handles of her chair you always fussin bout my readin  i do aplenty and ill read when i wanter  i live in the bresh here like a varmint never seein nor hearin nothin and what other musement kin i have  not in listenin to you talk for its complain complain one day after another  oh go on sam and leave me in peace  sam gave his pony a squeeze with his knees and shoved down the wagon trail that connected his ranch with the old open government road  it was eight oclock and already beginning to be very warm he should have started three hours earlier  chapman ranch was only eighteen miles away but there was a road for only three miles of the distance he had ridden over there once with one of the halfmoon cowpunchers and he had the direction welldefined in his mind  sam turned off the old government road at the split mesquite and struck down the arroyo of the quintanilla  here was a narrow stretch of smiling valley upholstered with a rich mat of green curly mesquite grass and mexico consumed those few miles quickly with his long easy lope  again upon reaching wild duck waterhole must he abandon welldefined ways  he turned now to his right up a little hill pebblecovered upon which grew only the tenacious and thorny prickly pear and chaparral  at the summit of this he paused to take his last general view of the landscape for from now on he must wind through brakes and thickets of chaparral pear and mesquite for the most part seeing scarcely farther than twenty yards in any direction choosing his way by the prairiedwellers instinct guided only by an occasional glimpse of a far distant hilltop a peculiarly shaped knot of trees or the position of the sun  sam rode down the sloping hill and plunged into the great pear flat that lies between the quintanilla and the piedra  in about two hours he discovered that he was lost  then came the usual confusion of mind and the hurry to get somewhere  mexico was anxious to redeem the situation twisting with alacrity along the tortuous labyrinths of the jungle  at the moment his masters sureness of the route had failed his horse had divined the fact there were no hills now that they could climb to obtain a view of the country  they came upon a few but so dense and interlaced was the brush that scarcely could a rabbit penetrate the mass  they were in the great lonely thicket of the frio bottoms  it was a mere nothing for a cattleman or a sheepman to be lost for a day or a night  the thing often happened  it was merely a matter of missing a meal or two and sleeping comfortably on your saddle blankets on a soft mattress of mesquite grass  but in sams case it was different  he had never been away from his ranch at night marthy was afraid of the countryafraid of mexicans of snakes of panthers even of sheep  so he had never left her alone  it must have been about four in the afternoon when sams conscience awoke  he was limp and drenched rather from anxiety than the heat or fatigue  until now he had been hoping to strike the trail that led to the frio crossing and the chapman ranch  he must have crossed it at some dim part of it and ridden beyond  if so he was now something like fifty miles from home  if he could strike a rancha campany place where he could get a fresh horse and inquire the road he would ride all night to get back to marthy and the kid  so i have hinted sam was seized by remorse  there was a big lump in his throat as he thought of the cross words he had spoken to his wife surely it was hard enough for her to live in that horrible country without having to bear the burden of his abuse  he cursed himself grimly and felt a sudden flush of shame that overglowed the summer heat as he remembered the many times he had flouted and railed at her because she had a liking for reading fiction  ther only soce ov amusement ther po gals got said sam aloud with a sob which unaccustomed sound caused mexico to shy a bit alivin with a soreheaded kiote like mea lowdown skunk that ought to be licked to death with a saddle cinchacookin and awashin and alivin on mutton and beans and me abusin her fur takin a squint or two in a little book  he thought of marthy as she had been when he first met her in dogtownsmart pretty and saucybefore the sun had turned the roses in her cheeks brown and the silence of the chaparral had tamed her ambitions  ef i ever speaks another hard word to ther little gal muttered sam or fails in the love and affection thats coming to her in the deal i hopes a wildcatll tar me to pieces  he knew what he would do  he would write to garcia  jones his san antonio merchants where he bought his supplies and sold his wool and have them send down a big box of novels and reading matter for marthy things were going to be different  he wondered whether a little piano could be placed in one of the rooms of the ranch house without the family having to move out of doors  in nowise calculated to allay his selfreproach was the thought that marthy and randy would have to pass the night alone  in spite of their bickerings when night came marthy was wont to dismiss her fears of the country and rest her head upon sams strong arm with a sigh of peaceful content and dependence  and were her fears so groundless sam thought of roving marauding mexicans of stealthy cougars that sometimes invaded the ranches of rattlesnakes centipedes and a dozen possible dangers  marthy would be frantic with fear  randy would cry and call for dada to come  still the interminable succession of stretches of brush cactus and mesquite  hollow after hollow slope after slopeall exactly alikeall familiar by constant repetition and yet all strange and new if he could only arrive somewhere  the straight line is art  nature moves in circles  a straightforward man is more an artificial product than a diplomatist is  men lost in the snow travel in exact circles until they sink exhausted as their footprints have attested  also travellers in philosophy and other mental processes frequently wind up at their startingpoint  it was when sam webber was fullest of contrition and good resolves that mexico with a heavy sigh subsided from his regular brisk trot into a slow complacent walk  they were winding up an easy slope covered with brush ten or twelve feet high  i say now mex demurred sam this here wont do  i know youre plumb tired out but we got ter git along  oh lordy aint there no mo houses in the world  he gave mexico a smart kick with his heels  mexico gave a protesting grunt as if to say  whats the use of that now were so near  he quickened his gait into a languid trot rounding a great clump of black chaparral he stopped short  sam dropped the bridle reins and sat looking into the back door of his own house not ten yards away  marthy serene and comfortable sat in her rockingchair before the door in the shade of the house with her feet resting luxuriously upon the steps  randy who was playing with a pair of spurs on the ground looked up for a moment at his father and went on spinning the rowels and singing a little song  marthy turned her head lazily against the back of the chair and considered the arrivals with emotionless eyes she held a book in her lap with her finger holding the place  sam shook himself queerly like a man coming out of a dream and slowly dismounted  he moistened his dry lips  i see you are still asettin he said areadin of them billybydam yallerback novils  sam had traveled round the circle and was himself again    the rubber plants story  we rubber plants form the connecting link between the vegetable kingdom and the decorations of a waldorfastoria scene in a third avenue theatre  i havent looked up our family tree but i believe we were raised by grafting a gum overshoe on to a 30cent table dhote stalk of asparagus  you take a white bulldog with a bourke cockran air of independence about him and a rubber plant and there you have the fauna and flora of a flat  what the shamrock is to ireland the rubber plant is to the dweller in flats and furnished rooms  we get moved from one place to another so quickly that the only way we can get our picture taken is with a kinetoscope  we are the vagrant vine and the flitting fig tree  you know the proverb where the rubber plant sits in the window the moving van draws up to the door  we are the city equivalent to the woodbine and the honeysuckle  no other vegetable except the pittsburg stogie can withstand as much handling as we can  when the family to which we belong moves into a flat they set us in the front window and we become lares and penates flypaper and the peripatetic emblem of home sweet home we arent as green as we look  i guess we are about what you would call the soubrettes of the conservatory  you try sitting in the front window of a 40 flat in manhattan and looking out into the street all day and back into the flat at night and see whether you get wise or nothey talk about the tree of knowledge of good and evil in the garden of edensay suppose there had been a rubber plant there when evebut i was going to tell you a story  the first thing i can remember i had only three leaves and belonged to a member of the pony ballet  i was kept in a sunny window and was generally watered with seltzer and lemon  i had plenty of fun in those days  i got crosseyed trying to watch the numbers of the automobiles in the street and the dates on the labels inside at the same time  well then the angel that was molting for the musical comedy lost his last feather and the company broke up  the ponies trotted away and i was left in the window ownerless  the janitor gave me to a refined comedy team on the eighth floor and in six weeks i had been set in the window of five different flats i took on experience and put out two more leaves  miss carruthers of the refined comedy teamdid you ever see her cross both feet back of her neckgave me to a friend of hers who had made an unfortunate marriage with a man in a store  consequently i was placed in the window of a furnished room rent in advance water two flights up gas extra after ten oclock at night  two of my leaves withered off here  also i was moved from one room to another so many times that i got to liking the odor of the pipes the expressmen smoked  i dont think i ever had so dull a time as i did with this lady there was never anything amusing going on insideshe was devoted to her husband and besides leaning out the window and flirting with the iceman she never did a thing toward breaking the monotony  when the couple broke up they left me with the rest of their goods at a secondhand store  i was put out in front for sale along with the jobbiest lot you ever heard of being lumped into one bargain  think of this little cornucopia of wonders all for 189  henry jamess works six talking machine records one pair of tennis shoes two bottles of horse radish and a rubber plantthat was me  one afternoon a girl came along and stopped to look at me  she had dark hair and eyes and she looked slim and sad around the mouth  oh oh she says to herself  i never thought to see one up here  she pulls out a little purse about as thick as one of my leaves and fingers over some small silver in it  old koen always on the lockout is ready rubbing his hands  this girl proceeds to turn down mr james and the other commodities  rubber plants or nothing is the burden of her song  and at last koen and she come together at 39 cents and away she goes with me in her arms  she was a nice girl but not my style  too quiet and sober looking thinks i to myself  ill just about land on the fireescape of a tenement six stories up  and ill spend the next six months looking at clothes on the line  but she carried me to a nice little room only three flights up in quite a decent street  and she put me in the window of course  and then she went to work and cooked dinner for herself  and what do you suppose she had  bread and tea and a little dab of jam  nothing else not a single lobster nor so much as one bottle of champagne the carruthers comedy team had both every evening except now and then when they took a notion for pigs knuckle and kraut  after she had finished her dinner my new owner came to the window and leaned down close to my leaves and cried softly to herself for a while it made me feel funny  i never knew anybody to cry that way over a rubber plant before  of course ive seen a few of em turn on the tears for what they could get out of it but she seemed to be crying just for the pure enjoyment of it  she touched my leaves like she loved em and she bent down her head and kissed each one of em i guess im about the toughest specimen of a peripatetic orchid on earth but i tell you it made me feel sort of queer  home never was like that to me before  generally i used to get chewed by poodles and have shirtwaists hung on me to dry and get watered with coffee grounds and peroxide of hydrogen  this girl had a piano in the room and she used to disturb it with both hands while she made noises with her mouth for hours at a time i suppose she was practising vocal music  one day she seemed very much excited and kept looking at the clock at eleven somebody knocked and she let in a stout dark man with towsled black hair  he sat down at once at the piano and played while she sang for him  when she finished she laid one hand on her bosom and looked at him  he shook his head and she leaned against the piano  two years already she said speaking slowlydo you think in two moreor even longer  the man shook his head again  you waste your time he said roughly i thought  the voice is not there  and then he looked at her in a peculiar way  but the voice is not everything he went on  you have looks  i can place you as i told you if  the girl pointed to the door without saying anything and the dark man left the room  and then she came over and cried around me again its a good thing i had enough rubber in me to be waterproof  about that time somebody else knocked at the door  thank goodness i said to myself  heres a chance to get the waterworks turned off  i hope its somebody thats game enough to stand a bird and a bottle to liven things up a little  tell you the truth this little girl made me tired  a rubber plant likes to see a little sport now and then  i dont suppose theres another green thing in new york that sees as much of gay life unless its the chartreuse or the sprigs of parsley around the dish  when the girl opens the door in steps a young chap in a traveling cap and picks her up in his arms and she sings out oh dick and stays there long enough towell youve been a rubber plant too sometimes i suppose  good thing says i to myself  this is livelier than scales and weeping  now therell be something doing  youve got to go back with me says the young man  ive come two thousand miles for you  arent you tired of it yet bess  youve kept all of us waiting so long  havent you found out yet what is best  the bubble burst only today says the girl  come here dick and see what i found the other day on the sidewalk for sale  she brings him by the hand and exhibits yours truly  how one ever got away up here who can tell  i bought it with almost the last money i had  he looked at me but he couldnt keep his eyes off her for more than a second  do you remember the night bess he said when we stood under one of those on the bank of the bayou and what you told me then  geewillikins i said to myself  both of them stand under a rubber plant  seems to me they are stretching matters somewhat  do i not says she looking up at him and sneaking close to his vest and now i say it again and it is to last forever  look dick at its leaves how wet they are  those are my tears and it was thinking of you that made them fall  the dear old magnolias says the young man pinching one of my leaves  i love them all  magnolia  well wouldnt thatsay those innocents thought i was a magnolia  what thewell wasnt that tough on a genuine little old new york rubber plant    out of nazareth  okochee in georgia had a boom and j pinkney bloom came out of it with a wad  okochee came out of it with a halfmilliondollar debt a two and a half per cent city property tax and a city council that showed a propensity for traveling the back streets of the town  these things came about through a fatal resemblance of the river cooloosa to the hudson as set forth and expounded by a northern tourist  okochee felt that new york should not be allowed to consider itself the only alligator in the swamp so to speak  and then that harmless but persistent individual so numerous in the souththe man who is always clamoring for more cotton mills and is ready to take a dollars worth of stock provided he can borrow the dollarthat man added his deadly work to the tourists innocent praise and okochee fell  the cooloosa river winds through a range of small mountains passes okochee and then blends its waters trippingly as fall the mellifluous indian syllables with the chattahoochee  okochee rose as it were from its sunny seat on the postoffice stoop hitched up its suspender and threw a granite dam two hundred and forty feet long and sixty feet high across the cooloosa one mile above the town  thereupon a dimpling sparkling lake backed up twenty miles among the little mountains  thus in the great game of municipal rivalry did okochee match that famous drawing card the hudson  it was conceded that nowhere could the palisades be judged superior in the way of scenery and grandeur  following the picture card was played the ace of commercial importance  fourteen thousand horsepower would this dam furnish  cotton mills factories and manufacturing plants would rise up as the green corn after a shower the spindle and the flywheel and turbine would sing the shrewd glory of okochee  along the picturesque heights above the lake would rise in beauty the costly villas and the splendid summer residences of capital  the naphtha launch of the millionaire would spit among the romantic coves the verdured hills would take formal shapes of terrace lawn and park  money would be spent like water in okochee and water would be turned into money  the fate of the good town is quickly told  capital decided not to invest  of all the great things promised the scenery alone came to fulfilment  the wooded peaks the impressive promontories of solemn granite the beautiful green slants of bank and ravine did all they could to reconcile okochee to the delinquency of miserly gold  the sunsets gilded the dreamy draws and coves with a minting that should charm away heartburning  okochee true to the instinct of its blood and clime was lulled by the spell  it climbed out of the arena loosed its suspender sat down again on the postoffice stoop and took a chew  it consoled itself by drawling sarcasms at the city council which was not to blame causing the fathers as has been said to seek back streets and figure perspiringly on the sinking fund and the appropriation for interest due  the youth of okocheethey who were to carry into the rosy future the burden of the debtaccepted failure with youths uncalculating joy for here was sport aquatic and nautical added to the meagre round of lifes pleasures  in yachting caps and flowing neckties they pervaded the lake to its limits  girls wore silk waists embroidered with anchors in blue and pink  the trousers of the young men widened at the bottom and their hands were proudly calloused by the oftplied oar fishermen were under the spell of a deep and tolerant joy  sailboats and rowboats furrowed the lenient waves popcorn and icecream booths sprang up about the little wooden pier  two small excursion steamboats were built and plied the delectable waters okochee philosophically gave up the hope of eating turtle soup with a gold spoon and settled back not ill content to its regular diet of lotus and fried hominy and out of this slow wreck of great expectations rose up j pinkney bloom with his wad and his prosperous cheery smile  needless to say j pinkney was no product of georgia soil  he came out of that flushed and capable region known as the north  he called himself a promoter his enemies had spoken of him as a grafter okochee took a middle course and held him to be no better nor no worse than a yank  far up the lakeeighteen miles above the townthe eye of this cheerful campfollower of booms had spied out a graft  he purchased there a precipitous tract of five hundred acres at fortyfive cents per acre and this he laid out and subdivided as the city of skylandthe queen city of the switzerland of the south  streets and avenues were surveyed parks designed corners of central squares reserved for the proposed opera house board of trade lyceum market public schools and exposition hall  the price of lots ranged from five to five hundred dollars  positively no lot would be priced higher than five hundred dollars  while the boom was growing in okochee j pinkneys circulars maps and prospectuses were flying through the mails to every part of the country  investors sent in their money by post and the skyland real estate company j pinkney bloom returned to each a deed duly placed on record to the best lot at the price on hand that day all this time the catamount screeched upon the reserved lot of the skyland board of trade the opossum swung by his tail over the site of the exposition hall and the owl hooted a melancholy recitative to his audience of young squirrels in opera house square  later when the money was coming in fast j pinkney caused to be erected in the coming city half a dozen cheap box houses and persuaded a contingent of indigent natives to occupy them thereby assuming the role of population in subsequent prospectuses which became accordingly more seductive and remunerative  so when the dream faded and okochee dropped back to digging bait and nursing its two and a half per cent tax j pinkney bloom unloving of checks and drafts and the cold interrogatories of bankers strapped about his fiftytwoinch waist a soft leather belt containing eight thousand dollars in big bills and said that all was very good  one last trip he was making to skyland before departing to other salad fields  skyland was a regular postoffice and the steamboat dixie belle under contract delivered the mail bag generally empty twice a week  there was a little business there to be settledthe postmaster was to be paid off for his light but lonely services and the inhabitants had to be furnished with another months homely rations as per agreement  and then skyland would know j pinkney bloom no more  the owners of these precipitous barren useless lots might come and view the scene of their invested credulity or they might leave them to their fit tenants the wild hog and the browsing deer  the work of the skyland real estate company was finished  the little steamboat dixie belle was about to shove off on her regular upthelake trip when a rickety hired carriage rattled up to the pier and a tall elderly gentleman in black stepped out signaling courteously but vivaciously for the boat to wait  time was of the least importance in the schedule of the dixie belle captain macfarland gave the order and the boat received its ultimate two passengers  for upon the arm of the tall elderly gentleman as he crossed the gangway was a little elderly lady with a gray curl depending quaintly forward of her left ear  captain macfarland was at the wheel therefore it seemed to j pinkney bloom who was the only other passenger that it should be his to play the part of host to the boats new guests who were doubtless on a sceneryviewing expedition  he stepped forward with that translucent childcandid smile upon his fresh pink countenance with that air of unaffected sincerity that was redeemed from bluffness only by its exquisite calculation with that promptitude and masterly decision of manner that so well suited his callingwith all his stock in trade well to the front he stepped forward to receive colonel and mrs peyton blaylock  with the grace of a grand marshal or a wedding usher he escorted the two passengers to a side of the upper deck from which the scenery was supposed to present itself to the observer in increased quantity and quality  there in comfortable steamer chairs they sat and began to piece together the random lines that were to form an intelligent paragraph in the big history of little events  our home sir said colonel blaylock removing his widebrimmed rather shapeless black felt hat is in holly springsholly springs georgia  i am very proud to make your acquaintance mr bloom mrs blaylock and myself have just arrived in okochee this morning sir on businessbusiness of importance in connection with the recent rapid march of progress in this section of our state  the colonel smoothed back with a sweeping gesture his long smooth locks  his dark eyes still fiery under the heavy black brows seemed inappropriate to the face of a business man  he looked rather to be an old courtier handed down from the reign of charles and reattired in a modern suit of fine but raveling and seamworn broadcloth  yes sir said mr bloom in his heartiest prospectus voice things have been whizzing around okochee  biggest industrial revival and waking up to natural resources georgia ever had  did you happen to squeeze in on the ground floor in any of the giltedged grafts colonel  well sir said the colonel hesitating in courteous doubt if i understand your question i may say that i took the opportunity to make an investment that i believe will prove quite advantageousyes sir i believe it will result in both pecuniary profit and agreeable occupation  colonel blaylock said the little elderly lady shaking her gray curl and smiling indulgent explanation at j pinkney bloom is so devoted to businesss  he has such a talent for financiering and markets and investments and those kind of things  i think myself extremely fortunate in having secured him for a partner on lifes journeyi am so unversed in those formidable but very useful branches of learning  colonel blaylock rose and made a bowa bow that belonged with silk stockings and lace ruffles and velvet  practical affairs he said with a wave of his hand toward the promoter are if i may use the comparison the garden walks upon which we tread through life viewing upon either side of us the flowers which brighten that journey   it is my pleasure to be able to lay out a walk or two  mrs blaylock sir is one of those fortunate higher spirits whose mission it is to make the flowers grow perhaps mr bloom you have perused the lines of lorella the southern poetess that is the name above which mrs blaylock has contributed to the press of the south for many years  unfortunately said mr bloom with a sense of the loss clearly written upon his frank face im like the colonelin the walkmaking business myselfand i havent had time to even take a sniff at the flowers  poetry is a line i never dealt in  it must be nice thoughquite nice  it is the region smiled mrs blaylock in which my soul dwells my shawl peyton if you pleasethe breeze comes a little chilly from yon verdured hills  the colonel drew from the tail pocket of his coat a small shawl of knitted silk and laid it solicitously about the shoulders of the lady mrs blaylock sighed contentedly and turned her expressive eyesstill as clear and unworldly as a childsupon the steep slopes that were slowly slipping past  very fair and stately they looked in the clear morning air  they seemed to speak in familiar terms to the responsive spirit of lorella  my native hills she murmured dreamily  see how the foliage drinks the sunlight from the hollows and dells  mrs blaylocks maiden days said the colonel interpreting her mood to j pinkney bloom were spent among the mountains of northern georgia  mountain air and mountain scenery recall to her those days holly springs where we have lived for twenty years is low and flat i fear that she may have suffered in health and spirits by so long a residence there  that is one portent reason for the change we are making  my dear can you not recall those lines you wroteentitled i think the georgia hillsthe poem that was so extensively copied by the southern press and praised so highly by the atlanta critics  mrs blaylock turned a glance of speaking tenderness upon the colonel fingered for a moment the silvery curl that drooped upon her bosom then looked again toward the mountains  without preliminary or affectation or demurral she began in rather thrilling and more deeply pitched tones to recite these lines    the georgia hills the georgia hills     oh heart why dost thou pine   are not these sheltered lowlands fair     with mead and bloom and vine   ah as the slowpaced river here     broods on its natal rills   my spirit drifts in longing sweet     back to the georgia hills    and through the closedrawn curtained night     i steal on sleeps slow wings   back to my hearts easeslopes of pine     where end my wanderings   oh heaven seems nearer from their tops     and farther earthly ills   even in dreams if i may but     dream of my georgia hills    the grass upon their orchard sides     is a fine couch to me   the common note of each small bird     passes all minstrelsy   it would not seem so dread a thing     if when the reaper wills   he might come there and take my hand     up in the georgia hills   thats great stuff maam said j pinkney bloom enthusiastically when the poetess had concluded  i wish i had looked up poetry more than i have  i was raised in the pine hills myself  the mountains ever call to their children murmured mrs blaylock i feel that life will take on the rosy hue of hope again in among these beautiful hills  peytona little taste of the currant wine if you will be so good  the journey though delightful in the extreme slightly fatigues me  colonel blaylock again visited the depths of his prolific coat and produced a tightly corked rough black bottle mr bloom was on his feet in an instant  let me bring a glass maam  you come along coloneltheres a little table we can bring too  maybe we can scare up some fruit or a cup of tea on board  ill ask mac  mrs blaylock reclined at ease  few royal ladies have held their royal prerogative with the serene grace of the petted southern woman the colonel with an air as gallant and assiduous as in the days of his courtship and j pinkney bloom with a ponderous agility half professional and half directed by some resurrected unnamed longforgotten sentiment formed a diversified but attentive court the currant winewine home made from the holly springs fruitwent round and then j pinkney began to hear something of holly springs life  it seemed from the conversation of the blaylocks that the springs was decadent  a third of the population had moved away  businessand the colonel was an authority on businesshad dwindled to nothing after carefully studying the field of opportunities open to capital he had sold his little property there for eight hundred dollars and invested it in one of the enterprises opened up by the book in okochee  might i inquire sir said mr bloom in what particular line of business you inserted your coin  i know that town as well as i know the regulations for illegal use of the mails  i might give you a hunch as to whether you can make the game go or not  j pinkney somehow had a kindly feeling toward these unsophisticated representatives of bygone days  they were so simple impractical and unsuspecting  he was glad that he happened not to have a gold brick or a block of that western bad boy silver mine stock along with him  he would have disliked to unload on people he liked so well as he did these but there are some temptations toe enticing to be resisted  no sir said colonel blaylock pausing to arrange the queens wrap i did not invest in okochee  i have made an exhaustive study of business conditions and i regard old settled towns as unfavorable fields in which to place capital that is limited in amount  some months ago through the kindness of a friend there came into my hands a map and description of this new town of skyland that has been built upon the lake  the description was so pleasing the future of the town set forth in such convincing arguments and its increasing prosperity portrayed in such an attractive style that i decided to take advantage of the opportunity it offered  i carefully selected a lot in the centre of the business district although its price was the highest in the schedulefive hundred dollarsand made the purchase at once  are you the mani mean did you pay five hundred dollars for a lot in skyland asked j pinkney bloom  i did sir answered the colonel with the air of a modest millionaire explaining his success a lot most excellently situated on the same square with the opera house and only two squares from the board of trade  i consider the purchase a most fortuitous one it is my intention to erect a small building upon it at once and open a modest book and stationery store  during past years i have met with many pecuniary reverses and i now find it necessary to engage in some commercial occupation that will furnish me with a livelihood  the book and stationery business though an humble one seems to me not inapt nor altogether uncongenial  i am a graduate of the university of virginia and mrs blaylocks really wonderful acquaintance with belleslettres and poetic literature should go far toward insuring success  of course mrs blaylock would not personally serve behind the counter  with the nearly three hundred dollars i have remaining i can manage the building of a house by giving a lien on the lot  i have an old friend in atlanta who is a partner in a large book store and he has agreed to furnish me with a stock of goods on credit on extremely easy terms  i am pleased to hope sir that mrs blaylocks health and happiness will be increased by the change of locality already i fancy i can perceive the return of those roses that were once the hope and despair of georgia cavaliers  again followed that wonderful bow as the colonel lightly touched the pale cheek of the poetess  mrs blaylock blushing like a girl shook her curl and gave the colonel an arch reproving tap  secret of eternal youthwhere art thou  every second the answer comeshere here here  listen to thine own heartbeats o weary seeker after external miracles  those years said mrs blaylock in holly springs were long long long  but now is the promised land in sight  skylanda lovely name  doubtless said the colonel we shall be able to secure comfortable accommodations at some modest hotel at reasonable rates  our trunks are in okochee to be forwarded when we shall have made permanent arrangements  j pinkney bloom excused himself went forward and stood by the captain at the wheel  mac said he do you remember my telling you once that i sold one of those fivehundreddollar lots in skyland  seems i do grinned captain macfarland  im not a coward as a general rule went on the promoter but i always said that if i ever met the sucker that bought that lot id run like a turkey  now you see that old babeinthewood over there well hes the boy that drew the prize  that was the only fivehundreddollar lot that went  the rest ranged from ten dollars to two hundred  his wife writes poetry  shes invented one about the high grounds of georgia thats way up in g  theyre going to skyland to open a book store  well said macfarland with another grin its a good thing you are along j p you can show em around town until they begin to feel at home  hes got three hundred dollars left to build a house and store with went on j pinkney as if he were talking to himself  and he thinks theres an open house up there  captain macfarland released the wheel long enough to give his leg a roguish slap  you old fat rascal he chuckled with a wink  mac youre a fool said j pinkney bloom coldly  he went back and joined the blaylocks where he sat less talkative with that straight furrow between his brows that always stood as a signal of schemes being shaped within  theres a good many swindles connected with these booms he said presently  what if this skyland should turn out to be onethat is suppose business should be sort of dull there and no special sale for books  my dear sir said colonel blaylock resting his hand upon the back of his wifes chair three times i have been reduced to almost penury by the duplicity of others but i have not yet lost faith in humanity if i have been deceived again still we may glean health and content if not worldly profit  i am aware that there are dishonest schemers in the world who set traps for the unwary but even they are not altogether bad  my dear can you recall those verses entitled he giveth the increase that you composed for the choir of our church in holly springs  that was four years ago said mrs blaylock perhaps i can repeat a verse or two    the lily springs from the rotting mould     pearls from the deep sea slime   good will come out of nazareth     all in gods own time    to the hardest heart the softening grace     cometh at last to bless   guiding it right to help and cheer     and succor in distress  i cannot remember the rest  the lines were not ambitious  they were written to the music composed by a dear friend  its a fine rhyme just the same declared mr bloom  it seems to ring the bell all right  i guess i gather the sense of it  it means that the rankest kind of a phony will give you the best end of it once in a while  mr bloom strayed thoughtfully back to the captain and stood meditating  ought to be in sight of the spires and gilded domes of skyland now in a few minutes chirruped macfarland shaking with enjoyment  go to the devil said mr bloom still pensive  and now upon the left bank they caught a glimpse of a white village high up on the hills smothered among green trees  that was cold branchno boom town but the slow growth of many years  cold branch lay on the edge of the grape and corn lands  the big country road ran just back of the heights  cold branch had nothing in common with the frisky ambition of okochee with its impertinent lake  mac said j pinkney suddenly i want you to stop at cold branch theres a landing there that they made to use sometimes when the river was up  cant said the captain grinning more broadly  ive got the united states mails on board  right today this boats in the government service  do you want to have the poor old captain keelhauled by uncle sam  and the great city of skyland all disconsolate waiting for its mail  im ashamed of your extravagance j p  mac almost whispered j pinkney in his dangerline voice i looked into the engine room of the dixie belle a while ago  dont you know of somebody that needs a new boiler  cement and black japan cant hide flaws from me  and then those shares of building and loan that you traded for repairsthey were all yours of course  i hate to mention these things but  oh come now j p said the captain  you know i was just fooling ill put you off at cold branch if you say so  the other passengers get off there too said mr bloom  further conversation was held and in ten minutes the dixie belle turned her nose toward a little cranky wooden pier on the left bank and the captain relinquishing the wheel to a roustabout came to the passenger deck and made the remarkable announcement  all out for skyland  the blaylocks and j pinkney bloom disembarked and the dixie belle proceeded on her way up the lake  guided by the indefatigable promoter they slowly climbed the steep hillside pausing often to rest and admire the view  finally they entered the village of cold branch warmly both the colonel and his wife praised it for its homelike and peaceful beauty  mr bloom conducted them to a twostory building on a shady street that bore the legend pinetop inn  here he took his leave receiving the cordial thanks of the two for his attentions the colonel remarking that he thought they would spend the remainder of the day in rest and take a look at his purchase on the morrow  j pinkney bloom walked down cold branchs main street  he did not know this town but he knew towns and his feet did not falter presently he saw a sign over a door  frank e cooly attorneyatlaw and notary public  a young man was mr cooly and awaiting business  get your hat son said mr bloom in his breezy way and a blank deed and come along  its a job for you  now he continued when mr cooly had responded with alacrity is there a bookstore in town  one said the lawyer  henry williamss  get there said mr bloom  were going to buy it  henry williams was behind his counter  his store was a small one containing a mixture of books stationery and fancy rubbish adjoining it was henrys homea decent cottage vineembowered and cosy  henry was lank and soporific and not inclined to rush his business  i want to buy your house and store said mr bloom  i havent got time to dickername your price  its worth eight hundred said henry too much dazed to ask more than its value  shut that door said mr bloom to the lawyer  then he tore off his coat and vest and began to unbutton his shirt  wanter fight about it do yer said henry williams jumping up and cracking his heels together twice  all right hunkysail in and cut yer capers  keep your clothes on said mr bloom  im only going down to the bank  he drew eight onehundreddollar bills from his money belt and planked them down on the counter  mr cooly showed signs of future promise for he already had the deed spread out and was reaching across the counter for the ink bottle  never before or since was such quick action had in cold branch  your name please asked the lawyer  make it out to peyton blaylock said mr bloom  god knows how to spell it  within thirty minutes henry williams was out of business and mr bloom stood on the brick sidewalk with mr cooly who held in his hand the signed and attested deed  youll find the party at the pinetop inn said j pinkney bloom get it recorded and take it down and give it to him  hell ask you a hells mint of questions so heres ten dollars for the trouble youll have in not being able to answer em  never run much to poetry did you young man  well said the really talented cooly who even yet retained his right mind now and then  dig into it said mr bloom itll pay you  never heard a poem now that run something like this did you    a good thing out of nazareth     comes up sometimes i guess   on hand all right to help and cheer     a sucker in distress  i believe not said mr cooly  its a hymn said j pinkney bloom  now show me the way to a livery stable son for im going to hit the dirt road back to okochee    confessions of a humorist  there was a painless stage of incubation that lasted twentyfive years and then it broke out on me and people said i was it  but they called it humor instead of measles  the employees in the store bought a silver inkstand for the senior partner on his fiftieth birthday  we crowded into his private office to present it  i had been selected for spokesman and i made a little speech that i had been preparing for a week  it made a hit  it was full of puns and epigrams and funny twists that brought down the housewhich was a very solid one in the wholesale hardware line  old marlowe himself actually grinned and the employees took their cue and roared  my reputation as a humorist dates from halfpast nine oclock on that morning  for weeks afterward my fellow clerks fanned the flame of my selfesteem  one by one they came to me saying what an awfully clever speech that was old man and carefully explained to me the point of each one of my jokes  gradually i found that i was expected to keep it up  others might speak sanely on business matters and the days topics but from me something gamesome and airy was required  i was expected to crack jokes about the crockery and lighten up the granite ware with persiflage  i was second bookkeeper and if i failed to show up a balance sheet without something comic about the footings or could find no cause for laughter in an invoice of plows the other clerks were disappointed  by degrees my fame spread and i became a local character  our town was small enough to make this possible the daily newspaper quoted me  at social gatherings i was indispensable  i believe i did possess considerable wit and a facility for quick and spontaneous repartee  this gift i cultivated and improved by practice and the nature of it was kindly and genial not running to sarcasm or offending others  people began to smile when they saw me coming and by the time we had met i generally had the word ready to broaden the smile into a laugh  i had married early  we had a charming boy of three and a girl of five  naturally we lived in a vinecovered cottage and were happy my salary as bookkeeper in the hardware concern kept at a distance those ills attendant upon superfluous wealth  at sundry times i had written out a few jokes and conceits that i considered peculiarly happy and had sent them to certain periodicals that print such things  all of them had been instantly accepted several of the editors had written to request further contributions  one day i received a letter from the editor of a famous weekly publication  he suggested that i submit to him a humorous composition to fill a column of space hinting that he would make it a regular feature of each issue if the work proved satisfactory  i did so and at the end of two weeks he offered to make a contract with me for a year at a figure that was considerably higher than the amount paid me by the hardware firm  i was filled with delight  my wife already crowned me in her mind with the imperishable evergreens of literary success  we had lobster croquettes and a bottle of blackberry wine for supper that night here was the chance to liberate myself from drudgery  i talked over the matter very seriously with louisa  we agreed that i must resign my place at the store and devote myself to humor  i resigned  my fellow clerks gave me a farewell banquet  the speech i made there coruscated  it was printed in full by the gazette  the next morning i awoke and looked at the clock  late by george i exclaimed and grabbed for my clothes  louisa reminded me that i was no longer a slave to hardware and contractors supplies  i was now a professional humorist  after breakfast she proudly led me to the little room off the kitchen dear girl   there was my table and chair writing pad ink and pipe tray  and all the authors trappingsthe celery stand full of fresh roses and honeysuckle last years calendar on the wall the dictionary and a little bag of chocolates to nibble between inspirations  dear girl  i sat me to work  the wall paper is patterned with arabesques or odalisks orperhapsit is trapezoids  upon one of the figures i fixed my eyes  i bethought me of humor  a voice startled melouisas voice  if you arent too busy dear it said come to dinner  i looked at my watch  yes five hours had been gathered in by the grim scytheman  i went to dinner  you mustnt work too hard at first said louisa  goetheor was it napoleonsaid five hours a day is enough for mental labor  couldnt you take me and the children to the woods this afternoon  i am a little tired i admitted  so we went to the woods  but i soon got the swing of it  within a month i was turning out copy as regular as shipments of hardware  and i had success  my column in the weekly made some stir and i was referred to in a gossipy way by the critics as something fresh in the line of humorists  i augmented my income considerably by contributing to other publications  i picked up the tricks of the trade  i could take a funny idea and make a twoline joke of it earning a dollar  with false whiskers on it would serve up cold as a quatrain doubling its producing value  by turning the skirt and adding a ruffle of rhyme you would hardly recognize it as vers de societe with neatly shod feet and a fashionplate illustration  i began to save up money and we had new carpets and a parlor organ my townspeople began to look upon me as a citizen of some consequence instead of the merry trifler i had been when i clerked in the hardware store  after five or six months the spontaniety seemed to depart from my humor  quips and droll sayings no longer fell carelessly from my lips i was sometimes hard run for material  i found myself listening to catch available ideas from the conversation of my friends  sometimes i chewed my pencil and gazed at the wall paper for hours trying to build up some gay little bubble of unstudied fun  and then i became a harpy a moloch a jonah a vampire to my acquaintances  anxious haggard greedy i stood among them like a veritable killjoy  let a bright saying a witty comparison a piquant phrase fall from their lips and i was after it like a hound springing upon a bone  i dared not trust my memory but turning aside guiltily and meanly i would make a note of it in my everpresent memorandum book or upon my cuff for my own future use  my friends regarded me in sorrow and wonder i was not the same man where once i had furnished them entertainment and jollity i now preyed upon them  no jests from me ever bid for their smiles now they were too precious  i could not afford to dispense gratuitously the means of my livelihood  i was a lugubrious fox praising the singing of my friends the crows that they might drop from their beaks the morsels of wit that i coveted  nearly every one began to avoid me  i even forgot how to smile not even paying that much for the sayings i appropriated  no persons places times or subjects were exempt from my plundering in search of material  even in church my demoralized fancy went hunting among the solemn aisles and pillars for spoil  did the minister give out the longmeter doxology at once i began doxologysockdologysockdolagermetermeet her  the sermon ran through my mental sieve its precepts filtering unheeded could i but glean a suggestion of a pun or a bon mot the solemnest anthems of the choir were but an accompaniment to my thoughts as i conceived new changes to ring upon the ancient comicalities concerning the jealousies of soprano tenor and basso  my own home became a hunting ground  my wife is a singularly feminine creature candid sympathetic and impulsive  once her conversation was my delight and her ideas a source of unfailing pleasure  now i worked her  she was a gold mine of those amusing but lovable inconsistencies that distinguish the female mind  i began to market those pearls of unwisdom and humor that should have enriched only the sacred precincts of home  with devilish cunning i encouraged her to talk  unsuspecting she laid her heart bare  upon the cold conspicuous common printed page i offered it to the public gaze  a literary judas i kissed her and betrayed her  for pieces of silver i dressed her sweet confidences in the pantalettes and frills of folly and made them dance in the market place  dear louisa  of nights i have bent over her cruel as a wolf above a tender lamb hearkening even to her soft words murmured in sleep hoping to catch an idea for my next days grind  there is worse to come  god help me  next my fangs were buried deep in the neck of the fugitive sayings of my little children  guy and viola were two bright fountains of childish quaint thoughts and speeches  i found a ready sale for this kind of humor and was furnishing a regular department in a magazine with funny fancies of childhood  i began to stalk them as an indian stalks the antelope i would hide behind sofas and doors or crawl on my hands and knees among the bushes in the yard to eavesdrop while they were at play i had all the qualities of a harpy except remorse  once when i was barren of ideas and my copy must leave in the next mail i covered myself in a pile of autumn leaves in the yard where i knew they intended to come to play  i cannot bring myself to believe that guy was aware of my hiding place but even if he was i would be loath to blame him for his setting fire to the leaves causing the destruction of my new suit of clothes and nearly cremating a parent  soon my own children began to shun me as a pest  often when i was creeping upon them like a melancholy ghoul i would hear them say to each other  here comes papa and they would gather their toys and scurry away to some safer hiding place  miserable wretch that i was  and yet i was doing well financially  before the first year had passed i had saved a thousand dollars and we had lived in comfort  but at what a cost  i am not quite clear as to what a pariah is but i was everything that it sounds like  i had no friends no amusements no enjoyment of life  the happiness of my family had been sacrificed i was a bee sucking sordid honey from lifes fairest flowers dreaded and shunned on account of my stingo  one day a man spoke to me with a pleasant and friendly smile not in months had the thing happened  i was passing the undertaking establishment of peter heffelbower  peter stood in the door and saluted me  i stopped strangely wrung in my heart by his greeting he asked me inside  the day was chill and rainy  we went into the back room where a fire burned in a little stove  a customer came and peter left me alone for a while  presently i felt a new feeling stealing over mea sense of beautiful calm and content i looked around the place there were rows of shining rosewood caskets black palls trestles hearse plumes mourning streamers and all the paraphernalia of the solemn trade here was peace order silence the abode of grave and dignified reflections  here on the brink of life was a little niche pervaded by the spirit of eternal rest  when i entered it the follies of the world abandoned me at the door i felt no inclination to wrest a humorous idea from those sombre and stately trappings  my mind seemed to stretch itself to grateful repose upon a couch draped with gentle thoughts  a quarter of an hour ago i was an abandoned humorist  now i was a philosopher full of serenity and ease  i had found a refuge from humor from the hot chase of the shy quip from the degrading pursuit of the panting joke from the restless reach after the nimble repartee  i had not known heffelbower well  when he came back i let him talk fearful that he might prove to be a jarring note in the sweet dirgelike harmony of his establishment  but no  he chimed truly  i gave a long sigh of happiness  never have i known a mans talk to be as magnificently dull as peters was compared with it the dead sea is a geyser  never a sparkle or a glimmer of wit marred his words  commonplaces as trite and as plentiful as blackberries flowed from his lips no more stirring in quality than a last weeks tape running from a ticker  quaking a little i tried upon him one of my best pointed jokes  it fell back ineffectual with the point broken  i loved that man from then on  two or three evenings each week i would steal down to heffelbowers and revel in his back room  that was my only joy  i began to rise early and hurry through my work that i might spend more time in my haven in no other place could i throw off my habit of extracting humorous ideas from my surroundings  peters talk left me no opening had i besieged it ever so hard  under this influence i began to improve in spirits  it was the recreation from ones labor which every man needs  i surprised one or two of my former friends by throwing them a smile and a cheery word as i passed them on the streets  several times i dumfounded my family by relaxing long enough to make a jocose remark in their presence  i had so long been ridden by the incubus of humor that i seized my hours of holiday with a schoolboys zest  mv work began to suffer  it was not the pain and burden to me that it had been  i often whistled at my desk and wrote with far more fluency than before  i accomplished my tasks impatiently as anxious to be off to my helpful retreat as a drunkard is to get to his tavern  my wife had some anxious hours in conjecturing where i spent my afternoons  i thought it best not to tell her women do not understand these things  poor girlshe had one shock out of it  one day i brought home a silver coffin handle for a paper weight and a fine fluffy hearse plume to dust my papers with  i loved to see them on my desk and think of the beloved back room down at heffelbowers  but louisa found them and she shrieked with horror i had to console her with some lame excuse for having them but i saw in her eyes that the prejudice was not removed  i had to remove the articles though at doublequick time  one day peter heffelbower laid before me a temptation that swept me off my feet  in his sensible uninspired way he showed me his books and explained that his profits and his business were increasing rapidly he had thought of taking in a partner with some cash  he would rather have me than any one he knew  when i left his place that afternoon peter had my check for the thousand dollars i had in the bank and i was a partner in his undertaking business  i went home with feelings of delirious joy mingled with a certain amount of doubt  i was dreading to tell my wife about it  but i walked on air  to give up the writing of humorous stuff once more to enjoy the apples of life instead of squeezing them to a pulp for a few drops of hard cider to make the pubic feel funnywhat a boon that would be  at the supper table louisa handed me some letters that had come during my absence  several of them contained rejected manuscript  ever since i first began going to heffelbowers my stuff had been coming back with alarming frequency  lately i had been dashing off my jokes and articles with the greatest fluency  previously i had labored like a bricklayer slowly and with agony  presently i opened a letter from the editor of the weekly with which i had a regular contract  the checks for that weekly article were still our main dependence  the letter ran thus   dear sir  as you are aware our contract for the year expires with the present month  while regretting the necessity for so doing we must say that we do not care to renew same for the coming year  we were quite pleased with your style of humor which seems to have delighted quite a large proportion of our readers  but for the past two months we have noticed a decided falling off in its quality  your earlier work showed a spontaneous easy natural flow of fun and wit  of late it is labored studied and unconvincing giving painful evidence of hard toil and drudging mechanism  again regretting that we do not consider your contributions available any longer we are yours sincerely  the editor   i handed this letter to my wife  after she had read it her face grew extremely long and there were tears in her eyes  the mean old thing she exclaimed indignantly  im sure your pieces are just as good as they ever were  and it doesnt take you half as long to write them as it did  and then i suppose louisa thought of the checks that would cease coming  oh john she wailed what will you do now  for an answer i got up and began to do a polka step around the supper table  i am sure louisa thought the trouble had driven me mad and i think the children hoped it had for they tore after me yelling with glee and emulating my steps  i was now something like their old playmate as of yore  the theatre for us tonight i shouted nothing less  and a late wild disreputable supper for all of us at the palace restaurant lumptydiddlededeededum  and then i explained my glee by declaring that i was now a partner in a prosperous undertaking establishment and that written jokes might go hide their heads in sackcloth and ashes for all me  with the editors letter in her hand to justify the deed i had done my wife could advance no objections save a few mild ones based on the feminine inability to appreciate a good thing such as the little back room of peter hefno of heffelbower  cos undertaking establishment  in conclusion i will say that today you will find no man in our town as well liked as jovial and full of merry sayings as i  my jokes are again noised about and quoted once more i take pleasure in my wifes confidential chatter without a mercenary thought while guy and viola play at my feet distributing gems of childish humor without fear of the ghastly tormentor who used to dog their steps notebook in hand  our business has prospered finely i keep the books and look after the shop while peter attends to outside matters  he says that my levity and high spirits would simply turn any funeral into a regular irish wake    the sparrows in madison square  the young man in straitened circumstances who comes to new york city to enter literature has but one thing to do provided he has studied carefully his field in advance  he must go straight to madison square write an article about the sparrows there and sell it to the sun for 15  i cannot recall either a novel or a story dealing with the popular theme of the young writer from the provinces who comes to the metropolis to win fame and fortune with his pen in which the hero does not get his start that way  it does seem strange that some author in casting about for startlingly original plots has not hit upon the idea of having his hero write about the bluebirds in union square and sell it to the herald  but a search through the files of metropolitan fiction counts up overwhelmingly for the sparrows and the old garden square and the sun always writes the check  of course it is easy to understand why this first city venture of the budding author is always successful  he is primed by necessity to a superlative effort mid the iron and stone and marble of the roaring city he has found this spot of singing birds and green grass and trees every tender sentiment in his nature is baffling with the sweet pain of homesickness his genius is aroused as it never may be again the birds chirp the tree branches sway the noise of wheels is forgotten he writes with his soul in his penand he sells it to the sun for 15  i had read of this custom during many years before i came to new york when my friends were using their strongest arguments to dissuade me from coming i only smiled serenely  they did not know of that sparrow graft i had up my sleeve  when i arrived in new york and the car took me straight from the ferry up twentythird street to madison square i could hear that 15 check rustling in my inside pocket  i obtained lodging at an unhyphenated hostelry and the next morning i was on a bench in madison square almost by the time the sparrows were awake  their melodious chirping the benignant spring foliage of the noble trees and the clean fragrant grass reminded me so potently of the old farm i had left that tears almost came into my eyes  then all in a moment i felt my inspiration  the brave piercing notes of those cheerful small birds formed a keynote to a wonderful light fanciful song of hope and joy and altruism  like myself they were creatures with hearts pitched to the tune of woods and fields as i was so were they captives by circumstance in the discordant dull cityyet with how much grace and glee they bore the restraint  and then the early morning people began to pass through the square to their worksullen people with sidelong glances and glum faces hurrying hurrying hurrying  and i got my theme cut out clear from the bird notes and wrought it into a lesson and a poem and a carnival dance and a lullaby and then translated it all into prose and began to write  for two hours my pencil traveled over my pad with scarcely a rest then i went to the little room i had rented for two days and there i cut it to half and then mailed it whitehot to the sun  the next morning i was up by daylight and spent two cents of my capital for a paper  if the word sparrow was in it i was unable to find it i took it up to my room and spread it out on the bed and went over it column by column  something was wrong  three hours afterward the postman brought me a large envelope containing my ms and a piece of inexpensive paper about 3 inches by 4i suppose some of you have seen themupon which was written in violet ink with the suns thanks  i went over to the square and sat upon a bench  no i did not think it necessary to eat any breakfast that morning  the confounded pests of sparrows were making the square hideous with their idiotic cheep cheep  i never saw birds so persistently noisy impudent and disagreeable in all my life  by this time according to all traditions i should have been standing in the office of the editor of the sun  that personagea tall grave whitehaired manwould strike a silver bell as he grasped my hand and wiped a suspicious moisture from his glasses  mr mcchesney he would be saying when a subordinate appeared this is mr henry the young man who sent in that exquisite gem about the sparrows in madison square  you may give him a desk at once  your salary sir will be 80 a week to begin with  this was what i had been led to expect by all writers who have evolved romances of literary new york  something was decidedly wrong with tradition  i could not assume the blame so i fixed it upon the sparrows  i began to hate them with intensity and heat  at that moment an individual wearing an excess of whiskers two hats and a pestilential air slid into the seat beside me  say willie he muttered cajolingly could you cough up a dime out of your coffers for a cup of coffee this morning  im lungweary my friend said i  the best i can do is three cents  and you look like a gentleman too said he  what brung you downboozer  birds i said fiercely  the brownthroated songsters carolling songs of hope and cheer to weary man toiling amid the citys dust and din  the little feathered couriers from the meadows and woods chirping sweetly to us of blue skies and flowering fields  the confounded little squinteyed nuisances yawping like a flock of steam pianos and stuffing themselves like aldermen with grass seeds and bugs while a man sits on a bench and goes without his breakfast yes sir birds look at them  as i spoke i picked up a dead tree branch that lay by the bench and hurled it with all my force into a close congregation of the sparrows on the grass  the flock flew to the trees with a babel of shrill cries but two of them remained prostrate upon the turf  in a moment my unsavory friend had leaped over the row of benches and secured the fluttering victims which he thrust hurriedly into his pockets  then he beckoned me with a dirty forefinger  come on cully he said hoarsely  youre in on the feed  thank you very much  weakly i followed my dingy acquaintance  he led me away from the park down a side street and through a crack in a fence into a vacant lot where some excavating had been going on  behind a pile of old stones and lumber he paused and took out his birds  i got matches said he  you got any paper to start a fire with  i drew forth my manuscript story of the sparrows and offered it for burnt sacrifice  there were old planks splinters and chips for our fire  my frowsy friend produced from some interior of his frayed clothing half a loaf of bread pepper and salt  in ten minutes each of us was holding a sparrow spitted upon a stick over the leaping flames  say said my fellow bivouacker this aint so bad when a fellows hungry  it reminds me of when i struck new york firstabout fifteen years ago  i come in from the west to see if i could get a job on a newspaper  i hit the madison square park the first mornin after and was sitting around on the benches  i noticed the sparrows chirpin and the grass and trees so nice and green that i thought i was back in the country again  then i got some papers out of my pocket and  i know i interrupted  you sent it to the sun and got 15  say said my friend suspiciously you seem to know a good deal where was you  i went to sleep on the bench there in the sun and somebody touched me for every cent i had15    hearts and hands  at denver there was an influx of passengers into the coaches on the eastbound b  m express  in one coach there sat a very pretty young woman dressed in elegant taste and surrounded by all the luxurious comforts of an experienced traveler  among the newcomers were two young men one of handsome presence with a bold frank countenance and manner the other a ruffled glumfaced person heavily built and roughly dressed  the two were handcuffed together  as they passed down the aisle of the coach the only vacant seat offered was a reversed one facing the attractive young woman  here the linked couple seated themselves  the young womans glance fell upon them with a distant swift disinterest then with a lovely smile brightening her countenance and a tender pink tingeing her rounded cheeks she held out a little graygloved hand  when she spoke her voice full sweet and deliberate proclaimed that its owner was accustomed to speak and be heard  well mr easton if you will make me speak first i suppose i must dont you ever recognize old friends when you meet them in the west  the younger man roused himself sharply at the sound of her voice seemed to struggle with a slight embarrassment which he threw off instantly and then clasped her fingers with his left hand  its miss fairchild he said with a smile  ill ask you to excuse the other hand its otherwise engaged just at present  he slightly raised his right hand bound at the wrist by the shining bracelet to the left one of his companion  the glad look in the girls eyes slowly changed to a bewildered horror  the glow faded from her cheeks  her lips parted in a vague relaxing distress easton with a little laugh as if amused was about to speak again when the other forestalled him  the glumfaced man had been watching the girls countenance with veiled glances from his keen shrewd eyes  youll excuse me for speaking miss but i see youre acquainted with the marshall here  if youll ask him to speak a word for me when we get to the pen hell do it and itll make things easier for me there hes taking me to leavenworth prison  its seven years for counterfeiting  oh said the girl with a deep breath and returning color  so that is what you are doing out here  a marshal  my dear miss fairchild said easton calmly i had to do something money has a way of taking wings unto itself and you know it takes money to keep step with our crowd in washington  i saw this opening in the west andwell a marshalship isnt quite as high a position as that of ambassador but  the ambassador said the girl warmly doesnt call any more  he neednt ever have done so  you ought to know that  and so now you are one of these dashing western heroes and you ride and shoot and go into all kinds of dangers  thats different from the washington life you have been missed from the old crowd  the girls eyes fascinated went back widening a little to rest upon the glittering handcuffs  dont you worry about them miss said the other man  all marshals handcuff themselves to their prisoners to keep them from getting away mr easton knows his business  will we see you again soon in washington asked the girl  not soon i think said easton  my butterfly days are over i fear  i love the west said the girl irrelevantly  her eyes were shining softly  she looked away out the car window  she began to speak truly and simply without the gloss of style and manner mamma and i spent the summer in denver  she went home a week ago because father was slightly ill  i could live and be happy in the west  i think the air here agrees with me  money isnt everything but people always misunderstand things and remain stupid  say mr marshal growled the glumfaced man  this isnt quite fair  im needing a drink and havent had a smoke all day  havent you talked long enough  take me in the smoker now wont you  im half dead for a pipe  the bound travelers rose to their feet easton with the same slow smile on his face  i cant deny a petition for tobacco he said lightly  its the one friend of the unfortunate  goodbye miss fairchild  duty calls you know  he held out his hand for a farewell  its too bad you are not going east she said reclothing herself with manner and style  but you must go on to leavenworth i suppose  yes said easton i must go on to leavenworth  the two men sidled down the aisle into the smoker  the two passengers in a seat near by had heard most of the conversation  said one of them  that marshals a good sort of chap some of these western fellows are all right  pretty young to hold an office like that isnt he asked the other  young exclaimed the first speaker whyoh didnt you catch on saydid you ever know an officer to handcuff a prisoner to his right hand    the cactus  the most notable thing about time is that it is so purely relative a large amount of reminiscence is by common consent conceded to the drowning man and it is not past belief that one may review an entire courtship while removing ones gloves  that is what trysdale was doing standing by a table in his bachelor apartments  on the table stood a singularlooking green plant in a red earthen jar  the plant was one of the species of cacti and was provided with long tentacular leaves that perpetually swayed with the slightest breeze with a peculiar beckoning motion  trysdales friend the brother of the bride stood at a sideboard complaining at being allowed to drink alone  both men were in evening dress  white favors like stars upon their coats shone through the gloom of the apartment  as he slowly unbuttoned his gloves there passed through trysdales mind a swift scarifying retrospect of the last few hours  it seemed that in his nostrils was still the scent of the flowers that had been banked in odorous masses about the church and in his ears the lowpitched hum of a thousand wellbred voices the rustle of crisp garments and most insistently recurring the drawling words of the minister irrevocably binding her to another  from this last hopeless point of view he still strove as if it had become a habit of his mind to reach some conjecture as to why and how he had lost her  shaken rudely by the uncompromising fact he had suddenly found himself confronted by a thing he had never before facedhis own innermost unmitigated arid unbedecked self   he saw all the garbs of pretence and egoism that he had worn now turn to rags of folly  he shuddered at the thought that to others before now the garments of his soul must have appeared sorry and threadbare vanity and conceit  these were the joints in his armor  and how free from either she had always beenbut why  as she had slowly moved up the aisle toward the altar he had felt an unworthy sullen exultation that had served to support him  he had told himself that her paleness was from thoughts of another than the man to whom she was about to give herself  but even that poor consolation had been wrenched from him  for when he saw that swift limpid upward look that she gave the man when he took her hand he knew himself to be forgotten  once that same look had been raised to him and he had gauged its meaning  indeed his conceit had crumbled its last prop was gone  why had it ended thus  there had been no quarrel between them nothing  for the thousandth time he remarshalled in his mind the events of those last few days before the tide had so suddenly turned  she had always insisted upon placing him upon a pedestal and he had accepted her homage with royal grandeur  it had been a very sweet incense that she had burned before him so modest he told himself so childlike and worshipful and he would once have sworn so sincere she had invested him with an almost supernatural number of high attributes and excellencies and talents and he had absorbed the oblation as a desert drinks the rain that can coax from it no promise of blossom or fruit  as trysdale grimly wrenched apart the seam of his last glove the crowning instance of his fatuous and tardily mourned egoism came vividly back to him  the scene was the night when he had asked her to come up on his pedestal with him and share his greatness  he could not now for the pain of it allow his mind to dwell upon the memory of her convincing beauty that nightthe careless wave of her hair the tenderness and virginal charm of her looks and words  but they had been enough and they had brought him to speak  during their conversation she had said  and captain carruthers tells me that you speak the spanish language like a native  why have you hidden this accomplishment from me  is there anything you do not know  now carruthers was an idiot  no doubt he trysdale had been guilty he sometimes did such things of airing at the club some old canting castilian proverb dug from the hotchpotch at the back of dictionaries carruthers who was one of his incontinent admirers was the very man to have magnified this exhibition of doubtful erudition  but alas the incense of her admiration had been so sweet and flattering  he allowed the imputation to pass without denial without protest he allowed her to twine about his brow this spurious bay of spanish scholarship  he let it grace his conquering head and among its soft convolutions he did not feel the prick of the thorn that was to pierce him later  how glad how shy how tremulous she was  how she fluttered like a snared bird when he laid his mightiness at her feet  he could have sworn and he could swear now that unmistakable consent was in her eyes but coyly she would give him no direct answer  i will send you my answer tomorrow she said and he the indulgent confident victor smilingly granted the delay  the next day he waited impatient in his rooms for the word  at noon her groom came to the door and left the strange cactus in the red earthen jar  there was no note no message merely a tag upon the plant bearing a barbarous foreign or botanical name  he waited until night but her answer did not come  his large pride and hurt vanity kept him from seeking her two evenings later they met at a dinner  their greetings were conventional but she looked at him breathless wondering eager he was courteous adamant waiting her explanation  with womanly swiftness she took her cue from his manner and turned to snow and ice thus and wider from this on they had drifted apart  where was his fault  who had been to blame  humbled now he sought the answer amid the ruins of his selfconceit  if  the voice of the other man in the room querulously intruding upon his thoughts aroused him  i say trysdale what the deuce is the matter with you  you look unhappy as if you yourself had been married instead of having acted merely as an accomplice  look at me another accessory come two thousand miles on a garlicky cockroachy banana steamer all the way from south america to connive at the sacrificeplease to observe how lightly my guilt rests upon my shoulders  only little sister i had too and now shes gone  come now take something to ease your conscience  i dont drink just now thanks said trysdale  your brandy resumed the other coming over and joining him is abominable  run down to see me some time at punta redonda and try some of our stuff that old garcia smuggles in  its worth the trip hallo heres an old acquaintance  wherever did you rake up this cactus trysdale  a present said trysdale from a friend  know the species  very well  its a tropical concern  see hundreds of em around punta every day  heres the name on this tag tied to it  know any spanish trysdale  no said trysdale with the bitter wraith of a smileis it spanish  yes  the natives imagine the leaves are reaching out and beckoning to you  they call it by this nameventomarme name means in english come and take me    the detective detector  i was walking in central park with avery knight the great new york burglar highwayman and murderer  but my dear knight said i it sounds incredible  you have undoubtedly performed some of the most wonderful feats in your profession known to modern crime  you have committed some marvellous deeds under the very noses of the policeyou have boldly entered the homes of millionaires and held them up with an empty gun while you made free with their silver and jewels you have sandbagged citizens in the glare of broadways electric lights you have killed and robbed with superb openness and absolute impunitybut when you boast that within fortyeight hours after committing a murder you can run down and actually bring me face to face with the detective assigned to apprehend you i must beg leave to express my doubtsremember you are in new york  avery knight smiled indulgently  you pique my professional pride doctor he said in a nettled tone i will convince you  about twelve yards in advance of us a prosperouslooking citizen was rounding a clump of bushes where the walk curved  knight suddenly drew a revolver and shot the man in the back  his victim fell and lay without moving  the great murderer went up to him leisurely and took from his clothes his money watch and a valuable ring and cravat pin  he then rejoined me smiling calmly and we continued our walk  ten steps and we met a policeman running toward the spot where the shot had been fired  avery knight stopped him  i have just killed a man he announced seriously and robbed him of his possessions  gwan said the policeman angrily or ill run yez in  want yer name in the papers dont yez  i never knew the cranks to come around so quick after a shootin before  out of th park now for yours or ill fan yez  what you have done i said argumentatively as knight and i walked on was easy  but when you come to the task of hunting down the detective that they send upon your trail you will find that you have undertaken a difficult feat  perhaps so said knight lightly  i will admit that my success depends in a degree upon the sort of man they start after me  if it should be an ordinary plainclothes man i might fail to gain a sight of him  if they honor me by giving the case to some one of their celebrated sleuths i do not fear to match my cunning and powers of induction against his  on the next afternoon knight entered my office with a satisfied look on his keen countenance  how goes the mysterious murder i asked  as usual said knight smilingly i have put in the morning at the police station and at the inquest  it seems that a card case of mine containing cards with my name and address was found near the body they have three witnesses who saw the shooting and gave a description of me the case has been placed in the hands of shamrock jolnes the famous detective  he left headquarters at 1130 on the assignment i waited at my address until two thinking he might call there  i laughed tauntingly  you will never see jolnes i continued until this murder has been forgotten two or three weeks from now  i had a better opinion of your shrewdness knight  during the three hours and a half that you waited he has got out of your ken  he is after you on true induction theories now and no wrongdoer has yet been known to come upon him while thus engaged  i advise you to give it up  doctor said knight with a sudden glint in his keen gray eye and a squaring of his chin in spite of the record your city holds of something like a dozen homicides without a subsequent meeting of the perpetrator and the sleuth in charge of the case i will undertake to break that record  tomorrow i will take you to shamrock jolnesi will unmask him before you and prove to you that it is not an impossibility for an officer of the law and a manslayer to stand face to face in your city  do it said i and youll have the sincere thanks of the police department  on the next day knight called for me in a cab  ive been on one or two false scents doctor he admitted  i know something of detectives methods and i followed out a few of them expecting to find jolnes at the other end  the pistol being a 45caliber i thought surely i would find him at work on the clue in fortyfifth street  then again i looked for the detective at the columbia university as the mans being shot in the back naturally suggested hazing  but i could not find a trace of him  nor will you i said emphatically  not by ordinary methods said knight  i might walk up and down broadway for a month without success  but you have aroused my pride doctor and if i fail to show you shamrock jolnes this day i promise you i will never kill or rob in your city again  nonsense man i replied  when our burglars walk into our houses and politely demand thousands of dollars worth of jewels and then dine and bang the piano an hour or two before leaving how do you a mere murderer expect to come in contact with the detective that is looking for you  avery knight sat lost in thought for a while  at length he looked up brightly  doc said he i have it  put on your hat and come with me  in half an hour i guarantee that you shall stand in the presence of shamrock jolnes  i entered a cab with avery knight  i did not hear his instructions to the driver but the vehicle set out at a smart pace up broadway turning presently into fifth avenue and proceeding northward again it was with a rapidly beating heart that i accompanied this wonderful and gifted assassin whose analytical genius and superb selfconfidence had prompted him to make me the tremendous promise of bringing me into the presence of a murderer and the new york detective in pursuit of him simultaneously  even yet i could not believe it possible  are you sure that you are not being led into some trap i asked suppose that your clue whatever it is should bring us only into the presence of the commissioner of police and a couple of dozen cops  my dear doctor said knight a little stiffly i would remind you that i am no gambler  i beg your pardon said i  but i do not think you will find jolnes  the cab stopped before one of the handsomest residences on the avenue walking up and down in front of the house was a man with long red whiskers with a detectives badge showing on the lapel of his coat now and then the man would remove his whiskers to wipe his face and then i would recognize at once the wellknown features of the great new york detective  jolnes was keeping a sharp watch upon the doors and windows of the house  well doctor said knight unable to repress a note of triumph in his voice have you seen  it is wonderfulwonderful i could not help exclaiming as our cab started on its return trip  but how did you do it  by what process of induction  my dear doctor interrupted the great murderer the inductive theory is what the detectives use  my process is more modern  i call it the saltatorial theory  without bothering with the tedious mental phenomena necessary to the solution of a mystery from slight clues i jump at once to a conclusion  i will explain to you the method i employed in this case  in the first place i argued that as the crime was committed in new york city in broad daylight in a public place and under peculiarly atrocious circumstances and that as the most skilful sleuth available was let loose upon the case the perpetrator would never be discovered do you not think my postulation justified by precedent  perhaps so i replied doggedly  but if big bill dev  stop that interrupted knight with a smile ive heard that several times  its too late now  i will proceed  if homicides in new york went undiscovered i reasoned although the best detective talent was employed to ferret them out it must be true that the detectives went about their work in the wrong way and not only in the wrong way but exactly opposite from the right way  that was my clue  i slew the man in central park  now let me describe myself to you  i am tall with a black beard and i hate publicity  i have no money to speak of i do not like oatmeal and it is the one ambition of my life to die rich  i am of a cold and heartless disposition  i do not care for my fellowmen and i never give a cent to beggars or charity  now my dear doctor that is the true description of myself the man whom that shrewd detective was to hunt down  you who are familiar with the history of crime in new york of late should be able to foretell the result  when i promised you to exhibit to your incredulous gaze the sleuth who was set upon me you laughed at me because you said that detectives and murderers never met in new york i have demonstrated to you that the theory is possible  but how did you do it i asked again  it was very simple replied the distinguished murderer  i assumed that the detective would go exactly opposite to the clues he had  i have given you a description of myself  therefore he must necessarily set to work and trail a short man with a white beard who likes to be in the papers who is very wealthy is fond of oatmeal wants to die poor and is of an extremely generous and philanthropic disposition when thus far is reached the mind hesitates no longer  i conveyed you at once to the spot where shamrock jolnes was piping off andrew carnegies residence  knight said i youre a wonder  if there was no danger of your reforming what a rounds man youd make for the nineteenth precinct    the dog and the playlet  this story has been rewritten and published in strictly business under the title the proof of the pudding   usually it is a cold day in july when you can stroll up broadway in that month and get a story out of the drama  i found one a few breathless parboiling days ago and it seems to decide a serious question in art  there was not a soul left in the city except hollis and meand two or three million sunworshippers who remained at desks and counters the elect had fled to seashore lake and mountain and had already begun to draw for additional funds  every evening hollis and i prowled about the deserted town searching for coolness in empty cafes diningrooms and roofgardens  we knew to the tenth part of a revolution the speed of every electric fan in gotham and we followed the swiftest as they varied  holliss fiancee miss loris sherman had been in the adirondacks at lower saranac lake for a month  in another week he would join her party there  in the meantime he cursed the city cheerfully and optimistically and sought my society because i suffered him to show me her photograph during the black coffee every time we dined together  my revenge was to read to him my oneact play  it was one insufferable evening when the overplus of the days heat was being hurled quiveringly back to the heavens by every surcharged brick and stone and inch of iron in the panting town  but with the cunning of the twolegged beasts we had found an oasis where the hoofs of apollos steed had not been allowed to strike  our seats were on an ocean of cool polished oak the white linen of fifty deserted tables flapped like seagulls in the artificial breeze a mile away a waiter lingered for a heliographic signalwe might have roared songs there or fought a duel without molestation  out came miss loriss photo with the coffee and i once more praised the elegant poise of the neck the extremely lowcoiled mass of heavy hair and the eyes that followed one like those in an oil painting  shes the greatest ever said hollis with enthusiasm  good as great northern preferred and a disposition built like a watch  one week more and ill be happy jonnyonthespot  old tom tolliver my best college chum went up there two weeks ago  he writes me that loris doesnt talk about anything but me  oh i guess rip van winkle didnt have all the good luck  yes yes said i hurriedly pulling out my typewritten play shes no doubt a charming girl  now heres that little curtainraiser you promised to listen to  ever been tried on the stage asked hollis  not exactly i answered  i read half of it the other day to a fellow whose brother knows robert edeson but he had to catch a train before i finished  go on said hollis sliding back in his chair like a good fellow im no stage carpenter but ill tell you what i think of it from a firstrow balcony standpoint  im a theatre bug during the season and i can size up a fake play almost as quick as the gallery can flag the waiter once more and then go ahead as hard as you like with it  ill be the dog  i read my little play lovingly and i fear not without some elocution  there was one scene in it that i believed in greatly the comedy swiftly rises into thrilling and unexpectedly developed drama capt marchmont suddenly becomes cognizant that his wife is an unscrupulous adventuress who has deceived him from the day of their first meeting  the rapid and mortal duel between them from that momentshe with her magnificent lies and siren charm winding about him like a serpent trying to recover her lost ground he with his mans agony and scorn and lost faith trying to tear her from his heart  that scene i always thought was a crackerjack  when capt marchmont discovers her duplicity by reading on a blotter in a mirror the impression of a note that she has written to the count he raises his hand to heaven and exclaims  o god who created woman while adam slept and gave her to him for a companion take back thy gift and return instead the sleep though it last forever  rot said hollis rudely when i had given those lines with proper emphasis  i beg your pardon i said as sweetly as i could  come now went on hollis dont be an idiot  you know very well that nobody spouts any stuff like that these days  that sketch went along all right until you rang in the skyrockets  cut out that rightarm exercise and the adam and eve stunt and make your captain talk as you or i or bill jones would  ill admit said i earnestly for my theory was being touched upon that on all ordinary occasions all of us use commonplace language to convey our thoughts  you will remember that up to the moment when the captain makes his terrible discovery all the characters on the stage talk pretty much as they would in real life but i believe that i am right in allowing him lines suitable to the strong and tragic situation into which he falls  tragic my eye said my friend irreverently  in shakespeares day he might have sputtered out some highcockalorum nonsense of that sort because in those days they ordered ham and eggs in blank verse and discharged the cook with an epic  but not for bway in the summer of 1905  it is my opinion said i that great human emotions shake up our vocabulary and leave the words best suited to express them on top  a sudden violent grief or loss or disappointment will bring expressions out of an ordinary man as strong and solemn and dramatic as those used in fiction or on the stage to portray those emotions  thats where you fellows are wrong said hollis  plain everyday talk is what goes  your captain would very likely have kicked the cat lit a cigar stirred up a highball and telephoned for a lawyer instead of getting off those robert mantell pyrotechnics  possibly a little later i continued  but just at the timejust as the blow is delivered if something scriptural or theatrical and deeptongued isnt wrung from a man in spite of his modern and practical way of speaking then im wrong  of course said hollis kindly youve got to whoop her up some degrees for the stage  the audience expects it  when the villain kidnaps little effie you have to make her mother claw some chunks out of the atmosphere and scream me cheeild me cheeild  what she would actually do would be to call up the police by phone ring for some strong tea and get the little darlings photo out ready for the reporters  when you get your villain in a cornera stage cornerits all right for him to clap his hand to his forehead and hiss all is lost  off the stage he would remark  this is a conspiracy against mei refer you to my lawyers  i get no consolation said i gloomily from your concession of an accentuated stage treatment  in my play i fondly hoped that i was following life  if people in real life meet great crises in a commonplace way they should do the same on the stage  and then we drifted like two trout out of our cool pool in the great hotel and began to nibble languidly at the gay flies in the swift current of broadway  and our question of dramatic art was unsettled  we nibbled at the flies and avoided the hooks as wise trout do but soon the weariness of manhattan in summer overcame us  nine stories up facing the south was holliss apartment and we soon stepped into an elevator bound for that cooler haven  i was familiar in those quarters and quickly my play was forgotten and i stood at a sideboard mixing things with cracked ice and glasses all about me  a breeze from the bay came in the windows not altogether blighted by the asphalt furnace over which it had passed hollis whistling softly turned over a latearrived letter or two on his table and drew around the coolest wicker armchairs  i was just measuring the vermouth carefully when i heard a sound some mans voice groaned hoarsely  false oh godfalse and love is a lie and friendship but the byword of devils  i looked around quickly  hollis lay across the table with his head down upon his outstretched arms  and then he looked up at me and laughed in his ordinary manner  i knew himhe was poking fun at me about my theory  and it did seem so unnatural those swelling words during our quiet gossip that i half began to believe i had been mistakenthat my theory was wrong  hollis raised himself slowly from the table  you were right about that theatrical business old man he said quietly as he tossed a note to me  i read it  loris had run away with tom tolliver    a little talk about mobs  i see remarked the tall gentleman in the frock coat and black slouch hat that another street car motorman in your city has narrowly excaped lynching at the hands of an infuriated mob by lighting a cigar and walking a couple of blocks down the street  do you think they would have lynched him asked the new yorker in the next seat of the ferry station who was also waiting for the boat  not until after the election said the tall man cutting a corner off his plug of tobacco  ive been in your city long enough to know something about your mobs  the motormans mob is about the least dangerous of them all except the national guard and the dressmakers convention  you see when little willie goldstein is sent by his mother for pigs knuckles with a nickel tightly grasped in his chubby fist he always crosses the street car track safely twenty feet ahead of the car and then suddenly turns back to ask his mother whether it was pale ale or a spool of 80 white cotton that she wanted  the motorman yells and throws himself on the brakes like a football player  there is a horrible grinding and then a ripping sound and a piercing shriek and willie is sitting with part of his trousers torn away by the fender screaming for his lost nickel  in ten seconds the car is surrounded by 600 infuriated citizens crying lynch the motorman  lynch the motorman at the top of their voices  some of them run to the nearest cigar store to get a rope but they find the last one has just been cut up and labelled hundreds of the excited mob press close to the cowering motorman whose hand is observed to tremble perceptibly as he transfers a stick of pepsin gum from his pocket to his mouth  when the bloodthirsty mob of maddened citizens has closed in on the motorman some bringing camp stools and sitting quite close to him and all shouting lynch him policeman fogarty forces his way through them to the side of their prospective victim  hello mike says the motorman in a low voice nice day  shall i sneak off a block or so or would you like to rescue me  well jerry if you dont mind says the policeman id like to disperse the infuriated mob singlehanded  i havent defeated a lynching mob since last tuesday and that was a small one of only 300 that wanted to string up a dago boy for selling wormy pears it would boost me some down at the station  all right mike says the motorman anything to oblige  ill turn pale and tremble  and he does so and policeman fogarty draws his club and says gwan wid yez and in eight seconds the desperate mob has scattered and gone about its business except about a hundred who remain to search for willies nickel  i never heard of a mob in our city doing violence to a motorman because of an accident said the new yorker  you are not liable to said the tall man  they know the motormans all right and that he wouldnt even run over a stray dog if he could help it  and they know that not a man among em would tie the knot to hang even a thomas cat that had been tried and condemned and sentenced according to law  then why do they become infuriated and make threats of lynching asked the new yorker  to assure the motorman answered the tall man that he is safe if they really wanted to do him up they would go into the houses and drop bricks on him from the thirdstory windows  new yorkers are not cowards said the other man a little stiffly  not one at a time agreed the tall man promptly  youve got a fine lot of singlehanded scrappers in your town  id rather fight three of you than one and id go up against all the gas trusts victims in a bunch before id pass two citizens on a dark corner with my watch chain showing  when you get rounded up in a bunch you lose your nerve get you in crowds and youre easy  ask the l road guards and george b cortelyou and the tintype booths at coney island  divided you stand united you fall  e pluribus nihil whenever one of your mobs surrounds a man and begins to holler lynch him he says to himself oh dear i suppose i must look pale to please the boys but i will forsooth let my life insurance premium lapse tomorrow  this is a sure tip for me to play methuselah straight across the board in the next handicap  i can imagine the tortured feelings of a prisoner in the hands of new york policemen when an infuriated mob demands that he be turned over to them for lynching  for gods sake officers cries the distracted wretch have ye hearts of stone that ye will not let them wrest me from ye  sorry jimmy says one of the policemen but it wont do  theres three of usme and darrel and the plainclothes man and theres only sivin thousand of the mob  howd we explain it at the office if they took ye  jist chase the infuriated aggregation around the corner darrel and well be movin along to the station  some of our gatherings of excited citizens have not been so harmless said the new yorker with a faint note of civic pride  ill admit that said the tall man  a cousin of mine who was on a visit here once had an arm broken and lost an ear in one of them  that must have been during the cooper union riots remarked the new yorker  not the cooper union explained the tall manbut it was a union riotat the vanastor wedding  you seem to be in favor of lynch law said the new yorker severely  no sir i am not  no intelligent man is  but sir there are certain cases when people rise in their just majesty and take a righteous vengeance for crimes that the law is slow in punishing i am an advocate of law and order but i will say to you that less than six months ago i myself assisted at the lynching of one of that race that is creating a wide chasm between your section of country and mine sir  it is a deplorable condition said the new yorker that exists in the south but  i am from indiana sir said the tall man taking another chew and i dont think you will condemn my course when i tell you that the colored man in question had stolen 960 in cash sir from my own brother    the snow man  editorial notebefore the fatal illness of william sydney porter known through his literary work as o henry this american master of shortstory writing had begun for hamptons magazine the story printed below  illness crept upon him rapidly and he was compelled to give up writing about at the point where the girl enters the story  when he realized that he could do no more it was his lifelong habit to write with a pencil never dictating to a stenographer o henry told in detail the remainder of the snow man to harris merton lyon whom he had often spoken of as one of the most effective shortstory writers of the present time  mr porter had delineated all of the characters leaving only the rounding out of the plot in the final pages to mr lyon   housed and windowpaned from it the greatest wonder to little children is the snow  to men it is something like a crucible in which their world melts into a white star ten million miles away the man who can stand the test is a snow man and this is his reading by fahrenheit reaumur or mosess carven tablets of stone  night had fluttered a sable pinion above the canyon of big lost river and i urged my horse toward the bay horse ranch because the snow was deepening  the flakes were as large as an hours circular tatting by miss wilkinss ablest spinster betokening a heavy snowfall and less entertainment and more adventure than the completion of the tatting could promise  i knew ross curtis of the bay horse and that i would be welcome as a snowbound pilgrim both for hospitalitys sake and because ross had few chances to confide in living creatures who did not neigh bellow bleat yelp or howl during his discourse  the ranch house was just within the jaws of the canyon where its builder may have fatuously fancied that the timbered and rocky walls on both sides would have protected it from the wintry colorado winds but i feared the drift  even now through the endless bottomless rift in the hillsthe speaking tube of the four windscame roaring the voice of the proprietor to the little room on the top floor  at my hello a ranch hand came from an outer building and received my thankful horse  in another minute ross and i sat by a stove in the diningroom of the fourroom ranch house while the big simple welcome of the household lay at my disposal  fanned by the whizzing norther the fine dry snow was sifted and bolted through the cracks and knotholes of the logs  the cook room without a separating door appended  in there i could see a short sturdy leisurely and weatherbeaten man moving with professional sureness about his redhot stove his face was stolid and unreadablesomething like that of a great thinker or of one who had no thoughts to conceal  i thought his eye seemed unwarrantably superior to the elements and to the man but quickly attributed that to the characteristic selfimportance of a petty chef camp cook was the niche that i gave him in the hall of types and he fitted it as an apple fits a dumpling  cold it was in spite of the glowing stove and ross and i sat and talked shuddering frequently half from nerves and half from the freezing draughts  so he brought the bottle and the cook brought boiling water and we made prodigious hot toddies against the attacks of boreas  we clinked glasses often  they sounded like icicles dropping from the eaves or like the tinkle of a thousand prisms on a louis xiv chandelier that i once heard at a boarders dance in the parlor of a tenaweek boardinghouse in gramercy square  sic transit  silence in the terrible beauty of the snow and of the sphinx and of the stars but they who believe that all things from a withoutwine table dhote to the crucifixion may be interpreted through music might have found a nocturne or a symphony to express the isolation of that blottedout world  the clink of glass and bottle the aeolian chorus of the wind in the house crannies its deeper trombone through the canyon below and the wagnerian crash of the cooks pots and pans united in a fit discordant melody i thought  no less welcome an accompaniment was the sizzling of broiling ham and venison cutlet indorsed by the solvent fumes of true java bringing rich promises of comfort to our yearning souls  the cook brought the smoking supper to the table  he nodded to me democratically as he cast the heavy plates around as though he were pitching quoits or hurling the discus  i looked at him with some appraisement and curiosity and much conciliation  there was no prophet to tell us when that drifting evil outside might cease to fall and it is well when snowbound to stand somewhere within the radius of the cooks favorable consideration  but i could read neither favor nor disapproval in the face and manner of our potwrestler  he was about five feet nine inches and two hundred pounds of commonplace bullnecked pinkfaced callous calm  he wore brown duck trousers too tight and too short and a blue flannel shirt with sleeves rolled above his elbows  there was a sort of grim steady scowl on his features that looked to me as though he had fixed it there purposely as a protection against the weakness of an inherent amiability that he fancied were better concealed  and then i let supper usurp his brief occupancy of my thoughts  draw up george said ross  lets all eat while the grubs hot  you fellows go on and chew answered the cook  i ate mine in the kitchen before sundown  think itll be a big snow george asked the ranchman  george had turned to reenter the cook room  he moved slowly around and looking at his face it seemed to me that he was turning over the wisdom and knowledge of centuries in his head  it might was his delayed reply  at the door of the kitchen he stopped and looked back at us  both ross and i held our knives and forks poised and gave him our regard some men have the power of drawing the attention of others without speaking a word  their attitude is more effective than a shout  and again it mightnt said george and went back to his stove  after we had eaten he came in and gathered the emptied dishes  he stood for a moment while his spurious frown deepened  it might stop any minute he said or it might keep up for days  at the farther end of the cook room i saw george pour hot water into his dishpan light his pipe and put the tableware through its required lavation  he then carefully unwrapped from a piece of old saddle blanket a paperback book and settled himself to read by his dim oil lamp  and then the ranchman threw tobacco on the cleared table and set forth again the bottles and glasses and i saw that i stood in a deep channel through which the long dammed flood of his discourse would soon be booming  but i was half content comparing my fate with that of the late thomas tucker who had to sing for his supper thus doubling the burdens of both himself and his host  snow is a hell of a thing said ross by way of a foreword  it aint somehow it seems to me salubrious  i can stand water and mud and two inches below zero and a hundred and ten in the shade and mediumsized cyclones but this here fuzzy white stuff naturally gets me all locoed  i reckon the reason it rattles you is because it changes the look of things so much  its like you had a wife and left her in the morning with the same old blue cotton wrapper on and rides in of a night and runs across her all outfitted in a white silk evening frock waving an ostrichfeather fan and monkeying with a posy of lily flowers  wouldnt it make you look for your pocket compass  youd be liable to kiss her before you collected your presence of mind  by and by the flood of rosss talk was drawn up into the clouds so it pleased me to fancy and there condensed into the finer snowflakes of thought and we sat silent about the stove as good friends and bitter enemies will do  i thought of bosss preamble about the mysterious influence upon man exerted by that erminelined monster that now covered our little world and knew he was right  of all the curious knickknacks mysteries puzzles indian gifts rattraps and welldisguised blessings that the gods chuck down to us from the olympian peaks the most disquieting and evilbringing is the snow  by scientific analysis it is absolute beauty and purityso at the beginning we look doubtfully at chemistry  it falls upon the world and lo we live in another  it hides in a night the old scars and familiar places with which we have grown heartsick or enamored  so as quietly as we can we hustle on our embroidered robes and hie us on prince camaralzamans horse or in the reindeer sleigh into the white country where the seven colors converge this is when our fancy can overcome the bane of it  but in certain spots of the earth comes the snowmadness made known by people turned wild and distracted by the bewildering veil that has obscured the only world they know  in the cities the white fairy who sets the brains of her dupes whirling by a wave of her wand is cast for the comedy role  her diamond shoe buckles glitter like frost with a pirouette she invites the spotless carnival  but in the waste places the snow is sardonic  sponging out the world of the outliers it gives no foothold on another sphere in return it makes of the earth a firmament under foot it leaves us clawing and stumbling in space in an inimical fifth element whose evil outdoes its strangeness and beauty there nature low comedienne plays her tricks on man  though she has put him forth as her highest product it appears that she has fashioned him with what seems almost incredible carelessness and indexterity  onesided and without balance with his two halves unequally fashioned and joined must he ever jog his eccentric way  the snow falls the darkness caps it and the ridiculous manbiped strays in accurate circles until he succumbs in the ruins of his defective architecture  in the throat of the thirsty the snow is vitriol  in appearance as plausible as the breakfast food of the angels it is as hot in the mouth as ginger increasing the pangs of the waterfamished  it is a derivative from water air and some cold uncanny fire from which the caloric has been extracted  good has been said of it even the poets crazed by its spell and shivering in their attics under its touch have indited permanent melodies commemorative of its beauty  still to the saddest overcoated optimist it is a plaguea corroding plague that pharaoh successfully sidestepped  it beneficently covers the wheat fields swelling the cropand the flour trust gets us by the throat like a sudden quinsy  it spreads the tail of its white kirtle over the red seams of the rugged northand the alaskan short story is born  etiolated perfidy it shelters the mountain traveler burrowing from the icy airand melting tomorrow drowns his brother in the valley below  at its worst it is lock and key and crucible and the wand of circe when it corrals man in lonely ranches mountain cabins and forest huts the snow makes apes and tigers of the hardiest  it turns the bosoms of weaker ones to glass their tongues to infants rattles their hearts to lawlessness and spleen  it is not all from the isolation the snow is not merely a blockader it is a chemical test it is a good man who can show a reaction that is not chiefly composed of a drachm or two of potash and magnesia with traces of adam ananias nebuchadnezzar and the fretful porcupine  this is no story you say well let it begin  there was a knock at the door is the opening not full of context and reminiscence oh best buyers of best sellers  we drew the latch and in stumbled etienne girod as he afterward named himself  but just then he was no more than a worm struggling for life enveloped in a killing white chrysalis  we dug down through snow overcoats mufflers and waterproofs and dragged forth a living thing with a van dyck beard and marvellous diamond rings  we put it through the approved curriculum of snowrubbing hot milk and teaspoonful doses of whiskey working him up to a graduating class entitled to a diploma of three fingers of rye in half a glassful of hot water  one of the ranch boys had already come from the quarters at rosss buglelike yell and kicked the strangers staggering pony to some sheltered corral where beasts were entertained  let a paragraphic biography of girod intervene  etienne was an opera singer originally we gathered but adversity and the snow had made him non compos vocis  the adversity consisted of the stranded san salvador opera company a period of hotel secondstory work and then a career as a professional palmist jumping from town to town  for like other professional palmists every time he worked the heart line too strongly he immediately moved along the line of least resistance  though etienne did not confide this to us we surmised that he had moved out into the dusk about twenty minutes ahead of a constable and had thus encountered the snow  in his most sacred blue language he dilated upon the subject of snow for etienne was parisborn and loved the snow with the same passion that an orchid does  meeserrhable commented etienne and took another three fingers  complete castiron pussyfooted blank blank said ross and followed suit  rotten said i  the cook said nothing  he stood in the door weighing our outburst and insistently from behind that frozen visage i got two messages via the m a m wireless  one was that george considered our vituperation against the snow childish the other was that george did not love dagoes  inasmuch as etienne was a frenchman i concluded i had the message wrong  so i queried the other bright eyes you dont really mean dagoes do you and over the wireless came three deathly psychic taps  yes  then i reflected that to george all foreigners were probably dagoes  i had once known another camp cook who had thought mons sig and millie transmississippi for mlle were italian given names this cook used to marvel therefore at the paucity of neoroman precognomens and therefore why not  i have said that snow is a test of men  for one day two days etienne stood at the window fletcherizing his finger nails and shrieking and moaning at the monotony  to me etienne was just about as unbearable as the snow and so seeking relief i went out on the second day to look at my horse slipped on a stone broke my collarbone and thereafter underwent not the snow test but the test of flatontheback  a test that comes once too often for any man to stand  however i bore up cheerfully  i was now merely a spectator and from my couch in the big room i could lie and watch the human interplay with that detached impassive impersonal feeling which french writers tell us is so valuable to the litterateur and american writers to the farodealer  i shall go crazy in this abominable meeserrhable place was etiennes constant prediction  never knew mark twain to bore me before said ross over and over he sat by the other window hour after hour a box of pittsburg stogies of the length strength and odor of a pittsburg graft scandal deposited on one side of him and roughing it the jumping frog and life on the mississippi on the other  for every chapter he lit a new stogy puffing furiously  this in time gave him a recurrent premonition of cramps gastritis smokers colic or whatever it is they have in pittsburg after a too deep indulgence in graft scandals to fend off the colic ross resorted time and again to old doctor stills ambercolored u s a colic cure  result after fortyeight hoursnerves  positive fact i never knew mark twain to make me tired before positive fact  ross slammed roughing it on the floor  when youre snowbound thisaway you want tragedy i guess  humor just seems to bring out all your cussedness  you read a mans poor pitiful attempts to be funny and it makes you so nervous you want to tear the book up get out your bandana and have a good long cry  at the other end of the room the frenchman took his finger nails out of his mouth long enough to exclaim  humor  humor at such a time as thees  my god i shall go crazy in thees abominable  supper announced george  these meals were not the meals of rabelais who said the great god makes the planets and we make the platters neat  by that time the ranchhouse meals were not affairs of gusto they were mental distraction not bodily provender  what they were to be later shall never be forgotten by ross or me or etienne  after supper the stogies and finger nails began again  my shoulder ached wretchedly and with halfclosed eyes i tried to forget it by watching the deft movements of the stolid cook  suddenly i saw him cock his ear like a dog  then with a swift step he moved to the door threw it open and stood there  the rest of us had heard nothing  what is it george asked ross  the cook reached out his hand into the darkness alongside the jamb with careful precision he prodded something  then he made one careful step into the snow  his back muscles bulged a little under the arms as he stooped and lightly lifted a burden  another step inside the door which he shut methodically behind him and he dumped the burden at a safe distance from the fire  he stood up and fixed us with a solemn eye  none of us moved under that orphic suspense until  a woman remarked george   miss willie adams was her name  vocation schoolteacher  present avocation getting  lost  in  the  snow  age yumyum the persian for twenty  take to the woods if you would describe miss adams a willow for grace a hickory for fibre a birch for the clear whiteness of her skin for eyes the blue sky seen through treetops the silk in cocoons for her hair her voice the murmur of the evening june wind in the leaves her mouth the berries of the wintergreen fingers as light as ferns her toe as small as a deer track  general impression upon the dazed beholderyou could not see the forest for the trees  psychology with a capital p and the foot of a lynx at this juncture stalks into the ranch house  three men a cook a pretty young womanall snowbound  count me out of it as i did not count anyway i never did with women  count the cook out if you like  but note the effect upon ross and etienne girod  ross dumped mark twain in a trunk and locked the trunk  also he discarded the pittsburg scandals  also he shaved off a three days beard  etienne being french began on the beard first  he pomaded it from a little tube of grease hongroise in his vest pocket   he combed it with a little aluminum comb from the same vest pocket he trimmed it with manicure scissors from the same vest pocket  his light and gallic spirits underwent a sudden miraculous change  he hummed a blithe san salvador opera company tune he grinned smirked bowed pirouetted twiddled twaddled twisted and tooralooed  gayly the notorious troubadour could not have equalled etienne  rosss method of advance was brusque domineering  little woman he said youre welcome hereand with what he thought subtle double meaningwelcome to stay here as long as you like snow or no snow  miss adams thanked him a little wildly some of the wintergreen berries creeping into the birch bark  she looked around hurriedly as if seeking escape  but there was none save the kitchen and the room allotted her  she made an excuse and disappeared into her own room  later i feigning sleep heard the following  mees adams i was almost to perishdieof monotony wen your fair and beautiful face appear in thees meeserrhable house  i opened my starboard eye  the beard was being curled furiously around a finger the svengali eye was rolling the chair was being hunched closer to the schoolteachers  i am frenchyou seetemperamentalnervous i cannot endure thees dull hours in thees ranch house buta woman comes  ah  the shoulders gave nine rahs and a tiger  what a difference  all is light and gay everting smile wen you smile you have eart beauty grace  my eart comes back to me wen i feel your eart  so  he laid his hand upon his vest pocket  from this vantage point he suddenly snatched at the  schoolteachers own hand ah mees adams if i could only tell you how i ad  dinner remarked george  he was standing just behind the frenchmans ear  his eyes looked straight into the schoolteachers eyes  after thirty seconds of survey his lips moved deep in the flinty frozen maelstrom of his face  dinner he concluded will be ready in two minutes  miss adams jumped to her feet relieved  i must get ready for dinner she said brightly and went into her room  ross came in fifteen minutes late  after the dishes had been cleaned away i waited until a propitious time when the room was temporarily ours alone and told him what had happened  he became so excited that he lit a stogy without thinking yellerhided unwashed palmreadin skunk he said under his breath ill shoot him full o holes if he dont watch outtalkin that way to my wife  i gave a jump that set my collarbone back another week  your wife i gasped  well i mean to make her that he announced  the air in the ranch house the rest of that day was tense with pentup emotions oh best buyers of best sellers  ross watched miss adams as a hawk does a hen he watched etienne as a hawk does a scarecrow etienne watched miss adams as a weasel does a henhouse  he paid no attention to ross  the condition of miss adams in the role of soughtafter was feverish lately escaped from the agony and long torture of the white cold where for hours nature had kept the little schoolteachers vision locked in and turned upon herself nobody knows through what profound feminine introspections she had gone  now suddenly cast among men instead of finding relief and security she beheld herself plunged anew into other discomforts  even in her own room she could hear the loud voices of her imposed suitors  ill blow you full o holes shouted ross witnesses shrieked etienne waving his hand at the cook and me  she could not have known the previous harassed condition of the men fretting under indoor conditions  all she knew was that where she had expected the frank freemasonry of the west she found the subtle tangle of two mens minds bent upon exacting whatever romance there might be in her situation  she tried to dodge ross and the frenchman by spells of nursing me they also came over to help nurse  this combination aroused such a natural state of invalid cussedness on my part that they were all forced to retire  once she did manage to whisper  i am so worried here  i dont know what to do  to which i replied gently hitching up my shoulder that i was a hunchsavant and that the eighth house under this sign the moon being in virgo showed that everything would turn out all right  but twenty minutes later i saw etienne reading her palm and felt that perhaps i might have to recast her horoscope and try for a dark man coming with a bundle  toward sunset etienne left the house for a few moments and ross who had been sitting taciturn and morose having unlocked mark twain made another dash  it was typical ross talk  he stood in front of her and looked down majestically at that cool and perfect spot where miss adams forehead met the neat part in her fragrant hair  first however he cast a desperate glance at me  i was in a profound slumber  little woman he began its certainly tough for a man like me to see you bothered this way  yougulpyou have been alone in this world too long  you need a protector  i might say that at a time like this you need a protector the worst kinda protector who would take a threering delight in smashing the saffroncolored kisser off of any yellerskinned skunk that made himself obnoxious to you  hem hem  i am a lonely man miss adams  i have so far had to carry on my life without thegulpsweet radiancegulpof a woman around the house  i feel especially doggoned lonely at a time like this when i am pretty near locoed from havin to stall indoors and hence it was with delight i welcomed your first appearance in this here shack since then i have been packed jam full of more different kinds of feelings ornery mean dizzy and superb than has fallen my way in years  miss adams made a useless movement toward escape  the ross chin stuck firm  i dont want to annoy you miss adams but by heck if it comes to that youll have to be annoyed  and ill have to have my say this palmticklin slob of a frenchman ought to be kicked off the place and if youll say the word off he goes  but i dont want to do the wrong thing  youve got to show a preference  im gettin around to the point missmiss willie in my own brick fashion  ive stood about all i can stand these last two days and somethins got to happen the suspense hereabouts is enough to hang a sheepherder miss williehe lassooed her hand by main forcejust say the word you need somebody to take your part all your life long  will you mar  supper remarked george tersely from the kitchen door  miss adams hurried away  ross turned angrily  you  i have been revolving it in my head said george  he brought the coffee pot forward heavily then bravely the big platter of pork and beans  then somberly the potatoes  then profoundly the biscuits  i have been revolving it in my mind there aint no use waitin any longer for swengalley  might as well eat now  from my excellent vantagepoint on the couch i watched the progress of that meal  ross muddled glowering disappointed etienne eternally blandishing attentive ogling miss adams nervous picking at her food hesitant about answering questions almost hysterical now and then the solid flitting shadow of the cook passing behind their backs like a dreadnaught in a fog  i used to own a clock which gurgled in its throat three minutes before it struck the hour  i know therefore the slow freight of anticipation  for i have awakened at three in the morning heard the clock gurgle and waited those three minutes for the three strokes i knew were to come  alors  in rosss ranch house that night the slow freight of  climax whistled in the distance  etienne began it after supper  miss adams had suddenly displayed a lively interest in the kitchen layout and i could see her in there chatting brightly at georgenot with himthe while he ducked his head and rattled his pans  my fren said etienne exhaling a large cloud from his cigarette and patting ross lightly on the shoulder with a bediamonded hand which hung limp from a yard or more of bony arm i see i mus be frank with you  firs because we are rivals second because you take these matters so serious ii am frenchman  i love the womenhe threw back his curls bared his yellow teeth and blew an unsavory kiss toward the kitchen  it is i suppose a trait of my nation  all frenchmen love the womenpretty women  now look here i am  he spread out his arms  cold outside  i detes the colll  snow  i abominate the meesserrhable snow  two men this pointing to mean this  pointing to ross  i am distracted  for two whole days i stan at the window an tear my air  i am nervous upset prrrofounly distress inside my ead an suddenlybeold  a woman a nice pretty charming innocen young woman  i naturally rejoice  i become myself againgay lightearted appy  i address myself to mademoiselle it passes the time  that msieu is wot the women are forpass the time entertainmentlike the music like the wine  they appeal to the mood the caprice the temperamen  to play with thees woman follow her through her humor pursue herah that is the mos delightful way to sen the hours about their business  ross banged the table  shut up you miserable yeller pup he roared i object to your pursuin anything or anybody in my house now you listen to me you  he picked up the box of stogies and used it on the table as an emphasizer  the noise of it awoke the attention of the girl in the kitchen  unheeded she crept into the room  i dont know anything about your french ways of lovemakin an i dont care  in my section of the country its the best man wins and im the best man here and dont you forget it  this girls goin to be mine  there aint going to be any playing or philandering or palm reading about it  ive made up my mind ill have this girl and that settles it  my word is the law in this neck o the woods shes mine and as soon as she says shes mine you pull out  the box made one final tremendous punctuation point  etiennes bravado was unruffled  ah that is no way to win a woman he smiled easily  i make prophecy you will never win er that way no  not thees woman  she mus be played along an then keessed this charming delicious little creature  one kees  an then you ave her  again he displayed his unpleasant teeth  i make you a bet i will kees her  as a cheerful chronicler of deeds done well it joys me to relate that the hand which fell upon etiennes amorous lips was not his own there was one sudden sound as of a mule kicking a lath fence and thenthrough the swinging doors of oblivion for etienne  i had seen this blow delivered  it was an aloof unstudied almost absentminded affair  i had thought the cook was rehearsing the proper method of turning a flapjack  silently lost in thought he stood there scratching his head  then he began rolling down his sleeves  youd better get your things on miss and well get out of here he decided  wrap up warm  i heard her heave a little sigh of relief as she went to get her cloak sweater and hat  ross jumped to his feet and said  george what are you goin to do  george who had been headed in my direction slowly swivelled around and faced his employer  bein a camp cook i aint overburdened with hosses george enlightened us  therefore i am going to try to borrow this fellers here  for the first time in four days my soul gave a genuine cheer  if its for lochinvar purposes go as far as you like i said grandly  the cook studied me a moment as if trying to find an insult in my words  no he replied  its for mine and the young ladys purposes and well go only three milesto hicksville  now let me tell you somethin ross suddenly i was confronted with the cooks chunky back and i heard a low curt carrying voice shoot through the room at my host  george had wheeled just as ross started to speak youre nutty  thats whats the matter with you  you cant stand the snow youre getting nervouser and nuttier every day  that and this dagohe jerked a thumb at the halfdead frenchman in the cornerhas got you to the point where i thought i better horn in i got to revolving it around in my mind and i seen if somethin wasnt done and done soon thered be murder around here and maybehis head gave an imperceptible list toward the girls roomworse  he stopped but he held up a stubby finger to keep any one else from speaking  then he plowed slowly through the drift of his ideas about this here woman  i know you ross and i know what you reely think about women  if she hadnt happened in here durin this here snow youd never have given two thoughts to the whole woman question likewise when the storm clears and you and the boys go hustlin out this here whole business ll clear out of your head and you wont think of a skirt again until kingdom come  just because o this snow here dont forget youre living in the selfsame world you was in four days ago  and youre the same man too  now whats the use o getting all snarled up over four days of stickin in the house  that theres what i been revolvin in my mind and this heres the decision ive come to  he plodded to the door and shouted to one of the ranch hands to saddle my horse  ross lit a stogy and stood thoughtful in the middle of the room  then he began  ive a durn good notion george to knock your confounded head off and throw you into that snowbank if  youre wrong mister  that aint a durned good notion youve got its durned bad  look here  he pointed steadily out of doors until we were both forced to follow his finger  youre in here for moren a week yet after allowing this fact to sink in he barked out at ross can you cook  then at me  can you cook  then he looked at the wreck of etienne and sniffed  there was an embarrassing silence as ross and i thought solemnly of a foodless week  if you just use hoss sense concluded george and dont go for to hurt my feelins all i want to do is to take this young gal down to hicksville and then ill head back here and cook fer you  the horse and miss adams arrived simultaneously both of them very serious and quiet  the horse because he knew what he had before him in that weather the girl because of what she had left behind  then all at once i awoke to a realization of what the cook was doing my god man i cried arent you afraid to go out in that snow  behind my back i heard ross mutter not him  george lifted the girl daintily up behind the saddle drew on his gloves put his foot in the stirrup and turned to inspect me leisurely  as i passed slowly in his review i saw in my minds eye the algebraic equation of snow the equals sign and the answer in the man before me  snow is my last name said george  he swung into the saddle and they started cautiously out into the darkening swirl of fresh new currency just issuing from the snowdrop mint  the girl to keep her place clung happily to the sturdy figure of the camp cook  i brought three things away from ross curtiss ranch houseyes four one was the appreciation of snow which i have so humbly tried here to render 2 was a collarbone of which i am extra careful 3 was a memory of what it is to eat very extremely bad food for a week and 4 was the cause of 3 a little note delivered at the end of the week and handpainted in blue pencil on a sheet of meat paper  i cannot come back there to that there job  mrs snow say no george i been revolvin it in my mind considerin circumstances shes right
