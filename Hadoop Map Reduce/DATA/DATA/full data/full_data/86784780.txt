86784780	the rover boys at school  or  the cadets of putnam hall  by arthur m winfield edward stratemeyer     introduction   my dear boys  the rover boys at school has been written that those of you who have never put in a term or more at an american military academy for boys may gain some insight into the workings of such an institution  while putnam hall is not the real name of the particular place of learning i had in  mind while penning this tale for your amusement and instruction there is really such a school and dear captain putnam is a living person as are also the lively wideawake funloving rover brothers dick tom and sam and their schoolfellows larry fred and frank  the same can be said to a certain degree of the bully dan baxter and his toady the sneak commonly known as mumps  the present story is complete in itself but it is written as the first of a series to be followed by the rover boys on the ocean and the rover boys in the jungle in both of which volumes we will again meet many of our former characters  trusting that this tale will find as much favor in your hands as have my previous stories i remain  affectionately and sincerely yours  edward stratemeyer     chapter i  introducing the rover boys   hurrah sam it is settled at last that we are to go to boarding school  are you certain tom  dont let me raise any false hopes  yes i am certain for i heard uncle randolph tell aunt martha that he wouldnt keep us in the house another week  he said he would rather put up with the central park menageriethink of that and tom rover began  to laugh  thats rather rough on us but i dont know but what we deserve it answered sam rover toms younger brother  we have been giving it pretty strong lately with playing tricks on sarah the cook jack the hired man and uncle randolphs pet dog alexander but then we had to do somethingor go into a dry rot  life in the country is all well enough but its mighty slow for me  i guess it is slow for anybody brought up in new york sam  why the first week i spent here i thought the stillness would kill me i couldnt actually go to sleep because it was so quiet  i wish uncle and aunt would move to the city  they have money enough  aunt martha likes to be quiet and uncle is too much wrapped up in the art of scientific farming as he calls it ill wager hell stay on this farm experimenting and writing works on agriculture until he dies well its a good enough way to do i suppose but it wouldnt suit me i want to see something of lifeas father did  so do i  perhaps well see something when we get to boarding school  where are we to go  i dont know some strict institution you can be sure of that uncle randolph told aunty it was time the three of us were taken in hand he said dick wasnt so bad but you and i  were the bother of his life eh  something about like that  he doesnt see any fun in tricks  he expects us to just walk around the farm or study and above all things keep quiet so that his scientific investigations are not disturbed  why doesnt he let us go out riding or boating on the river or down to the village to play baseball with the rest of the fellows  a real live american boy cant be still all the time and he ought to know it and with a decided shake of his curly head tom rover took a baseball from his pocket and began to throw it up against the side of the farmhouse catching it each time as it came down  tom had thrown the ball up just four times when a pair of blinds to an upper window flew open with a crash and the head of a sternlooking elderly gentleman appeared  the gentleman had gray hair very much tumbled and wore big spectacles  hi hi boys what does this mean came in a highpitched voice what are you hammering on the house for when i am just in the midst of a deep problem concerning the rotation of crops on a hillside with northern exposure  excuse me uncle randolph i didnt think to disturb you answered tom meekly  ill put the ball away  you never stop to think thomas  give me that ball  oh let me keep it uncle randolph  i wont throw it against the house again honor bright  youll forget that promise in ten minutes thomas i know you well  throw the ball up and mr randolph rover held out his hands  all right then here you go answered tom somewhat put out to thus lose a ball which had cost him his weeks spending money and he sent the sphere flying upward at a smart speed  mr rover made a clutch for it but the ball slipped through his hands and landed plump on his nose  oh he cried and disappeared from sight but reappeared a moment later to shake his fist at tom  you young rascal  you did that on purpose he spluttered and brought forth his handkerchief for his nose had begun to bleed was anyone ever tormented so by three boys  now you are in for it again tom whispered sam  i didnt mean to hit you uncle randolph  why didnt you catch it on the fly  on the fly repeated the uncle  do you suppose i am accustomed to catching cannon balls  didnt you ever play baseball  never  i spent my time in some useful study  the elderly gentleman continued to keep his handkerchief to his nose and adjusted his glasses  thank fortune you are all going to go to boarding school next week and we will once more have a little peace and quietness around valley brook  where are we to go uncle randolph asked sam  you will learn that monday morning when you start off  it wouldnt hurt to tell us now grumbled tom  you must learn to be patient thomas  my one hope is that life at boarding school makes a real man of you  of course we are all to go together  yes you are to go together although i can get along with richard very well he is so much more quiet and studious than you or samuel  i reckon he takes after you uncle randolph  if so he might do worse  by the way what were both of you doing here  nothing came from sam  we havent anything to do  this farm is the slowest place on earth added tom  why do you not study the scientific and agricultural works that i mentioned to you  see what i have done for scientific farming  i dont want to be a farmer said tom  id rather be a sailor  a sailor gasped randolph rover  of all things  why a sailor is the merest nobody on earth  i guess you mean on the sea uncle said sam with a grin  dont joke me samuel  yes thomasthe calling of a sailor amounts to absolutely nothing  scientific farming is the thing nothing more noble on the face of the earth than to till the soil  i never saw you behind a plow uncle randolph answered tom with a twinkle in his blue eyes  besides i heard you say that the farm ran behind last year  tut tut boy  you know nothing about it  i made a slight miscalculation in crops that was all  but this year we shall do better  you lost money year before last too commented sam  who told you that  mr woddie the storekeeper at the corners  mr woddie may understand storekeeping but he knows nothing of farming scientific or otherwise  i spent several thousands of dollars in experimenting but the money was not lost  we shall soon have grand results  i shall astonish the whole of new york state at the next meeting of our agricultural society and mr randolph rover waved his hand grandiloquently  it was easy to see that scientific farming was his hobby  randolph  it was the voice of mrs rover who now appeared beside her husband  what is the matter with your nose  tom hit me with his ball  it is all right now although it did bleed some  the bad boy  but it is just like him  sarah has given notice that she will leave at the end of her month  she says she cant stand the pranks tom and sam play on her  she need not gofor the boys are going to boarding school you know  she says you promised to send them off before  well they shall go this time rest assured of that  i cannot stand their racing up and down stairs and their noise any longer  they go monday morning  better send them off tomorrow  wellerthat is rather sudden  sarahs month is up friday  she will surely go unless the boys are out of the house  and she is the best cook i have ever had  excepting when she burnt the custard pies put in tom  and when she salted the rice pudding added sam  silence both of you  randolph do send them off  very well i will  boys you must go away from the house for an hour or two  can we go fishing or swimming asked tom  no i dont want you to go near the river you may get drowned  we can both swim ventured sam  never mindit is not safeand your poor father left you in my care  can we go down to the village  no you might get into bad company there  then where shall we go came from both boys simultaneously  randolph rover scratched his head in perplexity  he had never had any children of his own and to manage his brothers offspring was clearly beyond him  you might go down to the cornfield and study the formation of the ears  send them blackberrying suggested mrs rover  we want the berries for pies tomorrow and it will give them something to do  very well boys you may go blackberrying  and mind you keep out of mischief  well mind answered tom  but you might let me have that ball  i will give it to you in the morning answered randolph rover and turned away from the window with his wife  as soon as they were out of sight tom threw up both hands in mock tragedy alack horatio this excitement killeth me he cried in a stage whisper  sent blackberrying to keep us out of mischief  sam what are we coming to  well its better than moping around doing nothing  for my part i am glad we are to go to boarding school and the sooner the better  but i would like to know where to  if only we were going to a military academy  hurrah  just the thing  but no such luck  get the berry baskets and let us be off  by the way where is dick  gone to the village for the mail  there he comes down the road now and tom pointed to a distant path back of the meadows  the two boys hurried into a woodshed behind the large farmhouse and procured a basket and two tin pails  with these in hand they set off in the direction of the berry patch situated along the path that dick rover was pursuing their intention being to head off their brother and see if he had any letters for them  of the three rover boys richard commonly called dick was the eldest  he was sixteen tall slender and had dark eyes and dark hair  he was a rather quiet boy one who loved to read and study although he was not above having a good time now and then when he felt like breaking loose as tom expressed it  next to richard came tom a year younger as merry a lad as there was ever to be found full of life and go not above playing all sorts of tricks on people but with a heart of gold as even his uncle and aunt felt bound to admit  sam was the youngest  he was but fourteen but of the same height and general appearance as tom and the pair might readily have been taken for twins  he was not as full of pranks as tom but excelled his brothers in many outdoor sports  the history of the three rover boys was a curious one  they were the only children of one anderson rover a gentleman who had been widely known as a mineral expert gold mine proprietor and traveler  mr anderson rover had gone to california a poor young man and had there made a fortune in the mines  returning to the east he had married and settled down in new york city and there the three boys had been born  an epidemic of fever had taken off mrs rover when richard was but ten years of age  the shock had come so suddenly that anderson rover was dazed and for several weeks the man knew not what to do  take all of the money i made in the west but give me back my wife he said brokenheartedly but this could not be and soon after he left his three boys in charge of a housekeeper and set off to tour europe thinking that a change of scene would prove a benefit  when he came back he seemed a changed man  he was restless and could not remain at home for more than a few weeks at a time  he placed the boys at a boarding school in new york and returned to the west where he made another strike in the gold mines and when he came back once more he was reported to be worth between two and three hundred thousand dollars  but now a new idea had came into his head  he had been reading up on africa and had reached the conclusion that there must be gold in the great unexplored regions of that country  he determined to go to africa fit out an exploration and try his luck  it will not cost me over ten to twenty thousand dollars he said to his brother randolph  and it may make me a millionaire  if you are bound to go i will not stop you had been randolph rovers reply  but what of your boys in the meanwhile  this was a serious question for anderson rover knew well the risk he was running knew  well that many a white man had gone into the interior of africa never to return  at last it was settled that randolph rover should become dick tom and sams temporary guardian  this accomplished anderson rover set off and that was the last any of his family had ever heard of him  was he dead or alive  hundreds of times had the boys and their uncle pondered that question  each mail was watched with anxiety but day after day brought no news until the waiting became an old story and all settled down to the dismal conviction that the daring explorer must be dead  he had landed and gone into the interior with three white men and twenty natives and that was all that could be ascertained concerning him  at the time of anderson rovers departure randolph had been on the point of purchasing a farm of two hundred acres in the mohawk valley of new york state  the land had not changed hands until a year later however and then dick tom and sam were called upon to give up their life in the metropolis and settle down in the country a mile away from the village of dexter corners  for a month things had gone very well for all was new and it seemed like a picnic to use toms way of expressing it  they had run over the farm from end to end climbed to the roof of the barn explored the brook and sam had broken his arm by falling from the top of a cherry tree  but after that the novelty wore away and the boys began to fret  they want something to do thought randolph rover and set them to work studying scientific farming as he called it  at this dick made some progress but the uncle could do nothing with tom and sam  then the last two broke loose and began to play pranks on everybody that came along and life became little short of a burden to the studious randolph and his quietminded spouse  i must send them off to a boarding school or somewhere randolph rover would say but he kept putting the matter off hoping against hope that he might soon hear from his lost brother     chapter ii  an encounter on the road   ill race you to the path said sam when the woodshed was left behind  all right answered tom who was always ready to run  toe the mark here  now thenone two three  go  and away they went across the meadow leaping two ditches with the agility of a pair of deer and tearing through the small brush beyond regardless of the briers and the rents their nether garments might sustain  at first tom took the lead but sam speedily overhauled and then passed him  its no useyou always could outrun me panted tom as he came to a stop when sam crossed the footpath ten yards ahead of him  i cant understand it either  my legs are just as long as yours and my lungs just as big too i think  you want to do your running scientifically tom  that athletic instructor in new york  oh bother your scientific things sam  uncle gives us enough of that so dont you start in  i wonder if dick has got a letter from larry colby  he promised to write last week  he is going to a boarding school soon  well know in a few minutes  i wonder where larrygracious listen  sam broke off short as a loud cry for help reached their ears it came from the footpath at a point where it ran through a grove of beech trees  its dicks voice  he wants help burst from toms lips  come on and he set off as rapidly as his exhausted condition would permit  as before sam readily outdistanced him and soon came upon the scene of a most brutal encounter  a burly tramp all of six feet in height had attacked dick rover and thrown him upon his back  the tramp was now kneeling upon the prostrate boys chest at the same time trying to wrench a watch from dicks vest pocket  keep still there or ill knock you on the head cried the tramp as letting go of the watch chain he clapped a dirty hand over dicks mouth  iwontkeekeep still spluttered dick  letmeup  you will keep stillif you know what is best for you  i have your pocketbook and now i am bound to have that watch and that ring  no dont rob me of the watch  it belonged to my father panted dick and as the watch came out of the pocket he made a clutch at it  help help  will you shut up burst out the tramp fiercely and struck at the youth with his fist  it was at this juncture that sam put in an appearance  a glance told him how matters stood and without waiting an instant he came up behind the tramp and catching him by the shoulders hurled him backward  sam  good for you burst out dick joyfully  dont let him get away  what do you mean boy demanded the ruffian as he turned over and leaped to his feet  you let my brother alonethats what i mean was the answer  give me my pocketbook and that watch went on dick for the tramp held both articles one in each hand  yes i willnot was the ready reply turning suddenly the tramp started through the grove of trees on a run  without waiting sam ran after him followed by tom who had now arrived  dick came behind too much winded by being thrown on his back to keep up with them  he is making for the river cried tom after running for several minutes without gaining on the thief  if he has a boat hell get away  i dont think he has a boat tom  he looks like a regular tramp  well soon find out  they could not see the ruffian but they could hear him quite plainly as he crashed through the brush beyond the grove of trees then came a crash and a yell of pain  he has stumbled and fallen said sam and redoubled his speed soon he reached the spot where the tramp had gone down  he was about to proceed further when a wellknown object caught his eye  here is the pocketbook he burst out and picked the article up a hasty examination showed that the contents were intact and the two boys continued the pursuit with dick still following  they were now going downhill toward the river and presently struck a patch of wet meadow  we must be careful here observed tom and just then sank up to his ankles in water and mud  but the tramp could now be seen heading directly for the river and they continued to follow him  they were still fifty yards from the shore when sam uttered a cry of dismay  hes got a boat  so he has  stop there you thief  stop yourself or ill shoot one of you growled the tramp as he leaped into a flat bottom craft moored beside a fallen tree he had no pistol but thought he might scare the boys  they came to a halt and an instant later the flatbottom craft shot away from the river bank  by this time dick came up all out of breath  so he has gotten away he cried in dismay  yes answered sam but here is your pocketbook  and what of my watchthe one father gave to me before he left for africa  hes got that yet i suppose said tom  at this dick gave a groan for the watch was a fine gold one which mr rover had worn for years  dick had begged for the timepiece and it had been entrusted to him at the last moment  we must get that watch back somehow he said  isnt there another boat around here  there is one up to harrisons farm  that is quarter of a mile away  i dont think there is any nearer  and the river is all of two hundred feet wide here  what shall we do  it was a puzzling question and all three of the boys stared blankly at each other  in the meantime the thief had picked up a pair of oars and was using them in a clumsy fashion which showed plainly that he was not used to handling them  if we had a boat we could catch him easily observed tom  then his eyes fell upon the fallen tree  i have an idea  let us try to get across on that  i wont mind a wetting if only we can get dicks watch back  yes yes just the thing put in his elder brother quickly  all hands ran down to the fallen tree which was about a foot in diameter and not over twentyfive or thirty feet in length  it lay half in the water already and it was an easy matter to shove it off  we cant do much without oars or a pole said tom  wait a moment and he ran back to where he had seen another fallen tree a tall slender maple sapling  he soon had this in hand and cleared of its branches it made a capital pole  dick and sam sat astride of the tree in the water and tom stood against an upright branch and shoved off  the river was not deep and he kept on reaching bottom without difficulty  by this time the tramp was halfway across the stream which was flowing rapidly and carrying both boat and tree down toward a bend quarter of a mile below  go on back unless you want to be shot cried the man savagely but they paid no attention to the threat as no pistol appeared and seeing this the thief redoubled his efforts to get away  he was still a quarter of the distance from the opposite shore and the boys on the tree were in midstream when sam uttered a shout  there goes one of his oars  we can catch him nowif we try hard  it was true that the oar was gone and in his anxiety to regain the blade the tramp nearly lost the second oar  but his efforts were unavailing and he started to paddle himself to the bank meanwhile watching his pursuers anxiously  well get him said dick encouragingly when splash tom went overboard like a flash the lower end of his pole having slipped on a smooth rock of the river bottom  there was a grand splutter and it was fully a minute before tom reappearedtwenty feet away and minus his pole  hi help me on board somebody he spluttered for he had gone overboard so quickly that he had swallowed a large quantity of water  both sam and dick tried to reach him but could not  then the current caught the tree and whirled it around and around until both boys began to grow dizzy  seeing they could not aid him and getting back a little of his wind tom struck out for the tree  but the water running over his face blinded him and ere he knew he was so close the tree came circling around and struck him on the side of the head  oh he moaned and sank from sight  toms hit gasped sam  hell be drowned sure now  not if i can help him burst out dick and leaped overboard to his brothers assistance  but tom was still out of sight and for several seconds could not be located  sam waited anxiously half of a mind to jump into the river himself  the tramp was now forgotten and landed on the opposite bank unnoticed  he immediately dove into the bushes and disappeared from view  at last dick caught sight of toms arm and made a clutch for it hardly had he taken hold than tom swung around and caught him by the throat in a deathlike grip for he was too bewildered to know what he was doing  save me he groaned  oh my head  save me  i will tom only dont hold me so tight answered dick icant get any air  i cant swimim all upset was the reply and tom clutched his elder brother tighter than ever  seeing there was no help for it dick caught hold of the fingers around his throat and forced them loose by main force  then he swung himself behind tom and caught him under the arms in the meantime treading water to keep both of them afloat  sam cant you bring that tree closer he called out  there was no reply and looking around he saw that the tree and his younger brother were a hundred yards away and sailing down the river as rapidly as the increasing current could carry them for quarter of a mile below were what were known as the humpback fallsa series of dangerous rapids through which but few boats had ever passed without serious mishap  i reckon sam is having his hands full he thought  i must get tom to the shore alone  but it is going to be a tough job i can see that  oh dick came from tom  my head is spinning like a top  the tree hit you tom  but do keep quiet and ill take care of you  i cant swimi feel like a wet rag through and through  never mind about swimming  only dont catch me by the throat again and well be all right was dicks reassuring reply and as his brother became more passive he struck out for the bank upon which the thief had landed  the current carried them on and on but not so swiftly as it was carrying the tree  soon they were approaching the bend  dick was swimming manfully but was now all but exhausted  you cant make it dick groaned tom  better save yourself  and let you go  no indeed tom  i have a little strength left andhurrah ive struck bottom  dick was right his feet had landed on a sandbar and standing up both boys found the water only to their armpits  under such circumstances they waded ashore with care and here threw themselves down to rest  that thief is gone said dick dismally  and my watch too  but where is sam questioned tom then looked at his brother meaningfully  the humpback fall came from dick  sam  sam he yelled look out where you are going  but no answer came back to his cry for sam had long since floated out of hearing     chapter iii  sams adventure at humpback falls   for several minutes after dick leaped overboard to toms assistance sams one thought was of his two brothers  would they reach the tree or the shore in safety  fervently he prayed they would  the tree went around and around as a side current caught it and presently the whirlings became so rapid that sam grew dizzy and had to hold tight to keep from falling off  he saw dick catch tom from the back and start for shore and then like a flash the realization of his own situation dawned upon him he was on the tree with no means of guiding his improvised craft and sweeping nearer and nearer to the rapids of which he had heard so much but really knew so little  i must get this tree to the river bank he said to himself and looked around for some limb which might be cut off and used for a pole  but no such limb was handy and even had there been there would have been no time in which to prepare it for use for the rapids were now in plain sight the water boiling and foaming as it darted over one rock and another in a descent of thirty feet in forty yards  this wont do muttered the boy and wondered if it would not be best to leap overboard and try to swim to safety  but one look at that swirling current made him draw back  i reckon i had best stick to the tree and trust to luck to pass the rocks in safety he muttered and clutched the tree with a firmer hold than ever  the strange craft had now stopped circling and was shooting straight ahead for a rock that stood several feet above water  on it went and sam closed his eyes in expectancy of an awful shock which would pitch him headlong he knew not to where  but then came a swerve to the left and the tree grated along the edge of the rock  before sam could recover his breath down it went over the first line of rapids  here it stuck fast for a moment then turned over and went on throwing sam on the under side  the boys feet struck bottom and he bobbed up like a cork  again he clutched the tree and on the two went a distance of ten feet further  but now the tree became jammed between two other rocks and there it stuck with sam clutching one end and the water rushing in a torrent over the other  for the moment the boy could do little but hold fast but as his breath came back to him he climbed on top of the tree and took a look at the situation  it was truly a dismaying one  he was in the very center of the rapids and the shore on either side of him was fifty to sixty feet away  how am i ever to get to the bank he asked himself  i cant wade or swim for the current is far too strong  im in a pickle and no mistake  i wonder if dick and tom are on solid earth yet  he raised his voice into a shout not once but several times  at first only the echoes answered him but presently came a reply from a distance  sam sam where are you  it was dick calling and he was running along the bank alone tom being too exhausted to accompany him  here i amin the middle of the falls  where  out herein the middle of the falls  great caesar sam  cant you wade ashore  no the current is so strong i am afraid to  in a minute more dick reached a spot opposite to where the tree rested  as he took in the situation his face clouded in perplexity  you are rightdont try wading he said  if you do youll have your skull cracked open on the rocks  ill have to get a rope and haul you off  all right but do hurry for this tree may start on again at any instant  to procure a rope was no easy matter for nothing of that sort was at hand and the nearest farmhouse was some distance away  yet without thinking twice dick set off for the farmhouse arriving there inside of five minutes  i need a rope quick mr darrel he said  my brother is in the middle of the humpback falls on a tree and i want to save him  why dick rover you dont tell me cried joel darrel a farmer who had often worked for randolph rover  sure ill get a wash line this minute and he ran for the kitchen shed  luckily the line was just where the farmer supposed it would be and away went man and boy dick leading until the river bank was again reached  there he is mr darrel  how can we best help him do you think  the farmer scratched his head in perplexity  hang me if i jess know dick he said slowly  if we try to pull him straight to shore the current will carry him over the rocks in spite of the line  how long do you suppose the line is  it is fifty yards and all good and strong for i bought it of woddie only last week  fifty yardsthat is a hundred and fifty feet  do you see that spur of rock just above there  i do  is it more than a hundred and fifty feet from that rock to the tree  hardly but its close figuring  let us try the line and see  both walked up to the spur of rock they had in view  it jutted out into the river for several yards and was rather wet and slippery  take care or youll go in too cautioned joel darrel  shall i throw the rope out  you might try it answered dick  ill hold fast to your leg and he squatted down for that purpose  the line was uncoiled and thrown three times but each time it fell short and drifted inshore again  hurry up suddenly yelled sam  the tree is beginning to turn and it will break loose before long  let me try a throw said dick and took the wash line  as he made the cast tom came up on a walk his head tied up in a handkerchief  where is sam  out there said joel darrel and watched the casting of the line with interest  again it fell short but dicks second throw was a complete success and soon sam held the outer end of the line fast  it reaches and we have about fifteen feet to spare said dick joyfully  sam tie it around you  scarcely had the word left the younger brothers lips than the tree upon which he rested wobbled and went over and he found himself thrown into the foaming water  pull away all hands cried dick and hauled in desperately while joel darrel did the same  tom was not equal to the task but contented himself with holding fast to dicks coat that his elder brother might not slip from the rock  it was no light work to get sam up the first rise of the rapids but once this rise was passed the rest was easy by comparison they pulled in steadily and presently the boy reached the rock and came up looking very much like a dripping seal as he clambered to safety  thank fortune you are safe cried dick when it was all over and tom said amen under his breath  joel darrel looked well satisfied as he coiled up the wash line  it was a narrow escape he remarked presently  you want to be careful how you try to cross the river at this point  what were you doing on the tree  i was after a thief answered sam and then he looked at dick and tom  where is he  gone returned dick  a thief ejaculated joel darrel  whom did he rob  he robbed me  do tell dick  when  about half an hour ago i was coming from the corners with the mail when he pounced on me near our berry patch and knocked me down  he took my pocketbook and my watch but sam and tom came up and we chased the fellow and got the pocketbook back  but he kept the watch  yes  was it a good one  it was a gold watch that my father paid sixtyfive dollars forand the chain was worth ten and what is more the watch was one my father used to wear and as he is gone now i thought a good deal of it on that account  thats natural my boy  but where did the thief go  came across the river about quarter of a mile above here  then he had a boat  yesa craft painted brown with a white stripe around her  thats jerry rodmans boat  he must have stolen her in the first place to cross to your side  more than likely  but where did he go after he crossed the river  into the bushes i guess  you see tom went overboard from the tree and got struck and i went to his assistance so i didnt notice exactly  i want to get back now and follow the rascal  ill go along  i wish you would  in that case i wont try to keep up with you put in tom  my head is aching fit to split  yes you may as well take it easy answered dick  but say why not walk up to the river road and see if the rascal heads in this direction  so i will dick  will you go too sam  it was arranged that sam should accompany and they set off immediately while dick and joel darrel ran along the river bank to where the rowboat had been abandoned  down where it was muddy it was easy to trace the tramps footprints and they led through a meadow and across a cornfield coming out at a side road leading to the town of oak run  well where to next questioned the farmer as he and dick came to a halt  the youth shook his head  its so dry here the footprints are lost he returned slowly  thats true dick  but i reckon he went to oak run  why  because he could catch a train from there which would take him miles awayand i guess that is what he wants to do just about now  there is something in that  besides you know the other end of the road ends up in the woods  he wouldnt go there  i had best start for oak run then  ill go along  the distance was a mile and a half and they thought they would have to walk it but hardly had a dozen rods been covered than they heard the sound of wagon wheels and a grocery turnout and came into sight driven by a boy joel darrel knew well  this comes in just right observed darrel to dick  hi there harry oswald  give us a lift to oak run will you  certainly mr darrel answered the grocery boy and brought his store wagon to a stop  the farmer leaped to the seat and dick followed  on the way harry oswald was made acquainted with the situation and he drove along with all possible speed  they were just entering the outskirts of oak run when the whistle of a locomotive was heard  thats the down train for middletown cried joel darrel  hurry up  the horse was whipped up and they swept along to the depot at a speed which made the constable of the town shake his fist at harry and threaten to arrest him for fast driving  too late  the words came from dick and he was right  before the depot was reached the long train had pulled out  soon it was lost to sight in the distance  the thief was on it and his escape for the time being was now assured     chapter iv  the last day at the farm   what does this mean  it was gilbert ponsberry the chief constable of oak run who spoke as he strode up to the grocery wagon all out of breath  hullo ponsberry you are just the man we want to see cried joel darrel  did you notice who boarded that train  no i wasnt at the depot  anything wrong  i have been robbed of a gold watch and chain answered dick and related the particulars  gee shoo  no wonder you drove fast ejaculated the constable i would have done so myself  how did that fellow look  as well as he was able dick gave a description of the thief  i saw that tramp yesterday said the constable when he had finished  he was in the depot talking to a tall thin man  i remember him well for he and the other fellow were quarreling  i hung around rather expecting a fight  but it didnt come  you havent seen the thief since yesterday  no  you remember the tall thin man he was with  oh sure for he had a scar on his chin that looked like a knife cut  is he anywhere around  i havent seen him since  let us take a walk around and we can ask ricks the station master about this  we had better ask mr ricks first said dick  all hands even to the grocery boy hunted up the station master an elderly fellow who was well known for his unsociable disposition  dont know anything about any thief he snapped after hearing the story i mind my own business  but he may have taken the train pleaded dick  it made his heart sink to think that the watch that precious memento from his father might be gone forever  well if he did you had better go after himor telegraph to middletown was the short answer and then the station master turned away  you telegraph for me said dick to the constable  i will pay the costs  all right dick my but old ricks is getting more grumpy every day  if this railroad knows its business it will soon get another manager here was gilbert ponsberrys comment as he led the way to the telegraph office  here a telegram was prepared addressed to the police officer on duty at the middletown station and giving a fair description of the thief  the train would reach the city in exactly fortyfive minutes and as soon as the message had been sent dick darrel and the constable went off on a tour of oak run and the vicinity  of course nothing was seen of the thief and in an hour word came back from middletown that he was not on the cars  this was true for the train had stopped at a way station having broken something on the engine and the thief had left to walk the remainder of the distance to middletown on foot  it was not until nightfall that dick returned to his uncles farmhouse  here he found that sam and tom had already arrived  tom was lying on the sofa in the sitting room being cared for by his aunt martha who was the best of nurses whenever occasion required  didnt find any trace of the villain queried randolph rover with a sad shake of his head  too bad  too bad  and it was your fathers watch too  i never wanted to see dick wear it put in mrs rover  it was too fine for a boy  father told me to wear it aunty  he said it would remind me of him answered dick and he turned away for something like a tear had welled up in his eye  there there dick i didnt mean to hurt your feelings cried his aunt hastily  i would give a good deal if you had your watch back  supper was waiting but dick had no appetite and ate but little tom braced up sufficiently to take some toast and tea and declared that he would be all right by morning and so he was  here is a letter for tom from larry colby cried dick during the course of the evening  i declare i forgot all about it tom until this minute  i dont blame you dick was the reply with a sickly smile you read it for me  the light hurts my head and tom closed his eyes to listen  larry colby was a new york lad who in years gone by had been one of toms chums  the letter was just such a one as any boy might write to another and need have no place here  yet one paragraph interested everybody in the sitting room  next week i am to pack my trunk and go to putnam hall military academy wrote larry colby  father says it is a very fine military school and he has recommended it to your uncle  putnam hall military academy mused tom  i wonder where it is  it is over in seneca county on cayuga lake replied randolph rover and something like a smile appeared on his face  on cayuga lake uncle cried sam  why thats a splendid location isnt it  very fine  and is that where we are to go put in tom eagerly  yes thomas i might as well tell you although i wanted to surprise you  you are to go to putnam hall and there you will have with you lawrence colby frank harrington and several other lads with whom you are all acquainted  hurrah uncle randolph came from sam and rushing up he caught his relative around the shoulder  youre the best kind of uncle after all  putnam hall is an institution of learning that has been established for some twenty years went on mr rover pushing back his spectacles and laying down the agricultural work he had been perusing  it is presided over by captain victor putnam an old army officer who in his younger days used to be a schoolmaster  he is a strict disciplinarian and will make you toe the mark but let me say right here i have it from mr colby that there is no schoolmaster who is kinder or more considerate of his pupils  is it a regular military institution like west point asked tom  hardly thomas although the students so i am informed dress like cadets and spend an hour or so each day in drilling and in the summer all the school march up the lake and go into an encampment  that just suits me broke in sam enthusiastically  hurrah for putnam hall  hurrah echoed tom faintly and dick nodded to show he felt as they did  at the cheer sarah the cook stuck her head into the door  sure an i thought tom was out of his head bedad she observed  sarah im going away soonto a military academy  i wont bother you any more said tom  wont yez now  that will be foine  then the cook stopped short thinking she had hurt the boys feelings  oh master tom dont moind me  youre not such anan awful bother as we think and then at a wave of mrs rovers hand she disappeared  after this the evening passed quickly enough for the boys wanted to know all there was to be learned about their future boarding school  mr rover had a circular of the institution and they pored over this  captain victor putnam is the head master said dick as he read he has two assistants josiah crabtree and george strong besides two teachers who come in to give instructions in french and german if desired also in music  uncle randolph are we to take up these branches  i am going to leave you to select your own studies outside of the regular course richard  what would be the use of taking up music for instance if you were not musically inclined  id like to play a banjo said tom and grinned as well as the bandage on his head would permit  i doubt if the professor of music teaches that plantation instrument smiled mrs rover  then she patted toms shoulder affectionately  now the boys were really to leave her she was sorry to think of their going  they will not take more than a hundred pupils said dick referring to the circular again  i should say that was enough the pupils are divided into two companies a and b of about fifty soldiers each and the soldiers elect their own officers to serve during the school term  tom perhaps you may turn out captain of company b  and you may be major dick rover of the first battalion returned tom  say but this suits me to death uncle randolph  i am glad to hear it thomas  but i want you to promise me to attend to your studies  military matters are all well enough in their way but i want you to have the benefits of a good education  oh i fancy captain victor putnam will attend to that put in sam  the circular was read from end to end and it was after ten oclock before the boys got done talking about it and went to bed certainly the prospect was a bright one and if poor dick had only had his watch the three would have been in high feather  little did they dream of all the startling adventures in store  for them during their term at putnam hall  it must not be supposed that mr randolph rover intended to allow the theft of dicks watch to pass without a strong effort being made to recover the article early in the morning he drove to the corners and to oak run and another village called benders and at each place had a notice posted mentioning the loss and offering a reward of fifty dollars for the recovery of the property and of one hundred dollars if the thief was captured in addition  this offer however proved of no avail and dick had to leave for putnam hall wearing his old silver watch which he had put aside upon the receipt of the gold timepiece  it was a clear sunshiny morning when the boys started off they had paid a last visit to the various points of interest about the place and bid goodby to sarah who shook hands warmly and said farewell to the hired men both of whom hated them to leave for they had made matters pleasant as well as lively their three trunks were loaded in a farm wagon and now jack one of the menofallwork drove up with the two seated carriage to drive them over to oak run by way of the river bridge half a mile up the stream  goodby uncle randolph cried one after another as they shook hands  goodby aunt martha and each gave mrs rover a hug and a kiss something which brought the tears to the ladys eyes  goodby boys and take good care of yourselves said randolph rover  and if you cant stand it at boarding school write and we will send for you to come back here added his wife and then with a crack of the whip the carriage rolled off and the farm was left behind  it was to be many a day before the boys would see the place again     chapter v  on the way to putnam hall   i dont think well want to send word to aunt martha to be taken back observed sam who sat on the drivers seat with the hired man  neither do i returned tom to be sure we have a nice enough home here but its dreadfully slow  there is no telling what may be in store for us joined in dick dont you remember how fred garrison fared at holly school  that institution sent out a splendid circular and when fred got there they almost starved him to death  that is true  where is fred now  i dont know  mr colby wouldnt recommend putnam hall if it wasnt all right remarked tom  jack whip up the team or well miss that train  they are going putty well now master tom replied the driver  the trunks had gone on ahead and when they reached the depot at oak run they found old ricks grumbling because no one was there to check them  do you reckon im going to be responsible for everybodys baggage he snarled as dick approached him  ill check them as soon as i can get tickets answered dick curtly  what an old bear he is he whispered to tom  he didnt treat me half decently when i was over here about the watch  if only we had a little time i would fix him whispered tom in return  he had sobered down for several days now and was dying to play a trick on somebody  they went into the station and procured tickets and then found the time for the train had been changed and it would not be along for nearly half an hour  good  just wait till i get back said tom  he had noticed ricks gathering up some waste paper around the depot and felt tolerably certain the old fellow was about to build a bonfire of it  walking over to one of the stores he entered and asked the proprietor if he had any large firecrackers on hand  just two sir said the storekeeper and brought them forth each was six inches long and thick in proportion  how much asked the boy  seeing as they are the last i have ill let you have them for fifteen cents each  ill give you a quarter for the two  very well here you are and the transfer was made on the spot slipping the firecrackers into his coat pocket tom sauntered up to old ricks while sam and dick looked on sure that something was in the wind  ricks that is pretty bad news from middletown isnt it he observed  bad news  what do you mean demanded the station master as he threw some more waste paper on the fire which he had just lit  about that dynamite being stolen by train wreckers  they think some of the explosive was brought up here  didnt hear of it  dynamite is pretty bad stuff to have around so ive heard  awful  awful  i never want to see any of it answered ricks with a decided shake of his head  if it goes off its apt to blow everything to splinters went on dick  thats soi dont want any of it and the old man began to gather up more waste paper for his fire  watching his chance tom threw one of the firecrackers into the blaze and then rejoined his brothers  with a handful of paper ricks again approached the blaze  he was standing almost over it when the firecracker went off making a tremendous report and scattering the light blazing paper in all directions  help  im killed yelled old ricks as he fell upon his back get me away from here  theres dynamite in this fire  and he rolled over leapt to his feet and ran off like a madman  dont be alarmedit was only a firecracker called out tom loud enough for all standing around to hear and then he ran for the train which had just come in  soon he and his brothers were on board and off leaving poor ricks to be heartily laughed at by those who had observed his sudden terror  it was many a day before the cranky station master heard the last of his dynamite  the boys were to ride from oak run to ithaca and there take a small steamer which ran from that city to the head of the lake stopping at cedarville the nearest village to putnam hall  at cedarville one of the hall conveyances was to meet them to transfer both them and their baggage to the institution  the run to ithaca proved uneventful although the boys did not tire of looking out of the window at the beautiful panorama rushing past them  at noon they had lunch in the dining car a spread that sam declared was about as good as a regular dinner  three oclock in the afternoon found them at the steamboat landing waiting for the golden star to take them up to cedarville  fred garrison by all thats lucky burst out tom suddenly as he rushed up to a youth of about his own age who sat on a trunk eating an apple  tom rover  where are you bound  to a boarding school called putnam hall  you dont say  why i am going there myself and now fred garrison nearly wrung off toms hand  if this isnt the most glorious news yet burst in dick  why larry colby is going too  i know it  but he wont come until tomorrow  and frank harrington is going too  he is there alreadyhe wrote about it day before yesterday that makes six of us new york boys  the metropolitan sextet chirped in sam  boys we ought to form a league to stand by each other through thick or thin  im with you on that answered fred  as we are all newcomers its likely the old scholars will want to haze us or something like that  just let them try it on cried tom  yes we must stick together by all means and the compact so far as it concerned the rover boys and fred garrison was made on the spot  later on larry colby and frank harrington joined them gladly  it was not long before the golden star a stanch little sidewheeler steamed up to the dock and the waiting crowd rushed on board and secured favorable places on deck the baggage followed and soon they were off with a whistle which awoke the echoes of cayuga lake for miles around  while waiting on the dock dick had noticed three girls standing near them  they were evidently from the rural district but pretty and well dressed  the boys took seats near the bow of the boat on the upper deck and presently the girls sat down not far away  he was awfully bold clara i want nothing to do with him dick heard the prettiest of the girls say  he had no right to speak to us  he had dropped his handkerchief and he pretended i was stepping on it said another of the three  oh here he comes now she went on as a youth of seventeen came into view  he was large and boldlooking and it was easy to see that there was a good deal of the bully about him  he was smoking a cigarette but on seeing the girls he threw the paper roll away  how do you do again he said as he came up and tipped his hat  at this all of the girls looked angry and not one returned his salutation  but undaunted by this the newcomer caught up a camp stool and planked himself down almost directly between the prettiest of the three and her companions  splendid day for the trip he went on  wont you have some confectionery and he hauled from his pocket a box of cream chocolates and held them out  thank you but we dont wish any said the youngest of the girls  wont you have some asked the unknown of the eldest girl  i dont want any and i told you before not to speak to me she said in a low voice and the tears almost came into her eyes  i aint going to hurt you grumbled the young fellow  cant a fellow be pleasant like  i do not know you sir  oh thats all right   my name is daniel baxter  sorry i havent a card or i would give you one was the smooth rejoinder  i do not wish your card was the answer delivered in the most positive of tones  oh all right  yes its a splendid trip said the fellow and drew his camp chair even closer  the girls wished to edge away but there was no room in the narrow bow  the eldest girl looked around as if for help  her eyes met those of dick and she blushed  say that fellow is a regular pill whispered tom to his elder brother  somebody ought to take him by the collar and pitch him overboard  you are right tom answered dick and then as the bully attempted to crowd still closer to the girls he suddenly arose took a few steps forward and caught dan baxter by the arm  you get out of here and be quick about it he said in low but firm tones  the fellow started and for the instant his face changed color but then he saw that dick was but a boy younger and smaller than himself and his bullying manner returned  who are you talking to he demanded  i am talking to you  i told you to get outand be quick about it  oh cried the eldest girl but her face took on a look of relief for she saw that dick was a thoroughly gentlemanly youth  who are you anyway blustered dan baxter  my name is dick rover if you want to know  dick turned to the girls  he was annoying you wasnt he  very much answered the three promptly  then youll get out daniel baxter  supposing i refuse  if you refuse ill pitch you out and make a complaint to the police at our first stopping place  you talk big sneered the bully but he was much disconcerted  dont you talk back to my brother put in tom who had come up you think youre a regular masher as they call such silly fellows but i dont think your game is going to work here  thats it chimed in sam  humph three of you eh muttered the bully  well see about this some other time and leaving his camp chair he made for the cabin and disappeared from view  hes a bad egg was toms comment but how thoroughly bad the rover boys were still to learn     chapter vi  friends and enemies   i must thank you for ridding us of that fellow said one of the girls  he has annoyed us several times  it was a pleasure to assist you answered dick with the politeness of a dancing master and tipped his hat and his brothers and fred garrison did the same  after this there seemed nothing to do but to be introduced and dick did this for the boys while the eldest girl acted for herself and her companions  my name is dora stanhope she said  these are my cousins nellie and grace laning we live at cedarville  just the place we are going to cried tom  we are bound for putnam hall  i suppose you know the place  we dovery well answered dora stanhope  it is less than quarter of a mile away from our farm  and it is quite near to our place too added nellie laning  then perhaps well see more of each other remarked fred garrison  perhaps but isnt captain putnam rather strict about letting you boys out questioned dora  we dont know yetwe are newcomers  newcomers cried nellie  then you dont know that fellow who was just here  no  does he belong at putnam hall  yes  i know nothing of him however further than that i have seen him several times on the hall road  dick gave a low whistle  perhaps weve put our foot in it remarked sam in a low tone to him  never mind we did what was right answered dick  no fellow is justified in acting as dan baxter did  thats right  tell us something about putnam hall wont you said fred garrison after a pause  at this the three girls laughed  what should we know about that place asked dora  we have never been inside excepting at one christmas entertainment  but you must see some of the fellows occasionally  not often said grace laning  captain putnam does not allow his pupils to leave the grounds excepting on special occasions but papa caught three of the pupils in our strawberry patch once  he did  and what happened to the fellows put in tom with deep interest  father made them pick twelve quarts of berries for him for nothing and didnt let them eat a single one  great caesar what a fine fellow your dadi mean your fathermust be  of course he is fine  the boys had no right to attempt stealing the berries  my father would have given them some for the asking  but they wouldnt have been half as sweet as if they were hooked on the sly said tom wisely and everybody laughed  you boys ought to have fine times at putnam hall went on dora to dick  i sometimes see the soldier boys marching and once last summer i visited their encampment  we are looking forward to a good time was the answer  and i trust we see you again went on dick and dora blushed prettily  the golden star was now approaching a little landing known as hopedale and all left their chairs to see the village and people getting on and off  it was an engaging scene and the did not return to the bow of the boat until ten minutes  later after taking a walk completely around the steamers deck  in the bow a surprise awaited them  during their absence dan baxter had appropriated four of their camp chairs and was stretched out on them as if in sleep  oh what a cheek cried tom  let us haul him off suggested sam  all right come ahead put in fred  oh please dont have another row with him cried dora in alarm let him keep the seats  we can go somewhere else  all right let the pig sleep said dick  he felt tolerably certain that dan baxter was awake and heard him but the bully made no sign  the party walked away and the bully sneered softly to himself  they didnt dare to tackle me was what he thought in his conceit  id like to meet em one by one alone id show each a trick or two  at last cedarville was reached and the little steamer tied up at the dock and the boys and girls went ashore  just before leaving dick took a look at dan baxter and saw that he was now sleeping in earnest  i wont wake him he thought  if he is carried to the head of the lake it will only serve him right  once on the dock he and fred hurried off to see about the baggage and while they were gone a welldressed and pleasantlooking farmer came up and kissed each of the girls it was mr laning  i hope you had a nice visit to cousin mays he said  come the carriage is waiting out in the street  and he hurried the girls away before they had hardly time to say goodby  nice girls remarked tom  yes indeed answered sam  hope we see them again  we wont have much of a chance if what they say about putnam hall is true sam  evidently captain putnam believes in keeping his pupils well in hand  well uncle randolph believes we ought to be taken well in hand  dick and fred returned presently bringing with them a tall lean man of apparently fifty  boys cried fred let me introduce you to mr peleg snugsomebody general utility man at putnam hall  peleg snuggers please said the man meekly  excuse me but i was sent to bring you to the hall  do we walk demanded tom  no sir the carryall is out on the street and my boy pete has the wagon for your trunks  the trunks are already in the wagon said dick  come ahead  how many of you please went on peleg snuggers  there is only one of me thank you answered tom meekly  dont joke me so early in the term please said the utility man pleadingly  goodness knows ill get more than my share between now and christmas  i mean how many it the party  five of us mr sluggrub  snuggers please peleg snuggersan easy name to remember when you get the swing of it sir  to be sure smullers  yes there are exactly five of us and tom winked at his companions  thats all right the captain said to bring five  where is the other  what other  the other boy i see only four of you  you asked me how many there were in the party mr snugbug  yes sir and you said five  four of us and only one of you  isnt that fiveor do they have a different kind of arithmetic at putnam hall from what i have been studying  please dont joke master rover please dont i was to bring five boys the utility man drew a slip of paper from his pocket four new boysrichard samuel and thomas rover andfrederick garrisonand corporal daniel baxter  gracious the bully is a corporal at the hall came from sam in so low a tone that snuggers did not catch it  the corporal isnt present said fred gazing around absently  so he isnt  must have missed the boat  come along please and peleg snuggers led the way to where a large and extraheavy carryall stood  a splendid team of irongrays was attached to the carriage and dick who loved good horseflesh could not help but admire the animals  oh they are fine master richard said snuggers  nothing finer on the lake shore  captain putnams one recreation is to drive behind a fast team  is it  i wish he would take me out with him some time  always drives alone  reckon it kind of quiets him after a noisy time with the boy  i suppose  they were soon on the way which led out of cedarville and over a hill fronting the lake  by the way do you know where the farms belonging to mr stanhope and to mr laning are located asked tom when they were well out of the village  mr stanhope sir  there isnt any mr stanhope  he died two years ago  that place you see away over yonder is mrs stanhopes farm  she has a daughter dora  yes peleg snuggers paused for a moment  they say the widder thinks of marrying again  is that so put in dick and then he wondered if dora would be pleased with  her stepfather  so that is the place  yes sir two hundred and fifty acres and the fittest dairy in these parts  if the widder marries again her husband will fall into a very good thing  the dairy company at ithaca once offered fifty thousand dollars for the cattle and land  gracious came from tom  weve been chumming with an heiress are the lanings rich too  very well to do  that is their place that side road  here is where we turn off to get to the hall  captain putnam had this road made when the hall was first built  the road was one of cracked stone as smooth as a huge iron roller could make it  they bowled along at a rapid rate under the wide spreading branches of two rows of stately maples  they were close to the lake and occasional glimpses of water could be caught through the tree branches  it is certainly a splendid locality for a boarding academy was dicks comment  my what pure airenough to make a sick boy strong  do you have much sickness at the hall  very little sir  the captain does not let a cast of sickness stand but calls in dr fremley at once  that is where he is levelheaded said fred  my father said i was to call for a doctor the minute i felt at all sick  they were now approaching putnam hall but there was still another turn to make  as they swept around this they came upon a tramp half asleep under a tree  the tramp roused up at the sounds of carriage wheels and looked first at the driver of the carryall and then at the four boys  phew he ejaculated and lost no time in diving out of sight into some brush back of the row of maples  hullo who was that cried sam  a tramp i reckon answered the utility man  we are bothered a good deal with them  begging at the hall for the leftovers  exactly  the captain is too kindhearted  he ought to drive em all away answered peleg snuggers and then the carryall passed on  when it was gone and the wagon with the trunks had followed the tramp came out of the brush and gazed after both turnouts  say buddy girk but dat was a narrow escape he muttered to himself wot brought dem young gents to dis neighborhood  it cant be possible da have tracked mean so quick  he hesitated  i tink i had better give dis neighborhood de goby and he dove into the brush again  he was the rascal who had stolen dicks timepiece     chapter vii  tom gets into trouble   putnam hall was a fine building of brick and stone standing in the center of a beautiful parade ground of nearly ten acres  in front of the parade ground was the wagon road and beyond was a gentle slope leading down to the lake  to the left of the building was a playground hedged in by cedars at one corner of which stood a twostory frame building used as a gymnasium  to the right was a woods while in the rear were a storehouse a stable and several other outbuildings backed up by some farm lands cultivated for the sole benefit of the institution so that the pupils were served in season with the freshest of fruits and vegetables  the hall was built in the form of the letter f the upright line forming the front of the building and the other lines representing wings in the rear  there were three entrancesone for the teachers and senior class in the center one for the middle classes on the right and another for the youngest pupils on the left  there were of course several doors in the rear in addition  the entire ground floor of the hall was given over to class and drill rooms  the second floor was occupied by captain putnam and his staff of assistants and the pupils as living and sleeping apartments while the top floor was used by the servants although there were also several dormitories there used by young boys who came under the care of mrs green the housekeeper  captain victor putnam was a bachelor  a west point graduate he had seen gallant service in the west where he had aided the daring general custer during many an indian uprising  a fall from a horse during a campaign in the black hills had laid him on a long bed of sickness and had later on caused him to retire from the army and go back to his old profession of school teaching  he might have had a position at west point as an instructor but he had preferred to run his own military academy  hurrah here we are at last cried fred garrison as the carryall swept into view of the hall  i see twenty or thirty of the students and all togged out in soldier clothes  i suppose well be wearing suits soon answered tom  by george  im going to give them a salute  for the doings of the putnam hall students previous to the arrival at that institution of the rover boys see the putnam hall series the first volume of which is entitled the putnam hall cadetspublishers  how asked sam  never mind  just wait and see  in a minute more they swept up to the gateway leading to the parade ground  some of the pupils had seen the carriage coming and they ran down to learn if any old friends had arrived  hullo yelled several  hullo yourself came in return and then tom drew out the firecracker still in his pocket and lit it on the sly  just as it was about to explode he threw it up into the air  bang  the report was loud and clear and everybody within hearing rushed to the spot to see what it meant  there were forty or fifty pupils and two assistant teachers but captain putnam had gone out  hi  hi  what does this mean came in a highpitched voice and josiah crabtree the first assistant rushed up to the carryall what was that exploded  a big firecracker sir answered peleg snuggers  and who exploded it  before the utility man could answer there came a cry from the parade ground dont peach peleg dont peach  silence boys burst from josiah crabtree wrathfully  such a disturbance is against the rules of this institution  we didnt fire the cracker piped up a tall slim boy  it came from the carriage  mumps youre nothing but a sneak and tattletale was the reply to this from several older cadets and afraid of having his ears boxed on the sly john fenwick nicknamed mumps by everybody in the hall ran off  which of you fired the cracker demanded josiah crabtree advancing to the carriage step  there was no reply and he turned to the driver  snuggers what have you to say  i cant say anything sir  i was taking care of the horses sir answered the hired man meekly  i will find out who fired the cracker before i have finished with you growled the head assistant  get down and march into the hall  gracious what have we struck now whispered fred to dick  is this captain putnam asked dick without answering his chum  no young man i am josiah crabtree a m captain putnams first assistant  and you are  he paused  i am dick rover sir  these are my brothers tom and sam  and i am fred garrison finished that youth  very good  i hope richard that you were not guilty of firing that cracker  was there any great harm in giving a a salute upon our arrival  such a thing is against the rules of the institution  article 29 says no pupil shall use any firearms or explosive at any time excepting upon special permission  we are not pupils yet mr crabtree  that argument will not pass sir  so you fired the cracker very well  mr strong  the second assistant came up he was a man of not over twentyfive and his face was mild and pleasant  what is it mr crabtree  you will take charge of the other new pupils while i take charge of the one who has broken our rules on his very arrival  hold on cried tom  what are you going to do with my brother  that is none of your business master rover  you will go with mr strong  he didnt fire the cracker  i did that  and im not ashamed of it  i wasnt a pupil when i did it and im not a pupil now so i cant see how you can punish me for breaking one of your rules  at this there came a titter from the cadets gathered around hardly any of them liked josiah crabtree who was dictatorial beyond all reason  the head assistant flushed up  you are a pupil here and i will show you that you cannot break our rules with impunity and be impudent to me in the bargain cried crabtree  come with me  and he caught tom by the arm while dick and the others were led off in another direction  surely this is a fine beginning thought tom as he walked along  he was half inclined to break away but concluded to await developments  are you going to take me to captain putnam he questioned  we do not permit cadets placed under arrest to ask questions  great smoke  am i under arrest  you are  perhaps youll want to hang me next  silence  or i shall be tempted to sentence you to a caning  youll never cane me sir  silence  you have evidently been a wayward boy at home  if so it will be best for you to remember that all that is now at an end and you must behave yourself and obey orders  cant a fellow breathe without permission  silence  how about if i want a drink of water  silence i say stormed josiah crabtree  ill warrant youll not feel so smart by the time you are ready to leave putnam hall  there was a silence after this as the head assistant led the way into the building and conducted tom to a small room looking out toward the rear  you will remain here rover until captain putnam returns  how long will that be  didnt i tell you not to ask questions  but captain putnam may not return for a day or a month went on tom innocently  captain putnam will be back in an hour or  two  without another word josiah  crabtree turned and left the room locking the door behind him  well by crickety came from the boy when he was left alone ive put my foot into it from the very start  i wonder what captain putnam will say to this  if hes half as sour minded as old crabtree ill catch it  but i havent done anything wrong and they shant cane meand thats flat and he shook his curly head decidedly  the room was less than ten feet square and plainly furnished with two chairs and a small couch  in one corner was a washstand containing a basin and a pitcher of water  this looks a good deal like a cell he mused as he gazed around suddenly his eyes caught some writing on the wall in lead pencil he stepped over to read it      josiah crabtree put me here     and i am feeling very queer     he boxed my ears and pulled my hair     oh when im free wont i get square  somebody else has been here before me thought tom  i rather reckon ill get square too  hullo heres another whittier or longfellow      in this lockup im confined     if i stay long ill lose my mind     two days and nights ive paced the floor     as many others have before  i hope i dont stay two days and nights said tom half aloud then he walked to the single window of the apartment to find that it was heavily barred  no escaping that way he went on to read another inscription this time in blank verse           and i am jugged     alone in solitude and by myself     alone  i sit and think and think     and think again  old crabtree     base villain that he is hath put me here     and why  ah thereby hangs a tale horatio     his teeth the teeth that chew the best of steak     set on our tablethose i found and hid     and mumps the sneak hath told on me  alas     when will my martyrdom end  good for the chap who hid the teeth continued tom and smiled as he thought of the rage crabtree must have been in when he discovered that his false teeth were gone  a rattle in the keyhole disturbed him and he dropped onto a chair just as the head assistant again appeared  i want the keys to your trunk and your satchel he said  what for sir  didnt i tell you before not to ask questions  but my keys are my own private property and so is what is in the trunk and the satchel  all pupils baggage is examined rover to see that nothing improper is introduced into the hall  want to see if ive got any more firecrackers  we do not allow dime novels or eatables or other things that might harm our pupils  eating never harmed me sir  sometimes parents load up their boys with delicacies which are decidedly harmful  come the keys  josiah crabtrees tones were so harsh that toms heart rebelled on the moment  i shant give them to you mr crabtree  you have no right to place me here  i wish to see the proprietor captain putnam at once  do youerrefuse to recognize my authority over you cried josiah crabtree passionately  i do sir  when i have met captain putnam and been enrolled as a cadet it may be different  but at present i am not a cadet and not under your authority  well see boy well see came hotly from the head assistant before i am done with you you will be sorry that you have defied me  and with these words he went out slamming the door after him tom had made an enemy at the very start of his career as a cadet     chapter viii  a meeting in the messroom   in the meantime dick sam and fred had been having quite a different experience  george strong the second assistant at putnam hall was not only a firstclass teacher but a calm and fairminded gentleman as well and in addition and this was highly important he was not so old but that he could remember perfectly well when he had been a boy himself  come this way my lads he said with a faint smile  i trust you will soon feel at home in putnam hall  it is captain putnams desire to have all of his boys as he calls them feel that way  what will mr crabtree do with my brother asked dick anxiously  i cannot say rover  probably he will place him in the guardroom until captain putnam arrives  i am sure he didnt do much that was wrong  we had better not discuss that question my boy  come this way i will conduct you to your room  george strong showed them into the main hallway and up the stairs to the second story  passing through a side hall they entered a large bright dormitory overlooking the parade and the playground  here were eight beds four on either side with as many chairs and also a table and two washbowls with running water supplied from a tower on the roof the water being pumped up by the aid of a windmill  this room has not been occupied this year said the teacher captain putnam and mrs green our housekeeper thought it might be as well to put you in here together along with lawrence colby and frank harrington when they come  i believe you are all friends at least harrington and colby intimated as much in their letters  they told the truth cried sam  this just suits me and we owe captain putnam and mrs green one for doing it  george strong smiled  then the smile faded as he remembered how josiah crabtree once told captain putnam that he did not believe in letting chums room together  place each boy among strangers crabtree had said  it will make him more reliant  but captain putnam had not listened to the crabbed old fellow and strong was glad of it  here is a closet in which each of you can stow his clothing when it is dealt out to him  your ordinary suits will of course be placed away for you for during the academy term you will as cadets wear only your uniforms  when will i get my uniform asked fred who was anxious to don his soldier fixings as he put it  tomorrow if we have any suit on hand that fits  i dont want a secondhanded suit put in sam  george strong laughed dont worry my boy every pupil gets new clothing  but many boys are so nearly of a size that captain putnam always keeps a dozen or more suits on hand  oh thats different  the beds are all numbered and to avoid disputes we always put the eldest boy in bed no 1 and so on  you can arrange this between yourselves and i feel certain you wont get into a dispute  we wont quarrel said dick  i dont how exactly how old frank and larry are though  then arrange to suit yourselves until they come concluded mr strong  having shown then their dormitory he conducted them through the building and exhibited the various class and drillrooms and then ended up by introducing them to several other pupils including bart conners the major for the term and harry blossom and dave kearney the two captains  welcome to putnam hall cried major bart conners a tall youth of nearly seventeen  he shook hands all around and so did the two captains and then the assistant teacher left the party  oh it was a shame the way crabtree treated your brother said captain harry to dick  its a wonder to me that captain putnam keeps him here  i was in for getting up a petition to have crabtree removed put in captain dave i think every boy in the academy would sign it  i hope captain putnam is not so severe said fred  not by a jugful garrison came from captain harry  hes strict and makes everybody toe the mark but you couldnt find a better allaround man  then hell suit me  it was now quite late and presently a loud clear bell rang out in the belfry  six oclock said captain dave kearney  that is to bring in the boys from the playground  they have fifteen minutes in which to wash up for supper  excuse me ill be needed in ten minutes to form my company  and soon the newcomers found themselves alone with several others who had just arrived at putnam hall  the cadets were rushing from everywhere to the lavatories to make themselves presentable on parade  soon they began to form on the grounds before the building  dick and the others saw them divide up into two companies with harry blossom at the head of the first and dave kearney leading the second  the two companies called a battalion were commanded by major bart  in addition to the officers there were two drummers a bassdrummer and two fifers  companies attention came the command and the lines became rigid  by column of foursmarch  the drums struck up and away went the columns of each company to the front of the parade ground  then they wheeled to the right the fifers started up a lively air and the cadets marched around the hall three times and at last into the door nearest to the messhall or dining room  by jinks thats fine cried sam  cadet life will suit me im sure of it  the cadets had hardly disappeared before one of the waiters in the messhall came forward  please come right in gents he said mr strong will give you places at the tables and they went and soon found themselves seated among as jolly a set of boys as they had ever encountered  of course there were exceptions where would there not be in a crowd of nearly a hundred  there were pupils there who were morose by nature those who seldom or never smiled and there were likewise half a dozen of the dan baxter orderbullies and worse  we shall see more of all these characters as our tale progresses  i wonder if tom is going to get any supper said dick to his younger brother  if they dont give him any ill raise a kick dick  so will i  silence at the table came in the sharp tones of josiah crabtree who presided over the particular board at which the rovers had been placed  i was only wondering if my brother was going to get any supper returned sam boldly  silence  i will take care of that  in the midst of the meal a newcomer appeared at the doorway to the messroom  it was dan baxter  well baxter how is this asked mr strong the teacher nearest to him  ii was carried to bar landing answered the bully sheepishly  bar landing  then you were on the afternoon boat from ithaca  yes sir  how did you come to be carried past cedarville  ierfell asleep on the trip  indeed  well when next you travel you had better try to keep awake was george strongs comment and a titter passed along the table which made dan baxter very angry  sit down here alexander help baxter to some supper  yes sah came from the waiter and no more was said  presently baxter caught sight of dick at the table opposite and he looked daggers at the youth  hes got it in for me thought dick and he was right  the supper at an end the pupils were allowed two hours to themselvesone hour outdoors if they wished it or both hours in the reading room which was well supplied with books and all of the best magazines  the newcomers went out in a bunch and captain harry blossom accompanied them  ill show you the gymnasium if you wish to see it he said  i would like to know something about tom replied dick  where have they placed him  undoubtedly in the guardroom  where is that  do you see that window over there and captain harry pointed with his hand  yes came from dick and sam together  well thats the window to the place  i wonder if i cant talk to my brother went on dick  its against the rules to talk to a prisoner  well im going to talk anyway said dick with a recklessness which was unusual to him  i want to find out just what they are doing with him  i guess i had best leave this crowd remarked the young captain of company a  dick was about to ask why when sam nudged him on the arm  let him go whispered the younger brother  in a moment more captain harry had walked away  dont you see what he meant asked sam aloud  well hardly  then you are losing some of your wit dick  he didnt want to see us break the rules  i suppose if he had seen us he would have felt it was his duty to report us  thats so sam  how thick i was  well im going over to the window now  so am i  and ill go too added fred  off the three hurried across the parade ground the other new cadets watching them curiously for all had heard of what tom had done and how josiah crabtree had treated him  the window of the guardroom was but five feet from the ground  in front of it however was an iron fence placed in the form of a semicircle at a distance of about ten feet from the opening  the fence was higher than dicks head and the iron pickets were sharppointed  the window to the room is shut announced the elder rover after an inspection in the semidarkness  its a shame in this warm weather  poor tom will be half smothered to death  wait till i attract his attention said sam  catching up a clod of grass and dirt he threw it against one of the window panes  a minute of suspense followed but no face appeared at the window  thats queer said fred  it seems to me he would show himself if he was there  perhaps he cant said sam  he may be chained up in the other end of the room  im going to make sure said dick determinedly  sam and fred both of you give me a boost up  but how will you get back  you can give me another boost through the pickets  hurrah so we can cried sam  all right up you go  and up dick did go so rapidly that he almost fell over the top of the iron barrier  now who has a match he asked  here you are said fred and passed over several  stepping to the window dick tapped upon it and at the same time struck a light for the room within was pitchdark  the next instant he muttered a cry of disgust  sold  whats that came from sam and fred  the room is empty  then there must be some mistake said fred  can you see all over inside  yes  sure tom isnt asleep in a corner or on a couchif there is one put in sam  he would go to sleep if he could  he isnt hereno doubt of it answered dick after striking a second match and making another inspection oh  dick blew out the match in a hurry and started back for the fence he had seen the door of the guardroom open and josiah crabtree come in  the head assistant of putnam hall saw the light of the match and by it obtained a good view of dicks face  ha that youth has come here to assist his brother to escape was the conclusion he reached  he darted for the window and threw it up  come back here master rover he cried as he saw dick trying to mount the fence  dont you go whispered sam and tried to assist dick from the other side while fred did the same  josiah crabtree would have leaped from the window but the bars held him back  ill get you yet he ejaculated wrathfully and turning ran from the guardroom with the intention of capturing dick on the parade ground     chapter ix  a strange meeting in the woods   to go back to tom at the time he was left alone by the head assistant of putnam hall after refusing to give up the keys to his satchel and trunk  ive put my foot into it now thought the boy dismally  i wonder what captain putnam will say to all this when he hears of it  of course old crabtree will make out the worst possible case against me  it was too dark to see much and he dropped on the couch  he was worried a good deal yet he was not one to take anything too deeply to heart  before long a waiter appeared with a tray containing a big bowl of bread and milk  had josiah crabtree had his own way he would have sent only bread and water for the lads supper but such a proceeding would have been contrary to captain putnams rule  the kind captain realized that his pupils were but boys and should not be treated as real prisoners even when they did break the academy rules  heah is yo suppah sah announced alexander the waiter as he set the tray on the table  sorry i cant leave the light sah he referred to a lamp also on the tray which he now removed  what have you got asked tom sitting up  bowl of bread and milk sah  is that what they give visitors for supper  gracious sah is yo a visitah sah  i consider myself as such until i am placed on the muster roll  at this alexander scratched his woolly head  well sah i dont know nuffin about dat sah  i has to obey mr crabtrees oahdahs sah  has captain putnam come back yet  no sah an he sent word dat he didnt think he could git back sah before morning sah  humph  then ill have to stay here until that time  i reckon so sah  its a jolly shame  dats right sah and alexander grinned  well leave the bread and milk  its better than nothing  but hold on  who are you  alexander pop sah at yo service sah and again the colored man grinned  he was a short fat fellow the very embodiment of good nature  well alexander if you are at my service supposing you get me something else to eat beside this bread and milk  oh sah i couldnt do dat  yes you could  here is a quarter  dont you want to earn that  and tom held out the silver piece  mr crabtree would hab me discharged if he cotched me master rober  then dont let him catch you aleck my boy  at this the negro laughed and showed his immense ivories  yo is jest de boy i dun like to see sah he said  jess wait an ill do wot i can fo you but mums de word saheh  i never peach aleck its only a coward that does that concluded tom  the negro disappeared from the room but reappeared in less than ten minutes with something done up in a napkin  dare you am sah he said two tongue sandwiches and a big piece of layer cake sah all i could git fo mrs green am werry sharp  and here is a bit of candle sah for a light  but please dont let em know i brought yo de things sah  never a word aleck thank you answered tom and handed over the quarter  left again to himself tom lost no time in making way not only with the sandwiches and cake but also some of the bread and milk for his days traveling had left him tremendously hungry  the bit of candle was less than two inches long and began to splutter just as the meal was finished  a rattle at the door caused the lad to sweep the cake crumbs out of sight blow out the candle and pocket the tiny bit left  then the light of a lamp lit up the guardroom and josiah crabtree came in  well rover have you enjoyed your supper he asked coldly as he glanced at the half empty bowl  very much was the youths equally cold reply  you like bread and milk then was crabtrees sarcastic rejoinder  nothing better sir for supper  the head assistant bit his lip and then set down the lamp  rover dont you think you are making a bad beginning he said after a pause  i dont understand you mr crabtree  any other boy on joining a school would wish to make his entrance as creditable as possible  but i havent joined this school yet  i wont argue that point  i wasnt even on your grounds but in the public highwayand there shot offwhat  a simple firecracker  and for that you hauled me to this place and treat me like one who has broken half the laws of the land  if captain putnam upholds you in this matter do you know what i shall do  make an additional fool of yourself i presume  i shall write home to my guardian that i do not consider putnam hall a proper boarding academy for any boy and that i want to be put somewhere else  at these outspoken words josiah crabtree grew pale  his great unpopularity was already having its effect upon captain putnam and he was afraid that if he should be the means of losing a pupil it might cost him his place as much as he knew that the captain did not favor changes in his staff of instructors  dont be unreasonable my lad he said but his tone was much milder than before  i dont think i am unreasonable  the road is one belonging to this institutionin brief a private road  you became a pupil here when you entered our carriage that which brought you here  does everybody who rides in that carriage become a putnam hall pupil demanded tom  he saw that he was worrying crabtree and resolved to keep it up  wellerwe wont argue that point  then supposing we dont argue anything until captain putnam comes back  in the meantime if you will release me ill go to cedarville and put up at the hotel for the night  i shall not release you  all right then  but if my guardian takes me away mark my words you shall stand a personal lawsuit for having locked me up here without having any right to do so  whyerthis to meme the head assistant here screamed josiah crabtree  in his rage he ran over to tom and caught him by the ear  he had scarcely done so than tom put out one foot gave the teacher a shove and down went crabtree flat on his back  you villain gasped the head assistant as he scrambled to his feet  dont you pinch my ear again retorted tom  the door was open and before crabtree could stop him he ran out into the hallway  hold on  not much  it will be the worse for you  ill risk that  stop him somebody screamed josiah crabtree at the top of his voice  without waiting tom ran down the hallway  he knew not where he was going and coming to a door slipped through  he now found himself in the rear of the hall and a few seconds later ran across the back garden and dove into the farm lands  free once more he thought  and i shant go back until i am certain captain putnam is on hand to receive me  i wonder how dick and sam are faring  thinking that his brothers would soon learn of his escape and not wishing to be caught he hurried on until the farm lands were passed and he found himself in a woods  ill sweep around in a circle and make for that road leading to cedarville he concluded and trudged on rapidly for the woods were dark and lonely and not particularly to his liking  tom had covered the best part of half a mile when he saw a light ahead  at first he thought it must shine from the window of some farmhouse but soon made it out to be from a campfire situated in something of a hollow and not far from a spring  hullo  tramps or charcoal burners he thought  i wonder if they would be friendly  he slackened his pace and approached cautiously until within ten yards of where two men sat in earnest conversation  one man was tall and thin and had a scar on his chin  the other fellow was the thief who had robbed dick of his watch at first tom was not inclined to believe the evidence of his eyesight  perhaps im mistaken he mused  he resolved to draw nearer and hear if possible what the two men were saying  a clump of bushes grew close to the spring before mentioned and he crawled up behind this thus getting within fifteen feet of the campfire  you are certain you saw the boys buddy he heard the tall man with the scar say  im as sure of it as im sure your name is arnold baxt  hush buddy how many times must i tell you that i want that name dropped especially around here  there aint anybody around here to hear us  well i dont want the name mentioned  i call you buddy  you must call me nolly  all right nolly   now you are dead sure you saw the boys on their way to putnam hall  i am  how much have you drank today  only two glasses this morning  oh it was them went on buddy with a total disregard for grammar  the tall man muttered something under his breath  its too bad he said aloud  whats too bad  that they are going to putnam hall  still i dont know as it will amount to anything  but i reckon you had best get out of the neighborhood  im going to get out  what brought you here  i wanted to see you again as i said before  about what  that mining deal  i cant do anything at present  why not  there are some papers missing buddy  as soon as i get those ill be in a condition to go ahead  you know ive got to move slowly  well what brought you here  that is my business  every few months or so you come up to cedarville baxt nolly and on a secret mission  well who has a better right  come let us talk about something else  if you  hullo whats that  both men leaped to their feet as a sound from the bushes back of the spring reached their ears  tom had been lying as quiet as a mouse when a pinchingbug as they are commonly called had dropped from one of the bushes onto his neck  the bug was as big as a walnut shell and had fine nippers and when he took hold of the skin tom could not help but make a slight noise as he tried to throw the bug off  before the boy could arise to his feet the two men were rushing upon him buddy with a stick and the tall man with something which he had drawn from his pocket it was a sandbag a favorite weapon used in our large cities by footpads     chapter x  settling down at the hall   its a boy cried the tall slim man  one of the boys came from the tramp known as buddy  you dont say  the tall man turned to tom  how did you get here  walked answered tom as calmly as he could although this is not saying much for he realized that the pair before him were desperate characters and that he was no match for them  have you been spying on us demanded the fellow called nolly  ive been spying on this man answered tom pointing to the other fellow  he stole my brothers watch  what have you done with it  never stole a watch in me life returned buddy quickly  i say you did and it will do no good to deny it  if you say i stole any watch illill knock yer down cried buddy fiercely  and he rushed at tom and aimed a blow at the boys head with his stick  nolly also ran forward with his sandbag and seeing this tom leaped back and was soon making tracks as fast as his legs could carry him  the two men did not pursue him far  instead they turned and ran in the opposite direction  tom hurried on until he came within sight of a large farmhouse reaching the front door he used the brass knocker vigorously  soon an upper window was raised and the head of a middleaged man was thrust out  who is there he demanded  i want help sir answered tom  i am a pupil at putnam hall and i have just spotted a fellow in this neighborhood who robbed my brother of a gold watch  is that so  oh papa is it one of the boys grace and i were telling you about came in the voice of nellie laning  arent you tom rover  yes  this must be mr laning  yes my boy i am john laning answered the farmer  i will be down in a moment  we are in the habit of retiring early  in a few minutes tom was let into the house and he told his story to john laning his wife and the two girls all of whom listened with interest  then a hired man was aroused and the two men and the boy hurried to where the campfire had been located  but as stated before buddy and nolly had made good use of their time and no trace of them was to be found  they have skipped out said mr laning  to look for them will be worse than looking for spiders in a corn stack  i suppose youll be getting back to putnam hall now  if it is all the same i would like to engage a room at your farmhouse for the night answered tom and told his tale  at the mention of josiah crabtrees name john lanings face grew dark  i dont wonder you had a row with that man he said  i know him only too well  you can stay at my house if you will and it shall not cost you a cent  hullo here is luck thought tom and thanked the farmer for his offer  when they got back to the farmhouse toms story had to be told to grace and nellie while mr laning went off to prepare a room for the youth  oh josiah crabtree cried nelly  why dont you know he is trying to court our aunt lucy  your aunt lucy  who is she  dora stanhopes mother  doras father is dead you know  great caesar burst from tom i hope dora never gets him for a stepfather  so do all of us tom but im afraid he has made quite an impression on aunt lucy  she is rich and my own idea is that josiah crabtree is after her money  hes none too good for it was toms blunt comment  the girls and the lad chatted together for half an hour and then all retired for the balance of the night  theyre awfully sweet thought the boy these two and dora too  he slept soundly and did not arise until after seven  on coming below he found a hot breakfast awaiting him to which it is perhaps needless to state he did full justice  while he was talking to the girls and finishing up at the same time mr laning came in  thought i would tell you that captain putnam just drove down the hall road on his way to the school he announced  then ill get back at once said tom and bade the various members of the family goodby  hope we meet again soon he whispered to the girls and this made both blush  mr laning would have driven the lad to the academy but tom declined the offer and set off on foot  it did not take him long to cover the distance and he entered the grounds as unconcernedly as though nothing out of the ordinary had happened  hullo cried several cadets as they noticed him  where did you come from  mr crabtree has been looking all over for you  i dont wish to see him  i wish to see captain putnam  where is he  gracious but youre a cool one remarked one of the cadets the captain is in his office i think  will you please show me to the place  certainly  the office was a finely furnished apartment just off the main classroom  tom knocked on the door  come in said a cheery voice and the boy calmly entered to find himself confronted not only by captain putnam but likewise by josiah crabtree  ah  here is the young reprobate now cried crabtree as rushing up he grasped tom by the arm  you will kindly let go of my arm mr crabtree said tom steadily  you shant run away again  thats truenow captain putnam is here  so this is thomas rover said captain victor putnam with something like a twinkle in his clear eyes  rover i have heard a rather serious report about you and your brother richard  what kind of a report if i may ask sir  mr crabtree says you have been impudent to him and that when he locked you in the guardroom for breaking the rules you attacked him and knocked him down  he attacked me first  if anybody attacked you wouldnt you be apt to knock him down if you could  that would depend upon circumstances rover  if a man attacked me on the street i would certainly endeavor to defend myself to the best of my ability  but you must remember that you are a pupil here and mr crabtree is one of your masters appointed by me  i am not a pupil yet siralthough i hope to be very soon  why what do you mean demanded victor putnam and now his voice grew stern  many a boy would have flinched but tom had determined to say just what he thought of crabtree and he stood his ground  i mean just this captain putnam  i came to putnam hall with the best intention in the world of doing my duty as a pupil and becoming a credit to your institution  i hadnt a thought of breaking a rule or being impudent  before i entered your grounds i thought of a big fire cracker i had in my pocket and just for the fun of the thing set the cracker off as a sort of farewell to the outdoor life so soon to be left behind  captain putnam are you going to listen to such tomfoolery interrupted josiah crabtree  i believe i have a right to tell my story answered tom unless that right is granted i shall leave the hall go back to my guardian and tell him that i refuse to become a pupil here  you are a pupil already snarled crabtree  i am notand that is just the point i am trying to make went on tom to the owner of putnam hall  as soon as the firecracker went off this man rushed up  and demanded an explanation  he was going to lock up my brother first but i said i had fired the cracker and so he compelled me to go to the guardroom with him i was locked in and treated to bread and milk for supper and he wanted to steal the keys of my trunk and valise from me  steal ejaculated josiah crabtree  that is what it amounted to for the keys and boxes are my property  mr crabtree merely wanted to see that your baggage contained nothing improper put in captain putnam  there are certain things we do not allow boys to bring into the institution  then he had a right to keep my baggage out until i was properly enrolled as a pupil  i did not bring in the trunk and bag myself  at this captain putnam began to smile  i see the point you are trying to make rover  you are trying to prove that you were placed under arrest so to speak before you were under our authority here  exactly  i will leave it to you captain putnam if i was really a pupil when mr crabtree hauled me off to the guardroom  at this plain question the face of the owner of the hall became a study  you make a very fine distinction rover he answered slowly  perhaps so sir and i do it because i want to begin right here if i am to be handicapped at the start of my career what is the use of my trying to make a record for myself and tom looked the master of putnam hall full in the face  without a word captain putnam held out his hand  thomas you have considerable spirit but i think your heart is in the right place and i am willing to try you  supposing you enroll as a pupil now and we let bygones be bygones  with all my heart sir cried tom glad to have the whole affair settled so easily  why are you going to let thethe young rascal go demanded josiah crabtree in amazement  im not a rascal mr crabtree  yes you are  mr crabtree i have decided to drop the matter put in captain putnam in a tone which admitted of no dispute and the head assistant fell back abashed  rover says he wishes to make a record for himself and i am inclined to help him  he starts his term free and clear of all charges against himand his brother whom you have locked up shall do likewise  kindly call mr strong  it is aa most unusual proceeding growled the head assistant  perhaps but we will talk that matter over at another time  josiah crabtree went out and in a minute george strong appeared and tom was turned over to him to sign the roll of the academy and to join sam fred and the others in the class room over which mr strong presided  hullo youre back whispered sam but no more could be said until recess when tom told his story in detail  in the meantime dick was released  so you met the fellow who stole my watch cried the elder brother  i wish you had got the timepiece  so do i dick  dick had been captured by josiah crabtree just as he was vaulting the iron fence around the guardroom window  the head assistant had locked him up in the apartment tom had occupied and there dick had remained all night  oh crabtree is a terror said dick later on  i hope dora stanhopes mother never marries him  ill wager neither of you have heard the last of crabtree even if we are not in his classes remarked sam  he will watch for a chance to get even mark my words  i dont doubt it sam answered tom  but let him come on  i intend to do my duty as a cadet and i am not afraid of him     chapter xi  a row in the gymnasium   for several days matters moved along smoothly with the rover boys in that time their chums frank harrington and larry colby arrived and these with fred made up the metropolitan sextet as they called themselvesthe sole occupants of dormitory no 6  next to this dormitory was apartment five occupied by dan baxter mumps and six others of the bullys cronies  the two apartments were connected by a door but this was nailed up  so far there had been no open rupture between baxter and dick but there was trouble in the air and it was bound to reach a climax sooner or later  fortunately for dick and his brothers captain putnam had cadet uniforms to fit them and the three were now dressed in true military style  the other boys had to wait until uniforms could be made for them  the first day at putnam hall was spent in assigning the newcomers to the various classes according to their knowledge  on the second day the three rover boys were placed in the awkward squad to learn the military drill  the squad was presided over by corporal mark king a youth who was cut out to be a soldier although his father was a sea captain  now then line up he called out to the newcomers  all of you will please toe that crack in the floor now turn out your toes like this and put your shoulders back hands with the palms to the front  his instructions were followed to the letter for all were anxious to learn as fast as possible  now the first thing to remember is to say nothing but obey orders promptly exclaimed the corporal when an order is given the first part is a warning while the conclusion is the time when that order must be executed for instance i tell you eyes right i say eyes and you get ready to move your eyes i add right and you instantly turn them to the right and keep them there now well try eyesright great smoke number four you turned them to the left now again eyesright good eyesfront thats firstclass now eyesleft eyesfront that couldnt be better  and so it went on for an hour during which the boys learned not alone how to use their eyes but also to left face right face front face and about facethat is to turn directly to the rear  then they learned how to mark time with their feet starting with the left foot  tomorrow you shall learn how to march said corporal king when the drilling was over  and then each of you will get a gun and go through the manual of arms  will we learn how to shoot asked tom  i can shoot a little already  we have target practice once a month and during the annual encampment concluded the corporal  i wish that encampment was already at hand sighed sam  he imagined that life under a tent would just suit him  as soon as the boys got the run of the institution they began to feel at home  they made friends rapidly especially when it became known that sam was a fine runner and tom a capital baseball player  there were several baseball teams in the school and they frequently played matches on saturday afternoons  the gymnasium pleased dick as much as it did his younger brothers and nearly every day he spent a quarter of an hour or more in the building using one apparatus or another for the building was fitted up with rings parallel bars wooden horses pulling machines and other paraphernalia of athletic usage  one afternoon dick had just begun to use a set of parallel bars when dan baxter sauntered in accompanied by mumps and two other cronies  there were very few cadets in the building at the time and baxter came directly to dick  i guess we can settle that little affair now muttered the bully and slapped dick on the cheek  that for interfering with my doing on the boat  being on the bars dick could not ward off the blow but he immediately sprang down and with flushed cheeks leaped in front of baxter  you seem very anxious to fight he said in a low steady voice you can therefore take that for a starter  and hauling off with his right fist he struck dan baxter fairly and squarely upon the nose causing the blood to spurt and sending the bully to the floor like a shot  if ever there was an individual taken by surprise it was the bully of putnam hall  he had not anticipated such a sudden and determined resistance and for several seconds he lay still too dazed to move  in the meantime his friends sprang forward but dick waved them off  my fight is with baxter he said  i want you to keep your hands out of it  you hit him when he wasnt prepared blustered mumps  and he hit me when i was not prepared  stand back  and dick made such a show of being ready to attack mumps that the toady fell back in great alarm  in the meanwhile dan baxter arose and tried to stop the flow of blood with his handkerchief  ill get even with you rover he growled behind the stained cloth  at any time you please baxter returned dick  but dont you take me off my guard again or ill have no mercy on you  do you dare to meet me in a fair standing up fight demanded the bully  i certainly do  all right then  next saturday afternoon at three  dick bowed  where he questioned  in the patch of woods behind the cornfield  all right  mums is the word fellows said baxter to his cronies  you will keep this to yourself rover wont you  how many do you expect to bring to the fight  only the four fellows who are here  very well i will bring a like number  want to tell everybody dont you  no but i think i am entitled to fair play and that means that i must have as many friends there as you have  all right grumbled baxter but he evidently did not like the arrangement  a moment later he hurried off to do what he could to prevent his nose from swelling  dick told only his brothers and his chums of what had occurred but the news leaked out that a fight was on and saturday afternoon found at least twenty cadets in the secret and on their way to witness the mill as those who had read something about prizefighting were wont to call the contest  now lest my readers obtain a false impression of my views on this subject let me state plainly that i do not believe in fights between boys or otherwise they are brutal far from manly and add nothing to the strength of ones character  it is well enough to know how to defend ones self when occasion requires but such occasions occur but rarely  but i have set out to relate the adventures of the rover boys in school and out and on land and sea and i feel i must be truthful and tell everything just as it happened not only in this volume but in all those which are to follow and consequently i shall tell of the fight as the particulars were related to me by sam rover fred garrison and othersdetails which i am certain are correct  the spot was a sheltered one and on the edge of the woods two spies were posted to warn the contestants should josiah crabtree or any of the other teachers appear for fighting was against the rules of putnam hall and neither dick nor baxter wanted to be caught  both came to the spot promptly and without preliminary talking took off their coats collars ties and caps  a ring was formed and dick stepped forward and faced baxter  the bully was several inches taller than his opponent and at least fifteen pounds heavier  his nose was a bit swollen and there was a sneer upon his coarse face  rover if you wish to apologize to me you can do so and save yourself a thrashing he remarked  i can take care of myself baxter  perhaps you would like me to make a similar proposition to you  if so let me say it is too late i came here to give you a welldeserved thrashing and i mean to stick to my determination  phew but we talk big muttered mumps  you keep your oar out mumps put in tom if you dont ill give you a hiding just as soon as dick is done with dan  will you  maybe youll be the one to catch it muttered mumps nevertheless he said no more  are you ready asked the boy who acted as timekeeper  i am said dick  so am i returned baxter and hurled himself at his opponent without a seconds delay  he had expected to catch dick napping but he found himself mistaken  a blow aimed at dicks face was well parried and in return dick hit baxter heavily on the shoulder  hurrah  score one for dick cried larry colby  thats right old man keep at him  keep cool dan put in mumps  you can polish him off at your leisure  the blow on the shoulder staggered baxter and he fell back to become more cautious and then the two boys began to circle around and around each looking for a favorable opening  at last baxter thought he saw what he wanted and struck out again and dick was hit on the cheek  thats the way baxter came the cry  that was a teaser  give him another  again baxter launched out and now dick was hit on the arm  he slipped to one side and struck out like lightning and the bully caught it in the neck something which spun him around like a top  another for dick cried frank harrington  keep it up  again the two boys faced each other  but only for an instant with a savage cry baxter sprang upon dick as if to fairly tear him apart  one blow landed upon dicks arm and a second on his chest  its baxters fight  baxter is still king of this school  you might as well give it up rover hes too many for you  so the cries ran on while the bully encouraged by his success renewed his efforts and an additional blow sent dick to the ground in a heap     chapter xii  fair and foul fighting   as dick went down tom and sam uttered cries of chagrin and horror  the eldest rover had been struck on the chin and the blood was flowing from a deep scratch  get up  get up dick cried tom  dont say you are beaten  yes yes get up and go at him added sam  the urging was unnecessary as dick was already scrambling up dan baxter made a dash at him intending to strike him while he was down but a fierce look from tom stopped him  youll fight fair baxter were toms words  yes hell fight fair repeated dick throwing back his head as if to collect himself  fellowstudents dan baxter is not fit to be a pupil at this academy  why not came in a chorus  he is not fighting me fairly  what do you mean blustered mumps  dont find fault because he knocked you down added another of the bullys cronies  i say he is not fighting fair repeated dick stoutly  he has something in each hand  at this unexpected announcement dan baxter started back and changed color  then of a sudden he placed both hands into his trouser pockets  he is putting the things out of sight cried tom who saw through the bullys intentions  come baxter show us what you had  i didnt have anything growled the bully  if you say i had ill punch your head off  this is only a ruse to let dick gain time to get his wind  thats it cried mumps  go at him dan and finish him  baxter darent turn out his pockets said sam do it if you dare  there is what i have in them answered the bully pulling a trunk key from one pocket and some small change from the other perhaps youll say i was fighting with these in my hands  turn the pockets out demanded dick  yes turn em out added fred and a dozen others took up the cry  i wont do it growled baxter but it was plain to see that he was growing uneasy  im a gentleman and i can whip rover with ease and do it fairly too  while he was speaking larry colby had come up behind him  ere baxter could stop the movement larry pushed his hand into one of the bullys pockets and turned it out  a jagged stone as big as a walnut dropped to the ground  there see that cried larry  for shame baxter  i didnt have the stoneyou placed it there blustered the sostyled king of the school  didnt you though said fred garrison who had also come up behind baxter and he quickly hauled another stone from the other pocket  that is how he scratched me said dick  i was sure he had something in his hand  its a putup job howled baxter growing red in the face  if you want to continue the fight come on and he squared off again  thats the talk said mumps  let both show their hands perhaps rover has some stones too  both opened their palms then doubled up their fists  baxter was the first to strike out  but as quick as lightning dick dodged the blow and landed vigorously upon the bullys chest  before baxter could recover dick struck out again and the bully caught it straight in the left eye  oh he yelled in pain and put his hand up to the injured optic which began to grow black rapidly  then he struck out wildly half a dozen times  he was growing excited while dick was as calm as ever  watching his opportunity dick struck out with all his force and baxter received a crack on the nose which caused him to fall back into the arms of mumps  as that nose had been struck heavily in the gymnasium it was decidedly tender and baxter roared with pain  have you had enough demanded dick coming up to him  yesbaxter had had more than enough but he did not wish to acknowledge it  he made a sign to mumps previously agreed upon and mumps raised his cap as a signal to one of the spies set on guard  stop the fight cried the guard instantly  somebody is coming  nonsensenobody is coming said the other spy but baxter would not listen to him  im not going to be caughtill finish this some other time he said to dick and hurried away with mumps and his other friends leaving dick the victor beyond question  i knew you could do it cried tom as he fairly hugged his elder brother  ill wager he wont bother you again  no indeed put in sam and fred and the others said the same that was the first and last time that dan baxter fought any of the boys openly but he was their bitter enemy in secret we shall learn in this and other volumes  as soon as baxter had retreated dick and his brothers hurried to a nearby brook where the elder rover took a wash and tried by other means to remove the traces of the contest from his person he had a slight swelling on the scratched chin but that was all and inside of an hour felt quite like himself once more  with baxter it was very different and the sunday following he asked to be excused from attending church services in the hall saying he had fallen on some rocks and hurt his face  on hearing this captain putnam came to see him  sorry to hear this baxter he said  do you think you need a doctor  no sir ill be all right in a few days  where did you fall  down by the brook while we were playing tag  indeed  well you want to be more careful in the future was captain putnams advice and then he left baxter  if he suspected anything he did not let on  to a certain extent he believed in letting boys fight out their own battles   the rover boys had come to putnam hall in the fall and now summer sports were cast aside among the pupils and football and hare and hounds became the rage  as we know sam was an excellent runner and hare and hounds just suited him  we must ask the captain to let us take a long trip next saturday afternoon he said and the boys went to the owner of putnam hall in a body and obtained permission  it was decided that sam and fred should be the hares while larry colby was to be leading hound  as frank harrington had a trumpet he was made whipperin  captain putnam supplied the boys with a package of old copying books and these were cut up into small bits and stuffed into two pillow cases loaned by mrs green  the start was made on a clear but frosty afternoon  the hares stood on the parade ground with the hounds to the number of thirty behind them  george strong had consented to start them off  the hares were to be given three minutes start of the little scholars and five minutes start of the big boys  all ready asked the second assistant of putnam hall as he took out his watch  all ready answered sam and fred  then go  and away went the two boys straight for the cornfield dropping bits of paper as they sped along  they leaped the fence in the rear crossed the brook and then started along a path leading through the woods beyond  we mustnt dream of letting them catch us remarked sam as he ran on with fred directly behind him  i wonder where this path leads to  the top of the mountain so mr strong told me  he said there was another path coming down to the westward  on and on they went along the path until they came to a narrow mountain road  here they met a farmer carting a number of logs in his wagon and stopped him to ask a few questions  yes that road will take you right up to the top he said  but you want to be careful and not make a wrong turn or you may get lost  im not afraid of being lost said fred with a light laugh and on they sped again as rapidly as ever for fred was as good a runner as sam and the pair worked very well together  at the top of the first rise of ground they came to a spot that was somewhat bare and here they halted to look back  there are the small fellows cried sam pointing with his finger  and the big ones are not far behind  they are speeding along in good shape was freds comment come on before they spot us  and they hurried up the next hill here they encountered a number of rocks and were brought to a halt several times to determine which was the best path to pursue  by jinks the farmer was rightwe are getting lost said sam presently  where is the path  i think it is to the right  and i think it is to the left  at this both lads looked at each other then burst out laughing  it cant be in both directions fred  thats true and i am sure i am right  all right well try it and they did but it was a good ten minutes before the path came into view again and meanwhile the first of the hounds drew dangerously close  but the game was by no means over as we shall see     chapter xiii  what the game of hare and hound led to   what a glorious view  it was sam who uttered the words  the top of the mountain had been reached at last and the boys were feasting their eyes on the grand panorama spread on all sides  how beautiful the lake looks said fred  and how far one can see  its a pity we didnt bring a pair of glasses with us fred but say im hungry  so am i  let us eat that lunch at once and then start on the return  each had brought a sandwich along and these were soon consumed and washed down with a drink of cold water from a spring not far away  then on they went over the top of the mountain and along a path which they thought would bring them around its western base  it was now four oclock leaving them two hours in which to get back to putnam hall  about a third of the distance down the mountain side had been covered and sam was slightly in advance when suddenly he uttered a cry of alarm  look out fred  what is it  a snake  where  over yonder and he is coming for us  sam was right it was a snakean angry looking reptile all of six feet long and as thick as sams wrist  it hissed savagely as it advanced first upon sam and then upon fred  if there was one thing which could fill fred garrison full of terror it was a snake and the yell he gave would have outmatched that of an indian on the warpath  save me he screamed  dont let him touch me jump back cried sam and leaped himself  then seeing a tall rock handy he sprang upon it and here fred joined him  now it happened that the snake had its home under the rock and the movement of the lads made it more angry than ever  with a fierce hiss it came for the rock and disappeared underneath out of the range of their vision  its gone under the rock panted fred  he was so agitated he could scarcely speak  i know it returned sam  i wonder if it means to crawl up here  oh dont say that sam iicant we hit it with something  i  havent a thing but the bag of paper  neither have i  oh what shall we do  perhaps we had better stay here until the others come up  do you think the snake will keep quiet that long  im sure i dont know  very much disturbed the two boys peered over the edge of the rock  they were not versed in the different species of reptiles and knew not but that the one at hand might be poisonous  i see his tail cried fred with a shiver  he is moving around as if getting ready to come out  i wonder if i can grab him by the tail mused sam  grab him  oh sam  ive heard you can catch them by the tail snap them and make their heads fly right off  gracious i wouldnt attempt it  while fred was speaking the tail of the snake came up on the side of the rock  setting his teeth sam bent down and made a reach for the slippery thing and caught it tight  with a hiss the snake raised its head its diamondlike eyes shining like twin stars  youll be poisoned shrieked fred when whack sam gave the body of the reptile a swing and brought the head down with great force on the edge of the rock  one blow was enough for the head was mashed flat  then sam threw the body into the bushes there to quiver and twist for several hours to come although life was extinct  fred was as white as a sheet as he leaped to the ground  i couldnt have done that for a million dollars he declared what a splendid nerve you have sam  my father told me how to catch a snake in that way exclaimed sam  but hurry or the hounds will overtake us  i can hear them coming  your father must have been equally brave then answered fred as they started off on a run  by the way have you heard anything of him yet  not a word fred  dont it make you feel bad at times  does it fred  why some nights i cant go to sleep for thinking of where he may bedead in the heart of africa or perhaps a captive of some savage tribe  have they ever hunted for him  several have gone out but no traces are to be had  dick tom and i are in to hunt for him though as soon as our uncle randolph will permit it  thats an idea  but you may have to go right into the jungles for him  i dont care if we have to go to the top of the north pole if only we find him answered sam with quiet determination  inside of half an hour the bottom of the mountain was gained and then they struck out along a road which presently took them within sight of the stanhope homestead  i wonder if we have time to call on dora mused fred  it would be a scheme to leave our paper trail right through their garden  glorious burst from sam caught by the idea  i am certain dora stanhope will appreciate the sport  it did not take them long to reach the garden around the farmhouse and running up the path they ascended a side porch  as they did so two forms appeared around the house  one was mrs stanhope wearing a shawl over her shoulders and a bonnet on her head and the second was josiah crabtree  old crabtree murmured sam and then of a sudden he pulled fred out of sight behind some latticework inclosing one end of the porch  we must hurry my dear or we may be too late josiah crabtree was saying and now the boys noted that he was conducting the lady toward a carriage standing by the horse block  iihad we not better wait until next week josiah questioned mrs stanhope timidly  she was a pale delicate woman of forty of a shrinking nature easily led by others  no my dear there is no use in waiting  but dora  you must not mind what your daughter says my dear  when we are married she will easily become reconciled to the change mark my words  gracious old crabtree is going to marry her whispered sam poor dora  she wants me to wait continued the lady  and you ought to wait mother came in doras voice and now she too came into sight but without a hat or wraps  mr crabtree wishes very much to have the ceremony performed this afternoon dora dear  if he wants to marry you why cant he do it openlyat home or in our church  he is averse to any display  it seems to me it is a very sneaking way to do answered dora coldly  when you and papa were married the wedding was well attended so i have been told  your father and myself are different persons miss dora interrupted josiah crabtree stiffly  i prefer a quiet wedding and no time is better than the present  i shall at once resign my position at putnam hall and come to live here  dora stanhopes lip curled in scorn  she saw through josiah crabtrees motives even though her mother did not  if you wish to marry my mother why do you not make preparations to support her she said  dora cried mrs stanhope pleadingly  i mean what i say mother  he intends to marry you and then make you support him out of the proceeds of this farm  you are entirely mistaken interrupted josiah crabtree perhaps you do not know that i am worth in bank stocks and in bonds between twenty and thirty thousand dollars  i would like to see the stocks and bonds said the girl  so would i whispered fred to sam  ill wager he isnt worth a thousand dollars all told although they say he is a good deal of a miser  dora do not insult mr crabtree  if you wish to come along and see the ceremony performed put on your things  i do not wish to go  very well then you had best return to the house  it is a shame cried the girl and burst into tears  we will be back by seven oclock said josiah crabtree and led the widow down the garden path to where the carriage was standing  i wish i could stop this wedding whispered sam to his chum  i am with you on that returned fred  creation here come the hounds  just the thing  he looked at sam and his chum instantly understood  leaving the porch at a bound they ran across the garden  hurrah we have you yelled larry colby as he rushed up followed by tom dick and a dozen of the other big cadets  quick this way cried sam  do you see that carriage  of course we do answered tom  it contains mrs stanhope and old crabtree  they are going to drive off and get married against dora stanhopes wishes  phew came in a low whistle from the eldest of the rover boys  we ought to stop this affair went on fred  old crabby is going to get married came in a shout  come on let us go along  and pellmell went the boys after the carriage which had just turned from the horseblock with the teacher and mrs stanhope inside and a farmhand named borgy on the front seat     chapter xiv  josiah crabtree in difficulty   dora stanhope had witnessed the approach of the boys and now she came out into the garden again and confronted them  she blushed prettily upon seeing dick and several others with whom she was acquainted  i understand that mr crabtree is about to be married said dick in a low tone  yes he insists on marrying my mother this afternoon  he has been at her about this for several months answered dora between her sobs  evidently you oppose the marriage  ii hate mr crabtree came almost fiercely  he isis nothing like my poor dead papa was  i believe you dora answered dick  i dont see what your mother can find in him to like  we hate him at the academy  i know itand i imagine captain putnam is preparing to get rid of him for i heard he was corresponding with a teacher in buffaloone who has been head master in a military academy out in that vicinity  indeed  i hope we do get clear of himand i wish you could get clear of him too  it doesnt seem as if i could sighed dora  he has wound my mother right around his finger so to speak  but what are those other boys going to do  and she pointed to the balance of the cadets who were following closely upon the wheels of the carriage which had turned into the highway leading to cedarville  ill go after them and see said dick and turned to leave then he came to a halt and turned back  dora i am awfully sorry for you he whispered  if i can ever do anything for you dont hesitate to call on me  ill remember that dick she replied gratefully but never dreamed of how much she would one day require his aid  when dick joined the crowd he found it on all sides of the carriage shouting and hurrahing wildly  at first josiah crabtree pretended to pay no attention but presently he spoke to the driver and the turnout came to a halt  students what does this unseemly conduct mean he demanded harshly  why mr crabtree is that you exclaimed frank harrington in pretended surprise  yes harrington  i say what does it mean  we are out playing hare and hounds sir  but you are following this carriage  oh no sir we are following the paper scent sir answered larry colby and pointed to the pieces of paper which fred harrison was slyly dropping just in front of the horses  then our carriage is on the trail sighed josiah crabtree  it is very annoying  oh it doesnt bother us much sir answered frank coolly  bother you  it is myself and mrs stanhope to whom i referred make the hares take another course  cant do that sir until we catch them  but why must you keep so close to this carriage  i dont know sir  perhaps it is the carriage which is keeping close to us  josiah crabtree looked more angry than ever  he spoke to the driver with a view to increasing the speed of the team but borgy had entered into the spirit of the fun at hand and he was moreover a great friend of dora and he shook his head couldnt do it sir he said  i wouldnt want to run the risk of winding them  do you mean to say they cannot outrun these boys demanded the head assistant at putnam hall  hardly sirthe lads is uncommonly good runners answered borgy meekly  i will show you how to manage them ejaculated josiah crabtree and stepped over to the front seat  oh josiah be careful pleaded mrs stanhope  i know how to drive horses so dont worry answered crabtree and took up both reins and whip  before borgy could stop him he had given one of the horses a smart cut on the flank  the steed was a spirited one and not used to the whip and scarcely had the lash landed than he gave a wild leap into the air came down and broke into a mad run dragging his mate with him  a second later the carriage struck a stone bounced up and borgy was pitched out to land in the midst of some bushes growing by the roadside  the bolting of the team proved almost fatal to the boys in front who scattered just in time to let horses and carriage pass them with lightninglike speed  then the cadets gathered together and stared blankly at one another  its a runaway  serves old crabby right for hitting the horse  yes but he and the lady may be killed  such were some of the cries  as soon as they could recover the whole party made after the carriage now disappearing around a bend  theyll never get around the next turn alive said captain harry blossom who was running beside tom  soon dick joined the pair  in the meantime josiah crabtree was filled with terror over the sudden turn of affairs  he dropped the whip and tugged first at one rein and then the other  whoa whoa he cried in a hoarse whisper  whoa  but instead of slackening their speed the team moved on faster than ever the carriage rocking violently from side to side  we will be killed moaned mrs stanhope  oh why did i not take doras advice and have a regular wedding as she proposed  i willwill stop them panted crabtree  whoa you brutes whoa  whoa peter whoa jack added mrs stanhope timidly  for an instant the horses seemed to take notice of the ladys voice but only for an instant then they went on as fast as ever around another bend and down a rocky stretch lined on either side with trees and bushes  suddenly there came a crash as a wheel came off the carriage then came a second crash and mrs stanhope was hurled forth among some bushes  but the turnout continued on its way josiah crabtree clinging to the wreck until at last he too was hurled forth to fly up among some tree branches and remain there for the best part of ten minutes  when the crowd of cadets reached mrs stanhope they found the lady unconscious and evidently suffering from a broken arm  several of them including dick tom and sam did what they could for her while others ran off to find josiah crabtree and to summon a doctor  it was several minutes before the head assistant at putnam hall could be helped out of the tree  he came down in fear and trembling so overcome he could scarcely stand  howhow is mrs stanhope was his first question  we dont know answered several of the cadets and josiah crabtree hobbled back to find out  the shades of night had long fallen when mrs stanhope was conveyed to her home and a doctor was brought from cedarville and the lanings were informed of what had happened  the doctor said that a rib as well as the left arm had been fractured and that the lady must be kept quiet for at least two months  at once dora set about doing what she could for her mother and nellie laning remained at the homestead to assist her  no one seemed to care about josiah crabtree and he was allowed to hobble back to putnam hall on foot  it was the fault of those boys he muttered to himself  ill get even with them see if i dont  but his chances of getting even while at the academy were speedily nipped in the bud by captain putnam who did not say anything on sunday but interviewed the head assistant early on the day following  it is perhaps needless for us to go into the details of what has occurred mr crabtree said the owner of the hall  your contract with me comes to an end next month  i will pay you in full tomorrow and then i wish you to remove yourself and your belongings from this place  youyou discharge me cried the teacher in astonishment  i do  i have long been dissatisfied with your conduct toward my pupils and i am now satisfied that you are not worthy of the position with which i entrusted you  at this josiah crabtrees face fell for he had hoped to keep his place at putnam hall until his marriage to mrs stanhope was assured  now there was no telling when that marriage would occur and in the meantime it was not likely he could get another position  i think i ought to have more notice than this  you deserve no noticesince you were about to marry on the sly so to speak and most likely leave me when your contract came to an end without allowing me time to make other arrangements  i would have given you at least two weeks time  and i am giving you three weeks pay which you do not deserve  i do not think we need to prolong the discussion and captain putnam turned away  the departure of josiah crabtree was hailed with satisfaction by all of the pupils excepting dan baxter  strange to say a strong friendship had sprung up between the bully and the hottempered school teacher  baxter was the only one who shook hands when crabtree left  i hope we meet again mr crabtree he said  i like you even if the others dont  and i like you baxter answered josiah crabtree  i shall remember you  and josiah crabtree did remember the bully in a manner which was strange in the extreme     chapter xv  dan baxters money   after the departure of josiah crabtree from putnam hall george strong became the leading assistant and another teacher named garmore took second place  garmore was a yale man and soon became as favorably known as strong so the pupils had nothing more to find fault with so far as their instructors went  as has been noted before there were several baseball teams among the boys  as it grew too cold for baseball these teams gave up this sport and a good number of the lads took up football  in this sport sam being a good runner felt very much at home and soon he was at the head of one of the teams playing center tom was also on the team playing quarterback  not far from putnam hall was another academy kept by a certain gentleman named pornell the pupils at pornells were also great football players and one day they sent over a challenge that the putnams as they were dubbed should play them a match for the championship of the township in which both seats of learning were located  the challenge was brought by peleg snuggers who had gone over to pornells on an errand for captain putnam  its for you said snuggers handing the communication to sam the youthful captain of the eleven broke open the letter and read it aloud  pornell academy november 18 189  to the putnam hall football team  we hereby challenge you to a game of football for the championship of the township of cedarville the game to be played thanksgiving afternoon next at two oclock at our grounds or at your own as you may elect  we would prefer to play on our grounds as we have a  grandstand onehalf of which will be reserved for your friends if you will come over  pornell football team  per harry ackerson capt and secy  they certainly mean business said tom who was in the crowd listening to the reading of the challenge  i go in for accepting it  so do i said larry who played halfback  and i put in fred who was on the right end  the members of the football team were all at hand and it did not take long to find out each was in favor of the game and then the matter was laid before captain putnam  want to play football with mr pornells lads eh smiled the captain  all right i know of no healthier sport rightly conducted  you shall play them and on their grounds if you wish but mind you no neglecting lessons for the sake of practicing between now and thanksgiving  the pupils promised to neglect nothing and went off with a hurrah  soon peleg snuggers was on his way to the rival academy with the following answer to the challenge  putnam hall november 19 189  pornell football team we hereby accept your challenge to play a game of football for the championship of the township on thanksgiving afternoon next at two oclock  as you have a grandstand we will play on your grounds  in return for the use of half of your stand on this occasion the senior class of our academy will put up a silver cup as a trophy said trophy to go to the club winning the game and to belong to that club which shall during matches to be arranged in the future win the cup three times  the putnam hall football team  per fred harrison secy and treas  dick had suggested giving the cup and all of the senior class chipped in  willingly raising ten dollars with which a very neat trophy was secured through a pupil whose father was a silversmith in new york  i say all the senior class contributed i must correct this  there was one exception and that was dan baxter  i havent got anything for you or your brothers growled the bully when dick spoke of the matter before the class  let em furnish their own silver cups if they want em  all right baxter i guess sam and tom will be just as well satisfied if you dont chip in had been dicks ready answer  i only wanted to give everyone a chance to own an equal share in the gift if it was desired  our football team cant play for a sour apple dick rover theyll be whipped out of their boots  if i was a betting boy id bet you a dollar on the result answered dick coldly  ill bet you ten dollars we win put in fred garrison impulsively  ill cover that bet sneered baxter and drew from his pocket a roll of bills  gracious baxter where did you get that wad questioned several in chorus for the supply of pocket money among most of the pupils was limited  never mindi have it and thats enough answered baxter but he lost no time in putting all of the money but the tendollar bill away  it was all fred garrison could do to scrape up an equal sum and even at that he had to borrow a dollar from dick  but he was game and the money went to another pupil who became stakeholder until the contest should be decided  its a shame cried sam when he heard of the transaction  to bet against his own school  im like dicki dont believe in betting and yet i am glad fred took him up  if it is in my power baxter shall lose his wager  thanksgiving was but a week off so the football team had to work hard to get into proper condition  moreover studies must not be neglected for captain putnam was strict and would have canceled the game had his cadets become unmindful of their school duties but the team got permission to get up an hour earlier than usual every morning and this time was spent in the hardest kind of practice with the ball  the report that baxter had bet against his own school spread and the bully became more unpopular than ever  but this did not daunt him and soon he had a dozen other bets on aggregating fifty dollars or more  its a mystery to me where he gets so much money said dick to captain blossom one day is his father rich  i cant tell you answered the youthful commander of company a fact of the matter is nobody knows much about baxternot even mumps his chum  nobody ever comes to see him and he seldom ever gets any letters yet he always has all the spending money he wants  perhaps hes got a gold mine somewhere laughed dick  i dont know about that but i do know that there are days when he hasnt a cent and the next day he will have just such a roll of bills as you saw him with day before yesterdayand the money doesnt come to him through the mail either  perhaps captain putnam deals it out to him  captain harry shook his head  not much  the captain wouldnt let him have more than five dollars at a time  ive been through the mill and i know  here the matter was dropped but dick had good cause to remember this conversation later on  the distance from putnam hall to pornell academy was a mile and a half and it was arranged that the football team captain putnam george strong and several others should ride to the latter place in the hall carriages while the others walked the distance thanksgiving dawned bright and clear  the morning was spent in the hall chapel and dinner was served promptly at twelve  dont eat too much cautioned sam  i want every player to be wide awake today  the start was signalized by a grand flourish of tin horns and away went the two carriages with the horses on a gallop followed by a large number of the cadets on foot organized into their regular companies with major bart conners at the head of the battalion  the boys were in their best uniforms and certainly presented an imposing appearance as they marched behind the music of their drums and fifes  when the grounds at pornell academy were reached they were found to be more than three quarters full for the proprietor of the place had opened up for the benefit of the public at large and many had come from cedarville and the surrounding territory  the grandstand was already comfortably filled many coming into the part reserved for the hall folks on tickets of invitation issued by sam and indorsed by captain putnam  here they come yelled the boys of pornell  three cheers for putnam hall  the cheers were given with a will and getting the football team and the other cadets together putnam hall gave a rousing cheer in return for pornell academy  then the football teams disappeared into their respective dressing rooms and the newly arrived cadets took their places in the grandstand  a timekeeper and referee had already been appointed by sam and the rival captain at a meeting at the hall three days before  my what a crowd exclaimed tom as he surveyed the multitude i didnt think we were going to have such an audience as this  nor i returned sam  we must do our level best fellows  thats what came from several  if we get whipped  remember what baxter didthats enough to nerve anybody on finished larry colby  by the way where is baxter  sneaked out of the ranks answered another player  nobody wanted to march with him  well i dont blame them concluded sam  doctor pornell now put in an appearance and desired to know if the football team did not wish to march around the oval escorted by his own players  certainly cried sam and to show this is a purely friendly match let us march side by side he went on and this was also arranged  the putnam hall drumandfife corps led the march and each player strode forth with a rival at his side  the march brought forth a wild round of applause and a veritable shrieking of tin horns and cracking of wooden clappers  after the march each team was allowed quarter of an hour for practicing  the pornellites came out first and tumbled over the leather in lively fashion  the putnamites soon followed  they may be all right but they havent the weight said one of the rivals  and this appeared true for each pornellite man for man was at least five pounds heavier than his opponent  but weight does not always count for everything even in a football match  time for practice is up came presently and the two teams drew away from the gridiron  then there was a tossup for goals and pornell won and took the east end that which was most favored by the slight breeze that was blowing  and then the great game began     chapter xvi  the great football game   the halves were to be of twenty minutes each so no time was lost in putting the leather into the field  it was putnams kickoff and on the instant the ball went sailing into the air to land well into pornells territory  then came a grand rush and before the words can be put down twentytwo lads were at it nipandtuck to get possession of the sphere  its pornells ball  say but aint this going to be a snappy game  our fellows have the ball  there she goes up five yards into putnam ground  carry that ball back yelled dick excitedly  dont let them gain an inch  whoop her up for pornell  and then came a wild blare of tin horns and a waving of the academy colors brown and white  the waving of the hall colors an american flag set in a border of green came also with an equal din from horns and wooden clappers  hurrah hurrah hurrah  so the game went on for ten minutes and the pornellites had gained exactly twentyfive yardsno more  looks like a standoff said several  say maybe those young soldiers arent game  thats whatbut well wax em was the answer and then of a sudden came another yell for pornell had the ball and was pushing it straight ahead for putnams goal  ten yards  five yards more  fifteen yards more  hurrah hurrah hurrah  toot tootaroottoot clackclackclack bang  the pornellites were now wild but they stared blankly as they saw plucky tom rover snatch the leather up and run back twenty yards with it  hes going right through with it  there goes hardy after him  down they go  lushear has the ball  its going back  run lushear run  a dollar if you make it  they cant catch him  oh pshaw  down he goes  but the ball is safe  a touchdown  hurrah  the cry was correct  just three minutes before the end of the first half the pornell team scored a touchdown  instantly preparations were made to kick a goal if possible  but the kick was a failure and the two sides retired for the half with the score standing 4 to 0 in pornell academys favor  glumly the hall boys retired to their dressing room there to be rubbed down by their chums  its too bad it certainly is came from a dozen sympathizers  but it cant be helped  dont give up yet  they are too heavy for us in mass play said sam  we must try more running away with the leather  and so it was agreed  soon the gong rang and they reentered the field  now putnam hall do your best  we are looking at you  they cant play a little bit sneered dan baxter  im ashamed of them and he smiled to himself thinking the fifty dollars put up on the game was already as good as won  sam had given his team some explicit instructions and these were now being followed  as soon as the ball came into putnams possession there was a run on their part that carried the sphere twenty yards into their opponents territory  go in and win putnam  thats the way to do it  take it from them pornell  go for it  take it  and pornell did take it and half the distance gained was lost  both teams were now warmed up and for fully five minutes the ball flew back and forth remaining at the end of that time almost in the center of the gridiron  then pornell tried some heavy mass play but lost the leather on a fumble and it came into tom rovers possession  away flew tom as though a legion of demons were after him straight for pornells goal  the crowd began to shout itself hoarse  see tom rover  go it tom old boy go it  he cant carry it through  see conkey and largren are after him  there he goes down  conkey has the leather  this was true but ere conkey could start to run fred garrison brought him to earth and the ball rolled out into the field  sam and a pornell halfback made a rush for it  my ball yelled the pornellite who was twenty pounds heavier than the little captain  not today retorted sam and snatched it from under his very feet  before the pornellite could recover from his astonishment sam was pelting up the field with all the nimbleness of his agile legs  hurrah for sam rover  great caesar see him leg it  they cant catch him  there he goes over the line  a touchdown  the game is a tie  quick fellows cried sam only five more minutes remember who is to kick  it was a player named larcom  but larcom was not equal to it for the wind was rising and blowing in several directions at once  no goal  the game is a tie  put the ball out again  only four minutes to play  again the football went forth and again the crowd pounced upon it the pornellites were now desperate and massed themselves as never before they pushed forward ten yardsfifteentwentyalmost thirty it looked as if they would score another touchdown if not kick a goal but now sam rover sent a certain sign to his players it was taking a risk but it was worth trying  the ball came over to the right of the field and spun like lightning to the left  fred caught it up ran ten yards and passed it to larry colby who turned it over to tom   away it went to sam and then to frank  the pornellites were bewildered where was the ball  putnam has it  there she goes  hurrah for frank harrington  another touchdown  it was true  putnam hall had scored another touchdown  a tremendous yelling and cheering broke out in the midst of which the gong sounded  the game was over and our boys had won the victory  in a twinkle the gridiron was covered with swarming students and sam and his fellow players were hoisted up on willing shoulders to be trotted around the oval  hurrah for pornell they shouted  hurrah for putnam came back the cry  it had been a bitter but friendly contest and victors and vanquished shook hands over and over again  of course many students of pornell were bitterly disappointed but no one felt so sour over the whole afternoons doing as did dan baxter  in all he had lost over fifty dollars and now neither his fellow students nor the boys of pornell academy wanted anything to do with him  i havent any use for a chap who bets against his own crowd was the comment of one academy student and he voiced the sentiment of all  only mumps stuck to his chum and the two soon left the grounds together  by four oclock the cadets were on their way back to putnam hall the carriages moving behind the two companies of young soldiers who sang and shouted themselves hoarse as they moved along  even captain putnam entered into the spirit of the affair  brings me back to the days when i was a cadet myself he said to george strong  directly after supper a huge bonfire was lit on the playground and the students were allowed to have their own fun until eleven oclock  the football team was of course the center of attraction and sam and tom came in for their full share of honors  while the festivities of this thanksgiving eve were at their height a sudden thought struck dick  captain putnam had given the cadets permission to go beyond bounds if any cared to do so and he hurried away his intention being to call upon dora stanhope and see how she was faring  although dick would not admit it he thought a great deal of dora and he was sorry that she was in danger of having the detestable josiah crabtree for a stepfather  it was a clear moonlight night and he hurried off in the best of spirits taking a short cut by way of a road through the woods as he walked along he remembered how tom had met in this vicinity the thief who had stolen the watch  i wonder if ill meet him he thought but no tramp put in an appearance indeed he did not see a soul until the stanhope homestead was reached  a light was burning brightly in the sitting room and the curtains were drawn down to within six inches of the bottom of the windows dick was about to ascend the porch when he changed his mind and walked softly to one of the windows  if they have a lot of company i wont disturb them on a holiday like this he thought and peeped under one of the curtains  the sight that met his gaze filled him with astonishment and indignation  only two persons were present dora and josiah crabtree  crabtree had the girl by the left wrist and had one hand raised as if to strike his prisoner     chapter xvii  dick at the stanhope cottage   the villain  such were the words which sprang involuntarily to dicks lips as he gazed at the scene before him  he was filled with bitter indignation and could hardly resist the temptation to break in the window and leap to doras assistance  as he paused he saw dora push crabtree back and leap to the opposite side of the center table  dont you dare to touch me mr crabtree came loud enough for dick to hear quite plainly  i want you to behave yourself young lady stormed josiah crabtree  i know how to do that without your advice  no you dont  you have set your mother against me  if it hadnt been for you we would be married long ago  i believe a daughter has a right to advise her mother concerning a stranger mr crabtree  a stranger  well an outsiderif you like that better  i am no outsider  ive known your mother for years  i might have married her instead of your father doing so if he hadnt played an underhanded trick which  stop sir you shall not say a word against my father  good for dora thought dick  shes the right kind  your mother is quite willing to marry me and as a dutiful daughter you should bow to her wishes  mother is not herself mr crabtree  ever since father died she has been upset by business matters and you have pestered the life out of her  if you would only go away for a month or so and give her time to think it over i am sure she would end this matter between you  tut tut child you do not know what you are talking about your mother has given me her word and you ought to bow to the inevitable  she has not yet married you sir and until she is actually bound to you there will still be hope for her  this isis outrageous cried josiah crabtree wrathfully  do you think i will allow a mere slip of a girl to stand between me and my plans  just wait until i am your father  you shall never take the place of my dear dead father mr crabtreenever and now doras eyes filled with tears  he was ten thousand times better than you can ever be  i must admit i cant see it  he had not half the education i possess answered josiah crabtree conceitedly  perhaps not but he had an honest warm heart and that counts for more than a mere book education  i fancy many men are smarter even in book learning than mr josiah crabtree who tried last week for an opening at columbia college and failed to meet the requirements  ha who told you that  mother told me  she is foolish to take you into her confidence  it was not my fault that i failed of the openingmerely the pigheadedness of those having the matter in charge  however i do not care much as soon as your mother and i are married i shall make some changes here put up a fine brick building and open a rival school to putnam hall  gracious here is news thought dick  wonder what captain putnam will say to that  will you ejaculated dora  and who will give you permission to make alterations here  mrs crabtreethat is soon to be  do you know that she holds this property in a trust for me mr crabtree  it will be hers only if i die before i become of age her own shares of papas estate is situated further up the lake at berryport  at this announcement josiah crabtree started back  youyou are not telling the truth he faltered  i am  but your mother is the executrix of your fathers will  yes  exactly  consequently she has full control of all the property until you are twentyone  she hasbut certain changes suggested by you or her would be subject to the approval of the court or the surrogate so i have been told answered dora quietly  josiah crabtree glared at the girl and then began to pace the floor impatiently  dora see here he said finally  let us come to terms  what terms  your mother and i are bound to get married  remove your opposition to this and i will promise not to interfere with you in the least  you can do as you please and go where you please and you shall have all the spending money from time to time that the estate can afford  at this the girls lip curled proudly i do not thank you for your offer mr crabtree  the whole difficulty is just herei do not like you and my mother shall never marry you so long as i can prevent it  youyou saucy minx he snarled and leaping around the table caught her by the wrist again ill tame you before i am done with you mark my words if you dare to talk to your mother againhullo who is this  dick rover cried dora in amazement and in delight  for dick had suddenly thrown up the window sash which was unlocked and leaped straight into the sitting room  let her go josiah crabtree ordered the young cadet  dont you dare to strike her or ill knock you flat  one of the rover boys muttered the exteacher  what business have you here at this hour of the evening  have you run away from the hall  since you have been discharged i do not feel called upon to answer your question answered dick  but you must let dora alone or there will be a broken head around here i can tell you that  at dicks plain words josiah crabtree greatly paled  he had dropped the girls wrist and now he fell back several steps  i was not harming the girl only trying to reason with her  oh i know you well enough  ive heard you were the most pigheaded teacher they ever had at putnam hall rejoined dick warmly  i shall take pains to let mrs stanhope know what they think of you too  was he discharged asked dora  he told mamma that he had left of his own accord  he was discharged answered dick who had got word through peleg snuggers  it is not true stormed josiah crabtree  this is aa plot to injure me in the eyes of mrs stanhope and you shall pay dearly for it boy and he shook his fist in dicks face  dont do that again mr crabtree or we may have a setto right herebegging doras pardon answered dick his eyes flashing fire  thats all rightdont give in an inch to him dick whispered dora  i hate himoh more than words can tell and she caught the youths arm  i am not afraid of you boy was the short return but now the exteacher turned to the hallway  i was on the point of leaving and now i will go dora  but i will be back in a day or two and he strode from the room  a moment later he had secured his hat and overcoat and taken his departure  oh what a dreadful man sobbed dora when he was gone  dick rover what shall i do  and she looked at him pleadingly  its a puzzle to me doraworse than an example in cube root in algebra he smiled sadly  but if i was you id hold out and never let him marry my mother  oh i will never consent to thatnever  but he may marry her anyway  if he does you can apply to the courts for another guardianif crabtree doesnt treat you fairly  but i do not wish to separate from my mother  well the only thing to do is to keep fighting him off  in the meantime ill try to get some folks who know crabtree well to tell your mother just what a mean crabbed fellow he is  undoubtedly he is after the money your father left  so i always supposedbut mother does not think so  how is your mother  she is doing nicely and may be out in a week or two  i am keeping her in as long as possible so that josiah crabtree cannot argue her into going off and getting married  you certainly have your hands full dora answered the young cadet  i wish i could take this burden off your shoulders indeed i do and impulsively he caught up her plump hand and kissed it  oh  she snatched the hand away and blushed prettily but was not angry  ii  its something to know one has a friend dick she said softly  can i come to you if ithat is if i want something done  to be sure doraill do anything in the wide world for you there and he kissed her hand again  at that moment an elderly lady who had been hired to wait on mrs stanhope came in and the conversation was changed  dora asked about life at the hall and dick told of the football game and of the parts tom and sam had played in it  you are a great set of boys dora smiled  i wish i had a couple of sisters  you have your two cousins nellie and grace  yes but they are not as intimate as sisters would bealthough they are the best of cousins  what does mr laning say of crabtree dick whispered as the nurse left the room for a moment  uncle does not like him but he says the whole matter is none of his affairand mother must do as she thinks best  it was now growing late and dick took his departure kissing doras hand a third time as they stood in the darkness of the porch  youre terrible she murmured but it is doubtful if she meant anything by it  girls and boys are about the same the world over and dicks regard for dora was of the manly sort that is creditable to anybody     chapter xviii  winter sports   hurrah boys the ice is forming just as fast as it can  well have skating in twentyfour hours  it was sam who came rushing into the gymnasium with the news  the place was crowded at the time for it was too cold to play on the grounds outside  skating cried tom  that just suits me  i wonder if i brought my skates along  you didnt answered sam  neither did i  i have my skates said fred garrison  brand new pair  my skates were old said tom  i must strike captain putnam for a couple of dollars of my allowance and buy a new pair  so must i put in sam  dick i know has his skates  it was early in december and it had been growing colder steadily there had been one fall of snow but it had amounted to but little  the next day skating in the cove of the lake near putnam hall was excellent the ice being from three to four inches thick  at once sam and tom went to captain putnam  want to buy some skates said the captain  well the money i am keeping is your own and i presume every boy likes to skate here are two dollars for each of you  show me your purchases when you get back  we will replied the lads and hurried off for time was precious with the smooth ice waiting for them  they knew that a certain hardware dealer in cedarville had a good quantity of skates on hand and started to walk to the village without delay  baxter is going to buy a pair of skates too said sam on the way  i heard him telling mumps about it  well we dont want baxter for company answered tom  he can go alone  it did not take the lads long to reach cedarville but once at the hardware store considerable time was lost in getting just the skates desired  its queer baxter hasnt shown up said tom when they were ready to leave  perhaps he went elsewhere for his skates suggested sam  the hardware shop was at the end of the village street and as they passed a number of places of business tom suddenly caught his brother by the arm  there is baxter nowjust entering that tavern he exclaimed in a low voice  the tavern repeated sam  why its against the regulations to enter a drinking place  i dont carei saw baxter go in returned tom  he was with a tall man  if captain putnam hears of this baxter will be sent away or at least punished  perhaps sam but i shant tell him  no were no talebearers  let us go up to the side windows of the tavern and see if we can see them  this was agreed to and the two boys hurried up to first one window and then another  they are not in the saloon part thats certain said tom blankly  but i saw baxter go in and the tall man with him  here is a side room answered sam  and there they are at a corner table  the man is giving baxter some money  tom peeped into the window over his brothers shoulder  my gracious  whats up now tom  that tall man is the same fellow i met in the woods  the man that was with the tramp who stole the watch  you dont mean it  but i do  see the scar on his chin  yes  he is that thiefs pal as they call it  and he just gave baxter some bank bills  what does it mean  i give it up  but i know one thingthat man ought to be arrested  thats true  oh they have seen us  if theyhi what do you mean by that  for a burly bartender had suddenly come up behind both of the boys and hurled them backward  no spying around this place cried the dispenser of liquors roughly  take yourselves off  there is a man inside i want to see said tom  why dont you come in then  i willas soon as i can find a policeman or a constable  what going to have a gent arrested  the man inside knows all about a stolen watch  you must be mistaken  no i am not  where can i find a policeman  down at the steamboat landing most likely  all right  sam you stay here and see that that fellow dont make tracks and tom prepared to move away  see here we dont want any trouble in our place said the barkeeper  we run a respectable house we do  then you ought to help me bag the pal of a thief retorted tom  hold on tom came from sam  theyre gone  they slipped through a back door  tom ran up to the window again  it was true baxter and the man with a scar had disappeared  come on back he cried to his brother and both ran to the rear of the tavern here there was a yard at the end of which stood a barn and a long low carriage shed  only a negro hostler was in sight  perhaps they havent come out yet began sam when he caught sight of a buggy on a road behind the barn  it was going at a furious rate the scarred man driving and lashing his mettlesome horse at the same time  there goes the man  thats so where is baxter  i dont know  they ran after the buggy but soon gave up the chase as man and turnout disappeared around a bend leading to the woods back of cedarville  weve lost him murmured tom when he could get back his breath now who in the name of old nick can he be  evidently a friend to baxter  perhaps he  is baxters father suggested sam  baxters fathergracious  he is  how do you know  im not positive but when i met him and the thief in the woods the thief who was called buddy started to call that fellow baxter but the tall man wouldnt have it and made him call him nolly  his right name i feel certain is arnold baxter  then if he isnt baxters father he must be some close relative otherwise he wouldnt give baxter that money  now it is easy to see where the bully gets all of his cash  that tall man must be rich  yes but who knows how he comes by his money  he is the chum of a thief thats certain  a search was made for dan baxter but he could not be found  as a matter of fact he had been in the buggy hiding under the seat the boys hung around for quarter of an hour longer and then resolved to return to putnam hall  no use of making a row about it said tom  i remember that policeman at the steamboat landing  he is a terribly fat fellow and evidently a hard drinker  he couldnt help us enough  we had better try to work this out on our own account  ill tackle baxter the first chance i get  when the hall was reached they looked around for the bully but found he had not returned  they had now to go in for their studies and for the time being the affair was dropped  that afternoon found them on the lake and while enjoying the skating dick was informed of what had occurred  a bad crowd said the elder rover  yes tackle baxter by all means  but be cautious what you say for you cant prove much remember  a race had been arranged between the boys and dick was one of the contestants  the distance was from one end of the cove to the other was a little over threequarters of a mile  there were ten starters including fred frank larry and mumps  mumps had a reputation as a skater gained at his home on the hudson river  all ready shouted the starter  there was a dead silence  go came the word and away went the ten their skates flashing brightly in the setting sun  soon larry colby was in advance with mumps just over his shoulder  it is larrys race  mumps is a close second  shake em up fred  what are you lagging about frank  go it leo  skirk skirk skirk went the skate runners and now a crowd of lads started in pursuit of the racers  soon the turning point was gained  larry was in advance still but now mumps overtook him and suddenly the boy from the hudson who had such a reputation as a racer shot fifteen feet in advance  it looked as if the race was certainly his and larry and the others felt much downcast     chapter xix  the skating racedan baxter is cornered   the wind had been with the racers thus far but as one after another of the skaters turned the mark they found the wind now full in their faces and it was blowing freshly  mumps will win beyond a doubt was the cry as the lad from the hudson river forged still further ahead  my skate is loose cried larry and a second later the skate came off and flew fifty feet away  by this time dick and fred were coming up slowly but surely  it seemed to be nipandtuck between them and the friends of each cheered wildly  go it dick you can come in second anyway  make him follow you fred  you can do it if you try  on and on went the racers mumps still ten feet ahead fred and dick side by side and the others in a bunch just back of them  but the strain was now beginning to tell upon mumps who had pushed himself too much from the start  halfway to the finish from the turning point dick and fred began to crawl up until they were less than a yard behind him one at either hand  go it mumps  they are catching you  mumps did try to increase his speed but his wind was gone and he could hardly strike out  the finish was now in sight and the boys began to shout on every side  go it every one of you  hurrah mumps dick and fred are a tie  it was true the three boys were side by side  but presently both dick and fred made extra efforts and forged ahead  its your race fred  its yours dick  but it was neithers racefor with a shout both whizzed over the line at the same instant  a tie  and mumps aint in it  three cheers for dick and fred shouted frank harrington and the cheers were given with a will  by this time the play hour was over and all of the skaters rushed back to the hall to get ready for the drill previous to supper  it is needless to add that each lad brought an extra big appetite with him  all of the royer boys noticed that dan baxter did not turn up at roll call nor did the bully put in an appearance that night got a day off said mumps but that was all he could tell  late on the following day tom was walking toward the gymnasium when he caught sight of baxter just entering the school grounds he at once ran toward the bully  baxter i want to have a talk with you he said sharply as he looked the bully squarely in the face  do you was the uneasy answer  all right fire ahead  hadnt you better come up to the dormitory  we can have it all to ourselves for the others are either in the gymnasium or on the lake  well i was going up to our dormitory anyway answered baxter and stalked off leaving tom to follow him  once they were in the dormitory occupied by the bully and his set baxter locked the door  now out with what you have got to say and be quick about it he growled  i want to know who that man was you met in the tavern in cedarville  didnt meet any man in particular  met half a dozen in general  you know the man i meanthe tall fellow with a scar on his chin  oh that fellow  i think his name is nolly  hes a book agent and i promised to buy some histories from him and baxter pretended to yawn as if he was not especially interested  you are not telling the truth baxter answered tom undaunted by this show of nerve  do you mean to say i lie rover  take care or you may be sorry for what you say  you cant pull the wool over my eyes baxter  that mans name is no more nolly than mine is george washington or yours william mckinley  isnt it  then perhaps you know his real name  i do  his name is arnold baxter  had a bomb exploded at baxters ear he would not have appeared more astonished  say who told you that he demanded fiercely and caught tom by the arm  let go of me dan baxter  i say who told you that  i heard his name in the woods  he was with the man who robbed my brother dick of his watch when we were at home  stuff and nonsense growled the bully but he was very pale and his voice shook with emotion  that mans name is william nolly he used to know my father  that is why i helped him along by giving him an order for the histories  i dont really want the books  if you was helping him how is it that sam and i saw you taking a roll of bills from him down at the tavern  again baxter started  you didnt see no such thing he roared regardless of his grammar  ithat ishe gave me some change that is all  here are the books i bought and he pointed to a package he had been carrying  its a madeup story retorted tom  he gave you money and my opinion is that that man is your father and that he is no better than the man with whom he associates  the words had scarcely left toms lips than baxter leaped upon himlike an enraged animal and hurled him to the floor ive a good mind toto kill you for that rover he hissed take it back or ill choke you to death and his strong hand sought toms throat  will you came in a gasp and now tom turned over and threw the bully to one side  i guess two can play at this game  take that and he struck baxter a heavy blow on the side of the face in a moment they had clinched and were trying their best to throw each other  suddenly came a rattle of the door knob  boys boys  what does this mean it was george strongs voice  open the door instantly  keep your mouth shut whispered baxter as he again shook his fist in toms face  not one wordon your life  then he disengaged himself adjusted his collar and tie which had become rumpled and unlocked the door  at once the head assistant strode into the dormitory  have you two been fighting he demanded  we were only boxing a bit sir answered baxter before tom could speak  no harm intended sir  you were making a good deal of noise answered george strong dryly  what have you to say rover  i have this to say mr strong answered tom boldly  i would like to interview captain putnam without delay  dont you dare began baxter when a wave of the teachers hand cut him short  about what rover  about this affair and about baxter sir  i am not a telltale but certain things have happened which i think captain putnam should know for his own sake and for the reputation of his school  youyou imp hissed baxter  he wanted to spring at tom but now george strong caught him and held him fast  baxter you had best come with meand you too rover  to see captain putnam queried tom  yes  i dont want to go blustered the bully  let rover tell his yarni dont care  it will be only another of his lies  then you shall go to the guardroom said the teacher  rover you may go to see the captain alone  i will sirat once and tom made away  he had no sooner departed than george strong marched baxter off to the guardroom previously described  as the pair passed down the stairs they encountered mumps coming up  hullo dan what does this mean asked mumps in wonder  im under arrest laughed baxter bitterly  and for nothing too  silence commanded george strong  if you have done nothing wrong you will soon be released  you bet i will rejoined baxter insolently and then watching his chance he made a sign which mumps well understood  the sign meant come and help me if you can  mumps nodded to show that he understood  then he pretended to go up to the dormitory while the head teacher conducted baxter to the guardroom locked the impudent one in and walked away with the key     chapter xx  the bully leaves putnam hall   so you wish to see me rover  very well come right in and sit down said captain putnam who sat in front of his desk making up some of his accounts for the month just past  tom came in and sat down  it must be confessed he was a trifle nervous but this soon wore away  i came to tell you something and to ask your advice he began you remember what happened to me when i ran away into the woods just after arriving at the hall  very well thomas and the captain smiled  well when sam and i went to cedarville to buy our skates we saw dan baxter in the tavern there in company with the man with a scar on his chin  this man gave baxter some bank bills  what  at the tavern  yes sir  please tell your story in detail rover and now captain putnam swung around so that he might get a full view of his pupils face  and tom told his story from beginning to end just as i have set it down in the foregoing pages  i am certain this man is some relative of baxter he concluded and i am equally certain he is not an honest fellow  humph captain putnam arose and began to pace the heavily carpeted floor  rover this is a serious charge  i understand that sir  but you cant blame us boys for trying to get back dicks watch and trying toto  bring the guilty party to justice  certainly not  but it would seem the man with a scar is not the thief  no but he is the boon companion of the thief  that is trueunless there is some grave mistake  but you are right about one thing the man is really baxters father and his name is arnold baxter  and why does he travel around under the name of nolly  that is the mystery  i met mr baxter only oncewhen he placed his son in my care  at that time i was certain he was wearing a wig and a false mustache  the scar was on his chin although he tried to hide it  i have never seen him since  when any money is due from him he sends it to me by mail and does not ask for any receipt  i once asked baxter about his parents and he said his mother was dead and he didnt know exactly where his father was as the latter was a great traveler and went everywhere  i see  if you are right and the man is a rascal it is to his credit that he is trying to bring his son up as a gentleman  perhaps he doesnt want daniel to know anything of the past  do you follow me  i do sir  but if this is so would he take his son into the tavern  perhapseverybody is not so opposed to drinking as i am  well if mr baxter is a bad man i rather think dan is a chip of the old block rejoined tom bluntly  but be that as it may all i want to get hold of is that thief and dicks timepiece  i will question baxter closely answered captain putnam  but i do not wish to hold him guilty of something of which most likely he knows nothing  george strong had by this time come in and he was sent to bring baxter  he was gone but a few minutes when he came back in high excitement  baxter has broken out of the guardroom he exclaimed  i cannot find him anywhere  did you look in the dormitory  yes sir and his valise is gone and his trunk is empty of all of value  humph captain putnams brow contracted  this looks very suspicious  at that moment one of the smaller cadets came in with a note in his hand  i just met baxter running down the road exclaimed the little fellow  he gave me this for you captain putnam  at once the proprietor of the hall tore open the communication and read it half aloud  goodby to putnam hall forever  it is full of fellows who are no good and run by a man i never liked  no use of following me for i am going to join my father and i dont mean to come back  dan baxter  p stell the rover boys i shant forget them and some day i shall take pains to square accounts                    d b  the foolish boy was the captains comment  but perhaps he has done what is best for it might have been necessary to dismiss him  for a long while those at the hall wondered how baxter had escaped  only mumps knew and he kept the secret to himself  a duplicate key to the door of the guardroom had done the trick  as baxter was not followed nothing more was spoken of him for the time being and after several days the cadets settled down to their regular work as though nothing out of the ordinary had occurred  a hunt was instituted by dick for arnold baxter and buddy the thief but no trace of the pair came to light  the christmas holidays were now at hand and the closing days at putnam hall were given over to several entertainments  one of these consisted of a stage performance of a play called a christmas in a tenement given by twelve of the boys  three of the lads including tom took female parts and the audience laughed itself sore over the antics that were cut up  many living in the vicinity came to the entertainment including all of the lanings and also dora stanhope and her mother who was now almost as well as ever  it was fine said nellie laning to tom  but oh tom what a girl you did make  wouldnt you like me for a sister queried tom  a sister  oh dear cried nellie and began to laugh again  you looked like a female giraffe put in grace laning  sam acted a little boy splendidly  sam dont you want a stick of candy  yes mammy please squeaked sam just as he had on the stage and another laugh went around  in the meantime dick had drawn dora to one side  what is the news he asked anxiously  nothing new sighed dora  josiah crabtree has gone to boston on business  i am afraid i cannot keep that marriage off much longer  he seems bound to marry mother and even if she feels like drawing back she hasnt the courage to tell him so  its a shame murmured dick  well remember what i said dora if i can ever help you i will  and he squeezed her hand  before they separated he gave her a silk handkerchief he had purchased at cedarville one with her initial in the corner and she blushingly handed over a scarf made by herself  dick was very proud of that scarf although tom and sam teased him about it unmercifully  of course the boys had received letters from their uncle and aunt regularly yet they watched eagerly for the hour that should bring them within sight of the farm with its wellknown buildings  the journey to oak run proved uneventful and here jack the hired man met them with the carriage  glad to see you lads he saidwith a grin  seems quite natural like  so it does jack cried tom  let em out for we want to get home  the snow was falling and by the time the farmhouse was reached it was several inches deep  were in for a sleigh ride before we go back said sam  their uncle and aunt stood at the door to receive them  welcome home  merry christmas came from both and each of the boys gave a warm handshake to randolph rover and hearty kiss to their aunt martha  past troubles were all forgotten  this was christmas eve and the boys stayed up late cracking nuts by the blazing log fire and having a good time generally  in the morning dick was the first one awake  for gracious sake he ejaculated staring at the chimney piece there hung his own stocking and also one each belonging to tom and sam  each was filled with goodies such as he knew only his aunt martha could make  sam and dick wake up weve struck a bonanza he cried and hauled both from under the covers  all laughed heartily and marched down to the dining room with the stockings over their shoulders  a merry christmas to uncle randolph from all of us said tom handing over a much coveted volume on agriculture  and a merry christmas to aunt martha from three bad boys added sam and turned over a fancy workbasket both presents having been purchased at ithaca on the journey home  ha  just what i desired said randolph rover adjusting his spectacles  i am very much obliged boysi am indeed  such a pretty basket murmured mrs rover  it was very good of you and she hugged each lad in his turn  then came more presentsneckties collars and gloves for the boys besides a book for each written by a favorite juvenile writer  the snow is two feet deep said dick after an inspection when breakfast had come to an end  were booked for the house today  well wait until afternoon said mr rover  it was a happy time even if they were snowed in  soon the warm sun came out and brought the snow down a little  best kind of sleighing now said the hired man and drove around the biggest sleigh on the place  all tumbled in and the party did not return until after midnight     chapter xxi  something about the past   during holiday week the boys took occasion to tell their uncle all of the particulars concerning the tramp called buddy arnold baxter and his son the bully  it is needless to state that randolph rover listened to their story with interest  i would like to meet this man with a scar on his chin he said speaking of him reminds me of something that happened years ago  what was it uncle randolph questioned tom  your father had an enemy who had a scar on his chin  what cried sam  could it have been this arnold baxter  hardly although such a thing is possible  this man was a westerner and laid claim to some property owned by your father they had a quarrel and the fellow shot your father in the arm and then ran away  i never learned any of the particulars  arnold baxter and this buddy spoke about a mining claim and about some papers burst out tom  id like to wager he is the same chap  if he is you want to beware of him responded randolph rover gravely  he is your fathers deadliest enemy  ill remember that said dick and his brothers nodded  the matter was talked over for several hours but brought little satisfaction  on new years day came another fall of snow and the lads spent the afternoon in a regular snowballing match among themselves and with the hired man  poor jack caught it on all sides and after quarter of an hours bombardment was glad enough to run to the barn for shelter  but its great sport he grinned as he almost stood on his head trying to get from the back of his neck a soft snowball which tom had planted there  the following day they started back for putnam hall and on the way met larry frank fred and a number of others  when ithaca was reached a surprise awaited the crowd  the weather was so cold that the ice impeded transportation and the golden star was not making her usual trips to cedarville and other points  heres a state of things cried tom  whats to dowalk to putnam hall  well hardly seeing that it is a good number of miles and the weather is bitterly cold  well if we cant walk and cant ride how are we to get there came from sam  thats the conundrum brudder bones laughed larry imitating a negro minstrel  ise gib it up sah  its no laughing matter said dick  we might stay in ithaca over night but traveling may be no better in the morning  let us send a telegram to captain putnam for instructions suggested fred and soon the following message was prepared and sent to the hall by way of cedarville  six of us are held up at ithaca by the cold  how shall we come on  this message was forwarded without delay and while awaiting an answer dick and his brothers took a walk through the town  they were passing down the main street when sam uttered a short cry  hullo there is josiah crabtree  where questioned dick with deep interest  across the way  he has just entered the jewelry store on the corner  say perhaps hes buying a wedding ring blurted out tom before he stopped to think  tom that matter is no joke came from dick as his face grew red  i sincerely hope for dora stanhopes sake that he never marries doras mother  oh so do i answered tom readily  why he isnt fit to be stepfather to a dog  let us look into the window and see what he is doing suggested dick uneasily for he could not get it out of his head but that his brothers guess might be correct  the window was broad and clear and they looked through it into the shop with ease  josiah crabtree stood at the counter talking to a clerk who presently brought forth a tray of plain rings  it is a wedding ring as sure as you are born cried tom  im going in said dick in a low tone  wait for me here and he entered the establishment  there were counters an both sides and he walked to a position directly opposite to that occupied by the exschoolmaster  i wish to see some cheap scarf pins he said to the clerk who came to wait on him and the man hurried off to bring on the articles mentioned  and is this the latest style of wedding ring dick heard josiah crabtree say in a low voice  yes sir the very latestand very tasty answered the clerk who was waiting on him  i wish two one for the lady and one forahemmyself  yes sirquite the style now for a gentleman to have a ring want them engraved of course  yes  here is a paper with the sizes and what is to be engraved upon each  how much will they be with the engraving  six dollars each sir  six dollars  dont you make a reduction on taking two asked crabtree who was a good deal of a miser  we can throw off a dollar on the pair answered the clerk after consulting the proprietor of the shop  i didnt expect to pay over ten dollars  we can give you this style for ten dollars  no i want the latestto please the lady  humph muttered dick  youll never please mrs stanhope with any ring  eleven dollars is the lowest we can take  and when will the rings be ready for me  day after tomorrow  we might do them quicker but we have a great deal of engraving ahead  day after tomorrow will do for i do not wish them until next week answered josiah  here is my card  i am stopping at the american house in this city  yes sir  do you want the rings sent  no i will call for them concluded the exteacher and hurried from the place  sam and tom saw him coming and dodged out of sight around the corner  dick had taken in all that was said and had in the meantime picked out a cheap scarf pin which cost but ten cents  as soon as crabtree was gone he paid for the pin shoved it into his pocket and rejoined his brothers to whom he told the particulars of what had occurred  he intends to marry mrs stanhope next week he declared bitterly  i would give almost all im worth to stop that wedding  gracious but you do think a heap of dora said tom slyly well i dont blame you  she is a splendid girleh sam  thats right answered sam  but dick why not put up a job on old crabtree  what kind of a job  find out just when he wants to get married and then send him a letter from yale or some other college requesting him to come on at once if he wants a certain position  that will cause another delay and maybe mrs stanhope will get sick of him  oh if only we could do something like that cried his elder brother quickly i wish i could send him away out west  well manage it somehow put in tom  sam what wonderful ideas you have for your years  oh i take after my big brothers answered the youngest rover modestly  late in the evening a telegram was received from captain putnam  remain in ithaca over night at the american house  will send word how to get here in the morning  the american house ejaculated dick  that is where old crabtree is stopping  if only we can have some fun with the old chap sighed tom  the six boys marched to the hotel in a body told their story and showed the telegram to the clerk  all right said the clerk  weve had cadets stop here before i have a big room on the second floor with two large beds in it will that do  that suits me said larry  is mr josiah crabtree stopping here questioned tom  yes  he has the room next to the one i mentionedhis is no 13 and yours will be no 14  all right thanks answered tom dryly and immediately began to lay plans for playing a joke on the old teacher  we dont want to let mr crabtree know we are stopping here he said to the clerk later on  he is no longer a teacher at the hall and we would rather not meet  shall i put you in another room  oh no only dont tell him we are here  ill remember that sir  as soon as the boys had been shown to the big room tom turned to his fellows  i want each of you to chip in ten cents he said  what for came in a chorus  for the purpose of getting square with old crabby  i dont see the connection said larry  kindly be a little more definite  youll see or hear the connection a little later on answered tom  quick shell out and ill promise you your moneys worth or return the amount with legal interest  the fifty cents was quickly collected and adding ten cents of his own tom ran from the hotel  no fish market open at this time of night he said to himself  ill have to try a restaurant and hurried into the first place which came into sight  have you any crabs he asked of the waiter who came to him  yes sah very fine sah  want some softshell sah  i dont care whether they are softshell or as hard as rocks  i want live crabs the most active kind you have in stock  the waiter stared in amazement then called the owner of the restaurant  you want live crabs  i dostrong active goahead crabs and i want them in a box  is this a joke  it will bewhen the crabs get to work answered tom with a wink  oh i understand laughed the restaurant keeper  how many  what are they worth  good nippers are worth ten cents apiece  give me six and mind you put them in a strong box for me  five minutes later tom left the restaurant with the live crabs tucked safely away in a shoe box under his overcoat     chapter xxii  fun at the hotel   it was no easy matter for tom to get into the room josiah crabtree was occupying but after trying a good number of keys fished up here there and everywhere one was at last found that fitted the lock  striking a match tom entered the room quickly drew back the sheet of the bed dumped in the crabs and then pulled the sheet up to its original place  hes coming whispered sam who stood guard at the door  hide tom and then he ran back to the big room adjoining  finding he could not escape tom threw the box under the bed and rushed to a closet in the corner  here he crouched down behind a large trunk left in the place on storage  he had scarcely secreted himself when josiah crabtree came in  he had shoved his key in the lock but had failed to notice that the lockbolt was already turned back  oh what a cold night muttered the exschool teacher as he lit the gas  a warm bed will feel fine  i reckon it will be warm enough thought tom  as the room was scantily heated crabtree lost no time in disrobing  having donned a long night robe he turned off the gas flung the sheets back and leaped into bed  exactly ten seconds of silence followed  then came a yell calculated to raise the dead  whow  whats this  oh  whats got me by the legs  oh oh oh im being eaten up alive  let go there  oh dear  and with additional yells josiah crabtree leaped straight out of bed one crab hanging to his left knee several on his feet and one which he had caught hold of clinging to the back of his hand at once he began to do an indian wardance around the apartment knocking the furniture right and left  let go there what on earth can they be oh my toe is half offi know it is let go and then he struggled toward the gas jet but before he could light it tom had slipped out of the apartment closing the door behind him the banging of furniture continued and then came a crash as the washstand went over carrying with it a bowl a soap tray and a large pitcher filled with water the icy water gushed over crabtrees feet making him shiver with the cold but the crabs were undaunted and only clung the closer  the noise soon aroused the entire hotel and the clerk several bellboys and finally the proprietor rushed to the scene  the door was flung wide open  have you been drinking sir  how dare you disturb the hotel in this fashion demanded the proprietor  the crabs  take them off yelled crabtree continuing to dance around  crabs  what made you bring crabs up here  iioh my toes  take them off shrieked josiah crabtree and kicked out right and left  one of the crabs was flung off to land in the hotel proprietors face and to catch the man by the nose  my nose  he will bite it off cried the hotel man  kill the thing gillettsmash it with aaanything  and gillett the clerk tried to do so while the hotel man and crabtree continued to dance around in the wildest kind of fury safe in their own room the boys laughed until they cried  all had gone to bed and tom lost no time in getting under the covers  somebody has played a trick began crabtree when an extra nip on his knee cut him short  oh my i shall die he moaned  i know i shall die  by this time the proprietor of the hotel had freed himself from the crab that had nipped him on the nose  you wont die but youll get out of this hotel he snarled  throw the crabs out of the window he continued to his employees and after a good deal of trouble one crab after another was hurled forth the window being kept open in the meantime and the icy draught causing crabtree to shiver as with the ague  as there seemed no help for it the exteacher began to dress again with all possible speed  if i find out who did this illill kill him moaned josiah crabtree ive been nipped is a hundred places  youll leave this hotel said the proprietor  ive had enough of you  first the room didnt suit then the price was too high and at dinner and supper you found all manner of fault with the menu  youll go and the quicker the better  but look here began crabtree  i wont argue with you  either get out or ill have you arrested as a disorderly character  yes but  not a word  will you go quietly or shall i have you put out  illill go gasped josiah crabtree and five minutes later he was on the cold street satchel in hand and saying all manner of unpleasant things under his breath  oh tom laughed sam and could go no further  each of the boys had felt like exploding a dozen times  it was not until an hour after that any of them managed to get to sleep  when they came down in the morning the hotel clerk winked at them im not saying a word he whispered  but it served the old crank right  even the boss is doing a little smiling although he got quite a nip himself  really i dont know what you are talking about answered tom then he shut up one eye stuck his tongue into his cheek and strolled into the dining room  hes an outandout boy he is murmured the clerk gazing after him  breakfast was finished and the cadets were strolling around the hotel awaiting further instructions from captain putnam when a man drove up to the door in a big liverystable sleigh  i am after some boys bound for putnam hall he said  captain putnam telegraphed to the boss to bring em up to the hall in this sleigh  hurrah shouted sam  such a long ride will just suit me  if it doesnt prove too cold was dicks comment  there was but one seat in the turnout the back being filled with straw and robes  take your lunch with you said the driver for its a long trip we have before us and i reckon a part of the road aint none too good  the clerk of the hotel was consulted and soon a big lunchbox was packed containing sandwiches cake and a stone jug of hot coffee  this was stowed away in the straw and the lads piled in laughing merrily over the prospect before them  off we go shouted larry and with a crack of the whip the sleigh started  it was drawn by a heavy pair of horses who looked well able to get through any snowdrift that might present itself  ithaca was soon left behind and they sped swiftly along a road running northward a half mile more from the west shore of the lake  the road was level and somewhat worn by travel and for the first three miles good time was made  if we can continue this gait well reach putnam hall by three or four oclock this afternoon allowing an hours rest at noon said the driver in reply to a question put by frank  but we have still a number of small hills to climb and its not going to stay as clear as it was early this morning  the latter remark was caused by the sun disappearing under heavy clouds  soon it began to snow at first lightly and then heavier and heavier  were going to catch it said tom after the noon stop had been taken at a wayside hotel where they had taken dinner keeping the boxed lunch for later on  the snow is four inches deeper than it was  on they went again the snow becoming so thick at last that they could scarcely see a yard before them  it was very cold and the cadets were glad enough to huddle in the straw with the robes over them leaving the driver to pick his way as best he could  an hour had gone by and they were wondering if they were anywhere near cedarville when a wild shout rang out and the next instant came a crash as their sleigh collided with another coming from the opposite direction  a runner of each turnout was smashed and the occupants of the other sleigh came tumbling in upon the lads in great confusion  great caesar whats this groaned tom as he shifted a weight from his shoulders and then he stared in amazement as he found himself confronted by nellie laning  tom rover burst from the girls lips soon as she could recover her breath did you ever  well hardly murmured tom as he helped her to a sitting position  youre coming in on us fast  whats the trouble  oh and there is grace and your father  the sleighs ran into each other answered nellie  can you stop the horses father she called out  yes but the sleigh is a goner answered mr laning and then some sharp words passed between himself and the liverystable driver  there was no doubt however but that the blinding storm was largely responsible for the accident  an examination proved that both sleighs would have to be abandoned and then the two parties sought shelter at a nearby farmhouse while mr laning went off on one horse and the liverystable driver on another each to borrow a sleigh elsewhere  this left the boys in the company of the girls for over an hour and during that time dick tom and sam asked a great many questions especially about mrs stanhope and dora  yes the marriage is to come off next week thursday unless something prevents it said nellie  dora is fairly sick over the prospect  what aunt lucy can see in mr crabtree is more than any of us can understand  he must have hypnotized her observed dick  its a shame  i wish old crabtree was in jericho  so do all of us laughed grace and then sam took her off for a quiet chat while tom monopolized nellie  those rover boys think a great deal of the lanings and stanhopes observed larry to fred  well its all rightthey are awfully nice girls every one of em     chapter xxiii  balloting for a second lieutenant   back to putnam hall at last  how homelike the place looks sam uttered the words as he leaped from the sleigh and ran for the main entrance where captain putnam stood to receive them  he had heard of the accident and was fearful that one or another of his pupils might have been hurt  thank providence that no one was killed or seriously injured he observed as he wrung each by the hand  welcome lads and i trust you have all had happy holidays  the same to you captain putnam cried one after another and then they passed in to be greeted by george strong and the new assistant  cadets kept coming back for three days on the following monday the regular school opened to end in july soon the boys were as deep in their studies as ever before  in the meantime dick had concocted a scheme for sending josiah crabtree on a goose chase to chicago  tom had a friend in that city and he was requested to mail without delay a certain letter which tom enclosed with his own  this letter was composed by dick it was written on a large letterhead upon which dick printed the advertisement of the midwest national college incorporated doing the work on a small printing press used by some of the boys in getting out a school monthly to make the letter even more imposing dick printed the body of it on a typewriter which was used by one of the classes taking a business course the letter ran as follows  josiah crabtree a m cedarville n y  chicaoo january 1 189  dear sir you have been recommended to us by a new york scholastic employment agency as a firstclass teacher in mathematics history and other branches  we are in immediate need at the opening of this term of such a teacher and will pay two thousand dollars per year  will you come on at once at our expense with a view to closing with us  our institution is a new one but we already have eighty pupils of the best families of the middle west and are certain to have fifty more before the end of the year  we understand that you are a bachelor which state just suits our wants  kindly wire us and come on before thursday the 10th if possible  the two thousand per year is of course exclusive of board and suite of rooms which we provide for all of our instructors  yours truly  andrew n bluff lld president  if that doesnt make old crabtree hustle then i miss my guess said tom after reading the communication  he loves money too well to let that two thousand slidemarriage or no marriage even if he wants to wed hell go west to try and fix it up to hold the position anyway  the letter was posted to the friend in chicago that very night on the letter to josiah crabtree was placed an address in cedarville which was certain to catch him  on the following day captain putnam announced an election for second lieutenant of company a  lieutenant darman will not be here any longer as his family have moved to england he said i trust you elect the best cadet possible to the office  the election takes place next wednesday at noon  at once a lively discussion took place there were half a dozen pupils who wanted the position and among them were dick fred and mumps  i ought to have that place said mumps and on the quiet he started to buy up votes where he could not influence them in any other way  this move succeeded among the smaller lads but the big boys turned from him with scorn  it must be confessed that dick was exceedingly anxious when the time for balloting arrived  would he succeed or fail  just before dinner captain putnam brought out a square box into which ballots might be cast  the cadets will stand up in a row to be counted he said major conners will you will kindly count your command  eightyseven including myself announced the youthful major after he had gone down the line and back with care  are any cadets absent  no sir  very well then we will proceed to vote by having each cadet come up and cast a slip of paper with his favorites name on it in the box  the line will march in single file one pace from man to man  forward  the captain stood by the ballot box and up came the file major conners first and captain blossom following  in a few minutes all of the eightyseven ballots were in the box and then began the sorting out  i will now read the result of the first ballot announced captain putnam holding up a paper with the figures and amid a dead silence he began      whole number of votes cast  87     necessary to a choice       44     fred garrison has           32     richard rover has            8     george granbury has         15     john fenwick has            12  consequently nobody is elected  another vote will be taken immediately after dinner and then the companies were reformed and marched into the mess hall  fred garrison is ahead came in a whisper from every side good for you fred  mumps only got a dozen votes came from one of the little boys he wont get my vote next time  nor mine chimed in his chum  dont worry dick whispered tom  the final result isnt reached yet somebody has got to drop out first  the dinner finished the boys gathered in knots to talk the question over  soon the line was reformed for a second ballot  at that moment fred garrison stepped forward  fellow students he cried  one word before you vote  i wish to withdraw from the contest doing so in favor of two of my friends dick rover and george granbury  i thank those who voted for me before from the bottom of my heart  hurrah for fred came from a score of throats and a cheer rent the air  we wont forget you next time old man  soon the second ballot was cast and amid another silence captain putnam read it off      number of votes cast   87     necessary to a choice  44     john fenwick has        7     george granbury has    23     richard rover has      57  richard rover is declared elected second lieutenant of company a for the balance of this term  a cheer broke forth and many of the cadets came up to shake dick by the hand  among the number were fred and george granbury you beat me fairly rover said granbury a wholesouled fellow i am satisfiedso longas such a cad as mumps doesnt get an office  mumps was badly left put in tom  see he is sneaking off to his room  i rather guess he wishes he hadnt run  i thank you all very much said dick his face glowing  i shall try to do my best as second lieutenant  three cheers for all of the cadets of putnam hall  and the cheers broke forth with renewed vigor  dick you must do the square thing tonight said frank some time later  what do you mean asked the elder rover  when a fellow is elected to an office he is supposed to treat his friends  all of the cadets will be sneaking up to your dormitory some time between ten and twelve oclock tonight  indeed dick mused for a moment  all rightill be ready for them frank but mum is the word  you will treat  ill treat every cadet who shows himself and doesnt make any noise  good for you  then i can spread the word that it is all right  yesbut frank  well  beware of mumps  if he heard of what is going on i think he would try to spoil our game  ill be careful answered frank and hurried off in one direction while dick hurried off in another  both had scarcely disappeared than mumps came forth from behind a hall rack which stood close at hand  how lucky to overhear their talk said the sneak  will i spoil their game  well just wait and see thats all     chapter xxiv  preparing for a midnight feast   dick was in a quandary as to how he was to treat all of his friends and called sam and tom to him for consultation  ive got a dollar and a quarter said sam you can use that and welcome  and here is a dollar and ten added tom passing over the amount in ten cent pieces and nickels  havent you any money of your own  i have two dollars and thirty cents answered dick  that makes four dollars and sixtyfive cents said tom summing up  thats enough for a pretty fair blowout  so it is tom but where is the stuff to come from  mrs green wont sell it to me  thats true  and she has her pantries all locked up  oh pshaw  you dont want to treat the boys on school stuff said sam  get em something from cedarvillesome bottled soda candies nuts and things like that  thats the talk dick  let us sneak out after dark and go to cedarville cried tom  that would just suit me  ill think it over answered his big brother slowly  after supper found most of the cadets indoors for the night promised to be cold  about half of the boys remained in the library while the others betook themselves to their rooms  well queried tom as he approached dick on the stairs  im ready tom answered his brother  but be careful or well be spotted  like a pair of ghosts they glided up the front stairs along the broad hallway and down the stairs in the rear  the door was unlocked and they passed into the yard  let us take peleg snuggers into our confidence whispered tom for a quarter i am certain hell let us have one of the captains nags  you can test him if you wish answered dick who was doubtful  peleg snuggers was found in the harness room shining up some buckles by the aid of a stable lantern  hullo pelegworking rather late was toms greeting  yes sirgot behind answered the utility man  what brought you here  i want a horse peleg  which one can i have  a horse  did the captain send you  instead of replying tom held out a silver quarter  dont ask questions peleg but just let me take a horse for an hour or two thats a good man  cant do it master roveragainst orders sir  oh yes you can  we wont hurt the beast  we are bound to get to cedarville and back before ten oclock  do you want us to drop on the road from exhaustion and be frozen to death and tom put the question in all seriousness  no no certainly not  then bring out a horse  that black will do  here take the quarter peleg and much obliged to you  hurry up  was there ever such a boy grumbled the man but nevertheless he arose and got the black horse ready for them hooking the animal to a small cutter  remember if the captain learns of this i dont know nothing about it he called out as the two boys drove off by a back way out of sight of the main building of the institution  peleg is all right if you know how to handle him said tom as he took the reins from dick  ill let him out a bit and well drive to cedarville in a jiffy  tom youre getting more cheeky every day was dicks comment yet he was far from displeased over what his brother had accomplished  away went the cutter the roads being now in an excellent condition  soon putnam hall was left far behind and they came within sight of the stanhope homestead  id like to stop for just a minute said dick but tom shook his head  we want to get to cedarville before the shops close said the younger brother  we can stop on the way backif we have time and they continued on their way  both knew cedarville like a book as tom expressed it having been there so many times before  they drove straight to the largest confectionery in the village  a pound of chocolates a pound of marshmallows a pound of iced fruits and five pounds of best mixed candies said dick and the articles were quickly put up for him  how much  a dollar and thirty cents please  the bill was paid and they hurried to another store where they purchased two dozen bottles of soda water a dozen bottles of root beer and five pounds of mixed nuts  tom wanted to buy some cigarettes for such of the cadets as might wish to smoke but dick shook his head at this  no thats going too far he said  well have a respectable spread and thats enough  inside of half an hour they had started on the return the various articles purchased stowed safely away in the back of the cutter  well have at least fifteen minutes to spare said dick and waited as patiently as possible until the stanhope homestead again appeared  as soon as they gained the entrance to the garden dick hopped out ran up the path to the porch and rang the bell  dora stanhope answered his summons  oh dick is that you she cried  come in  i cant stay but a few minutes dora he answered as he entered the hall  i must get back to the academy  i thought i would just stop to see how you are getting on  oh everything is the same dick  i heard the marriage was to take place this week  yes  let me tell you something went on the boy and told her of the letter to be sent from chicago to josiah crabtree  oh i hope he gets it and goes exclaimed dora quickly and her face brightened a bit  send me word if he does said dick  he remained for ten minutes longer but what was said and done need not be mentioned here  when he left his heart was all aglow while dora was blushing deeply  best girl in the world he murmured  what an awfully nice young fellow was doras thought  hurry up cried tom from the sleigh when his big brother put in an appearance again  im most frozen stiff  and on went the cutter the horse feeling quite fresh after his rest  ill go ahead and see if the coast is clear said dick when they reached the vicinity of the stable and he leaped into the snow  it did not take long to walk to the barn  he was gone but a few minutes and came back on a run  we are in for it he cried  mr strong is down at the stable talking to peleg snuggers  great caesar  whats to do  get the stuff out of the sleigh first and hide it near the hall in the snow answered dick  be quick  his advice was followed tom carrying the soda water and root beer and dick the other things all were hidden in a snow bankdirectly under the dormitory window  this accomplished dick led the horse up to the back of the stable and unhitched him  he could hear george strong and the utility man talking less than twenty feet away  very well snuggers ill be back shortly he heard coming from the head assistant and strong walked from the stable toward the hall  in a twinkle dick ran around the stable corner  quick peleg here is the horse all unhooked  put him in his stall  the cutter is back there out of sight and as the hired man took possession of the animal the youth ran off to join his brother at the entrance to putnam hall  the door is locked groaned tom  something is wrong  without replying dick ran around to a spot under the dormitory window  making a soft snowball he threw it against the glass and followed this by several others  presently the window was thrown up and sam fred and larry showed their heads  say you fellows help us up cried dick softly  there is a wash line in the closetthe one my aunt martha insisted on tying around my trunk when we came here last summer  there was a scramble in the room and presently the end of the line was thrown out  it was new and strong and quite capable of supporting either of the lads weight  you go first tom but be quick said dick softly and his brother caught hold and went up with ease bracing one foot after another against the rough stonework and projecting bricks  then the rope came down a second time and dick ascended  hardly were the boys in the room than there came a loud knocking on the door  its mr strong gasped sam  what shall we do now  it looks as if we were a caught     chapter xxv  mumps is taught a lesson   the cadets stared blankly at each other  only two of them were undressed the others had all of their clothing on  it was time for the head assistant to go the rounds to see that all was right for the night  should he be allowed to enter the dormitory he would certainly smell a mouse and perhaps knock all of their plans for a feast in the head  off with your clothing all of you whispered tom  ill manage this affair  pretend to be asleep  but tom its my fault began dick when his younger brother cut him short  into the bedill be all right dick  satisfied that tom had some plan in his head for smoothing matters over the other boys disrobed with marvelous rapidity and crept into their beds  while this was going on the knocking an the door continued  boys open the door said george strong  open the door do you hear  answer him whispered tom to larry whose bed was nearest him pretend you have just awoke and he flung himself on the floor with one of a pair of big rubber boots in each hand  ohermr strong is that you  yes open the door  whyeris it locked  yes  at once larry tumbled from his bed unlocked the door and stood there rubbing his eyes  excuse me sir for not hearing you before  i want to know what the meaning is of the noise in here said george strong severely as he gazed around the dimly lit apartment for the lamp was turned low  you boys aregracious me  whats this  the teacher started back in genuine surprise and his words aroused all of the boys in the beds who followed his gaze in equal wonder  for in the center of the floor sat tom his eyes tightly closed a rubber boot in each hand and rocking backward and forward with great rapidity as if rowing  two lengths ahead muttered tom ill beat you yet larry three lengths  oh but this is a dandy race  pull away you cant beat me  oh  there goes an oar and bang went one of the rubber boots against the base board and tom made a leap as if diving into the water after it sprawling and spluttering as he pretended to swim  hes got the nightmare again shouted out sam quick to understand toms dodge  tom wake up there  the nightmare echoed mr strong  is it possible  poor boy wake up thomas and he caught tom by the shoulder and shook him and finally set him on his feet  the oari will have the oh tom opened his eyes and stared around him blankly  whyerwhats up  my boy youve had the nightmare answered the teacher kindly  nightmare  i told you not to eat that pie tonight put in sam he saved his pie from dinner and ate it just before we came up herewhich was true  eri thought i was on the lake racing larry colby murmured tom and hid his face as if in embarrassment  what did i do he faltered  you almost raised the roof thats what you did answered dick you had better send home for some of those digestion tablets you used to take and then he hid his face in the blankets to keep from laughing out loud  i will  tom turned to george strong  excuse me mr strong i am sorry i have caused you so much trouble  how do you feel now questioned the assistant anxiously  oh im all right now  well then go to bed and i trust you sleep more soundly for the balance of the night said the teacher and he remained in the room until tom was tucked in when he went off taking the key of the door with him  tom youre a brick came from frank when the teacher was out of hearing  what a head you have on your shoulders  strong took the key of the door said fred  i dont like that  shove a chairback up under the knob suggested dick and this was done the chair thus making an excellent brace  now to get that stuff in said dick donning his clothing with all possible speed  i shouldnt wonder if the soda and root beer are frozen as hard as a rock  he was soon ready to descend and the others lowered him by aid of the wash line  then the boxes and packages were hoisted up and dick came after  a few minutes later came a slight tapping on the door repeated three times  it was a signal and sam opened the door admitting george granbury and seven other cadets from dormitory no 2  the occupants of several other dormitories followed  are we to have mumps and his crowd in here asked one of the newcomers  i dont want mumps answered dick  not because he ran against me but because he was baxters toady and is a regular sneak  little luke walton and mark gross voted for you dick said harry blossom  they ought to be invited  all right tell them to come in and anybody else who wishes outside of mumps answered dick  the young captain went off and soon returned with six boys of sams age or younger  mumps is awfully mad he announced  my idea is he is going to cause us trouble if he can  well wax him good if he does cried tom say sam let us watch him and he hurried into the hallway while the others attacked the several good things dick had provided for them  tom and sam had been in the dark hallway but two minutes when the door of mumps dormitory opened and the sneak came out wearing his slippers and his long overcoat  he glided swiftly toward the side stairs leading to captain putnams private apartments  hes going to peach whispered tom  come on sam let us capture the enemy and he hurried after mumps and caught him by the arm  hi who is this demanded the sneak turning in fear  then as tom and sam confronted him his face grew white  come with us mumps we want to treat you answered tom readily into whose head another trick had entered  i dont want any of your treat growled the sneak  let me go  oh you must come urged tom  we have a fine bottle of root beer and a lot of candied fruit for you  if there was one thing that mumps liked it was root beer while he knew candied fruit was very rich eating  accordingly he hesitated  ill get all i can first and tell on them afterward he thought and allowed tom and sam to conduct him into the dormitory occupied by the metropolitan sextet  here is mumps come to join us cried tom as he introduced the sneak into the room and he winked at dick  now mumps sit down and make yourself at home and ill get something for you and he motioned the sneak to a position at the head of his bed  he hurried off and presently came back to mumps with a fine slice of candied orange  the sneak was greedy and instantly transferred the entire slice to his mouth and began to chew it vigorously  oh he cried presently and drew down his face in disgust  whats the matter mumps asked sam  this orange tastes like kerosene spluttered mumps and rushed to the window as he put out his head tom pointed to the sneak and then to the lamp at which he had flavored the candied fruit well get square just wait he whispered  you gave me that piece on purpose howled the sneak as soon as he had cleared his mouth  oh what an awful dose  somebody give me a drink of water  the water is all gone mumps answered tom  awfully sorry have a glass of root beer and he poured out a tumbler full  willing to drink anything to take that taste out of his mouth the sneak took the tumbler and gulped down about half of the root beer  the remainder was about to follow when suddenly he stopped short oh my  awfully good isnt it put in dick  good  it tastes like salt water snorted mumps  and he was not far wrong for tom had taken the pains to put a lot of salt in to the glass before filling it up  why that is the best root beer i ever tasted put in larry its as sweet as sugar  let me taste your glass mumps  do so with pleasure and the sneak passed it over  larry pretended to take a gulp  fine  couldnt be better  isnt that so frank and he passed the glass to harrington  its certainly as good as mine and thats o k answered frank and then george granbury took the tumbler and declared the root beer was even better than what he had had previously  its certainly your stomach mumps my boy said tom  you look kind of funnyjust like a fellow i knew who got the smallpox  he does look like a fellow getting the smallpox put in dick mumps does your tongue feel drylike  dry of course it is dryand salty growled mumps but he began to grow uneasy  let me see your tongue put in sam who happened to have a blue pencil in his pocket  as he spoke he broke off some of the blue point and crumbled it in his fingers  my tongue is all right answered mumps  nevertheless he held it out and sam slyly dropped the bluing on it  its as blue as indigo he exclaimed look into the glass for yourself  somewhat against his will mumps strode over to the looking glass as he noted the condition of his tongue he grew very pale and began to tremble  it is blue he whined andandi feel sick all over  oh say do you think i really am getting the smallpox  for an instant there was a dead silence  then the boys could hold in no longer and a long but smothered laugh showed the sneak how completely he had been sold     chapter xxvi  a lively game of baseball   if ever a boy was mad clear through that boy was the sneak of putnam hall  as the laugh ended mumps shook his fist at one and another of his tormentors  think you are smart dont you he spluttered in his rage ill fix you all  ill go and tell captain putnam all about this spread and then maybe you wont catch it  mumps keep quiet said dick placing himself between the enraged one and the door  make too much noise and ill promise you the worst drubbing you ever received  if you peach on me ill give you a second whipping added tom  this is a gentlemanly affair put in larry  the boy who gives us away gets a thrashing from me  ditto myself said frank and several others said the same  all looked so determined that mumps fell back in alarm  you let me go he whined  i dont want to stay here any longer  you cant go until you promise to keep quiet said dick  and youll promise right now cried tom seizing a pitcher of ice water that had been hidden under one of the stands  leaping on a bed he held the pitcher over mumps head  promise quick or ill let her go he went on  oh dont yelled mumps as a few drops of the water landed on his head and ran down his neck  do you promise to keep silent demanded dick  yes yes  all right  now mind if you break that promise you are in for at least ten good whippings  somebody else may give you away said mumps craftily  no one will  if captain putnam hears about this it will be only through you  so beware mumps if you value your hide  and then the sneak was allowed to go  five minutes later the spread came to an end the muss was cleared away and every cadet sought his couch to rest if not to sleep  it is possible that captain putnam and george strong suspected something yet as the cadets seemed none the worse for the festivities the next day nothing was said on the subject  boys will be boys smiled the captain to his head assistant and there the whole matter dropped  several days later while some of the cadets were down at the cove clearing off a portion of the ice for skating mrs stanhopes manofallwork came over with a note for dick from dora  the rover boys all read the note with deep interest  i have good news so ran the communication  mr crabtree has gone to chicago and the marriage has been postponed until next summer  you do not know how glad i am  of course there will be trouble when mr crabtree learns how he has been fooled but mother has promised me to remain single until august or september and i know she will keep that promise  i thank all of you very much for what you have done  yesterday i saw dan baxter who seems to be hanging around this neighborhood a good deal  he wanted to speak to me but i did not give him the chance  i wish he would go away for he looks to me like a very evilminded person  it is strange but mr crabtree thinks a good deal of him and has told my mother so  he says it is nonsense to put mr baxter down as a criminal  baxter stopping around here mused dick  what can he be up to  he had better clear out said sam the matter was discussed for some time but nothing came of it  skating lasted for nearly a month and then both the ice and the snow melted away as if by magic  soon spring was at hand and the early flowers began to show themselves in mrs greens little garden which was the housekeepers one pride  dick had seen dora once in that time  the girl had told him about how josiah crabtree had searched in vain for the college mentioned in the bogus letter  he said i played the trick were doras words  he wants mother to send me to some strict boarding school  and are you going had been dicks question  no i shall remain with mother  after she is married again i do not know what will become of me and as doras eyes filled with tears dick caught her hand  dont worry dora had been his words  i will help you and it is bound to come up right in the end  as soon as summer was at hand the putnam hall baseball club received a challenge from the pornell club to play them a game at either school grounds  they want to square accounts for the football defeat said fred well the only thing to do is to accept the challenge and the acceptance was sent without delay the game to be played on the putnam hall grounds captain putnam having promised the cadets his aid in building a grandstand  the lumber came out of a boathouse that had been torn down to make place for a new structure and as many of the cadets took to carpentering naturally the grandstand was quite a creditable affair  frank harrington was captain and catcher for the putnam hall team tom was pitcher while larry played first base dick second and sam was down in center to use those nimble legs of his should occasion require  fred was shortstop and the balance of the club was made up of the best players the school afforded  the saturday chosen for the game was an ideal one clear and not too warm  the students from pornell arrived early and so did the other visitors and by two oclock the grounds were crowded  as before a parade was had  then the umpire came out and gave each team fifteen minutes for practice  were in luck said dick when putnam hall won the toss and took last innings in a moment more they were in the field and the ump called out play  as was natural pornell had put its heaviest batters at the head of their list and it is possible tom was a bit nervous as he twirled the ball and sent it in toward the home plate  ball one came the decision and again the sphere came in ball two said the umpire  take it easy tom called out dick  lots of time remember  the next was a strike  then came a foul and then a hard drive to left field and amid a wild cheering the pornell batsman gained second base in safety  thats the way to do it cornwall  keep it up snader  the second player now came up and again the ball came in  tom was as nervous as before and another hit was made and the player covered first while the man on second went to third  tom do be careful whispered frank walking down to him dont let that fellow in and he nodded in the direction of the first runner  the third player was now at the bat  two balls and two strikes were counted against him and then came a foul high up in the air which frank caught with ease  one out and two on base  thats not so bad  again the ball came in  one strike said the umpire  i want a high ball growled the batter  again the ball was delivered two strikes  then the  ball came in again  three strikes batter out  and tom got a rousing cheer for striking out the pornellite  but the two men were still on first and third with one more man to put out  take care whispered larry and the basemen all moved up closer one strike and then came a high fly far out in center field  run sam  dont miss that came in a yell  run run  and sam did run knowing that if he missed the ball the pornell team would score two runs if not three  it was going far down the field but he was after it and just as it came down he made a leap andclutched the sphere with his  left hand  he has it  hurrah  no runs this innings for pornell  and the putnamites howled themselves hoarse while their opponents had nothing to say  but the players from the rival academy had a fine battery and it was impossible to get onto their pitchers curves during that first innings  the players went out in one two three order leaving the score 0 to 0  its going to be a close game said an old player from cedarville  im not betting on either side  the second innings passed without any scoring being done  in the third innings the pornell team made two runs  in the next innings putnam hall pulled a single run out of the fire as dick put it for it was his tally made on a slide halfway from third base  after this there were more goose eggs until the end of the eighth inning when the score became a tie 2 to 2  one more inning for each side and the excitement became intense  we must prevent them from scoring by all means said frank as they took the field while the first batter of the pornellites came to the plate and amid a breathless silence the final innings began     chapter xxvii  off for the summer encampmemt   the present situation was enough to make any pitcher nervous and it must be confessed that tom could scarcely control himself  a wild pitch and its all up with our side he thought as he took his place in the box  one ball  that was the verdict as the sphere landed in franks hands  two balls came immediately after  frank paused then rolled the ball to tom  do be careful whispered dick  take your time  perhaps we had better put larry in the box suggested another player but tom shook his head determinedly  ill stick it out  one strike  the batter had tried but failed to hit the sphere tom felt more hopeful but immediately after came three balls and then four balls and amid a cheer from his friends the pornell player walked to first base  the second man at the bat went out on a foul and the cadets cheered this time then came a strong hit to left field and in came one run  hurrah  3 to 2 in pornells favor  youve got em on the run now boys keep it up  two balls and the next batter knocked a hot liner to fred  it came along like lightning but fred wore a doordie look and made a dive for itand held on although his hands stung as if scorched with fire  hurrah  two out  now for the third and then knock out that lead of one run  alas  this was easier said than done  the next player gained first and so did the youth to follow  then came a heavy hit and the score went up to 5 to 2 but that was the last of it so far as pornell was concerned  now putnam hall see what you can do  larry was at the bat and cautious about striking  one strike called the umpire as the boy let a good ball go by  another real strike followed and then larry caught the sphere fairly and squarely drove it far into left field and made a home run  a homer  wasnt that great  that makes the score 5 to 3  keep it up putnam hall  the home run was very encouraging and now dick came forward with his ashen stick  he had one strike called on him and then managed to make a clean onebase hit  another player named forwell took stand next  the pitcher for the pornell team was now as nervous as tom bad been and suddenly forwell was hit in the arm by the ball  dead ball cried the umpire  take your base and forwell went to first while larry marched to second  then sam came to the bat but his first strike was a foul caught by the third baseman  another out followed made by the captain much to his chagrin  the score now stood 5 to 3 with two players on base and two out  one more out and the match would come to an end unless the score was a tie  tom rover to the bat called the scorekeeper and tom marched to the plate  a strike and two balls and he made as clean a onebase hit as had his elder brother  three on base and two out came the cry  now pornell be careful  fred garrison was the next of the team to come forward  all eyes were centered upon fred  be careful oh be careful pleaded frank  dont get out as i did  one strike cried the umpire as the ball whizzed over the plate ball one came a moment later  strike two was immediately added  bang the ball had come on again and fred had hit it with all of the force at his command  it shot past second base and toward centerfield  run run yelled frank and the crowd joined in as dick started for home followed by forwell and tom  the center fielder fumbled the ball and the four runners came in one right on top of the other  putnam hall has won  say but wasnt that a great game  hurrah hurrah hurrah came from the cadets and their friends  it was a great time for the boys  they gave three cheers for their opponents but the pornellites felt their second defeat too keenly and as quickly as they could they left the grounds and quarter of an hour later were on their way home  after this contest matters moved along quietly until june  in the meantime the cadets studied up with all diligence for the examinations soon to take place all of our friends passed creditably dick standing second in his class tom fourth and sam third in their classes  captain putnam and george strong heartily approved of the showing made  that tom rover is full of fun was the captains comment but he knows how to study as well as how to play jokes  mumps was almost at the foot of his class  the sneak had hardly any friends left and he announced that he was going to leave putnam hall never to returnfor which no one was particularly sorry  immediately after the examinations it was announced that the entire school would march to a place called brierroot grove where they would go into their annual encampment for two weeks  at once all of the cadets were in a bustle and soon uniforms were brushed up buckles and buttons polished knapsacks packed and rifles oiled and cleaned  makes a fellow feel as if he was going off to the war observed sam  i dont know but what i would like to be a soldier some day  the battalion marched away one monday morning with flags flying drums beating loudly and the fifers blowing away upon yankee doodle with all of their might  the route was the lake road and many of the farmhouses passed were decorated in honor of the departure  as they passed the stanhope homestead dora and mrs stanhope came forth and waved their handkerchiefs and dick as second lieutenant of company a could not resist the temptation to wave his sword at them  the campingout spot was reached that afternoon at five oclock the provision wagon and that loaded with the tents had already come up and soon the cadets were putting up their tents while the cooking detail was preparing supper  the evening meal consisted of nothing but bread coffee and beef stew but never did plain fare taste better with such pure mountain air for sauce  its just boss said tom on the second day in camp  living in a tent suits me to death  the next day however he changed his tune for it rained in torrents and everybody got soaked to the skin  ugh said tom  i wasnt thinking of this when i said it suited me to death  all made the best of it and luckily the storm did not last over twentyfour hours when the sun came out warmly and that was the last of the rain while the encampment lasted  a week had passed by when one afternoon dick tom and sam received permission to visit the town of rootville a mile away they were not to be gone not over three hours and were to purchase some medicine needed by several cadets who had taken cold during the damp spell  the boys walked to rootville in high spirits and readily procured the drugs desired then they wandered around from place to place taking in the sights  there was a depot and as natural they drifted thither and into the waiting room  here almost the first persons they saw was arnold baxter and buddy the tramp thief  gracious burst from dicks lips and then he pulled tom and sam back  here is a chance at last to arrest that thief  thats so cried tom  wait i saw a policeman outside  ill call him and he darted off  while dick and sam awaited toms reappearance they noticed that baxter and buddy were holding a conversation of great interest  i will pay you well if you will help me in this deal arnold baxter was saying  ill do all i can answered buddy girk  but what of your son dan  dan is not to be depended upon answered arnold baxter  he robbed me of two hundred dollars and skipped out for chicago  humph murmured dick  here is certainly news of dan baxter that is very much to his discredit  i hope i and dora and the rest never hear of him again  some other folks now came into the depot and arnold baxter and buddy lowered their voices so that dick and sam could hear nothing further  soon tom arrived followed by the policeman who looked anxiously at the two men  you say they are thieves he asked of dick  the short man is  he stole my watch  what of the other  he is a bad man tooalthough it may be hard to prove it  at once the crowd approached the evil pair and the officer caught buddy girk by the arm i want you he said in a low firm voice  the thief turned swiftly and as he saw himself confronted by dick and the officer of the law his face fell  i aint done nothing he cried and tried to break away but the officer at once overpowered him and brought forth a pair of handcuffs  youll put these on he said grimly and spite his protestations buddy girk was handcuffed  hold on cried dick as arnold baxter started to run  he made a clutch for the man but baxter was too quick for him and slipped through the crowd and out of the depot  instantly dick made after him     chapter xxviii  the recovery of the watchconclusion   arnold baxter hesitated but a moment on gaining the depot platform  a freight train was passing the station at a slow rate of speed and running to an empty car which stood wide open he leaped on board  dick was close behind him and as the man boarded the freight car caught him by the leg  as dick held on like a bulldog there was nothing left for arnold baxter to do but to drag the youth up behind him  you imp he snarled as the two faced each other on the car floor  what do you mean by following me in this fashion  and what do you mean by running away in this fashion panted dick  i have a right to do as i please  and so have  you have no right to follow me  that remains to be seen arnold baxter  i would like to ask you a few questions  would you indeed sneered the tall man  yes  i wont waste words  were you and my father enemies years ago  at this direct question arnold baxter scowled darkly  yes if you are anxious to know he muttered  i fancied as much  you tried to swindle him out of some western mining property  the boot was on the other leghe tried to swindle meran off to africa with my papers i think or else left them somewhere where i cant find them  i do not believe you for my father was an honest man while you are the boon companion of a thief  have a care boyi wont stand everything snarled arnold baxter his eyes gleaning like those of an angry cat  i am not afraid of you arnold baxter  i shall hand you over to the police at our next stopping place  will you hissed the man and leaped at dick bearing him down to the car floor  at once his hand sought the lads throat  ive a good mind to choke the life out of you he went on  i hate you alleveryone who bears the name of rover  lelet up gasped dick growing purple in the face while his eyes bulged from their sockets  ill pitch you off was arnold baxters answer and suddenly he lifted dick up in his strong arms and stepped to the open doorway they were passing over a trestle spanning a wide gully at the bottom of which were bushes rocks and a tiny mountain stream  dont cried dick and snatched at the handle of the car door he had just clutched it when arnold baxter launched forth his body into space  the next instant and while baxter stood by the edge of the door the long train swung around a sharp curve  there was a quick jerk and with a yell of fright which sounded in dicks ears for days afterward arnold baxter slipped through the doorway and went tumbling head foremost down into the gully  dick shut his eyes at the sight and clung fast mechanically then as soon as he could recover he swung himself into the car he could not stand and sank like a lump of lead to the car floor unconscious  when he recovered several train hands surrounded him and his face was wet from the water they had poured over him  it was fully an hour before he could tell his story and then a handcar was sent back to the spot where arnold baxter had had his terrible fall  the rascal was found at the foot of the gully a leg and several ribs broken and otherwise bruised  he was carried to the handcar like one dead and later on transferred to a hospital at ithaca here it was announced that he might possibly recover although this was exceedingly doubtful  hes a bad one said tom when he heard dicks story  i would like to know what buddy girk has to say about him  buddy had been taken to the rootville jail and searched and a pawnticket for the stolen watch found in his vest pocket  the ticket was on a middletown pawnbroker and showed that fifteen dollars had been loaned on the timepiece buddy had more than this amount in his pocket and some time later the money was forwarded to the pawnbroker and then the precious watch and chain came back to dick in as good a condition as ever  i havent got nuthin to say said buddy when dick tried to make him talk  i didnt steal the watch and i didnt do nothin  you wont tell me anything about arnold baxter questioned dick  aint got nuthin to say repeated buddy who was planning to escape from jail that very night  and escape he did through a window the bars of which were bent and broken  the authorities searched for him for nearly a week but the search proved unavailing  i dont care particularly said dick in commenting on the affair i have my watch back and thats the main thing  but buddy ought to be punished  now if it was arnold baxter who had gotten awayafter that terrible falli wouldnt say a word answered tom  the encampment came to an end in a blaze of glory on the forth of july with firecrackers and fireworks galore  the cadets cut up like wild indians until after midnight and captain putnam gave them a free rein  independence day comes but once a year he said  and i would not give much for the boy who is not patriotic  you are right there captain returned george strong  our boys are true blue every one of them  out on the parade ground the cadets were singing loudly and marching at the same time  everyone was in the best of high spirits and it was a time never to be forgotten  here i must bring to a close for the present the story of the rover boys doings at putnam hall and elsewhere  we have seen how dick was robbed of his watch and how he recovered the timepiece how the boys joined the other cadets and what friends and enemies they made and we have likewise entered into many a sport and contest with them  with the termination of the encampment the school term came to an end and the rover boys returned to their home with their uncle and aunt  but more adventures were in store for them and these will be related in another volume to be entitled the rover boys on the ocean or a chase for fortune  in this volume we will meet all of our old friends and also learn more concerning josiah crabtree and his little plot to marry mrs stanhope and obtain the money the lady was holding in trust for dora  we shall likewise meet dan baxter and his toady mumps and learn much concerning a thrilling chase on the ocean and its happy results  but for the present all went well  the boys arrived at the homestead two days after the fourth and were met at the door by their uncle randolph and aunt martha  welcome home all of you cried randolph rover  and as their aunt kissed them he continued and what do you think of your school  what do we think repeated tom  why we think putnam hall is the best boys school on earth  and dick and sam agreed with him   the end
