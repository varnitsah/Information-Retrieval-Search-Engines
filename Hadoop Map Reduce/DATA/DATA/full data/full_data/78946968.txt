78946968	uncle toms cabin  or  life among the lowly   by harriet beecher stowe     volume i   chapter i  in which the reader is introduced to a man of humanity   late in the afternoon of a chilly day in february two gentlemen were sitting alone over their wine in a wellfurnished dining parlor in the town of p in kentucky there were no servants present and the gentlemen with chairs closely approaching seemed to be discussing some subject with great earnestness  for convenience sake we have said hitherto two gentlemen one of the parties however when critically examined did not seem strictly speaking to come under the species he was a short thickset man with coarse commonplace features and that swaggering air of pretension which marks a low man who is trying to elbow his way upward in the world he was much overdressed in a gaudy vest of many colors a blue neckerchief bedropped gayly with yellow spots and arranged with a flaunting tie quite in keeping with the general air of the man his hands large and coarse were plentifully bedecked with rings and he wore a heavy gold watchchain with a bundle of seals of portentous size and a great variety of colors attached to itwhich in the ardor of conversation he was in the habit of flourishing and jingling with evident satisfaction his conversation was in free and easy defiance of murrays grammar and was garnished at convenient intervals with various profane expressions which not even the desire to be graphic in our account shall induce us to transcribe        english grammar 1795 by lindley murray 17451826 the      most authoritative american grammarian of his day  his companion mr shelby had the appearance of a gentleman and the arrangements of the house and the general air of the housekeeping indicated easy and even opulent circumstances as we before stated the two were in the midst of an earnest conversation  that is the way i should arrange the matter said mr shelby  i cant make trade that wayi positively cant mr shelby said the other holding up a glass of wine between his eye and the light  why the fact is haley tom is an uncommon fellow he is certainly worth that sum anywheresteady honest capable manages my whole farm like a clock  you mean honest as niggers go said haley helping himself to a glass of brandy  no i mean really tom is a good steady sensible pious fellow he got religion at a campmeeting four years ago and i believe he really did get it ive trusted him since then with everything i havemoney house horsesand let him come and go round the country and i always found him true and square in everything  some folks dont believe there is pious niggers shelby said haley with a candid flourish of his hand but i do i had a fellow now in this yer last lot i took to orleanst was as good as a meetin now really to hear that critter pray and he was quite gentle and quiet like he fetched me a good sum too for i bought him cheap of a man that was bliged to sell out so i realized six hundred on him yes i consider religion a valeyable thing in a nigger when its the genuine article and no mistake  well toms got the real article if ever a fellow had rejoined the other why last fall i let him go to cincinnati alone to do business for me and bring home five hundred dollars tom says i to him i trust you because i think youre a christiani know you wouldnt cheat tom comes back sure enough i knew he would some low fellows they say said to himtom why dont you make tracks for canada ah master trusted me and i couldntthey told me about it i am sorry to part with tom i must say you ought to let him cover the whole balance of the debt and you would haley if you had any conscience  well ive got just as much conscience as any man in business can afford to keepjust a little you know to swear by as t were said the trader jocularly and then im ready to do anything in reason to blige friends but this yer you see is a leetle too hard on a fellowa leetle too hard the trader sighed contemplatively and poured out some more brandy  well then haley how will you trade said mr shelby after an uneasy interval of silence  well havent you a boy or gal that you could throw in with tom  humnone that i could well spare to tell the truth its only hard necessity makes me willing to sell at all i dont like parting with any of my hands thats a fact  here the door opened and a small quadroon boy between four and five years of age entered the room there was something in his appearance remarkably beautiful and engaging his black hair fine as floss silk hung in glossy curls about his round dimpled face while a pair of large dark eyes full of fire and softness looked out from beneath the rich long lashes as he peered curiously into the apartment a gay robe of scarlet and yellow plaid carefully made and neatly fitted set off to advantage the dark and rich style of his beauty and a certain comic air of assurance blended with bashfulness showed that he had been not unused to being petted and noticed by his master  hulloa jim crow said mr shelby whistling and snapping a bunch of raisins towards him pick that up now  the child scampered with all his little strength after the prize while his master laughed  come here jim crow said he the child came up and the master patted the curly head and chucked him under the chin  now jim show this gentleman how you can dance and sing the boy commenced one of those wild grotesque songs common among the negroes in a rich clear voice accompanying his singing with many comic evolutions of the hands feet and whole body all in perfect time to the music  bravo said haley throwing him a quarter of an orange  now jim walk like old uncle cudjoe when he has the rheumatism said his master  instantly the flexible limbs of the child assumed the appearance of deformity and distortion as with his back humped up and his masters stick in his hand he hobbled about the room his childish face drawn into a doleful pucker and spitting from right to left in imitation of an old man  both gentlemen laughed uproariously  now jim said his master show us how old elder robbins leads the psalm the boy drew his chubby face down to a formidable length and commenced toning a psalm tune through his nose with imperturbable gravity  hurrah bravo what a young un said haley that chaps a case ill promise tell you what said he suddenly clapping his hand on mr shelbys shoulder fling in that chap and ill settle the businessi will come now if that aint doing the thing up about the rightest  at this moment the door was pushed gently open and a young quadroon woman apparently about twentyfive entered the room  there needed only a glance from the child to her to identify her as its mother there was the same rich full dark eye with its long lashes the same ripples of silky black hair the brown of her complexion gave way on the cheek to a perceptible flush which deepened as she saw the gaze of the strange man fixed upon her in bold and undisguised admiration her dress was of the neatest possible fit and set off to advantage her finely moulded shapea delicately formed hand and a trim foot and ankle were items of appearance that did not escape the quick eye of the trader well used to run up at a glance the points of a fine female article  well eliza said her master as she stopped and looked hesitatingly at him  i was looking for harry please sir and the boy bounded toward her showing his spoils which he had gathered in the skirt of his robe  well take him away then said mr shelby and hastily she withdrew carrying the child on her arm  by jupiter said the trader turning to him in admiration theres an article now you might make your fortune on that ar gal in orleans any day ive seen over a thousand in my day paid down for gals not a bit handsomer  i dont want to make my fortune on her said mr shelby dryly and seeking to turn the conversation he uncorked a bottle of fresh wine and asked his companions opinion of it  capital sirfirst chop said the trader then turning and slapping his hand familiarly on shelbys shoulder he added  come how will you trade about the galwhat shall i say for herwhatll you take  mr haley she is not to be sold said shelby my wife would not part with her for her weight in gold  ay ay women always say such things cause they hant no sort of calculation just show em how many watches feathers and trinkets ones weight in gold would buy and that alters the case i reckon  i tell you haley this must not be spoken of i say no and i mean no said shelby decidedly  well youll let me have the boy though said the trader you must own ive come down pretty handsomely for him  what on earth can you want with the child said shelby  why ive got a friend thats going into this yer branch of the businesswants to buy up handsome boys to raise for the market fancy articles entirelysell for waiters and so on to rich uns that can pay for handsome uns it sets off one of yer great placesa real handsome boy to open door wait and tend they fetch a good sum and this little devil is such a comical musical concern hes just the article  i would rather not sell him said mr shelby thoughtfully the fact is sir im a humane man and i hate to take the boy from his mother sir  o you dola yessomething of that ar natur i understand perfectly it is mighty onpleasant getting on with women sometimes i alays hates these yer screechin screamin times they are mighty onpleasant but as i manages business i generally avoids em sir now what if you get the girl off for a day or a week or so then the things done quietlyall over before she comes home your wife might get her some earrings or a new gown or some such truck to make up with her  im afraid not  lor bless ye yes these critters aint like white folks you know they gets over things only manage right now they say said haley assuming a candid and confidential air that this kind o trade is hardening to the feelings but i never found it so fact is i never could do things up the way some fellers manage the business ive seen em as would pull a womans child out of her arms and set him up to sell and she screechin like mad all the timevery bad policydamages the articlemakes em quite unfit for service sometimes i knew a real handsome gal once in orleans as was entirely ruined by this sort o handling the fellow that was trading for her didnt want her baby and she was one of your real high sort when her blood was up i tell you she squeezed up her child in her arms and talked and went on real awful it kinder makes my blood run cold to think of t and when they carried off the child and locked her up she jest went ravin mad and died in a week clear waste sir of a thousand dollars just for want of managementtheres where t is its always best to do the humane thing sir thats been my experience and the trader leaned back in his chair and folded his arm with an air of virtuous decision apparently considering himself a second wilberforce  the subject appeared to interest the gentleman deeply for while mr shelby was thoughtfully peeling an orange haley broke out afresh with becoming diffidence but as if actually driven by the force of truth to say a few words more  it dont look well now for a feller to be praisin himself but i say it jest because its the truth i believe im reckoned to bring in about the finest droves of niggers that is brought inat least ive been told so if i have once i reckon i have a hundred timesall in good casefat and likely and i lose as few as any man in the business and i lays it all to my management sir and humanity sir i may say is the great pillar of my management  mr shelby did not know what to say and so he said indeed  now ive been laughed at for my notions sir and ive been talked to they ant poplar and they ant common but i stuck to em sir ive stuck to em and realized well on em yes sir they have paid their passage i may say and the trader laughed at his joke  there was something so piquant and original in these elucidations of humanity that mr shelby could not help laughing in company perhaps you laugh too dear reader but you know humanity comes out in a variety of strange forms nowadays and there is no end to the odd things that humane people will say and do  mr shelbys laugh encouraged the trader to proceed  its strange now but i never could beat this into peoples heads now there was tom loker my old partner down in natchez he was a clever fellow tom was only the very devil with niggerson principle t was you see for a better hearted feller never broke bread t was his system sir i used to talk to tom why tom i used to say when your gals takes on and cry whats the use o crackin on em over the head and knockin on em round its ridiculous says i and dont do no sort o good why i dont see no harm in their cryin says i its natur says i and if natur cant blow off one way it will another besides tom says i it jest spiles your gals they get sickly and down in the mouth and sometimes they gets uglyparticular yallow gals doand its the devil and all gettin on em broke in now says i why cant you kinder coax em up and speak em fair depend on it tom a little humanity thrown in along goes a heap further than all your jawin and crackin and it pays better says i depend on t but tom couldnt get the hang on t and he spiled so many for me that i had to break off with him though he was a goodhearted fellow and as fair a business hand as is goin  and do you find your ways of managing do the business better than toms said mr shelby  why yes sir i may say so you see when i any ways can i takes a leetle care about the onpleasant parts like selling young uns and thatget the gals out of the wayout of sight out of mind you knowand when its clean done and cant be helped they naturally gets used to it tant you know as if it was white folks thats brought up in the way of spectin to keep their children and wives and all that niggers you know thats fetched up properly hant no kind of spectations of no kind so all these things comes easier  im afraid mine are not properly brought up then said mr shelby  spose not you kentucky folks spile your niggers you mean well by em but tant no real kindness arter all now a nigger you see whats got to be hacked and tumbled round the world and sold to tom and dick and the lord knows who tant no kindness to be givin on him notions and expectations and bringin on him up too well for the rough and tumble comes all the harder on him arter now i venture to say your niggers would be quite chopfallen in a place where some of your plantation niggers would be singing and whooping like all possessed every man you know mr shelby naturally thinks well of his own ways and i think i treat niggers just about as well as its ever worth while to treat em  its a happy thing to be satisfied said mr shelby with a slight shrug and some perceptible feelings of a disagreeable nature  well said haley after they had both silently picked their nuts for a season what do you say  ill think the matter over and talk with my wife said mr shelby meantime haley if you want the matter carried on in the quiet way you speak of youd best not let your business in this neighborhood be known it will get out among my boys and it will not be a particularly quiet business getting away any of my fellows if they know it ill promise you  o certainly by all means mum of course but ill tell you im in a devil of a hurry and shall want to know as soon as possible what i may depend on said he rising and putting on his overcoat  well call up this evening between six and seven and you shall have my answer said mr shelby and the trader bowed himself out of the apartment  id like to have been able to kick the fellow down the steps said he to himself as he saw the door fairly closed with his impudent assurance but he knows how much he has me at advantage if anybody had ever said to me that i should sell tom down south to one of those rascally traders i should have said is thy servant a dog that he should do this thing and now it must come for aught i see and elizas child too i know that i shall have some fuss with wife about that and for that matter about tom too so much for being in debtheigho the fellow sees his advantage and means to push it  perhaps the mildest form of the system of slavery is to be seen in the state of kentucky the general prevalence of agricultural pursuits of a quiet and gradual nature not requiring those periodic seasons of hurry and pressure that are called for in the business of more southern districts makes the task of the negro a more healthful and reasonable one while the master content with a more gradual style of acquisition has not those temptations to hardheartedness which always overcome frail human nature when the prospect of sudden and rapid gain is weighed in the balance with no heavier counterpoise than the interests of the helpless and unprotected  whoever visits some estates there and witnesses the goodhumored indulgence of some masters and mistresses and the affectionate loyalty of some slaves might be tempted to dream the oftfabled poetic legend of a patriarchal institution and all that but over and above the scene there broods a portentous shadowthe shadow of law so long as the law considers all these human beings with beating hearts and living affections only as so many things belonging to a masterso long as the failure or misfortune or imprudence or death of the kindest owner may cause them any day to exchange a life of kind protection and indulgence for one of hopeless misery and toilso long it is impossible to make anything beautiful or desirable in the best regulated administration of slavery  mr shelby was a fair average kind of man goodnatured and kindly and disposed to easy indulgence of those around him and there had never been a lack of anything which might contribute to the physical comfort of the negroes on his estate he had however speculated largely and quite loosely had involved himself deeply and his notes to a large amount had come into the hands of haley and this small piece of information is the key to the preceding conversation  now it had so happened that in approaching the door eliza had caught enough of the conversation to know that a trader was making offers to her master for somebody  she would gladly have stopped at the door to listen as she came out but her mistress just then calling she was obliged to hasten away  still she thought she heard the trader make an offer for her boycould she be mistaken her heart swelled and throbbed and she involuntarily strained him so tight that the little fellow looked up into her face in astonishment  eliza girl what ails you today said her mistress when eliza had upset the washpitcher knocked down the workstand and finally was abstractedly offering her mistress a long nightgown in place of the silk dress she had ordered her to bring from the wardrobe  eliza started o missis she said raising her eyes then bursting into tears she sat down in a chair and began sobbing  why eliza child what ails you said her mistress  o missis missis said eliza theres been a trader talking with master in the parlor i heard him  well silly child suppose there has  o missis do you suppose masr would sell my harry and the poor creature threw herself into a chair and sobbed convulsively  sell him no you foolish girl you know your master never deals with those southern traders and never means to sell any of his servants as long as they behave well why you silly child who do you think would want to buy your harry do you think all the world are set on him as you are you goosie come cheer up and hook my dress there now put my back hair up in that pretty braid you learnt the other day and dont go listening at doors any more  well but missis you never would give your consenttoto  nonsense child to be sure i shouldnt what do you talk so for i would as soon have one of my own children sold but really eliza you are getting altogether too proud of that little fellow a man cant put his nose into the door but you think he must be coming to buy him  reassured by her mistress confident tone eliza proceeded nimbly and adroitly with her toilet laughing at her own fears as she proceeded  mrs shelby was a woman of high class both intellectually and morally to that natural magnanimity and generosity of mind which one often marks as characteristic of the women of kentucky she added high moral and religious sensibility and principle carried out with great energy and ability into practical results her husband who made no professions to any particular religious character nevertheless reverenced and respected the consistency of hers and stood perhaps a little in awe of her opinion certain it was that he gave her unlimited scope in all her benevolent efforts for the comfort instruction and improvement of her servants though he never took any decided part in them himself in fact if not exactly a believer in the doctrine of the efficiency of the extra good works of saints he really seemed somehow or other to fancy that his wife had piety and benevolence enough for twoto indulge a shadowy expectation of getting into heaven through her superabundance of qualities to which he made no particular pretension  the heaviest load on his mind after his conversation with the trader lay in the foreseen necessity of breaking to his wife the arrangement contemplatedmeeting the importunities and opposition which he knew he should have reason to encounter  mrs shelby being entirely ignorant of her husbands embarrassments and knowing only the general kindliness of his temper had been quite sincere in the entire incredulity with which she had met elizas suspicions in fact she dismissed the matter from her mind without a second thought and being occupied in preparations for an evening visit it passed out of her thoughts entirely    chapter ii  the mother   eliza had been brought up by her mistress from girlhood as a petted and indulged favorite  the traveller in the south must often have remarked that peculiar air of refinement that softness of voice and manner which seems in many cases to be a particular gift to the quadroon and mulatto women these natural graces in the quadroon are often united with beauty of the most dazzling kind and in almost every case with a personal appearance prepossessing and agreeable eliza such as we have described her is not a fancy sketch but taken from remembrance as we saw her years ago in kentucky safe under the protecting care of her mistress eliza had reached maturity without those temptations which make beauty so fatal an inheritance to a slave she had been married to a bright and talented young mulatto man who was a slave on a neighboring estate and bore the name of george harris  this young man had been hired out by his master to work in a bagging factory where his adroitness and ingenuity caused him to be considered the first hand in the place he had invented a machine for the cleaning of the hemp which considering the education and circumstances of the inventor displayed quite as much mechanical genius as whitneys cottongin         a machine of this description was really the invention of      a young colored man in kentucky mrs stowes note  he was possessed of a handsome person and pleasing manners and was a general favorite in the factory nevertheless as this young man was in the eye of the law not a man but a thing all these superior qualifications were subject to the control of a vulgar narrowminded tyrannical master this same gentleman having heard of the fame of georges invention took a ride over to the factory to see what this intelligent chattel had been about he was received with great enthusiasm by the employer who congratulated him on possessing so valuable a slave  he was waited upon over the factory shown the machinery by george who in high spirits talked so fluently held himself so erect looked so handsome and manly that his master began to feel an uneasy consciousness of inferiority what business had his slave to be marching round the country inventing machines and holding up his head among gentlemen hed soon put a stop to it hed take him back and put him to hoeing and digging and see if hed step about so smart accordingly the manufacturer and all hands concerned were astounded when he suddenly demanded georges wages and announced his intention of taking him home  but mr harris remonstrated the manufacturer isnt this rather sudden  what if it isisnt the man mine  we would be willing sir to increase the rate of compensation  no object at all sir i dont need to hire any of my hands out unless ive a mind to  but sir he seems peculiarly adapted to this business  dare say he may be never was much adapted to anything that i set him about ill be bound  but only think of his inventing this machine interposed one of the workmen rather unluckily  o yes a machine for saving work is it hed invent that ill be bound let a nigger alone for that any time they are all laborsaving machines themselves every one of em no he shall tramp  george had stood like one transfixed at hearing his doom thus suddenly pronounced by a power that he knew was irresistible he folded his arms tightly pressed in his lips but a whole volcano of bitter feelings burned in his bosom and sent streams of fire through his veins he breathed short and his large dark eyes flashed like live coals and he might have broken out into some dangerous ebullition had not the kindly manufacturer touched him on the arm and said in a low tone  give way george go with him for the present well try to help you yet  the tyrant observed the whisper and conjectured its import though he could not hear what was said and he inwardly strengthened himself in his determination to keep the power he possessed over his victim  george was taken home and put to the meanest drudgery of the farm he had been able to repress every disrespectful word but the flashing eye the gloomy and troubled brow were part of a natural language that could not be repressedindubitable signs which showed too plainly that the man could not become a thing  it was during the happy period of his employment in the factory that george had seen and married his wife during that periodbeing much trusted and favored by his employerhe had free liberty to come and go at discretion the marriage was highly approved of by mrs shelby who with a little womanly complacency in matchmaking felt pleased to unite her handsome favorite with one of her own class who seemed in every way suited to her and so they were married in her mistress great parlor and her mistress herself adorned the brides beautiful hair with orangeblossoms and threw over it the bridal veil which certainly could scarce have rested on a fairer head and there was no lack of white gloves and cake and wineof admiring guests to praise the brides beauty and her mistress indulgence and liberality for a year or two eliza saw her husband frequently and there was nothing to interrupt their happiness except the loss of two infant children to whom she was passionately attached and whom she mourned with a grief so intense as to call for gentle remonstrance from her mistress who sought with maternal anxiety to direct her naturally passionate feelings within the bounds of reason and religion  after the birth of little harry however she had gradually become tranquillized and settled and every bleeding tie and throbbing nerve once more entwined with that little life seemed to become sound and healthful and eliza was a happy woman up to the time that her husband was rudely torn from his kind employer and brought under the iron sway of his legal owner  the manufacturer true to his word visited mr harris a week or two after george had been taken away when as he hoped the heat of the occasion had passed away and tried every possible inducement to lead him to restore him to his former employment  you neednt trouble yourself to talk any longer said he doggedly i know my own business sir  i did not presume to interfere with it sir i only thought that you might think it for your interest to let your man to us on the terms proposed  o i understand the matter well enough i saw your winking and whispering the day i took him out of the factory but you dont come it over me that way its a free country sir the mans mine and i do what i please with himthats it  and so fell georges last hopenothing before him but a life of toil and drudgery rendered more bitter by every little smarting vexation and indignity which tyrannical ingenuity could devise  a very humane jurist once said the worst use you can put a man to is to hang him no there is another use that a man can be put to that is worse    chapter iii  the husband and father   mrs shelby had gone on her visit and eliza stood in the verandah rather dejectedly looking after the retreating carriage when a hand was laid on her shoulder she turned and a bright smile lighted up her fine eyes  george is it you how you frightened me well i am so glad you s come missis is gone to spend the afternoon so come into my little room and well have the time all to ourselves  saying this she drew him into a neat little apartment opening on the verandah where she generally sat at her sewing within call of her mistress  how glad i amwhy dont you smileand look at harryhow he grows the boy stood shyly regarding his father through his curls holding close to the skirts of his mothers dress isnt he beautiful said eliza lifting his long curls and kissing him  i wish hed never been born said george bitterly i wish id never been born myself  surprised and frightened eliza sat down leaned her head on her husbands shoulder and burst into tears  there now eliza its too bad for me to make you feel so poor girl said he fondly its too bad o how i wish you never had seen meyou might have been happy  george george how can you talk so what dreadful thing has happened or is going to happen im sure weve been very happy till lately  so we have dear said george then drawing his child on his knee he gazed intently on his glorious dark eyes and passed his hands through his long curls  just like you eliza and you are the handsomest woman i ever saw and the best one i ever wish to see but oh i wish id never seen you nor you me  o george how can you  yes eliza its all misery misery misery my life is bitter as wormwood the very life is burning out of me im a poor miserable forlorn drudge i shall only drag you down with me thats all whats the use of our trying to do anything trying to know anything trying to be anything whats the use of living i wish i was dead  o now dear george that is really wicked i know how you feel about losing your place in the factory and you have a hard master but pray be patient and perhaps something  patient said he interrupting her havent i been patient did i say a word when he came and took me away for no earthly reason from the place where everybody was kind to me id paid him truly every cent of my earningsand they all say i worked well  well it is dreadful said eliza but after all he is your master you know  my master and who made him my master thats what i think ofwhat right has he to me im a man as much as he is im a better man than he is i know more about business than he does i am a better manager than he is i can read better than he can i can write a better handand ive learned it all myself and no thanks to himive learned it in spite of him and now what right has he to make a drayhorse of meto take me from things i can do and do better than he can and put me to work that any horse can do he tries to do it he says hell bring me down and humble me and he puts me to just the hardest meanest and dirtiest work on purpose  o george george you frighten me why i never heard you talk so im afraid youll do something dreadful i dont wonder at your feelings at all but oh do be carefuldo dofor my sakefor harrys  i have been careful and i have been patient but its growing worse and worse flesh and blood cant bear it any longerevery chance he can get to insult and torment me he takes i thought i could do my work well and keep on quiet and have some time to read and learn out of work hours but the more he see i can do the more he loads on he says that though i dont say anything he sees ive got the devil in me and he means to bring it out and one of these days it will come out in a way that he wont like or im mistaken  o dear what shall we do said eliza mournfully  it was only yesterday said george as i was busy loading stones into a cart that young masr tom stood there slashing his whip so near the horse that the creature was frightened i asked him to stop as pleasant as i couldhe just kept right on i begged him again and then he turned on me and began striking me i held his hand and then he screamed and kicked and ran to his father and told him that i was fighting him he came in a rage and said hed teach me who was my master and he tied me to a tree and cut switches for young master and told him that he might whip me till he was tiredand he did do it if i dont make him remember it some time and the brow of the young man grew dark and his eyes burned with an expression that made his young wife tremble who made this man my master thats what i want to know he said  well said eliza mournfully i always thought that i must obey my master and mistress or i couldnt be a christian  there is some sense in it in your case they have brought you up like a child fed you clothed you indulged you and taught you so that you have a good education that is some reason why they should claim you but i have been kicked and cuffed and sworn at and at the best only let alone and what do i owe ive paid for all my keeping a hundred times over i wont bear it no i wont he said clenching his hand with a fierce frown  eliza trembled and was silent she had never seen her husband in this mood before and her gentle system of ethics seemed to bend like a reed in the surges of such passions  you know poor little carlo that you gave me added george the creature has been about all the comfort that ive had he has slept with me nights and followed me around days and kind o looked at me as if he understood how i felt well the other day i was just feeding him with a few old scraps i picked up by the kitchen door and masr came along and said i was feeding him up at his expense and that he couldnt afford to have every nigger keeping his dog and ordered me to tie a stone to his neck and throw him in the pond  o george you didnt do it  do it not ibut he did masr and tom pelted the poor drowning creature with stones poor thing he looked at me so mournful as if he wondered why i didnt save him i had to take a flogging because i wouldnt do it myself i dont care masr will find out that im one that whipping wont tame my day will come yet if he dont look out  what are you going to do o george dont do anything wicked if you only trust in god and try to do right hell deliver you  i ant a christian like you eliza my hearts full of bitterness i cant trust in god why does he let things be so  o george we must have faith mistress says that when all things go wrong to us we must believe that god is doing the very best  thats easy to say for people that are sitting on their sofas and riding in their carriages but let em be where i am i guess it would come some harder i wish i could be good but my heart burns and cant be reconciled anyhow you couldnt in my placeyou cant now if i tell you all ive got to say you dont know the whole yet  what can be coming now  well lately masr has been saying that he was a fool to let me marry off the place that he hates mr shelby and all his tribe because they are proud and hold their heads up above him and that ive got proud notions from you and he says he wont let me come here any more and that i shall take a wife and settle down on his place at first he only scolded and grumbled these things but yesterday he told me that i should take mina for a wife and settle down in a cabin with her or he would sell me down river  whybut you were married to me by the minister as much as if youd been a white man said eliza simply  dont you know a slave cant be married there is no law in this country for that i cant hold you for my wife if he chooses to part us thats why i wish id never seen youwhy i wish id never been born it would have been better for us bothit would have been better for this poor child if he had never been born all this may happen to him yet  o but master is so kind  yes but who knowshe may dieand then he may be sold to nobody knows who what pleasure is it that he is handsome and smart and bright i tell you eliza that a sword will pierce through your soul for every good and pleasant thing your child is or has it will make him worth too much for you to keep  the words smote heavily on elizas heart the vision of the trader came before her eyes and as if some one had struck her a deadly blow she turned pale and gasped for breath she looked nervously out on the verandah where the boy tired of the grave conversation had retired and where he was riding triumphantly up and down on mr shelbys walkingstick she would have spoken to tell her husband her fears but checked herself  no nohe has enough to bear

parting as those may make whose hope to meet again is as the spiders weband the husband and wife were parted    chapter iv  an evening in uncle toms cabin   the cabin of uncle tom was a small log building close adjoining to the house as the negro par excellence designates his masters dwelling in front it had a neat gardenpatch where every summer strawberries raspberries and a variety of fruits and vegetables flourished under careful tending the whole front of it was covered by a large scarlet bignonia and a native multiflora rose which entwisting and interlacing left scarce a vestige of the rough logs to be seen here also in summer various brilliant annuals such as marigolds petunias fouroclocks found an indulgent corner in which to unfold their splendors and were the delight and pride of aunt chloes heart  let us enter the dwelling the evening meal at the house is over and aunt chloe who presided over its preparation as head cook has left to inferior officers in the kitchen the business of clearing away and washing dishes and come out into her own snug territories to get her ole mans supper therefore doubt not that it is her you see by the fire presiding with anxious interest over certain frizzling items in a stewpan and anon with grave consideration lifting the cover of a bakekettle from whence steam forth indubitable intimations of something good a round black shining face is hers so glossy as to suggest the idea that she might have been washed over with white of eggs like one of her own tea rusks her whole plump countenance beams with satisfaction and contentment from under her wellstarched checked turban bearing on it however if we must confess it a little of that tinge of selfconsciousness which becomes the first cook of the neighborhood as aunt chloe was universally held and acknowledged to be  a cook she certainly was in the very bone and centre of her soul not a chicken or turkey or duck in the barnyard but looked grave when they saw her approaching and seemed evidently to be reflecting on their latter end and certain it was that she was always meditating on trussing stuffing and roasting to a degree that was calculated to inspire terror in any reflecting fowl living her corncake in all its varieties of hoecake dodgers muffins and other species too numerous to mention was a sublime mystery to all less practised compounders and she would shake her fat sides with honest pride and merriment as she would narrate the fruitless efforts that one and another of her compeers had made to attain to her elevation  the arrival of company at the house the arranging of dinners and suppers in style awoke all the energies of her soul and no sight was more welcome to her than a pile of travelling trunks launched on the verandah for then she foresaw fresh efforts and fresh triumphs  just at present however aunt chloe is looking into the bakepan in which congenial operation we shall leave her till we finish our picture of the cottage  in one corner of it stood a bed covered neatly with a snowy spread and by the side of it was a piece of carpeting of some considerable size on this piece of carpeting aunt chloe took her stand as being decidedly in the upper walks of life and it and the bed by which it lay and the whole corner in fact were treated with distinguished consideration and made so far as possible sacred from the marauding inroads and desecrations of little folks in fact that corner was the drawingroom of the establishment in the other corner was a bed of much humbler pretensions and evidently designed for use the wall over the fireplace was adorned with some very brilliant scriptural prints and a portrait of general washington drawn and colored in a manner which would certainly have astonished that hero if ever he happened to meet with its like  on a rough bench in the corner a couple of woollyheaded boys with glistening black eyes and fat shining cheeks were busy in superintending the first walking operations of the baby which as is usually the case consisted in getting up on its feet balancing a moment and then tumbling downeach successive failure being violently cheered as something decidedly clever  a table somewhat rheumatic in its limbs was drawn out in front of the fire and covered with a cloth displaying cups and saucers of a decidedly brilliant pattern with other symptoms of an approaching meal at this table was seated uncle tom mr shelbys best hand who as he is to be the hero of our story we must daguerreotype for our readers he was a large broadchested powerfullymade man of a full glossy black and a face whose truly african features were characterized by an expression of grave and steady good sense united with much kindliness and benevolence there was something about his whole air selfrespecting and dignified yet united with a confiding and humble simplicity  he was very busily intent at this moment on a slate lying before him on which he was carefully and slowly endeavoring to accomplish a copy of some letters in which operation he was overlooked by young masr george a smart bright boy of thirteen who appeared fully to realize the dignity of his position as instructor  not that way uncle tomnot that way said he briskly as uncle tom laboriously brought up the tail of his g the wrong side out that makes a q you see  la sakes now does it said uncle tom looking with a respectful admiring air as his young teacher flourishingly scrawled qs and gs innumerable for his edification and then taking the pencil in his big heavy fingers he patiently recommenced  how easy white folks alus does things said aunt chloe pausing while she was greasing a griddle with a scrap of bacon on her fork and regarding young master george with pride the way he can write now and read too and then to come out here evenings and read his lessons to usits mighty interestin  but aunt chloe im getting mighty hungry said george isnt that cake in the skillet almost done  mose done masr george said aunt chloe lifting the lid and peeping inbrowning beautifula real lovely brown ah let me alone for dat missis let sally try to make some cake t other day jes to larn her she said o go way missis said i it really hurts my feelins now to see good vittles spilt dat ar way cake ris all to one sideno shape at all no more than my shoe go way  and with this final expression of contempt for sallys greenness aunt chloe whipped the cover off the bakekettle and disclosed to view a neatlybaked poundcake of which no city confectioner need to have been ashamed this being evidently the central point of the entertainment aunt chloe began now to bustle about earnestly in the supper department  here you mose and pete get out de way you niggers get away polly honeymammyll give her baby some fin by and by now masr george you jest take off dem books and set down now with my old man and ill take up de sausages and have de first griddle full of cakes on your plates in less dan no time  they wanted me to come to supper in the house said george but i knew what was what too well for that aunt chloe  so you didso you did honey said aunt chloe heaping the smoking battercakes on his plate you knowd your old auntyd keep the best for you o let you alone for dat go way and with that aunty gave george a nudge with her finger designed to be immensely facetious and turned again to her griddle with great briskness  now for the cake said masr george when the activity of the griddle department had somewhat subsided and with that the youngster flourished a large knife over the article in question  la bless you masr george said aunt chloe with earnestness catching his arm you wouldnt be for cuttin it wid dat ar great heavy knife smash all downspile all de pretty rise of it here ive got a thin old knife i keeps sharp a purpose dar now see comes apart light as a feather now eat awayyou wont get anything to beat dat ar  tom lincon says said george speaking with his mouth full that their jinny is a better cook than you  dem lincons ant much count no way said aunt chloe contemptuously i mean set along side our folks they s spectable folks enough in a kinder plain way but as to gettin up anything in style they dont begin to have a notion on t set masr lincon now alongside masr shelby good lor and missis linconcan she kinder sweep it into a room like my mississo kinder splendid yer know o go way dont tell me nothin of dem linconsand aunt chloe tossed her head as one who hoped she did know something of

hem ah masr george you doesnt know half your privileges in yer family and bringin up here aunt chloe sighed and rolled up her eyes with emotion  im sure aunt chloe i understand my pie and pudding privileges said george ask tom lincon if i dont crow over him every time i meet him  aunt chloe sat back in her chair and indulged in a hearty guffaw of laughter at this witticism of young masrs laughing till the tears rolled down her black shining cheeks and varying the exercise with playfully slapping and poking masr georgey and telling him to go way and that he was a casethat he was fit to kill her and that he sartin would kill her one of these days and between each of these sanguinary predictions going off into a laugh each longer and stronger than the other till george really began to think that he was a very dangerously witty fellow and that it became him to be careful how he talked as funny as he could  and so ye telled tom did ye o lor what young uns will be up ter ye crowed over tom o lor masr george if ye wouldnt make a hornbug laugh  yes said george i says to him tom you ought to see some of aunt chloes pies theyre the right sort says i  pity now tom couldnt said aunt chloe on whose benevolent heart the idea of toms benighted condition seemed to make a strong impression ye oughter just ask him here to dinner some o these times masr george she added it would look quite pretty of ye ye know masr george ye oughtenter feel bove nobody on count yer privileges cause all our privileges is gin to us we ought alays to member that said aunt chloe looking quite serious  well i mean to ask tom here some day next week said george and you do your prettiest aunt chloe and well make him stare wont we make him eat so he wont get over it for a fortnight  yes yessartin said aunt chloe delighted youll see lor to think of some of our dinners yer mind dat ar great chicken pie i made when we guv de dinner to general knox i and missis we come pretty near quarrelling about dat ar crust what does get into ladies sometimes i dont know but sometimes when a body has de heaviest kind o sponsibility on em as ye may say and is all kinder seris and taken up dey takes dat ar time to be hangin round and kinder interferin now missis she wanted me to do dis way and she wanted me to do dat way and finally i got kinder sarcy and says i now missis do jist look at dem beautiful white hands o yourn with long fingers and all a sparkling with rings like my white lilies when de dew s on em and look at my great black stumpin hands now dont ye think dat de lord must have meant me to make de piecrust and you to stay in de parlor dar i was jist so sarcy masr george  and what did mother say said george  saywhy she kinder larfed in her eyesdem great handsome eyes o hern and says she well aunt chloe i think you are about in the right on t says she and she went off in de parlor she oughter cracked me over de head for bein so sarcy but dars whar t isi cant do nothin with ladies in de kitchen  well you made out well with that dinneri remember everybody said so said george  didnt i and want i behind de dininroom door dat bery day and didnt i see de general pass his plate three times for some more dat bery pieand says he you must have an uncommon cook mrs shelby lor i was fit to split myself  and de gineral he knows what cookin is said aunt chloe drawing herself up with an air bery nice man de gineral he comes of one of de bery fustest families in old virginny he knows whats what now as well as i dode gineral ye see theres pints in all pies masr george but tant everybody knows what they is or as orter be but the gineral he knows i knew by his marks he made yes he knows what de pints is  by this time master george had arrived at that pass to which even a boy can come under uncommon circumstances when he really could not eat another morsel and therefore he was at leisure to notice the pile of woolly heads and glistening eyes which were regarding their operations hungrily from the opposite corner  here you mose pete he said breaking off liberal bits and throwing it at them you want some dont you come aunt chloe bake them some cakes  and george and tom moved to a comfortable seat in the chimneycorner while aunte chloe after baking a goodly pile of cakes took her baby on her lap and began alternately filling its mouth and her own and distributing to mose and pete who seemed rather to prefer eating theirs as they rolled about on the floor under the table tickling each other and occasionally pulling the babys toes  o go long will ye said the mother giving now and then a kick in a kind of general way under the table when the movement became too obstreperous cant ye be decent when white folks comes to see ye stop dat ar now will ye better mind yerselves or ill take ye down a buttonhole lower when masr george is gone  what meaning was couched under this terrible threat it is difficult to say but certain it is that its awful indistinctness seemed to produce very little impression on the young sinners addressed  la now said uncle tom they are so full of tickle all the while they cant behave theirselves  here the boys emerged from under the table and with hands and faces well plastered with molasses began a vigorous kissing of the baby  get along wid ye said the mother pushing away their woolly heads yell all stick together and never get clar if ye do dat fashion go long to de spring and wash yerselves she said seconding her exhortations by a slap which resounded very formidably but which seemed only to knock out so much more laugh from the young ones as they tumbled precipitately over each other out of doors where they fairly screamed with merriment  did ye ever see such aggravating young uns said aunt chloe rather complacently as producing an old towel kept for such emergencies she poured a little water out of the cracked teapot on it and began rubbing off the molasses from the babys face and hands and having polished her till she shone she set her down in toms lap while she busied herself in clearing away supper the baby employed the intervals in pulling toms nose scratching his face and burying her fat hands in his woolly hair which last operation seemed to afford her special content  aint she a peart young un said tom holding her from him to take a fulllength view then getting up he set her on his broad shoulder and began capering and dancing with her while masr george snapped at her with his pockethandkerchief and mose and pete now returned again roared after her like bears till aunt chloe declared that they fairly took her head off with their noise as according to her own statement this surgical operation was a matter of daily occurrence in the cabin the declaration no whit abated the merriment till every one had roared and tumbled and danced themselves down to a state of composure  well now i hopes youre done said aunt chloe who had been busy in pulling out a rude box of a trundlebed and now you mose and you pete get into thar for wes goin to have the meetin  o mother we dont wanter we wants to sit up to meetinmeetins is so curis we likes em  la aunt chloe shove it under and let em sit up said masr george decisively giving a push to the rude machine  aunt chloe having thus saved appearances seemed highly delighted to push the thing under saying as she did so well mebbe t will do em some good  the house now resolved itself into a committee of the whole to consider the accommodations and arrangements for the meeting  what wes to do for cheers now i declar i dont know said aunt chloe as the meeting had been held at uncle toms weekly for an indefinite length of time without any more cheers there seemed some encouragement to hope that a way would be discovered at present  old uncle peter sung both de legs out of dat oldest cheer last week suggested mose  you go long ill boun you pulled em out some o your shines said aunt chloe  well itll stand if it only keeps jam up agin de wall said mose  den uncle peter musnt sit in it cause he alays hitches when he gets a singing he hitched pretty nigh across de room t other night said pete  good lor get him in it then said mose and den hed begin come saintsand sinners hear me tell and den down hed goand mose imitated precisely the nasal tones of the old man tumbling on the floor to illustrate the supposed catastrophe  come now be decent cant ye said aunt chloe ant yer shamed  masr george however joined the offender in the laugh and declared decidedly that mose was a buster so the maternal admonition seemed rather to fail of effect  well ole man said aunt chloe youll have to tote in them ar barls  mothers barls is like dat ar widders masr george was reading bout in de good bookdey never fails said mose aside to peter  im sure one on em caved in last week said pete and let em all down in de middle of de singin dat ar was failin warnt it  during this aside between mose and pete two empty casks had been rolled into the cabin and being secured from rolling by stones on each side boards were laid across them which arrangement together with the turning down of certain tubs and pails and the disposing of the rickety chairs at last completed the preparation  masr george is such a beautiful reader now i know hell stay to read for us said aunt chloe pears like t will be so much more interestin  george very readily consented for your boy is always ready for anything that makes him of importance  the room was soon filled with a motley assemblage from the old grayheaded patriarch of eighty to the young girl and lad of fifteen a little harmless gossip ensued on various themes such as where old aunt sally got her new red headkerchief and how missis was a going to give lizzy that spotted muslin gown when shed got her new berage made up and how masr shelby was thinking of buying a new sorrel colt that was going to prove an addition to the glories of the place a few of the worshippers belonged to families hard by who had got permission to attend and who brought in various choice scraps of information about the sayings and doings at the house and on the place which circulated as freely as the same sort of small change does in higher circles  after a while the singing commenced to the evident delight of all present not even all the disadvantage of nasal intonation could prevent the effect of the naturally fine voices in airs at once wild and spirited the words were sometimes the wellknown and common hymns sung in the churches about and sometimes of a wilder more indefinite character picked up at campmeetings  the chorus of one of them which ran as follows was sung with great energy and unction       die on the field of battle      die on the field of battle      glory in my soul  another special favorite had oft repeated the words       o im going to glorywont you come along with me      dont you see the angels beckning and a calling me away      dont you see the golden city and the everlasting day  there were others which made incessant mention of jordans banks and canaans fields and the new jerusalem for the negro mind impassioned and imaginative always attaches itself to hymns and expressions of a vivid and pictorial nature and as they sung some laughed and some cried and some clapped hands or shook hands rejoicingly with each other as if they had fairly gained the other side of the river  various exhortations or relations of experience followed and intermingled with the singing one old grayheaded woman long past work but much revered as a sort of chronicle of the past rose and leaning on her staff saidwell chilen well im mighty glad to hear ye all and see ye all once more cause i dont know when ill be gone to glory but ive done got ready chilen pears like id got my little bundle all tied up and my bonnet on jest a waitin for the stage to come along and take me home sometimes in the night i think i hear the wheels a rattlin and im lookin out all the time now you jest be ready too for i tell ye all chilen she said striking her staff hard on the floor dat ar glory is a mighty thing its a mighty thing chilenyou donno nothing about itits wonderful and the old creature sat down with streaming tears as wholly overcome while the whole circle struck up       o canaan bright canaan      im bound for the land of canaan  masr george by request read the last chapters of revelation often interrupted by such exclamations as the sakes now only hear that jest think on t is all that a comin sure enough  george who was a bright boy and well trained in religious things by his mother finding himself an object of general admiration threw in expositions of his own from time to time with a commendable seriousness and gravity for which he was admired by the young and blessed by the old and it was agreed on all hands that a minister couldnt lay it off better than he did that t was reely mazin  uncle tom was a sort of patriarch in religious matters in the neighborhood having naturally an organization in which the morale was strongly predominant together with a greater breadth and cultivation of mind than obtained among his companions he was looked up to with great respect as a sort of minister among them and the simple hearty sincere style of his exhortations might have edified even better educated persons but it was in prayer that he especially excelled nothing could exceed the touching simplicity the childlike earnestness of his prayer enriched with the language of scripture which seemed so entirely to have wrought itself into his being as to have become a part of himself and to drop from his lips unconsciously in the language of a pious old negro he prayed right up and so much did his prayer always work on the devotional feelings of his audiences that there seemed often a danger that it would be lost altogether in the abundance of the responses which broke out everywhere around him   while this scene was passing in the cabin of the man one quite otherwise passed in the halls of the master  the trader and mr shelby were seated together in the dining room aforenamed at a table covered with papers and writing utensils  mr shelby was busy in counting some bundles of bills which as they were counted he pushed over to the trader who counted them likewise  all fair said the trader and now for signing these yer  mr shelby hastily drew the bills of sale towards him and signed them like a man that hurries over some disagreeable business and then pushed them over with the money haley produced from a wellworn valise a parchment which after looking over it a moment he handed to mr shelby who took it with a gesture of suppressed eagerness  wal now the things done said the trader getting up  its done said mr shelby in a musing tone and fetching a long breath he repeated its done  yer dont seem to feel much pleased with it pears to me said the trader  haley said mr shelby i hope youll remember that you promised on your honor you wouldnt sell tom without knowing what sort of hands hes going into  why youve just done it sir said the trader  circumstances you well know obliged me said shelby haughtily  wal you know they may blige me too said the trader howsomever ill do the very best i can in gettin tom a good berth as to my treatin on him bad you neednt be a grain afeard if theres anything that i thank the lord for it is that im never noways cruel  after the expositions which the trader had previously given of his humane principles mr shelby did not feel particularly reassured by these declarations but as they were the best comfort the case admitted of he allowed the trader to depart in silence and betook himself to a solitary cigar    chapter v  showing the feelings of living property on changing owners   mr and mrs shelby had retired to their apartment for the night he was lounging in a large easychair looking over some letters that had come in the afternoon mail and she was standing before her mirror brushing out the complicated braids and curls in which eliza had arranged her hair for noticing her pale cheeks and haggard eyes she had excused her attendance that night and ordered her to bed the employment naturally enough suggested her conversation with the girl in the morning and turning to her husband she said carelessly  by the by arthur who was that lowbred fellow that you lugged in to our dinnertable today  haley is his name said shelby turning himself rather uneasily in his chair and continuing with his eyes fixed on a letter  haley who is he and what may be his business here pray  well hes a man that i transacted some business with last time i was at natchez said mr shelby  and he presumed on it to make himself quite at home and call and dine here ay  why i invited him i had some accounts with him said shelby  is he a negrotrader said mrs shelby noticing a certain embarrassment in her husbands manner  why my dear what put that into your head said shelby looking up  nothingonly eliza came in here after dinner in a great worry crying and taking on and said you were talking with a trader and that she heard him make an offer for her boythe ridiculous little goose  she did hey said mr shelby returning to his paper which he seemed for a few moments quite intent upon not perceiving that he was holding it bottom upwards  it will have to come out said he mentally as well now as ever  i told eliza said mrs shelby as she continued brushing her hair that she was a little fool for her pains and that you never had anything to do with that sort of persons of course i knew you never meant to sell any of our peopleleast of all to such a fellow  well emily said her husband so i have always felt and said but the fact is that my business lies so that i cannot get on without i shall have to sell some of my hands  to that creature impossible mr shelby you cannot be serious  im sorry to say that i am said mr shelby ive agreed to sell tom  what our tomthat good faithful creaturebeen your faithful servant from a boy o mr shelbyand you have promised him his freedom tooyou and i have spoken to him a hundred times of it well i can believe anything nowi can believe now that you could sell little harry poor elizas only child said mrs shelby in a tone between grief and indignation  well since you must know all it is so i have agreed to sell tom and harry both and i dont know why i am to be rated as if i were a monster for doing what every one does every day  but why of all others choose these said mrs shelby why sell them of all on the place if you must sell at all  because they will bring the highest sum of anythats why i could choose another if you say so the fellow made me a high bid on eliza if that would suit you any better said mr shelby  the wretch said mrs shelby vehemently  well i didnt listen to it a momentout of regard to your feelings i wouldntso give me some credit  my dear said mrs shelby recollecting herself forgive me i have been hasty i was surprised and entirely unprepared for thisbut surely you will allow me to intercede for these poor creatures tom is a noblehearted faithful fellow if he is black i do believe mr shelby that if he were put to it he would lay down his life for you  i know iti dare saybut whats the use of all thisi cant help myself  why not make a pecuniary sacrifice im willing to bear my part of the inconvenience o mr shelby i have triedtried most faithfully as a christian woman shouldto do my duty to these poor simple dependent creatures i have cared for them instructed them watched over them and know all their little cares and joys for years and how can i ever hold up my head again among them if for the sake of a little paltry gain we sell such a faithful excellent confiding creature as poor tom and tear from him in a moment all we have taught him to love and value i have taught them the duties of the family of parent and child and husband and wife and how can i bear to have this open acknowledgment that we care for no tie no duty no relation however sacred compared with money i have talked with eliza about her boyher duty to him as a christian mother to watch over him pray for him and bring him up in a christian way and now what can i say if you tear him away and sell him soul and body to a profane unprincipled man just to save a little money i have told her that one soul is worth more than all the money in the world and how will she believe me when she sees us turn round and sell her childsell him perhaps to certain ruin of body and soul  im sorry you feel so about itindeed i am said mr shelby and i respect your feelings too though i dont pretend to share them to their full extent but i tell you now solemnly its of no usei cant help myself i didnt mean to tell you this emily but in plain words there is no choice between selling these two and selling everything either they must go or all must haley has come into possession of a mortgage which if i dont clear off with him directly will take everything before it ive raked and scraped and borrowed and all but beggedand the price of these two was needed to make up the balance and i had to give them up haley fancied the child he agreed to settle the matter that way and no other i was in his power and had to do it if you feel so to have them sold would it be any better to have all sold  mrs shelby stood like one stricken finally turning to her toilet she rested her face in her hands and gave a sort of groan  this is gods curse on slaverya bitter bitter most accursed thinga curse to the master and a curse to the slave i was a fool to think i could make anything good out of such a deadly evil it is a sin to hold a slave under laws like oursi always felt it wasi always thought so when i was a girli thought so still more after i joined the church but i thought i could gild it overi thought by kindness and care and instruction i could make the condition of mine better than freedomfool that i was  why wife you are getting to be an abolitionist quite  abolitionist if they knew all i know about slavery they might talk we dont need them to tell us you know i never thought that slavery was rightnever felt willing to own slaves  well therein you differ from many wise and pious men said mr shelby you remember mr bs sermon the other sunday  i dont want to hear such sermons i never wish to hear mr b in our church again ministers cant help the evil perhapscant cure it any more than we canbut defend itit always went against my common sense and i think you didnt think much of that sermon either  well said shelby i must say these ministers sometimes carry matters further than we poor sinners would exactly dare to do we men of the world must wink pretty hard at various things and get used to a deal that isnt the exact thing but we dont quite fancy when women and ministers come out broad and square and go beyond us in matters of either modesty or morals thats a fact but now my dear i trust you see the necessity of the thing and you see that i have done the very best that circumstances would allow  o yes yes said mrs shelby hurriedly and abstractedly fingering her gold watchi havent any jewelry of any amount she added thoughtfully but would not this watch do somethingit was an expensive one when it was bought if i could only at least save elizas child i would sacrifice anything i have  im sorry very sorry emily said mr shelby im sorry this takes hold of you so but it will do no good the fact is emily the things done the bills of sale are already signed and in haleys hands and you must be thankful it is no worse that man has had it in his power to ruin us alland now he is fairly off if you knew the man as i do youd think that we had had a narrow escape  is he so hard then  why not a cruel man exactly but a man of leathera man alive to nothing but trade and profitcool and unhesitating and unrelenting as death and the grave hed sell his own mother at a good percentagenot wishing the old woman any harm either  and this wretch owns that good faithful tom and elizas child  well my dear the fact is that this goes rather hard with me its a thing i hate to think of haley wants to drive matters and take possession tomorrow im going to get out my horse bright and early and be off i cant see tom thats a fact and you had better arrange a drive somewhere and carry eliza off let the thing be done when she is out of sight  no no said mrs shelby ill be in no sense accomplice or help in this cruel business ill go and see poor old tom god help him in his distress they shall see at any rate that their mistress can feel for and with them as to eliza i dare not think about it the lord forgive us what have we done that this cruel necessity should come on us  there was one listener to this conversation whom mr and mrs shelby little suspected  communicating with their apartment was a large closet opening by a door into the outer passage when mrs shelby had dismissed eliza for the night her feverish and excited mind had suggested the idea of this closet and she had hidden herself there and with her ear pressed close against the crack of the door had lost not a word of the conversation  when the voices died into silence she rose and crept stealthily away pale shivering with rigid features and compressed lips she looked an entirely altered being from the soft and timid creature she had been hitherto she moved cautiously along the entry paused one moment at her mistress door and raised her hands in mute appeal to heaven and then turned and glided into her own room it was a quiet neat apartment on the same floor with her mistress there was a pleasant sunny window where she had often sat singing at her sewing there a little case of books and various little fancy articles ranged by them the gifts of christmas holidays there was her simple wardrobe in the closet and in the drawershere was in short her home and on the whole a happy one it had been to her but there on the bed lay her slumbering boy his long curls falling negligently around his unconscious face his rosy mouth half open his little fat hands thrown out over the bedclothes and a smile spread like a sunbeam over his whole face  poor boy poor fellow said eliza they have sold you but your mother will save you yet  no tear dropped over that pillow in such straits as these the heart has no tears to giveit drops only blood bleeding itself away in silence she took a piece of paper and a pencil and wrote hastily  o missis dear missis dont think me ungratefuldont think hard of me any wayi heard all you and master said tonight i am going to try to save my boyyou will not blame me god bless and reward you for all your kindness  hastily folding and directing this she went to a drawer and made up a little package of clothing for her boy which she tied with a handkerchief firmly round her waist and so fond is a mothers remembrance that even in the terrors of that hour she did not forget to put in the little package one or two of his favorite toys reserving a gayly painted parrot to amuse him when she should be called on to awaken him it was some trouble to arouse the little sleeper but after some effort he sat up and was playing with his bird while his mother was putting on her bonnet and shawl  where are you going mother said he as she drew near the bed with his little coat and cap  his mother drew near and looked so earnestly into his eyes that he at once divined that something unusual was the matter  hush harry she said mustnt speak loud or they will hear us a wicked man was coming to take little harry away from his mother and carry him way off in the dark but mother wont let himshes going to put on her little boys cap and coat and run off with him so the ugly man cant catch him  saying these words she had tied and buttoned on the childs simple outfit and taking him in her arms she whispered to him to be very still and opening a door in her room which led into the outer verandah she glided noiselessly out  it was a sparkling frosty starlight night and the mother wrapped the shawl close round her child as perfectly quiet with vague terror he clung round her neck  old bruno a great newfoundland who slept at the end of the porch rose with a low growl as she came near she gently spoke his name and the animal an old pet and playmate of hers instantly wagging his tail prepared to follow her though apparently revolving much in this simple dogs head what such an indiscreet midnight promenade might mean some dim ideas of imprudence or impropriety in the measure seemed to embarrass him considerably for he often stopped as eliza glided forward and looked wistfully first at her and then at the house and then as if reassured by reflection he pattered along after her again a few minutes brought them to the window of uncle toms cottage and eliza stopping tapped lightly on the windowpane  the prayermeeting at uncle toms had in the order of hymnsinging been protracted to a very late hour and as uncle tom had indulged himself in a few lengthy solos afterwards the consequence was that although it was now between twelve and one oclock he and his worthy helpmeet were not yet asleep  good lord whats that said aunt chloe starting up and hastily drawing the curtain my sakes alive if it ant lizy get on your clothes old man quicktheres old bruno too a pawin round what on airth im gwine to open the door  and suiting the action to the word the door flew open and the light of the tallow candle which tom had hastily lighted fell on the haggard face and dark wild eyes of the fugitive  lord bless youim skeered to look at ye lizy are ye tuck sick or whats come over ye  im running awayuncle tom and aunt chloecarrying off my childmaster sold him  sold him echoed both lifting up their hands in dismay  yes sold him said eliza firmly i crept into the closet by mistress door tonight and i heard master tell missis that he had sold my harry and you uncle tom both to a trader and that he was going off this morning on his horse and that the man was to take possession today  tom had stood during this speech with his hands raised and his eyes dilated like a man in a dream slowly and gradually as its meaning came over him he collapsed rather than seated himself on his old chair and sunk his head down upon his knees  the good lord have pity on us said aunt chloe o it dont seem as if it was true what has he done that masr should sell him  he hasnt done anythingit isnt for that master dont want to sell and missis shes always good i heard her plead and beg for us but he told her t was no use that he was in this mans debt and that this man had got the power over him and that if he didnt pay him off clear it would end in his having to sell the place and all the people and move off yes i heard him say there was no choice between selling these two and selling all the man was driving him so hard master said he was sorry but oh missisyou ought to have heard her talk if she ant a christian and an angel there never was one im a wicked girl to leave her so but then i cant help it she said herself one soul was worth more than the world and this boy has a soul and if i let him be carried off who knows whatll become of it it must be right but if it ant right the lord forgive me for i cant help doing it  well old man said aunt chloe why dont you go too will you wait to be toted down river where they kill niggers with hard work and starving id a heap rather die than go there any day theres time for yebe off with lizyyouve got a pass to come and go any time come bustle up and ill get your things together  tom slowly raised his head and looked sorrowfully but quietly around and said  no noi ant going let eliza goits her right i wouldnt be the one to say notant in natur for her to stay but you heard what she said if i must be sold or all the people on the place and everything go to rack why let me be sold i spose i can bar it as well as any on em he added while something like a sob and a sigh shook his broad rough chest convulsively masr always found me on the spothe always will i never have broke trust nor used my pass no ways contrary to my word and i never will its better for me alone to go than to break up the place and sell all masr ant to blame chloe and hell take care of you and the poor  here he turned to the rough trundle bed full of little woolly heads and broke fairly down he leaned over the back of the chair and covered his face with his large hands sobs heavy hoarse and loud shook the chair and great tears fell through his fingers on the floor just such tears sir as you dropped into the coffin where lay your firstborn son such tears woman as you shed when you heard the cries of your dying babe for sir he was a manand you are but another man and woman though dressed in silk and jewels you are but a woman and in lifes great straits and mighty griefs ye feel but one sorrow  and now said eliza as she stood in the door i saw my husband only this afternoon and i little knew then what was to come they have pushed him to the very last standing place and he told me today that he was going to run away do try if you can to get word to him tell him how i went and why i went and tell him im going to try and find canada you must give my love to him and tell him if i never see him again she turned away and stood with her back to them for a moment and then added in a husky voice tell him to be as good as he can and try and meet me in the kingdom of heaven  call bruno in there she added shut the door on him poor beast he mustnt go with me  a few last words and tears a few simple adieus and blessings and clasping her wondering and affrighted child in her arms she glided noiselessly away    chapter vi  discovery   mr and mrs shelby after their protracted discussion of the night before did not readily sink to repose and in consequence slept somewhat later than usual the ensuing morning  i wonder what keeps eliza said mrs shelby after giving her bell repeated pulls to no purpose  mr shelby was standing before his dressingglass sharpening his razor and just then the door opened and a colored boy entered with his shavingwater  andy said his mistress step to elizas door and tell her i have rung for her three times poor thing she added to herself with a sigh  andy soon returned with eyes very wide in astonishment  lor missis lizys drawers is all open and her things all lying every which way and i believe shes just done clared out  the truth flashed upon mr shelby and his wife at the same moment he exclaimed  then she suspected it and shes off  the lord be thanked said mrs shelby i trust she is  wife you talk like a fool really it will be something pretty awkward for me if she is haley saw that i hesitated about selling this child and hell think i connived at it to get him out of the way it touches my honor and mr shelby left the room hastily  there was great running and ejaculating and opening and shutting of doors and appearance of faces in all shades of color in different places for about a quarter of an hour one person only who might have shed some light on the matter was entirely silent and that was the head cook aunt chloe silently and with a heavy cloud settled down over her once joyous face she proceeded making out her breakfast biscuits as if she heard and saw nothing of the excitement around her  very soon about a dozen young imps were roosting like so many crows on the verandah railings each one determined to be the first one to apprize the strange masr of his ill luck  hell be rael mad ill be bound said andy  wont he swar said little black jake  yes for he does swar said woollyheaded mandy i hearn him yesterday at dinner i hearn all about it then cause i got into the closet where missis keeps the great jugs and i hearn every word and mandy who had never in her life thought of the meaning of a word she had heard more than a black cat now took airs of superior wisdom and strutted about forgetting to state that though actually coiled up among the jugs at the time specified she had been fast asleep all the time  when at last haley appeared booted and spurred he was saluted with the bad tidings on every hand the young imps on the verandah were not disappointed in their hope of hearing him swar which he did with a fluency and fervency which delighted them all amazingly as they ducked and dodged hither and thither to be out of the reach of his ridingwhip and all whooping off together they tumbled in a pile of immeasurable giggle on the withered turf under the verandah where they kicked up their heels and shouted to their full satisfaction  if i had the little devils muttered haley between his teeth  but you hant got em though said andy with a triumphant flourish and making a string of indescribable mouths at the unfortunate traders back when he was fairly beyond hearing  i say now shelby this yer s a most extrornary business said haley as he abruptly entered the parlor it seems that gal s off with her young un  mr haley mrs shelby is present said mr shelby  i beg pardon maam said haley bowing slightly with a still lowering brow but still i say as i said before this yers a singlar report is it true sir  sir said mr shelby if you wish to communicate with me you must observe something of the decorum of a gentleman andy take mr haleys hat and ridingwhip take a seat sir yes sir i regret to say that the young woman excited by overhearing or having reported to her something of this business has taken her child in the night and made off  i did expect fair dealing in this matter i confess said haley  well sir said mr shelby turning sharply round upon him what am i to understand by that remark if any man calls my honor in question i have but one answer for him  the trader cowered at this and in a somewhat lower tone said that it was plaguy hard on a fellow that had made a fair bargain to be gulled that way  mr haley said mr shelby if i did not think you had some cause for disappointment i should not have borne from you the rude and unceremonious style of your entrance into my parlor this morning i say thus much however since appearances call for it that i shall allow of no insinuations cast upon me as if i were at all partner to any unfairness in this matter moreover i shall feel bound to give you every assistance in the use of horses servants c in the recovery of your property so in short haley said he suddenly dropping from the tone of dignified coolness to his ordinary one of easy frankness the best way for you is to keep goodnatured and eat some breakfast and we will then see what is to be done  mrs shelby now rose and said her engagements would prevent her being at the breakfasttable that morning and deputing a very respectable mulatto woman to attend to the gentlemens coffee at the sideboard she left the room  old lady dont like your humble servant over and above said haley with an uneasy effort to be very familiar  i am not accustomed to hear my wife spoken of with such freedom said mr shelby dryly  beg pardon of course only a joke you know said haley forcing a laugh  some jokes are less agreeable than others rejoined shelby  devilish free now ive signed those papers cuss him muttered haley to himself quite grand since yesterday  never did fall of any prime minister at court occasion wider surges of sensation than the report of toms fate among his compeers on the place it was the topic in every mouth everywhere and nothing was done in the house or in the field but to discuss its probable results elizas flightan unprecedented event on the placewas also a great accessory in stimulating the general excitement  black sam as he was commonly called from his being about three shades blacker than any other son of ebony on the place was revolving the matter profoundly in all its phases and bearings with a comprehensiveness of vision and a strict lookout to his own personal wellbeing that would have done credit to any white patriot in washington  its an ill wind dat blow nowhardat ar a fact said sam sententiously giving an additional hoist to his pantaloons and adroitly substituting a long nail in place of a missing suspenderbutton with which effort of mechanical genius he seemed highly delighted  yes its an ill wind blows nowhar he repeated now dar toms downwal course ders room for some nigger to be upand why not dis niggerdats de idee tom a ridin round de countryboots blackedpass in his pocketall grand as cuffeebut who he now why shouldnt samdats what i want to know  halloo samo sam masr wants

like a fool but lor shell bring him to i knows well enough how thatll beits allers best to stand missis side the fence now i tell yer  black sam upon this scratched his woolly pate which if it did not contain very profound wisdom still contained a great deal of a particular species much in demand among politicians of all complexions and countries and vulgarly denominated knowing which side the bread is buttered so stopping with grave consideration he again gave a hitch to his pantaloons which was his regularly organized method of assisting his mental perplexities  der ant no sayingneverbout no kind o thing in dis yer world he said at last sam spoke like a philosopher emphasizing thisas if he had had a large experience in different sorts of worlds and therefore had come to his conclusions advisedly  now sartin id a said that missis would a scoured the varsal world after lizy added sam thoughtfully  so she would said andy but cant ye see through a ladder ye black nigger missis dont want dis yer masr haley to get lizys boy dats de go  high said sam with an indescribable intonation known only to those who have heard it among the negroes  and ill tell yer more n all said andy i specs youd better be making tracks for dem hossesmighty sudden toofor i hearn missis quirin arter yerso youve stood foolin long enough  sam upon this began to bestir himself in real earnest and after a while appeared bearing down gloriously towards the house with bill and jerry in a full canter and adroitly throwing himself off before they had any idea of stopping he brought them up alongside of the horsepost like a tornado haleys horse which was a skittish young colt winced and bounced and pulled hard at his halter  ho ho said sam skeery ar ye and his black visage lighted up with a curious mischievous gleam ill fix ye now said he  there was a large beechtree overshadowing the place and the small sharp triangular beechnuts lay scattered thickly on the ground with one of these in his fingers sam approached the colt stroked and patted and seemed apparently busy in soothing his agitation on pretence of adjusting the saddle he adroitly slipped under it the sharp little nut in such a manner that the least weight brought upon the saddle would annoy the nervous sensibilities of the animal without leaving any perceptible graze or wound  dar he said rolling his eyes with an approving grin me fix em  at this moment mrs shelby appeared on the balcony beckoning to him sam approached with as good a determination to pay court as did ever suitor after a vacant place at st james or washington  why have you been loitering so sam i sent andy to tell you to hurry  lord bless you missis said sam horses wont be cotched all in a minit theyd done clared out way down to the south pasture and the lord knows whar  sam how often must i tell you not to say lord bless you and the lord knows and such things its wicked  o lord bless my soul i done forgot missis i wont say nothing of

well sam you are to go with mr haley to show him the road and help him be careful of the horses sam you know jerry was a little lame last week dont ride them too fast  mrs shelby spoke the last words with a low voice and strong emphasis  let dis child alone for dat said sam rolling up his eyes with a volume of meaning lord knows high didnt say dat said he suddenly catching his breath with a ludicrous flourish of apprehension which made his mistress laugh spite of herself yes missis ill look out for de hosses  now andy said sam returning to his stand under the beechtrees you see i wouldnt be t all surprised if dat ar genlmans crittur should gib a fling by and by when he comes to be a gettin up you know andy critturs will do such things and therewith sam poked andy in the side in a highly suggestive manner  high said andy with an air of instant appreciation  yes you see andy missis wants to make timedat ars clar to der most ornary bserver i jis make a little for her now you see get all dese yer hosses loose caperin permiscus round dis yer lot and down to de wood dar and i spec masr wont be off in a hurry  andy grinned  yer see said sam yer see andy if any such thing should happen as that masr haleys horse should begin to act contrary and cut up you and i jist lets go of ourn to help him and well help himoh yes and sam and andy laid their heads back on their shoulders and broke into a low immoderate laugh snapping their fingers and flourishing their heels with exquisite delight  at this instant haley appeared on the verandah somewhat mollified by certain cups of very good coffee he came out smiling and talking in tolerably restored humor sam and andy clawing for certain fragmentary palmleaves which they were in the habit of considering as hats flew to the horseposts to be ready to help masr  sams palmleaf had been ingeniously disentangled from all pretensions to braid as respects its brim and the slivers starting apart and standing upright gave it a blazing air of freedom and defiance quite equal to that of any fejee chief while the whole brim of andys being departed bodily he rapped the crown on his head with a dexterous thump and looked about well pleased as if to say who says i havent got a hat  well boys said haley look alive now we must lose no time  not a bit of him masr said sam putting haleys rein in his hand and holding his stirrup while andy was untying the other two horses  the instant haley touched the saddle the mettlesome creature bounded from the earth with a sudden spring that threw his master sprawling some feet off on the soft dry turf sam with frantic ejaculations made a dive at the reins but only succeeded in brushing the blazing palmleaf aforenamed into the horses eyes which by no means tended to allay the confusion of his nerves so with great vehemence he overturned sam and giving two or three contemptuous snorts flourished his heels vigorously in the air and was soon prancing away towards the lower end of the lawn followed by bill and jerry whom andy had not failed to let loose according to contract speeding them off with various direful ejaculations and now ensued a miscellaneous scene of confusion sam and andy ran and shouteddogs barked here and thereand mike mose mandy fanny and all the smaller specimens on the place both male and female raced clapped hands whooped and shouted with outrageous officiousness and untiring zeal  haleys horse which was a white one and very fleet and spirited appeared to enter into the spirit of the scene with great gusto and having for his coursing ground a lawn of nearly half a mile in extent gently sloping down on every side into indefinite woodland he appeared to take infinite delight in seeing how near he could allow his pursuers to approach him and then when within a hands breadth whisk off with a start and a snort like a mischievous beast as he was and career far down into some alley of the woodlot nothing was further from sams mind than to have any one of the troop taken until such season as should seem to him most befittingand the exertions that he made were certainly most heroic like the sword of coeur de lion which always blazed in the front and thickest of the battle sams palmleaf was to be seen everywhere when there was the least danger that a horse could be caught there he would bear down full tilt shouting now for it cotch him cotch him in a way that would set everything to indiscriminate rout in a moment  haley ran up and down and cursed and swore and stamped miscellaneously mr shelby in vain tried to shout directions from the balcony and mrs shelby from her chamber window alternately laughed and wonderednot without some inkling of what lay at the bottom of all this confusion  at last about twelve oclock sam appeared triumphant mounted on jerry with haleys horse by his side reeking with sweat but with flashing eyes and dilated nostrils showing that the spirit of freedom had not yet entirely subsided  hes cotched he exclaimed triumphantly if t hadnt been for me they might a bust themselves all on em but i cotched him  you growled haley in no amiable mood if it hadnt been for you this never would have happened  lord bless us masr said sam in a tone of the deepest concern and me that has been racin and chasin till the sweat jest pours off me  well well said haley youve lost me near three hours with your cursed nonsense now lets be off and have no more fooling  why masr said sam in a deprecating tone i believe you mean to kill us all clar horses and all here we are all just ready to drop down and the critters all in a reek of sweat why masr wont think of startin on now till arter dinner masrs hoss wants rubben down see how he splashed hisself and jerry limps too dont think missis would be willin to have us start dis yer way no how lord bless you masr we can ketch up if we do stop lizy never was no great of a walker  mrs shelby who greatly to her amusement had overheard this conversation from the verandah now resolved to do her part she came forward and courteously expressing her concern for haleys accident pressed him to stay to dinner saying that the cook should bring it on the table immediately  thus all things considered haley with rather an equivocal grace proceeded to the parlor while sam rolling his eyes after him with unutterable meaning proceeded gravely with the horses to the stableyard  did yer see him andy did yer see him said sam when he had got fairly beyond the shelter of the barn and fastened the horse to a post o lor if it warnt as good as a meetin now to see him a dancin and kickin and swarin at us didnt i hear him swar away ole fellow says i to myself  will yer have yer hoss now or wait till you cotch him says i lor andy i think i can

i was a standin as innercent and as humble  lor i seed you said andy ant you an old hoss sam  rather specks i am said sam did yer see missis up stars at the winder i seed her laughin  im sure i was

dont feel no ways ashamed to take idees from you we oughtenter overlook nobody andy cause the smartest on us gets tripped up sometimes and so andy lets go up to the house now ill be boun missisll give us an uncommon good bite dis yer time    chapter vii  the mothers struggle   it is impossible to conceive of a human creature more wholly desolate and forlorn than eliza when she turned her footsteps from uncle toms cabin  her husbands suffering and dangers and the danger of her child all blended in her mind with a confused and stunning sense of the risk she was running in leaving the only home she had ever known and cutting loose from the protection of a friend whom she loved and revered then there was the parting from every familiar objectthe place where she had grown up the trees under which she had played the groves where she had walked many an evening in happier days by the side of her young husbandeverything as it lay in the clear frosty starlight seemed to speak reproachfully to her and ask her whither could she go from a home like that  but stronger than all was maternal love wrought into a paroxysm of frenzy by the near approach of a fearful danger her boy was old enough to have walked by her side and in an indifferent case she would only have led him by the hand but now the bare thought of putting him out of her arms made her shudder and she strained him to her bosom with a convulsive grasp as she went rapidly forward  the frosty ground creaked beneath her feet and she trembled at the sound every quaking leaf and fluttering shadow sent the blood backward to her heart and quickened her footsteps she wondered within herself at the strength that seemed to be come upon her for she felt the weight of her boy as if it had been a feather and every flutter of fear seemed to increase the supernatural power that bore her on while from her pale lips burst forth in frequent ejaculations the prayer to a friend abovelord help lord save me  if it were your harry mother or your willie that were going to be torn from you by a brutal trader tomorrow morningif you had seen the man and heard that the papers were signed and delivered and you had only from twelve oclock till morning to make good your escapehow fast could you walk how many miles could you make in those few brief hours with the darling at your bosomthe little sleepy head on your shoulderthe small soft arms trustingly holding on to your neck  for the child slept at first the novelty and alarm kept him waking but his mother so hurriedly repressed every breath or sound and so assured him that if he were only still she would certainly save him that he clung quietly round her neck only asking as he found himself sinking to sleep  mother i dont need to keep awake do i  no my darling sleep if you want to  but mother if i do get asleep you wont let him get me  no so may god help me said his mother with a paler cheek and a brighter light in her large dark eyes  youre sure ant you mother  yes sure said the mother in a voice that startled herself for it seemed to her to come from a spirit within that was no part of her and the boy dropped his little weary head on her shoulder and was soon asleep how the touch of those warm arms the gentle breathings that came in her neck seemed to add fire and spirit to her movements it seemed to her as if strength poured into her in electric streams from every gentle touch and movement of the sleeping confiding child sublime is the dominion of the mind over the body that for a time can make flesh and nerve impregnable and string the sinews like steel so that the weak become so mighty  the boundaries of the farm the grove the woodlot passed by her dizzily as she walked on and still she went leaving one familiar object after another slacking not pausing not till reddening daylight found her many a long mile from all traces of any familiar objects upon the open highway  she had often been with her mistress to visit some connections in the little village of t not far from the ohio river and knew the road well to go thither to escape across the ohio river were the first hurried outlines of her plan of escape beyond that she could only hope in god  when horses and vehicles began to move along the highway with that alert perception peculiar to a state of excitement and which seems to be a sort of inspiration she became aware that her headlong pace and distracted air might bring on her remark and suspicion she therefore put the boy on the ground and adjusting her dress and bonnet she walked on at as rapid a pace as she thought consistent with the preservation of appearances in her little bundle she had provided a store of cakes and apples which she used as expedients for quickening the speed of the child rolling the apple some yards before them when the boy would run with all his might after it and this ruse often repeated carried them over many a halfmile  after a while they came to a thick patch of woodland through which murmured a clear brook as the child complained of hunger and thirst she climbed over the fence with him and sitting down behind a large rock which concealed them from the road she gave him a breakfast out of her little package the boy wondered and grieved that she could not eat and when putting his arms round her neck he tried to wedge some of his cake into her mouth it seemed to her that the rising in her throat would choke her  no no harry darling mother cant eat till you are safe we must go onontill we come to the river and she hurried again into the road and again constrained herself to walk regularly and composedly forward  she was many miles past any neighborhood where she was personally known if she should chance to meet any who knew her she reflected that the wellknown kindness of the family would be of itself a blind to suspicion as making it an unlikely supposition that she could be a fugitive as she was also so white as not to be known as of colored lineage without a critical survey and her child was white also it was much easier for her to pass on unsuspected  on this presumption she stopped at noon at a neat farmhouse to rest herself and buy some dinner for her child and self for as the danger decreased with the distance the supernatural tension of the nervous system lessened and she found herself both weary and hungry  the good woman kindly and gossipping seemed rather pleased than otherwise with having somebody come in to talk with and accepted without examination elizas statement that she was going on a little piece to spend a week with her friendsall which she hoped in her heart might prove strictly true  an hour before sunset she entered the village of t by the ohio river weary and footsore but still strong in heart her first glance was at the river which lay like jordan between her and the canaan of liberty on the other side  it was now early spring and the river was swollen and turbulent great cakes of floating ice were swinging heavily to and fro in the turbid waters owing to the peculiar form of the shore on the kentucky side the land bending far out into the water the ice had been lodged and detained in great quantities and the narrow channel which swept round the bend was full of ice piled one cake over another thus forming a temporary barrier to the descending ice which lodged and formed a great undulating raft filling up the whole river and extending almost to the kentucky shore  eliza stood for a moment contemplating this unfavorable aspect of things which she saw at once must prevent the usual ferryboat from running and then turned into a small public house on the bank to make a few inquiries  the hostess who was busy in various fizzing and stewing operations over the fire preparatory to the evening meal stopped with a fork in her hand as elizas sweet and plaintive voice arrested her  what is it she said  isnt there any ferry or boat that takes people over to b now she said  no indeed said the woman the boats has stopped running  elizas look of dismay and disappointment struck the woman and she said inquiringly  may be youre wanting to get overanybody sick ye seem mighty anxious  ive got a child thats very dangerous said eliza i never heard of it till last night and ive walked quite a piece today in hopes to get to the ferry  well now thats onlucky said the woman whose motherly sympathies were much aroused im relly consarned for ye solomon she called from the window towards a small back building a man in leather apron and very dirty hands appeared at the door  i say sol said the woman is that ar man going to tote them barls over tonight  he said he should try if t was any way prudent said the man  theres a man a piece down here thats going over with some truck this evening if he durs to hell be in here to supper tonight so youd better set down and wait thats a sweet little fellow added the woman offering him a cake  but the child wholly exhausted cried with weariness  poor fellow he isnt used to walking and ive hurried him on so said eliza  well take him into this room said the woman opening into a small bedroom where stood a comfortable bed eliza laid the weary boy upon it and held his hands in hers till he was fast asleep for her there was no rest as a fire in her bones the thought of the pursuer urged her on and she gazed with longing eyes on the sullen surging waters that lay between her and liberty  here we must take our leave of her for the present to follow the course of her pursuers   though mrs shelby had promised that the dinner should be hurried on table yet it was soon seen as the thing has often been seen before that it required more than one to make a bargain so although the order was fairly given out in haleys hearing and carried to aunt chloe by at least half a dozen juvenile messengers that dignitary only gave certain very gruff snorts and tosses of her head and went on with every operation in an unusually leisurely and circumstantial manner  for some singular reason an impression seemed to reign among the servants generally that missis would not be particularly disobliged by delay and it was wonderful what a number of counter accidents occurred constantly to retard the course of things one luckless wight contrived to upset the gravy and then gravy had to be got up de novo with due care and formality aunt chloe watching and stirring with dogged precision answering shortly to all suggestions of haste that she warnt a going to have raw gravy on the table to help nobodys catchings one tumbled down with the water and had to go to the spring for more and another precipitated the butter into the path of events and there was from time to time giggling news brought into the kitchen that masr haley was mighty oneasy and that he couldnt sit in his cheer no ways but was a walkin and stalkin to the winders and through the porch  sarves him right said aunt chloe indignantly hell get wus nor oneasy one of these days if he dont mend his ways his masterll be sending for him and then see how hell look  hell go to torment and no mistake said little jake  he desarves it said aunt chloe grimly hes broke a many many many heartsi tell ye all she said stopping with a fork uplifted in her hands its like what masr george reads in ravelationssouls a callin under the altar and a callin on the lord for vengeance on sichand by and by the lord hell hear emso he will  aunt chloe who was much revered in the kitchen was listened to with open mouth and the dinner being now fairly sent in the whole kitchen was at leisure to gossip with her and to listen to her remarks  sichll be burnt up forever and no mistake wont ther said andy  id be glad to see it ill be boun said little jake  chilen said a voice that made them all start it was uncle tom who had come in and stood listening to the conversation at the door  chilen he said im afeard you dont know what yere sayin forever is a dreful word chilen its awful to think on t you oughtenter wish that ar to any human crittur  we wouldnt to anybody but the souldrivers said andy nobody can help wishing it to them they s so awful wicked  dont natur herself kinder cry out on em said aunt chloe dont dey tear der suckin baby right off his mothers breast and sell him and der little children as is crying and holding on by her clothesdont dey pull em off and sells em dont dey tear wife and husband apart said aunt chloe beginning to cry when its jest takin the very life on emand all the while does they feel one bit dont dey drink and smoke and take it oncommon easy lor if the devil dont get them whats he good for and aunt chloe covered her face with her checked apron and began to sob in good earnest  pray for them that spitefully use you the good book says says tom  pray for em said aunt chloe lor its too tough i cant pray for em  its natur chloe and natur s strong said tom but the lords grace is stronger besides you oughter think what an awful state a poor critturs soul s in thatll do them ar thingsyou oughter thank god that you ant like him chloe im sure id rather be sold ten thousand times over than to have all that ar poor critturs got to answer for  so d i a heap said jake lor shouldnt we cotch it andy  andy shrugged his shoulders and gave an acquiescent whistle  im glad masr didnt go off this morning as he looked to said tom that ar hurt me more than sellin it did mebbe it might have been natural for him but t would have come despt hard on me as has known him from a baby but ive seen masr and i begin ter feel sort o reconciled to the lords will now masr couldnt help hisself he did right but im feared things will be kinder goin to rack when im gone masr cant be spected to be a pryin round everywhar as ive done a keepin up all the ends the boys all means well but they s powerful carless that ar troubles me  the bell here rang and tom was summoned to the parlor  tom said his master kindly i want you to notice that i give this gentleman bonds to forfeit a thousand dollars if you are not on the spot when he wants you hes going today to look after his other business and you can have the day to yourself go anywhere you like boy  thank you masr said tom  and mind yourself said the trader and dont come it over your master with any o yer nigger tricks for ill take every cent out of him if you ant thar if hed hear to me he wouldnt trust any on yeslippery as eels  masr said tomand he stood very straighti was jist eight years old when ole missis put you into my arms and you wasnt a year old thar says she tom thats to be your young masr take good care on him says she and now i jist ask you masr have i ever broke word to you or gone contrary to you specially since i was a christian  mr shelby was fairly overcome and the tears rose to his eyes  my good boy said he the lord knows you say but the truth and if i was able to help it all the world shouldnt buy you  and sure as i am a christian woman said mrs shelby you shall be redeemed as soon as i can any bring together means sir she said to haley take good account of who you sell him to and let me know  lor yes for that matter said the trader i may bring him up in a year not much the wuss for wear and trade him back  ill trade with you then and make it for your advantage said mrs shelby  of course said the trader all s equal with me lives trade em up as down so i does a good business all i want is a livin you know maam thats all any on us wants i spose  mr and mrs shelby both felt annoyed and degraded by the familiar impudence of the trader and yet both saw the absolute necessity of putting a constraint on their feelings the more hopelessly sordid and insensible he appeared the greater became mrs shelbys dread of his succeeding in recapturing eliza and her child and of course the greater her motive for detaining him by every female artifice she therefore graciously smiled assented chatted familiarly and did all she could to make time pass imperceptibly  at two oclock sam and andy brought the horses up to the posts apparently greatly refreshed and invigorated by the scamper of the morning  sam was there new oiled from dinner with an abundance of zealous and ready officiousness as haley approached he was boasting in flourishing style to andy of the evident and eminent success of the operation now that he had farly come to it  your master i spose dont keep no dogs said haley thoughtfully as he prepared to mount  heaps on em said sam triumphantly thars brunohes a roarer and besides that bout every nigger of us keeps a pup of some natur or uther  poh said haleyand he said something else too with regard to the said dogs at which sam muttered  i dont see no use cussin on em no way  but your master dont keep no dogs i pretty much know he dont for trackin out niggers  sam knew exactly what he meant but he kept on a look of earnest and desperate simplicity  our dogs all smells round considable sharp i spect theys the kind though they hant never had no practice they s far dogs though at most anything if youd get em started here bruno he called whistling to the lumbering newfoundland who came pitching tumultuously toward them  you go hang said haley getting up come tumble up now  sam tumbled up accordingly dexterously contriving to tickle andy as he did so which occasioned andy to split out into a laugh greatly to haleys indignation who made a cut at him with his ridingwhip  i s stonished at yer andy said sam with awful gravity this yers a seris bisness andy yer mustnt be a makin game this yer ant no way to help masr  i shall take the straight road to the river said haley decidedly after they had come to the boundaries of the estate i know the way of all of emthey makes tracks for the underground  sartin said sam dats de idee masr haley hits de thing right in de middle now ders two roads to de riverde dirt road and der pikewhich masr mean to take  andy looked up innocently at sam surprised at hearing this new geographical fact but instantly confirmed what he said by a vehement reiteration  cause said sam id rather be clined to magine that lizy d take de dirt road bein its the least travelled  haley notwithstanding that he was a very old bird and naturally inclined to be suspicious of chaff was rather brought up by this view of the case  if yer warnt both on yer such cussed liars now he said contemplatively as he pondered a moment  the pensive reflective tone in which this was spoken appeared to amuse andy prodigiously and he drew a little behind and shook so as apparently to run a great risk of failing off his horse while sams face was immovably composed into the most doleful gravity  course said sam masr can do as hed ruther go de straight road if masr thinks bestits all one to us now when i study pon it i think de straight road de best deridedly  she would naturally go a lonesome way said haley thinking aloud and not minding sams remark  dar ant no sayin said sam gals is pecular they never does nothin ye thinks they will mose genlly the contrary gals is natlly made contrary and so if you thinks theyve gone one road it is sartin youd better go t other and then youll be sure to find em now my private pinion is lizy took der road so i think wed better take de straight one  this profound generic view of the female sex did not seem to dispose haley particularly to the straight road and he announced decidedly that he should go the other and asked sam when they should come to it  a little piece ahead said sam giving a wink to andy with the eye which was on andys side of the head and he added gravely but ive studded on de matter and im quite clar we ought not to go dat ar way i nebber been over it no way its despit lonesome and we might lose our waywhar wed come to de lord only knows  nevertheless said haley i shall go that way  now i think on t i think i hearn em tell that dat ar road was all fenced up and down by der creek and thar ant it andy  andy wasnt certain hed only hearn tell about that road but never been over it in short he was strictly noncommittal  haley accustomed to strike the balance of probabilities between lies of greater or lesser magnitude thought that it lay in favor of the dirt road aforesaid the mention of the thing he thought he perceived was involuntary on sams part at first and his confused attempts to dissuade him he set down to a desperate lying on second thoughts as being unwilling to implicate liza  when therefore sam indicated the road haley plunged briskly into it followed by sam and andy  now the road in fact was an old one that had formerly been a thoroughfare to the river but abandoned for many years after the laying of the new pike it was open for about an hours ride and after that it was cut across by various farms and fences sam knew this fact perfectly wellindeed the road had been so long closed up that andy had never heard of it he therefore rode along with an air of dutiful submission only groaning and vociferating occasionally that t was despt rough and bad for jerrys foot  now i jest give yer warning said haley i know yer yer wont get me to turn off this road with all yer fussinso you shet up  masr will go his own way said sam with rueful submission at the same time winking most portentously to andy whose delight was now very near the explosive point  sam was in wonderful spiritsprofessed to keep a very brisk lookoutat one time exclaiming that he saw a gals bonnet on the top of some distant eminence or calling to andy if that thar wasnt lizy down in the hollow always making these exclamations in some rough or craggy part of the road where the sudden quickening of speed was a special inconvenience to all parties concerned and thus keeping haley in a state of constant commotion  after riding about an hour in this way the whole party made a precipitate and tumultuous descent into a barnyard belonging to a large farming establishment not a soul was in sight all the hands being employed in the fields but as the barn stood conspicuously and plainly square across the road it was evident that their journey in that direction had reached a decided finale  want dat ar what i telled masr said sam with an air of injured innocence how does strange gentleman spect to know more about a country dan de natives born and raised  you rascal said haley you knew all about this  didnt i tell yer i knowd and yer wouldnt believe me i telled masr t was all shet up and fenced up and i didnt spect we could get throughandy heard me  it was all too true to be disputed and the unlucky man had to pocket his wrath with the best grace he was able and all three faced to the right about and took up their line of march for the highway  in consequence of all the various delays it was about threequarters of an hour after eliza had laid her child to sleep in the village tavern that the party came riding into the same place eliza was standing by the window looking out in another direction when sams quick eye caught a glimpse of her haley and andy were two yards behind at this crisis sam contrived to have his hat blown off and uttered a loud and characteristic ejaculation which startled her at once she drew suddenly back the whole train swept by the window round to the front door  a thousand lives seemed to be concentrated in that one moment to eliza her room opened by a side door to the river she caught her child and sprang down the steps towards it the trader caught a full glimpse of her just as she was disappearing down the bank and throwing himself from his horse and calling loudly on sam and andy he was after her like a hound after a deer in that dizzy moment her feet to her scarce seemed to touch the ground and a moment brought her to the waters edge right on behind they came and nerved with strength such as god gives only to the desperate with one wild cry and flying leap she vaulted sheer over the turbid current by the shore on to the raft of ice beyond it was a desperate leapimpossible to anything but madness and despair and haley sam and andy instinctively cried out and lifted up their hands as she did it  the huge green fragment of ice on which she alighted pitched and creaked as her weight came on it but she staid there not a moment with wild cries and desperate energy she leaped to another and still another cake stumblingleapingslippingspringing upwards again her shoes are goneher stockings cut from her feetwhile blood marked every step but she saw nothing felt nothing till dimly as in a dream she saw the ohio side and a man helping her up the bank  yer a brave gal now whoever ye ar said the man with an oath  eliza recognized the voice and face for a man who owned a farm not far from her old home  o mr symmessave medo save medo hide me said elia  why whats this said the man why if tant shelbys gal  my childthis boyhed sold him there is his masr said she pointing to the kentucky shore o mr symmes youve got a little boy  so i have said the man as he roughly but kindly drew her up the steep bank besides youre a right brave gal i like grit wherever i see it  when they had gained the top of the bank the man paused  id be glad to do something for ye said he but then theres nowhar i could take ye the best i can do is to tell ye to go thar said he pointing to a large white house which stood by itself off the main street of the village go thar theyre kind folks thars no kind o danger but theyll help youtheyre up to all that sort o thing  the lord bless you said eliza earnestly  no casion no casion in the world said the man what ive dones of no count  and oh surely sir you wont tell any one  go to thunder gal what do you take a feller for in course not said the man come now go along like a likely sensible gal as you are youve arnt your liberty and you shall have it for all me  the woman folded her child to her bosom and walked firmly and swiftly away the man stood and looked after her  shelby now mebbe wont think this yer the most neighborly thing in the world but whats a feller to do if he catches one of my gals in the same fix hes welcome to pay back somehow i never could see no kind o critter a strivin and pantin and trying to clar theirselves with the dogs arter em and go agin em besides i dont see no kind of casion for me to be hunter and catcher for other folks neither  so spoke this poor heathenish kentuckian who had not been instructed in his constitutional relations and consequently was betrayed into acting in a sort of christianized manner which if he had been better situated and more enlightened he would not have been left to do  haley had stood a perfectly amazed spectator of the scene till eliza had disappeared up the bank when he turned a blank inquiring look on sam and andy  that ar was a tolable fair stroke of business said sam  the gal s got seven devils in her i believe said haley how like a wildcat she jumped  wal now said sam scratching his head i hope masrll scuse us trying dat ar road dont think i feel spry enough for dat ar no way and sam gave a hoarse chuckle  you laugh said the trader with a growl  lord bless you masr i couldnt help it now said sam giving way to the long pentup delight of his soul she looked so curis a leapin and springinice a crackinand only to hear herplump ker chunk ker splash spring lord how she goes it and sam and andy laughed till the tears rolled down their cheeks  ill make ye laugh t other side yer mouths said the trader laying about their heads with his ridingwhip  both ducked and ran shouting up the bank and were on their horses before he was up  goodevening masr said sam with much gravity i berry much spect missis be anxious bout jerry masr haley wont want us no longer missis wouldnt hear of our ridin the critters over lizys bridge tonight and with a facetious poke into andys ribs he started off followed by the latter at full speedtheir shouts of laughter coming faintly on the wind    chapter viii  elizas escape   eliza made her desperate retreat across the river just in the dusk of twilight the gray mist of evening rising slowly from the river enveloped her as she disappeared up the bank and the swollen current and floundering masses of ice presented a hopeless barrier between her and her pursuer haley therefore slowly and discontentedly returned to the little tavern to ponder further what was to be done the woman opened to him the door of a little parlor covered with a rag carpet where stood a table with a very shining black oilcloth sundry lank highbacked wood chairs with some plaster images in resplendent colors on the mantelshelf above a very dimlysmoking grate a long hardwood settle extended its uneasy length by the chimney and here haley sat him down to meditate on the instability of human hopes and happiness in general  what did i want with the little cuss now he said to himself that i should have got myself treed like a coon as i am this yer way and haley relieved himself by repeating over a not very select litany of imprecations on himself which though there was the best possible reason to consider them as true we shall as a matter of taste omit  he was startled by the loud and dissonant voice of a man who was apparently dismounting at the door he hurried to the window  by the land if this yer ant the nearest now to what ive heard folks call providence said haley i do blieve that ars tom loker  haley hastened out standing by the bar in the corner of the room was a brawny muscular man full six feet in height and broad in proportion he was dressed in a coat of buffaloskin made with the hair outward which gave him a shaggy and fierce appearance perfectly in keeping with the whole air of his physiognomy in the head and face every organ and lineament expressive of brutal and unhesitating violence was in a state of the highest possible development indeed could our readers fancy a bulldog come unto mans estate and walking about in a hat and coat they would have no unapt idea of the general style and effect of his physique he was accompanied by a travelling companion in many respects an exact contrast to himself he was short and slender lithe and catlike in his motions and had a peering mousing expression about his keen black eyes with which every feature of his face seemed sharpened into sympathy his thin long nose ran out as if it was eager to bore into the nature of things in general his sleek thin black hair was stuck eagerly forward and all his motions and evolutions expressed a dry cautious acuteness the great man poured out a big tumbler half full of raw spirits and gulped it down without a word the little man stood tiptoe and putting his head first to one side and then the other and snuffing considerately in the directions of the various bottles ordered at last a mint julep in a thin and quivering voice and with an air of great circumspection when poured out he took it and looked at it with a sharp complacent air like a man who thinks he has done about the right thing and hit the nail on the head and proceeded to dispose of it in short and welladvised sips  wal now whod a thought this yer luck ad come to me why loker how are ye said haley coming forward and extending his hand to the big man  the devil was the civil reply what brought you here haley  the mousing man who bore the name of marks instantly stopped his sipping and poking his head forward looked shrewdly on the new acquaintance as a cat sometimes looks at a moving dry leaf or some other possible object of pursuit  i say tom this yers the luckiest thing in the world im in a devil of a hobble and you must help me out  ugh aw like enough grunted his complacent acquaintance a body may be pretty sure of that when youre glad to see em something to be made off of em whats the blow now  youve got a friend here said haley looking doubtfully at marks partner perhaps  yes i have here marks heres that ar feller that i was in with in natchez  shall be pleased with his acquaintance said marks thrusting out a long thin hand like a ravens claw mr haley i believe  the same sir said haley and now gentlemen seein as weve met so happily i think ill stand up to a small matter of a treat in this here parlor so now old coon said he to the man at the bar get us hot water and sugar and cigars and plenty of the real stuff and well have a blowout  behold then the candles lighted the fire stimulated to the burning point in the grate and our three worthies seated round a table well spread with all the accessories to good fellowship enumerated before  haley began a pathetic recital of his peculiar troubles loker shut up his mouth and listened to him with gruff and surly attention marks who was anxiously and with much fidgeting compounding a tumbler of punch to his own peculiar taste occasionally looked up from his employment and poking his sharp nose and chin almost into haleys face gave the most earnest heed to the whole narrative the conclusion of it appeared to amuse him extremely for he shook his shoulders and sides in silence and perked up his thin lips with an air of great internal enjoyment  so then yer fairly sewed up ant ye he said he he he its neatly done too  this yer youngun business makes lots of trouble in the trade said haley dolefully  if we could get a breed of gals that didnt care now for their young uns said marks tell ye i think t would be bout the greatest modrn improvement i knows onand marks patronized his joke by a quiet introductory sniggle  jes so said haley i never couldnt see into it young uns is heaps of trouble to em one would think now theyd be glad to get clar on em but they arnt and the more trouble a young un is and the more good for nothing as a genl thing the tighter they sticks to em  wal mr haley said marks est pass the hot water yes sir you say est what i feel and allus have now i bought a gal once when i was in the tradea tight likely wench she was too and quite considerable smartand she had a young un that was misable sickly it had a crooked back or something or other and i jest gin t away to a man that thought hed take his chance raising on t being it didnt cost nothinnever thought yer know of the gals takin on about itbut lord yer oughter seen how she went on why relly she did seem to me to valley the child more cause t was sickly and cross and plagued her and she warnt making blieve neithercried about it she did and lopped round as if shed lost every friend she had it relly was droll to think on t lord there aint no end to womens notions  wal jest so with me said haley last summer down on red river i got a gal traded off on me with a likely lookin child enough and his eyes looked as bright as yourn but come to look i found him stone blind facthe was stone blind wal ye see i thought there warnt no harm in my jest passing him along and not sayin nothin and id got him nicely swapped off for a keg o whiskey but come to get him away from the gal she was jest like a tiger so t was before we started and i hadnt got my gang chained up so what should she do but ups on a cottonbale like a cat ketches a knife from one of the deck hands and i tell ye she made all fly for a minit till she saw t want no use and she jest turns round and pitches head first young un and all into the riverwent down plump and never ris  bah said tom loker who had listened to these stories with illrepressed disgustshifless both on ye my gals dont cut up no such shines i tell ye  indeed how do you help it said marks briskly  help it why i buys a gal and if shes got a young un to be sold i jest walks up and puts my fist to her face and says look here now if you give me one word out of your head ill smash yer face in i wont hear one wordnot the beginning of a word i says to em this yer young uns mine and not yourn and youve no kind o business with it im going to sell it first chance mind you dont cut up none o yer shines about it or ill make ye wish yed never been born i tell ye they sees it ant no play when i gets hold i makes em as whist as fishes and if one on em begins and gives a yelp why and mr loker brought down his fist with a thump that fully explained the hiatus  that ars what ye may call emphasis said marks poking haley in the side and going into another small giggle ant tom peculiar he he i say tom i spect you make em understand for all niggers heads is woolly they dont never have no doubt o your meaning tom if you ant the devil tom you s his twin brother ill say that for ye  tom received the compliment with becoming modesty and began to look as affable as was consistent as john bunyan says with his doggish nature  haley who had been imbibing very freely of the staple of the evening began to feel a sensible elevation and enlargement of his moral facultiesa phenomenon not unusual with gentlemen of a serious and reflective turn under similar circumstances  wal now tom he said ye relly is too bad as i alays have told ye ye know tom you and i used to talk over these yer matters down in natchez and i used to prove to ye that we made full as much and was as well off for this yer world by treatin on em well besides keepin a better chance for comin in the kingdom at last when wust comes to wust and thar ant nothing else left to get ye know  boh said tom dont i knowdont make me too sick with any yer stuffmy stomach is a leetle riled now and tom drank half a glass of raw brandy  i say said haley and leaning back in his chair and gesturing impressively ill say this now i alays meant to drive my trade so as to make money on t fust and foremost as much as any man but then trade ant everything and money ant everything cause we s all got souls i dont care now who hears me say itand i think a cussed sight on itso i may as well come out with it i blieve in religion and one of these days when ive got matters tight and snug i calculates to tend to my soul and them ar matters and so whats the use of doin any more wickedness than s relly necessaryit dont seem to me its t all prudent  tend to yer soul repeated tom contemptuously take a bright lookout to find a soul in yousave yourself any care on that score if the devil sifts you through a hair sieve he wont find one  why tom youre cross said haley why cant ye take it pleasant now when a fellers talking for your good  stop that ar jaw o yourn there said tom gruffly i can stand most any talk o yourn but your pious talkthat kills me right up after all whats the odds between me and you tant that you care one bit more or have a bit more feelinits clean sheer dog meanness wanting to cheat the devil and save your own skin dont i see through it and your gettin religion as you call it arter all is too pisin mean for any critturrun up a bill with the devil all your life and then sneak out when pay time comes bob  come come gentlemen i say this isnt business said marks theres different ways you know of looking

to orleans to speculate on ant it beautiful  tom whose great heavy mouth had stood ajar during this communication now suddenly snapped it together as a big dog closes on a piece of meat and seemed to

be a heap more relishin if they wasmore fun yer know  tom loker who as we have made it appear was a man of slow thoughts and movements here interrupted marks by bringing his heavy fist down on the

slowly rose to obey after exchanging a few words of further arrangement haley with visible reluctance handed over the fifty dollars to tom and the worthy trio separated for the night  if any of our refined and christian readers object to the society into which this scene introduces them let us beg them to begin and conquer their prejudices in time the catching business we beg to remind them is rising to the dignity of a lawful and patriotic profession if all the broad land between the mississippi and the pacific becomes one great market for bodies and souls and human property retains the locomotive tendencies of this nineteenth century the trader and catcher may yet be among our aristocracy   while this scene was going on at the tavern sam and andy in a state of high felicitation pursued their way home  sam was in the highest possible feather and expressed his exultation by all sorts of supernatural howls and ejaculations by divers odd motions and contortions of his whole system sometimes he would sit backward with his face to the horses tail and sides and then with a whoop and a somerset come right side up in his place again and drawing on a grave face begin to lecture andy in highsounding tones for laughing and playing the fool anon slapping his sides with his arms he would burst forth in peals of laughter that made the old woods ring as they passed with all these evolutions he contrived to keep the horses up to the top of their speed until between ten and eleven their heels resounded on the gravel at the end of the balcony mrs shelby flew to the railings  is that you sam where are they  masr haley s arestin at the tavern hes drefful fatigued missis  and eliza sam  wal shes clar cross jordan as a body may say in the land o canaan  why sam what do you mean said mrs shelby breathless and almost faint as the possible meaning of these words came over her  wal missis de lord he persarves his own lizys done gone over the river into hio as markably as if de lord took her over in a charrit of fire and two hosses  sams vein of piety was always uncommonly fervent in his mistress presence and he made great capital of scriptural figures and images  come up here sam said mr shelby who had followed on to the verandah and tell your mistress what she wants come come emily said he passing his arm round her you are cold and all in a shiver you allow yourself to feel too much  feel too much am not i a womana mother are we not both responsible to god for this poor girl my god lay not this sin to our charge  what sin emily you see yourself that we have only done what we were obliged to  theres an awful feeling of guilt about it though said mrs shelby i cant reason it away  here andy you nigger be alive called sam under the verandah take these yer hosses to der barn dont ye hear masr a callin and sam soon appeared palmleaf in hand at the parlor door  now sam tell us distinctly how the matter was said mr shelby where is eliza if you know  wal masr i saw her with my own eyes a crossin on the floatin ice she crossed most markably it wasnt no less nor a miracle and i saw a man help her up the hio side and then she was lost in the dusk  sam i think this rather apocryphalthis miracle crossing on floating ice isnt so easily done said mr shelby  easy couldnt nobody a done it without de lord why now said sam t was jist dis yer way masr haley and me and andy we comes up to de little tavern by the river and i rides a leetle aheadis so zealous to be a cotchin lizy that i couldnt hold in no wayand when i comes by the tavern winder sure enough there she was right in plain sight and dey diggin on behind wal i loses off my hat and sings out nuff to raise the dead course lizy she hars and she dodges back when masr haley he goes past the door and then i tell ye she clared out de side door she went down de river bankmasr haley he seed her and yelled out and him and me and andy we took arter down she come to the river and thar was the current running ten feet wide by the shore and over t other side ice a sawin and a jiggling up and down kinder as t were a great island we come right behind her and i thought my soul hed got her sure enoughwhen she gin sich a screech as i never hearn and thar she was clar over t other side of the current on the ice and then on she went a screeching and a jumpinthe ice went crack cwallop cracking chunk and she a boundin like a buck lord the spring that ar gals got in her ant common im o pinion  mrs shelby sat perfectly silent pale with excitement while sam told his story  god be praised she isnt dead she said but where is the poor child now  de lord will pervide said sam rolling up his eyes piously as ive been a sayin dis yer s a providence and no mistake as missis has allers been a instructin on us thars allers instruments ris up to do de lords will now if t hadnt been for me today shed a been took a dozen times warnt it i started off de hosses dis yer mornin and kept em chasin till nigh dinner time and didnt i car masr haley night five miles out of de road dis evening or else hed a come up with lizy as easy as a dog arter a coon these yer s all providences  they are a kind of providences that youll have to be pretty sparing of master sam i allow no such practices with gentlemen on my place said mr shelby with as much sternness as he could command under the circumstances  now there is no more use in making believe be angry with a negro than with a child both instinctively see the true state of the case through all attempts to affect the contrary and sam was in no wise disheartened by this rebuke though he assumed an air of doleful gravity and stood with the corners of his mouth lowered in most penitential style  masr quite rightquite it was ugly on metheres no disputin that ar and of course masr and missis wouldnt encourage no such works im sensible of dat ar but a poor nigger like me s mazin tempted to act ugly sometimes when fellers will cut up such shines as dat ar masr haley he ant no genlman no way anybodys been raised as ive been cant help a seein dat ar  well sam said mrs shelby as you appear to have a proper sense of your errors you may go now and tell aunt chloe she may get you some of that cold ham that was left of dinner today you and andy must be hungry  missis is a heap too good for us said sam making his bow with alacrity and departing  it will be perceived as has been before intimated that master sam had a native talent that might undoubtedly have raised him to eminence in political lifea talent of making capital out of everything that turned up to be invested for his own especial praise and glory and having done up his piety and humility as he trusted to the satisfaction of the parlor he clapped his palmleaf on his head with a sort of rakish freeandeasy air and proceeded to the dominions of aunt chloe with the intention of flourishing largely in the kitchen  ill speechify these yer niggers said sam to himself now ive got a chance lord ill reel it off to make em stare  it must be observed that one of sams especial delights had been to ride in attendance on his master to all kinds of political gatherings where roosted on some rail fence or perched aloft in some tree he would sit watching the orators with the greatest apparent gusto and then descending among the various brethren of his own color assembled on the same errand he would edify and delight them with the most ludicrous burlesques and imitations all delivered with the most imperturbable earnestness and solemnity and though the auditors immediately about him were generally of his own color it not infrequently happened that they were fringed pretty deeply with those of a fairer complexion who listened laughing and winking to sams great selfcongratulation in fact sam considered oratory as his vocation and never let slip an opportunity of magnifying his office  now between sam and aunt chloe there had existed from ancient times a sort of chronic feud or rather a decided coolness but as sam was meditating something in the provision department as the necessary and obvious foundation of his operations he determined on the present occasion to be eminently conciliatory for he well knew that although missis orders would undoubtedly be followed to the letter yet he should gain a considerable deal by enlisting the spirit also he therefore appeared before aunt chloe with a touchingly subdued resigned expression like one who has suffered immeasurable hardships in behalf of a persecuted fellowcreatureenlarged upon the fact that missis had directed him to come to aunt chloe for whatever might be wanting to make up the balance in his solids and fluidsand thus unequivocally acknowledged her right and supremacy in the cooking department and all thereto pertaining  the thing took accordingly no poor simple virtuous body was ever cajoled by the attentions of an electioneering politician with more ease than aunt chloe was won over by master sams suavities and if he had been the prodigal son himself he could not have been overwhelmed with more maternal bountifulness and he soon found himself seated happy and glorious over a large tin pan containing a sort of olla podrida of all that had appeared on the table for two or three days past savory morsels of ham golden blocks of corncake fragments of pie of every conceivable mathematical figure chicken wings gizzards and drumsticks all appeared in picturesque confusion and sam as monarch of all he surveyed sat with his palmleaf cocked rejoicingly to one side and patronizing andy at his right hand  the kitchen was full of all his compeers who had hurried and crowded in from the various cabins to hear the termination of the days exploits now was sams hour of glory the story of the day was rehearsed with all kinds of ornament and varnishing which might be necessary to heighten its effect for sam like some of our fashionable dilettanti never allowed a story to lose any of its gilding by passing through his hands roars of laughter attended the narration and were taken up and prolonged by all the smaller fry who were lying in any quantity about on the floor or perched in every corner in the height of the uproar and laughter sam however preserved an immovable gravity only from time to time rolling his eyes up and giving his auditors divers inexpressibly droll glances without departing from the sententious elevation of his oratory  yer see fellowcountrymen said sam elevating a turkeys leg with energy yer see now what dis yer chile s up ter for fendin yer allyes all on yer for him as tries to get one o our people is as good as tryin to get all yer see the principle s de samedat ars clar and any one o these yer drivers that comes smelling round arter any our people why hes got me in his way im the feller hes got to set in withim the feller for yer all to come to bredrenill stand up for yer rightsill fend em to the last breath  why but sam yer telled me only this mornin that youd help this yer masr to cotch lizy seems to me yer talk dont hang together said andy  i tell you now andy said sam with awful superiority dont yer be a talkin bout what yer dont know nothin on boys like you andy means well but they cant be spected to collusitate the great principles of action  andy looked rebuked particularly by the hard word collusitate which most of the youngerly members of the company seemed to consider as a settler in the case while sam proceeded  dat ar was conscience andy when i thought of gwine arter lizy i railly spected masr was sot dat way when i found missis was sot the contrar dat ar was conscience more yetcause fellers allers gets more by stickin to missis sideso yer see i s persistent either way and sticks up to conscience and holds on to principles yes principles said sam giving an enthusiastic toss to a chickens neckwhats principles good for if we isnt persistent i wanter know thar andy you may have dat ar bonetant picked quite clean  sams audience hanging on his words with open mouth he could not but proceed  dis yer matter bout persistence fellerniggers said sam with the air of one entering into an abstruse subject dis yer sistency s a thing what ant seed into very clar by most anybody now yer see when a feller stands up for a thing one day and night de contrar de next folks ses and natrally enough dey ses why he ant persistenthand me dat ar bit o corncake andy but lets look inter it i hope the genlmen and der fair sex will scuse my usin an ornary sort o parison here im a

which ary side my larder is dont you see all on yer  its the only thing ye ever was persistent in lord knows muttered aunt chloe who was getting rather restive the merriment of the evening being to her somewhat after the scripture comparisonlike vinegar upon nitre  yes indeed said sam rising full of supper and glory for a closing effort yes my fellercitizens and ladies of de other sex in general i has principlesim proud to oon emthey s perquisite to dese yer times and ter all times i has principles and i sticks to em like fortyjest anything that i thinks is principle i goes in to ti wouldnt

sudden  niggers all on yer said sam waving his palmleaf with benignity i give yer my blessin go to bed now and be good boys  and with this pathetic benediction the assembly dispersed    chapter ix  in which it appears that a senator is but a man   the light of the cheerful fire shone on the rug and carpet of a cosey parlor and glittered on the sides of the teacups and wellbrightened teapot as senator bird was drawing off his boots preparatory to inserting his feet in a pair of new handsome slippers which his wife had been working for him while away on his senatorial tour mrs bird looking the very picture of delight was superintending the arrangements of the table ever and anon mingling admonitory remarks to a number of frolicsome juveniles who were effervescing in all those modes of untold gambol and mischief that have astonished mothers ever since the flood  tom let the doorknob alonetheres a man mary mary dont pull the cats tailpoor pussy jim you mustnt climb on that tableno noyou dont know my dear what a surprise it is to us all to see you here tonight said she at last when she found a space to say something to her husband  yes yes i thought id just make a run down spend the night and have a little comfort at home im tired to death and my head aches  mrs bird cast a glance at a camphorbottle which stood in the halfopen closet and appeared to meditate an approach to it but her husband interposed  no no mary no doctoring a cup of your good hot tea and some of our good home living is what i want its a tiresome business this legislating  and the senator smiled as if he rather liked the idea of considering himself a sacrifice to his country  well said his wife after the business of the teatable was getting rather slack and what have they been doing in the senate  now it was a very unusual thing for gentle little mrs bird ever to trouble her head with what was going on in the house of the state very wisely considering that she had enough to do to mind her own mr bird therefore opened his eyes in surprise and said  not very much of importance  well but is it true that they have been passing a law forbidding people to give meat and drink to those poor colored folks that come along i heard they were talking of some such law but i didnt think any christian legislature would pass it  why mary you are getting to be a politician all at once  no nonsense i wouldnt give a fig for all your politics generally but i think this is something downright cruel and unchristian i hope my dear no such law has been passed  there has been a law passed forbidding people to help off the slaves that come over from kentucky my dear so much of that thing has been done by these reckless abolitionists that our brethren in kentucky are very strongly excited and it seems necessary and no more than christian and kind that something should be done by our state to quiet the excitement  and what is the law it dont forbid us to shelter those poor creatures a night does it and to give em something comfortable to eat and a few old clothes and send them quietly about their business  why yes my dear that would be aiding and abetting you know  mrs bird was a timid blushing little woman of about four feet in height and with mild blue eyes and a peachblow complexion and the gentlest sweetest voice in the worldas for courage a moderatesized cockturkey had been known to put her to rout at the very first gobble and a stout housedog of moderate capacity would bring her into subjection merely by a show of his teeth her husband and children were her entire world and in these she ruled more by entreaty and persuasion than by command or argument there was only one thing that was capable of arousing her and that provocation came in on the side of her unusually gentle and sympathetic natureanything in the shape of cruelty would throw her into a passion which was the more alarming and inexplicable in proportion to the general softness of her nature generally the most indulgent and easy to be entreated of all mothers still her boys had a very reverent remembrance of a most vehement chastisement she once bestowed on them because she found them leagued with several graceless boys of the neighborhood stoning a defenceless kitten  ill tell you what master bill used to say i was scared that time mother came at me so that i thought she was crazy and i was whipped and tumbled off to bed without any supper before i could get over wondering what had come about and after that i heard mother crying outside the door which made me feel worse than all the rest ill tell you what hed say we boys never stoned another kitten  on the present occasion mrs bird rose quickly with very red cheeks which quite improved her general appearance and walked up to her husband with quite a resolute air and said in a determined tone  now john i want to know if you think such a law as that is right and christian  you wont shoot me now mary if i say i do  i never could have thought it of you john you didnt vote for it  even so my fair politician  you ought to be ashamed john poor homeless houseless creatures its a shameful wicked abominable law and ill break it for one the first time i get a chance and i hope i shall have a chance i do things have got to a pretty pass if a woman cant give a warm supper and a bed to poor starving creatures just because they are slaves and have been abused and oppressed all their lives poor things  but mary just listen to me your feelings are all quite right dear and interesting and i love you for them but then dear we mustnt suffer our feelings to run away with our judgment you must consider its a matter of private feelingthere are great public interests involvedthere is such a state of public agitation rising that we must put aside our private feelings  now john i dont know anything about politics but i can read my bible and there i see that i must feed the hungry clothe the naked and comfort the desolate and that bible i mean to follow  but in cases where your doing so would involve a great public evil  obeying god never brings on public evils i know it cant its always safest all round to do as he bids us  now listen to me mary and i can state to you a very clear argument to show  o nonsense john you can talk all night but you wouldnt do it i put it to you johnwould you now turn away a poor shivering hungry creature from your door because he was a runaway would you now  now if the truth must be told our senator had the misfortune to be a man who had a particularly humane and accessible nature and turning away anybody that was in trouble never had been his forte and what was worse for him in this particular pinch of the argument was that his wife knew it and of course was making an assault on rather an indefensible point so he had recourse to the usual means of gaining time for such cases made and provided he said ahem and coughed several times took out his pockethandkerchief and began to wipe his glasses mrs bird seeing the defenceless condition of the enemys territory had no more conscience than to push her advantage  i should like to see you doing that johni really should turning a woman out of doors in a snowstorm for instance or may be youd take her up and put her in jail wouldnt you you would make a great hand at that  of course it would be a very painful duty began mr bird in a moderate tone  duty john dont use that word you know it isnt a dutyit cant be a duty if folks want to keep their slaves from running away let em treat em wellthats my doctrine if i had slaves as i hope i never shall have id risk their wanting to run away from me or you either john i tell you folks dont run away when they are happy and when they do run poor creatures they suffer enough with cold and hunger and fear without everybodys turning against them and law or no law i never will so help me god  mary mary my dear let me reason with you  i hate reasoning johnespecially reasoning on such subjects theres a way you political folks have of coming round and round a plain right thing and you dont believe in it yourselves when it comes to practice i know you well enough john you dont believe its right any more than i do and you wouldnt do it any sooner than i  at this critical juncture old cudjoe the black manofallwork put his head in at the door and wished missis would come into the kitchen and our senator tolerably relieved looked after his little wife with a whimsical mixture of amusement and vexation and seating himself in the armchair began to read the papers  after a moment his wifes voice was heard at the door in a quick earnest tonejohn john i do wish youd come here a moment  he laid down his paper and went into the kitchen and started quite amazed at the sight that presented itselfa young and slender woman with garments torn and frozen with one shoe gone and the stocking torn away from the cut and bleeding foot was laid back in a deadly swoon upon two chairs there was the impress of the despised race on her face yet none could help feeling its mournful and pathetic beauty while its stony sharpness its cold fixed deathly aspect struck a solemn chill over him he drew his breath short and stood in silence his wife and their only colored domestic old aunt dinah were busily engaged in restorative measures while old cudjoe had got the boy on his knee and was busy pulling off his shoes and stockings and chafing his little cold feet  sure now if she ant a sight to behold said old dinah compassionately pears like t was the heat that made her faint she was tolable peart when she cum in and asked if she couldnt warm herself here a spell and i was just aaskin her where she cum from and she fainted right down never done much hard work guess by the looks of her hands  poor creature said mrs bird compassionately as the woman slowly unclosed her large dark eyes and looked vacantly at her suddenly an expression of agony crossed her face and she sprang up saying o my harry have they got him  the boy at this jumped from cudjoes knee and running to her side put up his arms o hes here hes here she exclaimed  o maam said she wildly to mrs bird do protect us dont let them get him  nobody shall hurt you here poor woman said mrs bird encouragingly you are safe dont be afraid  god bless you said the woman covering her face and sobbing while the little boy seeing her crying tried to get into her lap  with many gentle and womanly offices which none knew better how to render than mrs bird the poor woman was in time rendered more calm a temporary bed was provided for her on the settle near the fire and after a short time she fell into a heavy slumber with the child who seemed no less weary soundly sleeping on her arm for the mother resisted with nervous anxiety the kindest attempts to take him from her and even in sleep her arm encircled him with an unrelaxing clasp as if she could not even then be beguiled of her vigilant hold  mr and mrs bird had gone back to the parlor where strange as it may appear no reference was made on either side to the preceding conversation but mrs bird busied herself with her knittingwork and mr bird pretended to be reading the paper  i wonder who and what she is said mr bird at last as he laid it down  when she wakes up and feels a little rested we will see said mrs bird  i say wife said mr bird after musing in silence over his newspaper  well dear  she couldnt wear one of your gowns could she by any letting down or such matter she seems to be rather larger than you are  a quite perceptible smile glimmered on mrs birds face as she answered well see  another pause and mr bird again broke out  i say wife  well what now  why theres that old bombazin cloak that you keep on purpose to put over me when i take my afternoons nap you might as well give her thatshe needs clothes  at this instant dinah looked in to say that the woman was awake and wanted to see missis  mr and mrs bird went into the kitchen followed by the two eldest boys the smaller fry having by this time been safely disposed of in bed  the woman was now sitting up on the settle by the fire she was looking steadily into the blaze with a calm heartbroken expression very different from her former agitated wildness  did you want me said mrs bird in gentle tones i hope you feel better now poor woman  a longdrawn shivering sigh was the only answer but she lifted her dark eyes and fixed them on her with such a forlorn and imploring expression that the tears came into the little womans eyes  you neednt be afraid of anything we are friends here poor woman tell me where you came from and what you want said she  i came from kentucky said the woman  when said mr bird taking up the interogatory  tonight  how did you come  i crossed on the ice  crossed on the ice said every one present  yes said the woman slowly i did god helping me i crossed on the ice for they were behind meright behindand there was no other way  law missis said cudjoe the ice is all in brokenup blocks a swinging and a tetering up and down in the water  i know it wasi know it said she wildly but i did it i wouldnt have thought i couldi didnt think i should get over but i didnt care i could but die if i didnt the lord helped me nobody knows how much the lord can help em till they try said the woman with a flashing eye  were you a slave said mr bird  yes sir i belonged to a man in kentucky  was he unkind to you  no sir he was a good master  and was your mistress unkind to you  no sirno my mistress was always good to me  what could induce you to leave a good home then and run away and go through such dangers  the woman looked up at mrs bird with a keen scrutinizing glance and it did not escape her that she was dressed in deep mourning  maam she said suddenly have you ever lost a child  the question was unexpected and it was thrust on a new wound for it was only a month since a darling child of the family had been laid in the grave  mr bird turned around and walked to the window and mrs bird burst into tears but recovering her voice she said  why do you ask that i have lost a little one  then you will feel for me i have lost two one after anotherleft em buried there when i came away and i had only this one left i never slept a night without him he was all i had he was my comfort and pride day and night and maam they were going to take him away from meto sell himsell him down south maam to go all alonea baby that had never been away from his mother in his life i couldnt stand it maam i knew i never should be good for anything if they did and when i knew the papers the papers were signed and he was sold i took him and came off in the night and they chased methe man that bought him and some of masrs folksand they were coming down right behind me and i heard em i jumped right on to the ice and how i got across i dont knowbut first i knew a man was helping me up the bank  the woman did not sob nor weep she had gone to a place where tears are dry but every one around her was in some way characteristic of themselves showing signs of hearty sympathy  the two little boys after a desperate rummaging in their pockets in search of those pockethandkerchiefs which mothers know are never to be found there had thrown themselves disconsolately into the skirts of their mothers gown where they were sobbing and wiping their eyes and noses to their hearts contentmrs bird had her face fairly hidden in her pockethandkerchief and old dinah with tears streaming down her black honest face was ejaculating lord have mercy on us with all the fervor of a campmeetingwhile old cudjoe rubbing his eyes very hard with his cuffs and making a most uncommon variety of wry faces occasionally responded in the same key with great fervor our senator was a statesman and of course could not be expected to cry like other mortals and so he turned his back to the company and looked out of the window and seemed particularly busy in clearing his throat and wiping his spectacleglasses occasionally blowing his nose in a manner that was calculated to excite suspicion had any one been in a state to observe critically  how came you to tell me you had a kind master he suddenly exclaimed gulping down very resolutely some kind of rising in his throat and turning suddenly round upon the woman  because he was a kind master ill say that of him any wayand my mistress was kind but they couldnt help themselves they were owing money and there was some way i cant tell how that a man had a hold on them and they were obliged to give him his will i listened and heard him telling mistress that and she begging and pleading for meand he told her he couldnt help himself and that the papers were all drawnand then it was i took him and left my home and came away i knew t was no use of my trying to live if they did it for t pears like this child is all i have  have you no husband  yes but he belongs to another man his master is real hard to him and wont let him come to see me hardly ever and hes grown harder and harder upon us and he threatens to sell him down southits like ill never see him again  the quiet tone in which the woman pronounced these words might have led a superficial observer to think that she was entirely apathetic but there was a calm settled depth of anguish in her large dark eye that spoke of something far otherwise  and where do you mean to go my poor woman said mrs bird  to canada if i only knew where that was is it very far off is canada said she looking up with a simple confiding air to mrs birds face  poor thing said mrs bird involuntarily  is t a very great way off think said the woman earnestly  much further than you think poor child said mrs bird but we will try to think what can be done for you here dinah make her up a bed in your own room close by the kitchen and ill think what to do for her in the morning meanwhile never fear poor woman put your trust in god he will protect you  mrs bird and her husband reentered the parlor she sat down in her little rockingchair before the fire swaying thoughtfully to and fro mr bird strode up and down the room grumbling to himself pish pshaw confounded awkward business at length striding up to his wife he said  i say wife shell have to get away from here this very night that fellow will be down on the scent bright and early tomorrow morning if t was only the woman she could lie quiet till it was over but that little chap cant be kept still by a troop of horse and foot ill warrant me hell bring it all out popping his head out of some window or door a pretty kettle of fish it would be for me too to be caught with them both here just now no theyll have to be got off tonight  tonight how is it possiblewhere to  well i know pretty well where to said the senator beginning to put on his boots with a reflective air and stopping when his leg was half in he embraced his knee with both hands and seemed to go off in deep meditation  its a confounded awkward ugly business said he at last beginning to tug at his bootstraps again and thats a fact after one boot was fairly on the senator sat with the other in his hand profoundly studying the figure of the carpet it will have to be done though for aught i seehang it all and he drew the other boot anxiously on and looked out of the window  now little mrs bird was a discreet womana woman who never in her life said i told you so and on the present occasion though pretty well aware of the shape her husbands meditations were taking she very prudently forbore to meddle with them only sat very quietly in her chair and looked quite ready to hear her liege lords intentions when he should think proper to utter them  you see he said theres my old client van trompe has come over from kentucky and set all his slaves free and he has bought a place seven miles up the creek here back in the woods where nobody goes unless they go on purpose and its a place that isnt found in a hurry there shed be safe enough but the plague of the thing is nobody could drive a carriage there tonight but me  why not cudjoe is an excellent driver  ay ay but here it is the creek has to be crossed twice and the second crossing is quite dangerous unless one knows it as i do i have crossed it a hundred times on horseback and know exactly the turns to take and so you see theres no help for it cudjoe must put in the horses as quietly as may be about twelve oclock and ill take her over and then to give color to the matter he must carry me on to the next tavern to take the stage for columbus that comes by about three or four and so it will look as if i had had the carriage only for that i shall get into business bright and early in the morning but im thinking i shall feel rather cheap there after all thats been said and done but hang it i cant help it  your heart is better than your head in this case john said the wife laying her little white hand on his could i ever have loved you had i not known you better than you know yourself and the little woman looked so handsome with the tears sparkling in her eyes that the senator thought he must be a decidedly clever fellow to get such a pretty creature into such a passionate admiration of him and so what could he do but walk off soberly to see about the carriage at the door however he stopped a moment and then coming back he said with some hesitation  mary i dont know how youd feel about it but theres that drawer full of thingsofofpoor little henrys so saying he turned quickly on his heel and shut the door after him  his wife opened the little bedroom door adjoining her room and taking the candle set it down on the top of a bureau there then from a small recess she took a key and put it thoughtfully in the lock of a drawer and made a sudden pause while two boys who boy like had followed close on her heels stood looking with silent significant glances at their mother and oh mother that reads this has there never been in your house a drawer or a closet the opening of which has been to you like the opening again of a little grave ah happy mother that you are if it has not been so  mrs bird slowly opened the drawer there were little coats of many a form and pattern piles of aprons and rows of small stockings and even a pair of little shoes worn and rubbed at the toes were peeping from the folds of a paper there was a toy horse and wagon a top a ballmemorials gathered with many a tear and many a heartbreak she sat down by the drawer and leaning her head on her hands over it wept till the tears fell through her fingers into the drawer then suddenly raising her head she began with nervous haste selecting the plainest and most substantial articles and gathering them into a bundle  mamma said one of the boys gently touching her arm you going to give away those things  my dear boys she said softly and earnestly if our dear loving little henry looks down from heaven he would be glad to have us do this i could not find it in my heart to give them away to any common personto anybody that was happy but i give them to a mother more heartbroken and sorrowful than i am and i hope god will send his blessings with them  there are in this world blessed souls whose sorrows all spring up into joys for others whose earthly hopes laid in the grave with many tears are the seed from which spring healing flowers and balm for the desolate and the distressed among such was the delicate woman who sits there by the lamp dropping slow tears while she prepares the memorials of her own lost one for the outcast wanderer  after a while mrs bird opened a wardrobe and taking from thence a plain serviceable dress or two she sat down busily to her worktable and with needle scissors and thimble at hand quietly commenced the letting down process which her husband had recommended and continued busily at it till the old clock in the corner struck twelve and she heard the low rattling of wheels at the door  mary said her husband coming in with his overcoat in his hand you must wake her up now we must be off  mrs bird hastily deposited the various articles she had collected in a small plain trunk and locking it desired her husband to see it in the carriage and then proceeded to call the woman soon arrayed in a cloak bonnet and shawl that had belonged to her benefactress she appeared at the door with her child in her arms mr bird hurried her into the carriage and mrs bird pressed on after her to the carriage steps eliza leaned out of the carriage and put out her handa hand as soft and beautiful as was given in return she fixed her large dark eyes full of earnest meaning on mrs birds face and seemed going to speak her lips movedshe tried once or twice but there was no soundand pointing upward with a look never to be forgotten she fell back in the seat and covered her face the door was shut and the carriage drove on  what a situation now for a patriotic senator that had been all the week before spurring up the legislature of his native state to pass more stringent resolutions against escaping fugitives their harborers and abettors  our good senator in his native state had not been exceeded by any of his brethren at washington in the sort of eloquence which has won for them immortal renown how sublimely he had sat with his hands in his pockets and scouted all sentimental weakness of those who would put the welfare of a few miserable fugitives before great state interests  he was as bold as a lion about it and mightily convinced not only himself but everybody that heard himbut then his idea of a fugitive was only an idea of the letters that spell the wordor at the most the image of a little newspaper picture of a man with a stick and bundle with ran away from the subscriber under it the magic of the real presence of distressthe imploring human eye the frail trembling human hand the despairing appeal of helpless agonythese he had never tried he had never thought that a fugitive might be a hapless mother a defenceless childlike that one which was now wearing his lost boys little wellknown cap and so as our poor senator was not stone or steelas he was a man and a downright noblehearted one toohe was as everybody must see in a sad case for his patriotism and you need not exult over him good brother of the southern states for we have some inklings that many of you under similar circumstances would not do much better we have reason to know in kentucky as in mississippi are noble and generous hearts to whom never was tale of suffering told in vain ah good brother is it fair for you to expect of us services which your own brave honorable heart would not allow you to render were you in our place  be that as it may if our good senator was a political sinner he was in a fair way to expiate it by his nights penance there had been a long continuous period of rainy weather and the soft rich earth of ohio as every one knows is admirably suited to the manufacture of mudand the road was an ohio railroad of the good old times  and pray what sort of a road may that be says some eastern traveller who has been accustomed to connect no ideas with a railroad but those of smoothness or speed  know then innocent eastern friend that in benighted regions of the west where the mud is of unfathomable and sublime depth roads are made of round rough logs arranged transversely side by side and coated over in their pristine freshness with earth turf and whatsoever may come to hand and then the rejoicing native calleth it a road and straightway essayeth to ride thereupon in process of time the rains wash off all the turf and grass aforesaid move the logs hither and thither in picturesque positions up down and crosswise with divers chasms and ruts of black mud intervening  over such a road as this our senator went stumbling along making moral reflections as continuously as under the circumstances could be expectedthe carriage proceeding along much as followsbump bump bump slush down in the mudthe senator woman and child reversing their positions so suddenly as to come without any very accurate adjustment against the windows of the downhill side carriage sticks fast while cudjoe on the outside is heard making a great muster among the horses after various ineffectual pullings and twitchings just as the senator is losing all patience the carriage suddenly rights itself with a bouncetwo front wheels go down into another abyss and senator woman and child all tumble promiscuously on to the front seatsenators hat is jammed over his eyes and nose quite unceremoniously and he considers himself fairly extinguishedchild cries and cudjoe on the outside delivers animated addresses to the horses who are kicking and floundering and straining under repeated cracks of the whip carriage springs up with another bouncedown go the hind wheelssenator woman and child fly over on to the back seat his elbows encountering her bonnet and both her feet being jammed into his hat which flies off in the concussion after a few moments the slough is passed and the horses stop pantingthe senator finds his hat the woman straightens her bonnet and hushes her child and they brace themselves for what is yet to come  for a while only the continuous bump bump intermingled just by way of variety with divers side plunges and compound shakes and they begin to flatter themselves that they are not so badly off after all at last with a square plunge which puts all on to their feet and then down into their seats with incredible quickness the carriage stopsand after much outside commotion cudjoe appears at the door  please sir its powerful bad spot this yer i dont know how wes to get clar out im a thinkin well have to be a gettin rails  the senator despairingly steps out picking gingerly for some firm foothold down goes one foot an immeasurable depthhe tries to pull it up loses his balance and tumbles over into the mud and is fished out in a very despairing condition by cudjoe  but we forbear out of sympathy to our readers bones western travellers who have beguiled the midnight hour in the interesting process of pulling down rail fences to pry their carriages out of mud holes will have a respectful and mournful sympathy with our unfortunate hero we beg them to drop a silent tear and pass on  it was full late in the night when the carriage emerged dripping and bespattered out of the creek and stood at the door of a large farmhouse  it took no inconsiderable perseverance to arouse the inmates but at last the respectable proprietor appeared and undid the door he was a great tall bristling orson of a fellow full six feet and some inches in his stockings and arrayed in a red flannel huntingshirt a very heavy mat of sandy hair in a decidedly tousled condition and a beard of some days growth gave the worthy man an appearance to say the least not particularly prepossessing he stood for a few minutes holding the candle aloft and blinking on our travellers with a dismal and mystified expression that was truly ludicrous it cost some effort of our senator to induce him to comprehend the case fully and while he is doing his best at that we shall give him a little introduction to our readers  honest old john van trompe was once quite a considerable landowner and slaveowner in the state of kentucky having nothing of the bear about him but the skin and being gifted by nature with a great honest just heart quite equal to his gigantic frame he had been for some years witnessing with repressed uneasiness the workings of a system equally bad for oppressor and oppressed at last one day johns great heart had swelled altogether too big to wear his bonds any longer so he just took his pocketbook out of his desk and went over into ohio and bought a quarter of a township of good rich land made out free papers for all his peoplemen women and childrenpacked them up in wagons and sent them off to settle down and then honest john turned his face up the creek and sat quietly down on a snug retired farm to enjoy his conscience and his reflections  are you the man that will shelter a poor woman and child from slavecatchers said the senator explicitly  i rather think i am said honest john with some considerable emphasis  i thought so said the senator  if theres anybody comes said the good man stretching his tall muscular form upward why here im ready for him and ive got seven sons each six foot high and theyll be ready for em give our respects to em said john tell em its no matter how soon they callmake no kinder difference to us said john running his fingers through the shock of hair that thatched his head and bursting out into a great laugh  weary jaded and spiritless eliza dragged herself up to the door with her child lying in a heavy sleep on her arm the rough man held the candle to her face and uttering a kind of compassionate grunt opened the door of a small bedroom adjoining to the large kitchen where they were standing and motioned her to go in he took down a candle and lighting it set it upon the table and then addressed himself to eliza  now i say gal you neednt be a bit afeard let who will come here im up to all that sort o thing said he pointing to two or three goodly rifles over the mantelpiece and most people that know me know that t wouldnt be healthy to try to get anybody out o my house when im agin it so now you jist go to sleep now as quiet as if yer mother was a rockin ye said he as he shut the door  why this is an uncommon handsome un he said to the senator ah well handsome uns has the greatest cause to run sometimes if they has any kind o feelin such as decent women should i know all about that  the senator in a few words briefly explained elizas history  o ou aw now i want to know said the good man pitifully sho now sho thats natur now poor crittur hunted down now like a deerhunted down jest for havin natural feelins and doin what no kind o mother could help a doin i tell ye what these yer things make me come the nighest to swearin now o most anything said honest john as he wiped his eyes with the back of a great freckled yellow hand i tell yer what stranger it was years and years before id jine the church cause the ministers round in our parts used to preach that the bible went in for these ere cuttings upand i couldnt be up to em with their greek and hebrew and so i took up agin em bible and all i never jined the church till i found a minister that was up to em all in greek and all that and he said right the contrary and then i took right hold and jined the churchi did now fact said john who had been all this time uncorking some very frisky bottled cider which at this juncture he presented  yed better jest put up here now till daylight said he heartily and ill call up the old woman and have a bed got ready for you in no time  thank you my good friend said the senator i must be along to take the night stage for columbus  ah well then if you must ill go a piece with you and show you a cross road that will take you there better than the road you came on that roads mighty bad  john equipped himself and with a lantern in hand was soon seen guiding the senators carriage towards a road that ran down in a hollow back of his dwelling when they parted the senator put into his hand a tendollar bill  its for her he said briefly  ay ay said john with equal conciseness  they shook hands and parted    chapter x  the property is carried off   the february morning looked gray and drizzling through the window of uncle toms cabin it looked on downcast faces the images of mournful hearts the little table stood out before the fire covered with an ironingcloth a coarse but clean shirt or two fresh from the iron hung on the back of a chair by the fire and aunt chloe had another spread out before her on the table carefully she rubbed and ironed every fold and every hem with the most scrupulous exactness every now and then raising her hand to her face to wipe off the tears that were coursing down her cheeks  tom sat by with his testament open on his knee and his head leaning upon his handbut neither spoke it was yet early and the children lay all asleep together in their little rude trundlebed  tom who had to the full the gentle domestic heart which woe for them has been a peculiar characteristic of his unhappy race got up and walked silently to look at his children  its the last time he said  aunt chloe did not answer only rubbed away over and over on the coarse shirt already as smooth as hands could make it and finally setting her iron suddenly down with a despairing plunge she sat down to the table and lifted up her voice and wept  spose we must be resigned but oh lord how ken i if i knowd anything whar you s goin or how theyd sarve you missis says shell try and deem ye in a year or two but lor nobody never comes up

up to the lord abovehes above allthar dont a sparrow fall without him  it dont seem to comfort me but i spect it orter said aunt chloe but dars no use talkin ill jes wet up de corncake and get ye one good breakfast cause nobody knows when youll get another  in order to appreciate the sufferings of the negroes sold south it must be remembered that all the instinctive affections of that race are peculiarly strong their local attachments are very abiding they are not naturally daring and enterprising but homeloving and affectionate add to this all the terrors with which ignorance invests the unknown and add to this again that selling to the south is set before the negro from childhood as the last severity of punishment the threat that terrifies more than whipping or torture of any kind is the threat of being sent down river we have ourselves heard this feeling expressed by them and seen the unaffected horror with which they will sit in their gossipping hours and tell frightful stories of that down river which to them is       that undiscovered country from whose bourn      no traveller returns          a slightly inaccurate quotation from hamlet act iii      scene i lines 369370  a missionary figure among the fugitives in canada told us that many of the fugitives confessed themselves to have escaped from comparatively kind masters and that they were induced to brave the perils of escape in almost every case by the desperate horror with which they regarded being sold southa doom which was hanging either over themselves or their husbands their wives or children this nerves the african naturally patient timid and unenterprising with heroic courage and leads him to suffer hunger cold pain the perils of the wilderness and the more dread penalties of recapture  the simple morning meal now smoked on the table for mrs shelby had excused aunt chloes attendance at the great house that morning the poor soul had expended all her little energies on this farewell feasthad killed and dressed her choicest chicken and prepared her corncake with scrupulous exactness just to her husbands taste and brought out certain mysterious jars on the mantelpiece some preserves that were never produced except on extreme occasions  lor pete said mose triumphantly hant we got a buster of a breakfast at the same time catching at a fragment of the chicken  aunt chloe gave him a sudden box on the ear thar now crowing over the last breakfast yer poor daddys gwine to have to home  o chloe said tom gently  wal i cant help it said aunt chloe hiding her face in her apron i s so tossed about it it makes me act ugly  the boys stood quite still looking first at their father and then at their mother while the baby climbing up her clothes began an imperious commanding cry  thar said aunt chloe wiping her eyes and taking up the baby now is done i hopenow do eat something this yers my nicest chicken thar boys ye shall have some poor critturs yer mammys been cross to yer  the boys needed no second invitation and went in with great zeal for the eatables and it was well they did so as otherwise there would have been very little performed to any purpose by the party  now said aunt chloe bustling about after breakfast i must put up yer clothes jest like as not hell take em all away i know thar waysmean as dirt they is wal now yer flannels for rhumatis is in this corner so be careful cause there wont nobody make ye no more then heres yer old shirts and these yer is new ones i toed off these yer stockings last night and put de ball in em to mend with but lor wholl ever mend for ye and aunt chloe again overcome laid her head on the box side and sobbed to think on t no crittur to do for ye sick or well i dont railly think i ought ter be good now  the boys having eaten everything there was on the breakfasttable began now to take some thought of the case and seeing their mother crying and their father looking very sad began to whimper and put their hands to their eyes uncle tom had the baby on his knee and was letting her enjoy herself to the utmost extent scratching his face and pulling his hair and occasionally breaking out into clamorous explosions of delight evidently arising out of her own internal reflections  ay crow away poor crittur said aunt chloe yell have to come to it too yell live to see yer husband sold or mebbe be sold yerself and these yer boys theys to be sold i spose too jest like as not when dey gets good for somethin ant no use in niggers havin nothin  here one of the boys called out thars missis acomin in  she cant do no good whats she coming for said aunt chloe  mrs shelby entered aunt chloe set a chair for her in a manner decidedly gruff and crusty she did not seem to notice either the action or the manner she looked pale and anxious  tom she said i come to and stopping suddenly and regarding the silent group she sat down in the chair and covering her face with her handkerchief began to sob  lor now missis dontdont said aunt chloe bursting out in her turn and for a few moments they all wept in company and in those tears they all shed together the high and the lowly melted away all the heartburnings and anger of the oppressed o ye who visit the distressed do ye know that everything your money can buy given with a cold averted face is not worth one honest tear shed in real sympathy  my good fellow said mrs shelby i cant give you anything to do you any good if i give you money it will only be taken from you but i tell you solemnly and before god that i will keep trace of you and bring you back as soon as i can command the moneyand till then trust in god  here the boys called out that masr haley was coming and then an unceremonious kick pushed open the door haley stood there in very ill humor having ridden hard the night before and being not at all pacified by his ill success in recapturing his prey  come said he ye nigger yer ready servant maam said he taking off his hat as he saw mrs shelby  aunt chloe shut and corded the box and getting up looked gruffly on the trader her tears seeming suddenly turned to sparks of fire  tom rose up meekly to follow his new master and raised up his heavy box on his shoulder his wife took the baby in her arms to go with him to the wagon and the children still crying trailed on behind  mrs shelby walking up to the trader detained him for a few moments talking with him in an earnest manner and while she was thus talking the whole family party proceeded to a wagon that stood ready harnessed at the door a crowd of all the old and young hands on the place stood gathered around it to bid farewell to their old associate tom had been looked up to both as a head servant and a christian teacher by all the place and there was much honest sympathy and grief about him particularly among the women  why chloe you bar it better n we do said one of the women who had been weeping freely noticing the gloomy calmness with which aunt chloe stood by the wagon  is done my tears she said looking grimly at the trader who was coming up i does not feel to cry fore dat ar old limb no how  get in said haley to tom as he strode through the crowd of servants who looked at him with lowering brows  tom got in and haley drawing out from under the wagon seat a heavy pair of shackles made them fast around each ankle  a smothered groan of indignation ran through the whole circle and mrs shelby spoke from the verandahmr haley i assure you that precaution is entirely unnecessary  don know maam ive lost one five hundred dollars from this yer place and i cant afford to run no more risks  what else could she spect on him said aunt chloe indignantly while the two boys who now seemed to comprehend at once their fathers destiny clung to her gown sobbing and groaning vehemently  im sorry said tom that masr george happened to be away  george had gone to spend two or three days with a companion on a neighboring estate and having departed early in the morning before toms misfortune had been made public had left without hearing of it  give my love to masr george he said earnestly  haley whipped up the horse and with a steady mournful look fixed to the last on the old place tom was whirled away  mr shelby at this time was not at home he had sold tom under the spur of a driving necessity to get out of the power of a man whom he dreadedand his first feeling after the consummation of the bargain had been that of relief but his wifes expostulations awoke his halfslumbering regrets and toms manly disinterestedness increased the unpleasantness of his feelings it was in vain that he said to himself that he had a right to do itthat everybody did itand that some did it without even the excuse of necessityhe could not satisfy his own feelings and that he might not witness the unpleasant scenes of the consummation he had gone on a short business tour up the country hoping that all would be over before he returned  tom and haley rattled on along the dusty road whirling past every old familiar spot until the bounds of the estate were fairly passed and they found themselves out on the open pike after they had ridden about a mile haley suddenly drew up at the door of a blacksmiths shop when taking out with him a pair of handcuffs he stepped into the shop to have a little alteration in them  these yer s a little too small for his build said haley showing the fetters and pointing out to tom  lor now if thar ant shelbys tom he hant sold him now said the smith  yes he has said haley  now ye dont well reely said the smith whod a thought it why ye neednt go to fetterin him up this yer way hes the faithfullest best crittur  yes yes said haley but your good fellers are just the critturs to want

fellers they hates it like sin no way but to fetter em got legstheyll use emno mistake  well said the smith feeling among his tools them plantations down thar stranger ant jest the place a kentuck nigger wants to go to they dies thar tolable fast dont they  wal yes tolable fast ther dying is what with the climating and one thing and another they dies so as to keep the market up pretty brisk said haley  wal now a feller cant help thinkin its a mighty pity to have a nice quiet likely feller as good un as tom is go down to be fairly ground up on one of them ar sugar plantations  wal hes got

leaves his wife and chilen up here spose  yes but hell get another thar lord thars women enough everywhar said haley  tom was sitting very mournfully on the outside of the shop while this conversation was going on suddenly he heard the quick short click of a horses hoof behind him and before he could fairly awake from his surprise young master george sprang into the wagon threw his arms tumultuously round his neck and was sobbing and scolding with energy  i declare its real mean i dont care what they say any of em its a nasty mean shame if i was a man they shouldnt do itthey should not so said george with a kind of subdued howl  o masr george this does me good said tom i couldnt bar to go off without seein ye it does me real good ye cant tell here tom made some movement of his feet and georges eye fell on the fetters  what a shame he exclaimed lifting his hands ill knock that old fellow downi will  no you wont masr george and you must not talk so loud it wont help me any to

ive brought you my dollar  o i couldnt think o takin on t masr george no ways in the world said tom quite moved  but you shall take it said george look herei told aunt chloe id do it and she advised me just to make a hole in it and put a string through so you could hang it round your neck and keep it out of sight else this mean scamp would take it away i tell ye tom i want to blow him up it would do me good  no dont masr george for it wont do me any good  well i wont for your sake said george busily tying his dollar round toms neck but there now button your coat tight over it and keep it and

i told aunt chloe this morning ill build our house all over and you shall have a room for a parlor with a carpet on it when im a man o youll have good times yet  haley now came to the door with the handcuffs in his hands  look here now mister said george with an air of great superiority as he got out i shall let father and mother know how you treat uncle tom  youre welcome said the trader  i should think youd be ashamed to spend all your life buying men and women and chaining them like cattle i should think youd feel mean said george  so long as your grand folks wants to buy men and women im as good as they is said haley tant any meaner sellin on em that t is buyin  ill never do either when im a man said george im ashamed this day that im a kentuckian i always was proud of it before and george sat very straight on his horse and looked round with an air as if he expected the state would be impressed with his opinion  well goodby uncle tom keep a stiff upper lip said george  goodby masr george said tom looking fondly and admiringly at him god almighty bless you ah kentucky hant got many like you he said in the fulness of his heart as the frank boyish face was lost to his view away he went and tom looked till the clatter of his horses heels died away the last sound or sight of his home but over his heart there seemed to be a warm spot where those young hands had placed that precious dollar tom put up his hand and held it close to his heart  now i tell ye what tom said haley as he came up to the wagon and threw in the handcuffs i mean to start far with ye as i genally do with my niggers and ill tell ye now to begin with you treat me far and ill treat you far i ant never hard on my niggers calculates to do the best for em i can now ye see youd better jest settle down comfortable and not be tryin no tricks because niggers tricks of all sorts im up to and its no use if niggers is quiet and dont try to get off they has good times with me and if they dont why its thar fault and not mine  tom assured haley that he had no present intentions of running off in fact the exhortation seemed rather a superfluous one to a man with a great pair of iron fetters on his feet but mr haley had got in the habit of commencing his relations with his stock with little exhortations of this nature calculated as he deemed to inspire cheerfulness and confidence and prevent the necessity of any unpleasant scenes  and here for the present we take our leave of tom to pursue the fortunes of other characters in our story    chapter xi  in which property gets into an improper state of mind  it was late in a drizzly afternoon that a traveler alighted at the door of a small country hotel in the village of n in kentucky in the barroom he found assembled quite a miscellaneous company whom stress of weather had driven to harbor and the place presented the usual scenery of such reunions great tall rawboned kentuckians attired in huntingshirts and trailing their loose joints over a vast extent of territory with the easy lounge peculiar to the racerifles stacked away in the corner shotpouches gamebags huntingdogs and little negroes all rolled together in the cornerswere the characteristic features in the picture at each end of the fireplace sat a longlegged gentleman with his chair tipped back his hat on his head and the heels of his muddy boots reposing sublimely on the mantelpiecea position we will inform our readers decidedly favorable to the turn of reflection incident to western taverns where travellers exhibit a decided preference for this particular mode of elevating their understandings  mine host who stood behind the bar like most of his country men was great of stature goodnatured and loosejointed with an enormous shock of hair on his head and a great tall hat on the top of that  in fact everybody in the room bore on his head this characteristic emblem of mans sovereignty whether it were felt hat palmleaf greasy beaver or fine new chapeau there it reposed with true republican independence in truth it appeared to be the characteristic mark of every individual some wore them tipped rakishly to one sidethese were your men of humor jolly freeandeasy dogs some had them jammed independently down over their nosesthese were your hard characters thorough men who when they wore their hats wanted to wear them and to wear them just as they had a mind to there were those who had them set far over backwideawake men who wanted a clear prospect while careless men who did not know or care how their hats sat had them shaking about in all directions the various hats in fact were quite a shakespearean study  divers negroes in very freeandeasy pantaloons and with no redundancy in the shirt line were scuttling about hither and thither without bringing to pass any very particular results except expressing a generic willingness to turn over everything in creation generally for the benefit of masr and his guests add to this picture a jolly crackling rollicking fire going rejoicingly up a great wide chimneythe outer door and every window being set wide open and the calico windowcurtain flopping and snapping in a good stiff breeze of damp raw airand you have an idea of the jollities of a kentucky tavern  your kentuckian of the present day is a good illustration of the doctrine of transmitted instincts and pecularities his fathers were mighty huntersmen who lived in the woods and slept under the free open heavens with the stars to hold their candles and their descendant to this day always acts as if the house were his campwears his hat at all hours tumbles himself about and puts his heels on the tops of chairs or mantelpieces just as his father rolled on the green sward and put his upon trees and logskeeps all the windows and doors open winter and summer that he may get air enough for his great lungscalls everybody stranger with nonchalant bonhommie and is altogether the frankest easiest most jovial creature living  into such an assembly of the free and easy our traveller entered he was a short thickset man carefully dressed with a round goodnatured countenance and something rather fussy and particular in his appearance he was very careful of his valise and umbrella bringing them in with his own hands and resisting pertinaciously all offers from the various servants to relieve him of them he looked round the barroom with rather an anxious air and retreating with his valuables to the warmest corner disposed them under his chair sat down and looked rather apprehensively up at the worthy whose heels illustrated the end of the mantelpiece who was spitting from right to left with a courage and energy rather alarming to gentlemen of weak nerves and particular habits  i say stranger how are ye said the aforesaid gentleman firing an honorary salute of tobaccojuice in the direction of the new arrival  well i reckon was the reply of the other as he dodged with some alarm the threatening honor  any news said the respondent taking out a strip of tobacco and a large huntingknife from his pocket  not that i know of said the man  chaw said the first speaker handing the old gentleman a bit of his tobacco with a decidedly brotherly air  no thank yeit dont agree with me said the little man edging off  dont eh said the other easily and stowing away the morsel in his own mouth in order to keep up the supply of tobaccojuice for the general benefit of society  the old gentleman uniformly gave a little start whenever his longsided brother fired in his direction and this being observed by his companion he very goodnaturedly turned his artillery to another quarter and proceeded to storm one of the fireirons with a degree of military talent fully sufficient to take a city  whats that said the old gentleman observing some of the company formed in a group around a large handbill  nigger advertised said one of the company briefly  mr wilson for that was the old gentlemans name rose up and after carefully adjusting his valise and umbrella proceeded deliberately to take out his spectacles and fix them on his nose and this operation being performed read as follows       ran away from the subscriber my mulatto boy george said      george six feet in height a very light mulatto brown curly      hair is very intelligent speaks handsomely can read and      write will probably try to pass for a white man is deeply      scarred on his back and shoulders has been branded in his      right hand with the letter h       i will give four hundred dollars for him alive and the      same sum for satisfactory proof that he has been killed  the old gentleman read this advertisement from end to end in a low voice as if he were studying it  the longlegged veteran who had been besieging the fireiron as before related now took down his cumbrous length and rearing aloft his tall form walked up to the advertisement and very deliberately spit a full discharge of tobaccojuice on it  theres my mind upon that said he briefly and sat down again  why now stranger whats that for said mine host  id do it all the same to the writer of that ar paper if he was here said the long man coolly resuming his old employment of cutting tobacco any man that owns a boy like that and cant find any better way o treating on him deserves to lose him such papers as these is a shame to kentucky thats my mind right out if anybody wants to know  well now thats a fact said mine host as he made an entry in his book  ive got a gang of boys sir said the long man resuming his attack on the fireirons and i jest tells emboys says irun now dig put jest when ye want to i never shall come to look after you thats the way i keep mine let em know they are free to run any time and it jest breaks up their wanting to more n all ive got free papers for em all recorded in case i gets keeled up any o these times and they know it and i tell ye stranger there ant a fellow in our parts gets more out of his niggers than i do why my boys have been to cincinnati with five hundred dollars worth of colts and brought me back the money all straight time and agin it stands to reason they should treat em like dogs and youll have dogs works and dogs actions treat em like men and youll have mens works and the honest drover in his warmth endorsed this moral sentiment by firing a perfect feu de joi at the fireplace  i think youre altogether right friend said mr wilson and this boy described here is a fine fellowno mistake about that he worked for me some halfdozen years in my bagging factory and he was my best hand sir he is an ingenious fellow too he invented a machine for the cleaning of hempa really valuable affair its gone into use in several factories his master holds the patent of it  ill warrant ye said the drover holds it and makes money out of it and then turns round and brands the boy in his right hand if i had a fair chance id mark him i reckon so that hed carry it one while  these yer knowin boys is allers aggravatin and sarcy said a coarselooking fellow from the other side of the room thats why they gets cut up and marked so if they behaved themselves they wouldnt  that is to say the lord made em men and its a hard squeeze gettin em down into beasts said the drover dryly  bright niggers isnt no kind of vantage to their masters continued the other well entrenched in a coarse unconscious obtuseness from the contempt of his opponent whats the use o talents and them things if you cant get the use on em yourself why all the use they make on t is to get round you ive had one or two of these fellers and i jest sold em down river i knew id got to lose em first or last if i didnt  better send orders up to the lord to make you a set and leave out their souls entirely said the drover  here the conversation was interrupted by the approach of a small onehorse buggy to the inn it had a genteel appearance and a welldressed gentlemanly man sat on the seat with a colored servant driving  the whole party examined the new comer with the interest with which a set of loafers in a rainy day usually examine every newcomer he was very tall with a dark spanish complexion fine expressive black eyes and closecurling hair also of a glossy blackness his wellformed aquiline nose straight thin lips and the admirable contour of his finelyformed limbs impressed the whole company instantly with the idea of something uncommon he walked easily in among the company and with a nod indicated to his waiter where to place his trunk bowed to the company and with his hat in his hand walked up leisurely to the bar and gave in his name as henry butter oaklands shelby county turning with an indifferent air he sauntered up to the advertisement and read it over  jim he said to his man seems to me we met a boy something like this up at bemans didnt we  yes masr said jim only i ant sure about the hand  well i didnt look of course said the stranger with a careless yawn then walking up to the landlord he desired him to furnish him with a private apartment as he had some writing to do immediately  the landlord was all obsequious and a relay of about seven negroes old and young male and female little and big were soon whizzing about like a covey of partridges bustling hurrying treading on each others toes and tumbling over each other in their zeal to get masrs room ready while he seated himself easily on a chair in the middle of the room and entered into conversation with the man who sat next to him  the manufacturer mr wilson from the time of the entrance of the stranger had regarded him with an air of disturbed and uneasy curiosity he seemed to himself to have met and been acquainted with him somewhere but he could not recollect every few moments when the man spoke or moved or smiled he would start and fix his eyes on him and then suddenly withdraw them as the bright dark eyes met his with such unconcerned coolness at last a sudden recollection seemed to flash upon him for he stared at the stranger with such an air of blank amazement and alarm that he walked up to him  mr wilson i think said he in a tone of recognition and extending his hand i beg your pardon i didnt recollect you before i see you remember memr butler of oaklands shelby county  yeyesyes sir said mr wilson like one speaking in a dream  just then a negro boy entered and announced that masrs room was ready  jim see to the trunks said the gentleman negligently then addressing himself to mr wilson he addedi should like to have a few moments conversation with you on business in my room if you please  mr wilson followed him as one who walks in his sleep and they proceeded to a large upper chamber where a newmade fire was crackling and various servants flying about putting finishing touches to the arrangements  when all was done and the servants departed the young man deliberately locked the door and putting the key in his pocket faced about and folding his arms on his bosom looked mr wilson full in the face  george said mr wilson  yes george said the young man  i couldnt have thought it  i am pretty well disguised i fancy said the young man with a smile a little walnut bark has made my yellow skin a genteel brown and ive dyed my hair black so you see i dont answer to the advertisement at all  o george but this is a dangerous game you are playing i could not have advised you to it  i can do it on my own responsibility said george with the same proud smile  we remark en passant that george was by his fathers side of white descent his mother was one of those unfortunates of her race marked out by personal beauty to be the slave of the passions of her possessor and the mother of children who may never know a father from one of the proudest families in kentucky he had inherited a set of fine european features and a high indomitable spirit from his mother he had received only a slight mulatto tinge amply compensated by its accompanying rich dark eye a slight change in the tint of the skin and the color of his hair had metamorphosed him into the spanishlooking fellow he then appeared and as gracefulness of movement and gentlemanly manners had always been perfectly natural to him he found no difficulty in playing the bold part he had adoptedthat of a gentleman travelling with his domestic  mr wilson a goodnatured but extremely fidgety and cautious old gentleman ambled up and down the room appearing as john bunyan hath it much tumbled up and down in his mind and divided between his wish to help george and a certain confused notion of maintaining law and order so as he shambled about he delivered himself as follows  well george i spose youre running awayleaving your lawful master georgei dont wonder at itat the same time im sorry georgeyes decidedlyi think i must say that georgeits my duty to tell you so  why are you sorry sir said george calmly  why to see you as it were setting yourself in opposition to the laws of your country  my country said george with a strong and bitter emphasis what country have i but the graveand i wish to god that i was laid there  why george nonoit wont do this way of talking is wickedunscriptural george youve got a hard masterin fact he iswell he conducts himself reprehensiblyi cant pretend to defend him but you know how the angel commanded hagar to return to her mistress and submit herself under the hand and the apostle sent back onesimus to his master         gen 16  the angel bade the pregnant hagar return to her      mistress sarai even though sarai had dealt harshly with      her         phil 110  onesimus went back to his master to become      no longer a servant but a brother beloved  dont quote bible at me that way mr wilson said george with a flashing eye dont for my wife is a christian and i mean to be if ever i get to where i can but to quote bible to a fellow in my circumstances is enough to make him give it up altogether i appeal to god almightyim willing to go with the case to him and ask him if i do wrong to seek my freedom  these feelings are quite natural george said the goodnatured man blowing his nose yes theyre natural but it is my duty not to encourage em in you yes my boy im sorry for you now its a bad casevery bad but the apostle says let everyone abide in the condition in which he is called we must all submit to the indications of providence georgedont you see  george stood with his head drawn back his arms folded tightly over his broad breast and a bitter smile curling his lips  i wonder mr wilson if the indians should come and take you a prisoner away from your wife and children and want to keep you all your life hoeing corn for them if youd think it your duty to abide in the condition in which you were called i rather think that youd think the first stray horse you could find an indication of providenceshouldnt you  the little old gentleman stared with both eyes at this illustration of the case but though not much of a reasoner he had the sense in which some logicians on this particular subject do not excelthat of saying nothing where nothing could be said so as he stood carefully stroking his umbrella and folding and patting down all the creases in it he proceeded on with his exhortations in a general way  you see george you know now i always have stood your friend and whatever ive said ive said for your good now here it seems to me youre running an awful risk you cant hope to carry it out if youre taken it will be worse with you than ever theyll only abuse you and half kill you and sell you down the river  mr wilson i know all this said george i do run a risk but he threw open his overcoat and showed two pistols and a bowieknife there he said im ready for em down south i never will go no if it comes to that i can earn myself at least six feet of free soilthe first and last i shall ever own in kentucky  why george this state of mind is awful its getting really desperate george im concerned going to break the laws of your country  my country again mr wilson you have a country but what country have i or any one like me born of slave mothers what laws are there for us we dont make themwe dont consent to themwe have nothing to do with them all they do for us is to crush us and keep us down havent i heard your fourthofjuly speeches dont you tell us all once a year that governments derive their just power from the consent of the governed cant a fellow think that hears such things cant he put this and that together and see what it comes to  mr wilsons mind was one of those that may not unaptly be represented by a bale of cottondowny soft benevolently fuzzy and confused he really pitied george with all his heart and had a sort of dim and cloudy perception of the style of feeling that agitated him but he deemed it his duty to go on talking good to him with infinite pertinacity  george this is bad i must tell you you know as a friend youd better not be meddling with such notions they are bad george very bad for boys in your conditionvery and mr wilson sat down to a table and began nervously chewing the handle of his umbrella  see here now mr wilson said george coming up and sitting himself determinately down in front of him look at me now dont i sit before you every way just as much a man as you are look at my facelook at my handslook at my body and the young man drew himself up proudly why am i not a man as much as anybody well mr wilson hear what i can tell you i had a fatherone of your kentucky gentlemenwho didnt think enough of me to keep me from being sold with his dogs and horses to satisfy the estate when he died i saw my mother put up at sheriffs sale with her seven children they were sold before her eyes one by one all to different masters and i was the youngest she came and kneeled down before old masr and begged him to buy her with me that she might have at least one child with her and he kicked her away with his heavy boot i saw him do it and the last that i heard was her moans and screams when i was tied to his horses neck to be carried off to his place  well then  my master traded with one of the men and bought my oldest sister she was a pious good girla member of the baptist churchand as handsome as my poor mother had been she was well brought up and had good manners at first i was glad she was bought for i had one friend near me i was soon sorry for it sir i have stood at the door and heard her whipped when it seemed as if every blow cut into my naked heart and i couldnt do anything to help her and she was whipped sir for wanting to live a decent christian life such as your laws give no slave girl a right to live and at last i saw her chained with a traders gang to be sent to market in orleanssent there for nothing else but thatand thats the last i know of her well i grew uplong years and yearsno father no mother no sister not a living soul that cared for me more than a dog nothing but whipping scolding starving why sir ive been so hungry that i have been glad to take the bones they threw to their dogs and yet when i was a little fellow and laid awake whole nights and cried it wasnt the hunger it wasnt the whipping i cried for no sir it was for my mother and my sistersit was because i hadnt a friend to love me on earth i never knew what peace or comfort was i never had a kind word spoken to me till i came to work in your factory mr wilson you treated me well you encouraged me to do well and to learn to read and write and to try to make something of myself and god knows how grateful i am for it then sir i found my wife youve seen heryou know how beautiful she is when i found she loved me when i married her i scarcely could believe i was alive i was so happy and sir she is as good as she is beautiful but now what why now comes my master takes me right away from my work and my friends and all i like and grinds me down into the very dirt and why because he says i forgot who i was he says to teach me that i am only a nigger after all and last of all he comes between me and my wife and says i shall give her up and live with another woman and all this your laws give him power to do in spite of god or man mr wilson look at it there isnt one of all these things that have broken the hearts of my mother and my sister and my wife and myself but your laws allow and give every man power to do in kentucky and none can say to him nay do you call these the laws of my country sir i havent any country anymore than i have any father but im going to have one i dont want anything of your country except to be let aloneto go peaceably out of it and when i get to canada where the laws will own me and protect me that shall be my country and its laws i will obey but if any man tries to stop me let him take care for i am desperate ill fight for my liberty to the last breath i breathe you say your fathers did it if it was right for them it is right for me  this speech delivered partly while sitting at the table and partly walking up and down the roomdelivered with tears and flashing eyes and despairing gestureswas altogether too much for the goodnatured old body to whom it was addressed who had pulled out a great yellow silk pockethandkerchief and was mopping up his face with great energy  blast em all he suddenly broke out havent i always said sothe infernal old cusses i hope i ant swearing now well go ahead george go ahead but be careful my boy dont shoot anybody george unlesswellyoud better not shoot i reckon at least i wouldnt hit anybody you know where is your wife george he added as he nervously rose and began walking the room  gone sir gone with her child in her arms the lord only knows wheregone after the north star and when we ever meet or whether we meet at all in this world no creature can tell  is it possible astonishing from such a kind family  kind families get in debt and the laws of our country allow them to sell the child out of its mothers bosom to pay its masters debts said george bitterly  well well said the honest old man fumbling in his pocket i spose perhaps i ant following my judgmenthang it i wont follow my judgment he added suddenly so here george and taking out a roll of bills from his pocketbook he offered them to george  no my kind good sir said george youve done a great deal for me and this might get you into trouble i have money enough i hope to take me as far as i need it  no but you must george money is a great help everywherecant have too much if you get it honestly take itdo take it nowdo my boy  on condition sir that i may repay it at some future time i will said george taking up the money  and now george how long are you going to travel in this waynot long or far i hope its well carried on but too bold and this black fellowwho is he  a true fellow who went to canada more than a year ago he heard after he got there that his master was so angry at him for going off that he had whipped his poor old mother and he has come all the way back to comfort her and get a chance to get her away  has he got her  not yet he has been hanging about the place and found no chance yet meanwhile he is going with me as far as ohio to put me among friends that helped him and then he will come back after her  dangerous very dangerous said the old man  george drew himself up and smiled disdainfully  the old gentleman eyed him from head to foot with a sort of innocent wonder  george something has brought you out wonderfully you hold up your head and speak and move like another man said mr wilson  because im a freeman said george proudly yes sir ive said masr for the last time to any man im free  take care you are not sureyou may be taken  all men are free and equal in the grave if it comes to that mr wilson said george  im perfectly dumbfounded with your boldness said mr wilsonto come right here to the nearest tavern  mr wilson it is so bold and this tavern is so near that they will never think of it they will look for me on ahead and you yourself wouldnt know me jims master dont live in this county he isnt known in these parts besides he is given up nobody is looking after him and nobody will take me up from the advertisement i think  but the mark in your hand  george drew off his glove and showed a newlyhealed scar in his hand  that is a parting proof of mr harris regard he said scornfully a fortnight ago he took it into his head to give it to me because he said he believed i should try to get away one of these days looks interesting doesnt it he said drawing his glove on again  i declare my very blood runs cold when i think of ityour condition and your risks said mr wilson  mine has run cold a good many years mr wilson at present its about up to the boiling point said george  well my good sir continued george after a few moments silence i saw you knew me i thought id just have this talk with you lest your surprised looks should bring me out i leave early tomorrow morning before daylight by tomorrow night i hope to sleep safe in ohio i shall travel by daylight stop at the best hotels go to the dinnertables with the lords of the land so goodby sir if you hear that im taken you may know that im dead  george stood up like a rock and put out his hand with the air of a prince the friendly little old man shook it heartily and after a little shower of caution he took his umbrella and fumbled his way out of the room  george stood thoughtfully looking at the door as the old man closed it a thought seemed to flash across his mind he hastily stepped to it and opening it said  mr wilson one word more  the old gentleman entered again and george as before locked the door and then stood for a few moments looking on the floor irresolutely at last raising his head with a sudden effortmr wilson you have shown yourself a christian in your treatment of mei want to ask one last deed of christian kindness of you  well george  well sirwhat you said was true i am running a dreadful risk there isnt on earth a living soul to care if i die he added drawing his breath hard and speaking with a great efforti shall be kicked out and buried like a dog and nobodyll think of it a day afteronly my poor wife poor soul shell mourn and grieve and if youd only contrive mr wilson to send this little pin to her she gave it to me for a christmas present poor child give it to her and tell her i loved her to the last will you will you he added earnestly  yes certainlypoor fellow said the old gentleman taking the pin with watery eyes and a melancholy quiver in his voice  tell her one thing said george its my last wish if she can get to canada to go there no matter how kind her mistress isno matter how much she loves her home beg her not to go backfor slavery always ends in misery tell her to bring up our boy a free man and then he wont suffer as i have tell her this mr wilson will you  yes george ill tell her but i trust you wont die take heartyoure a brave fellow trust in the lord george i wish in my heart you were safe through thoughthats what i do  is there a god to trust in said george in such a tone of bitter despair as arrested the old gentlemans words o ive seen things all my life that have made me feel that there cant be a god you christians dont know how these things look to us theres a god for you but is there any for us  o now dontdont my boy said the old man almost sobbing as he spoke dont feel so there isthere is clouds and darkness are around about him but righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne theres a god georgebelieve it trust in him and im sure hell help you everything will be set rightif not in this life in another  the real piety and benevolence of the simple old man invested him with a temporary dignity and authority as he spoke george stopped his distracted walk up and down the room stood thoughtfully a moment and then said quietly  thank you for saying that my good friend ill think of that    chapter xii  select incident of lawful trade   in ramah there was a voice heardweeping and lamentation and great mourning rachel weeping for her children and would not be comforted        jer 3115  mr haley and tom jogged onward in their wagon each for a time absorbed in his own reflections now the reflections of two men sitting side by side are a curious thingseated on the same seat having the same eyes ears hands and organs of all sorts and having pass before their eyes the same objectsit is wonderful what a variety we shall find in these same reflections  as for example mr haley he thought first of toms length and breadth and height and what he would sell for if he was kept fat and in good case till he got him into market he thought of how he should make out his gang he thought of the respective market value of certain supposititious men and women and children who were to compose it and other kindred topics of the business then he thought of himself and how humane he was that whereas other men chained their niggers hand and foot both he only put fetters on the feet and left tom the use of his hands as long as he behaved well and he sighed to think how ungrateful human nature was so that there was even room to doubt whether tom appreciated his mercies he had been taken in so by niggers whom he had favored but still he was astonished to consider how goodnatured he yet remained  as to tom he was thinking over some words of an unfashionable old book which kept running through his head again and again as follows we have here no continuing city but we seek one to come wherefore god himself is not ashamed to be called our god for he hath prepared for us a city these words of an ancient volume got up principally by ignorant and unlearned men have through all time kept up somehow a strange sort of power over the minds of poor simple fellows like tom they stir up the soul from its depths and rouse as with trumpet call courage energy and enthusiasm where before was only the blackness of despair  mr haley pulled out of his pocket sundry newspapers and began looking over their advertisements with absorbed interest he was not a remarkably fluent reader and was in the habit of reading in a sort of recitative halfaloud by way of calling in his ears to verify the deductions of his eyes in this tone he slowly recited the following paragraph   executors salenegroesagreeably to order of court will be sold on tuesday february 20 before the courthouse door in the town of washington kentucky the following negroes hagar aged 60 john aged 30 ben aged 21 saul aged 25 albert aged 14 sold for the benefit of the creditors and heirs of the estate of jesse blutchford  samuel morris thomas flint executors   this yer i must look at said he to tom for want of somebody else to talk to  ye see im going to get up a prime gang to take down with ye tom itll make it sociable and pleasant likegood company will ye know we must drive right to washington first and foremost and then ill clap you into jail while i does the business  tom received this agreeable intelligence quite meekly simply wondering in his own heart how many of these doomed men had wives and children and whether they would feel as he did about leaving them it is to be confessed too that the naive offhand information that he was to be thrown into jail by no means produced an agreeable impression on a poor fellow who had always prided himself on a strictly honest and upright course of life yes tom we must confess it was rather proud of his honesty poor fellownot having very much else to be proud ofif he had belonged to some of the higher walks of society he perhaps would never have been reduced to such straits however the day wore on and the evening saw haley and tom comfortably accommodated in washingtonthe one in a tavern and the other in a jail  about eleven oclock the next day a mixed throng was gathered around the courthouse stepssmoking chewing spitting swearing and conversing according to their respective tastes and turnswaiting for the auction to commence the men and women to be sold sat in a group apart talking in a low tone to each other the woman who had been advertised by the name of hagar was a regular african in feature and figure she might have been sixty but was older than that by hard work and disease was partially blind and somewhat crippled with rheumatism by her side stood her only remaining son albert a brightlooking little fellow of fourteen years the boy was the only survivor of a large family who had been successively sold away from her to a southern market the mother held on to him with both her shaking hands and eyed with intense trepidation every one who walked up to examine him  dont be feard aunt hagar said the oldest of the men i spoke to masr thomas bout it and he thought he might manage to sell you in a lot both together  dey neednt call me worn out yet said she lifting her shaking hands i can cook yet and scrub and scourim wuth a buying if i do come cheaptell em dat aryou tell em she added earnestly  haley here forced his way into the group walked up to the old man pulled his mouth open and looked in felt of his teeth made him stand and straighten himself bend his back and perform various evolutions to show his muscles and then passed on to the next and put him through the same trial walking up last to the boy he felt of his arms straightened his hands and looked at his fingers and made him jump to show his agility  he ant gwine to be sold widout me said the old woman with passionate eagerness he and i goes in a lot together i s rail strong yet masr and can do heaps o workheaps on it masr  on plantation said haley with a contemptuous glance likely story and as if satisfied with his examination he walked out and looked and stood with his hands in his pocket his cigar in his mouth and his hat cocked on one side ready for action  what think of em said a man who had been following haleys examination as if to make up his own mind from it  wal said haley spitting i shall put in i think for the youngerly ones and the boy  they want to sell the boy and the old woman together said the man  find it a tight pullwhy shes an old rack o bonesnot worth her salt  you wouldnt then said the man  anybody d be a fool t would shes half blind crooked with rheumatis and foolish to boot  some buys up these yer old critturs and ses theres a sight more wear in em than a body d think said the man reflectively  no go t all said haley wouldnt take her for a presentfactive seen now  wal t is kinder pity

plantationhandwouldnt be bothered with her no way not if theyd give her to me said haley  shell take on despt said the man  natlly she will said the trader coolly  the conversation was here interrupted by a busy hum in the audience and the auctioneer a short bustling important fellow elbowed his way into the crowd the old woman drew in her breath and caught instinctively at her son  keep close to yer mammy albertclosedeyll put us up togedder she said  o mammy im feard they wont said the boy  dey must child i cant live no ways if they dont said the old creature vehemently  the stentorian tones of the auctioneer calling out to clear the way now announced that the sale was about to commence a place was cleared and the bidding began the different men on the list were soon knocked off at prices which showed a pretty brisk demand in the market two of them fell to haley  come now young un said the auctioneer giving the boy a touch with his hammer be up and show your springs now  put us two up togedder togedderdo please masr said the old woman holding fast to her boy  be off said the man gruffly pushing her hands away you come last now darkey spring and with the word he pushed the boy toward the block while a deep heavy groan rose behind him the boy paused and looked back but there was no time to stay and dashing the tears from his large bright eyes he was up in a moment  his fine figure alert limbs and bright face raised an instant competition and half a dozen bids simultaneously met the ear of the auctioneer anxious halffrightened he looked from side to side as he heard the clatter of contending bidsnow here now theretill the hammer fell haley had got him he was pushed from the block toward his new master but stopped one moment and looked back when his poor old mother trembling in every limb held out her shaking hands toward him  buy me too masr for de dear lords sakebuy mei shall die if you dont  youll die if i do thats the kink of it said haleyno and he turned on his heel  the bidding for the poor old creature was summary the man who had addressed haley and who seemed not destitute of compassion bought her for a trifle and the spectators began to disperse  the poor victims of the sale who had been brought up in one place together for years gathered round the despairing old mother whose agony was pitiful to see  couldnt dey leave me one masr allers said i should have onehe did she repeated over and over in heartbroken tones  trust in the lord aunt hagar said the oldest of the men sorrowfully  what good will it do said she sobbing passionately  mother motherdont dont said the boy they say you s got a good master  i dont carei dont care o albert oh my boy you s my last baby lord how ken i  come take her off cant some of ye said haley dryly dont do no good for her to go on that ar way  the old men of the company partly by persuasion and partly by force loosed the poor creatures last despairing hold and as they led her off to her new masters wagon strove to comfort her  now said haley pushing his three purchases together and producing a bundle of handcuffs which he proceeded to put on their wrists and fastening each handcuff to a long chain he drove them before him to the jail  a few days saw haley with his possessions safely deposited on one of the ohio boats it was the commencement of his gang to be augmented as the boat moved on by various other merchandise of the same kind which he or his agent had stored for him in various points along shore  the la belle riviere as brave and beautiful a boat as ever walked the waters of her namesake river was floating gayly down the stream under a brilliant sky the stripes and stars of free america waving and fluttering over head the guards crowded with welldressed ladies and gentlemen walking and enjoying the delightful day all was full of life buoyant and rejoicingall but haleys gang who were stored with other freight on the lower deck and who somehow did not seem to appreciate their various privileges as they sat in a knot talking to each other in low tones  boys said haley coming up briskly i hope you keep up good heart and are cheerful now no sulks ye see keep stiff upper lip boys do well by me and ill do well by you  the boys addressed responded the invariable yes masr for ages the watchword of poor africa but its to be owned they did not look particularly cheerful they had their various little prejudices in favor of wives mothers sisters and children seen for the last timeand though they that wasted them required of them mirth it was not instantly forthcoming  ive got a wife spoke out the article enumerated as john aged thirty and he laid his chained hand on toms kneeand she dont know a word about this poor girl  where does she live said tom  in a tavern a piece down here said john i wish now i could see her once more in this world he added  poor john it was rather natural and the tears that fell as he spoke came as naturally as if he had been a white man tom drew a long breath from a sore heart and tried in his poor way to comfort him  and over head in the cabin sat fathers and mothers husbands and wives and merry dancing children moved round among them like so many little butterflies and everything was going on quite easy and comfortable  o mamma said a boy who had just come up from below theres a negro trader on board and hes brought four or five slaves down there  poor creatures said the mother in a tone between grief and indignation  whats that said another lady  some poor slaves below said the mother  and theyve got chains on said the boy  what a shame to our country that such sights are to be seen said another lady  o theres a great deal to be said on both sides of the subject said a genteel woman who sat at her stateroom door sewing while her little girl and boy were playing round her ive been south and i must say i think the negroes are better off than they would be to be free  in some respects some of them are well off i grant said the lady to whose remark she had answered the most dreadful part of slavery to my mind is its outrages on the feelings and affectionsthe separating of families for example  that is a bad thing certainly said the other lady holding up a babys dress she had just completed and looking intently on its trimmings but then i fancy it dont occur often  o it does said the first lady eagerly ive lived many years in kentucky and virginia both and ive seen enough to make any ones heart sick suppose maam your two children there should be taken from you and sold  we cant reason from our feelings to those of this class of persons said the other lady sorting out some worsteds on her lap  indeed maam you can know nothing of them if you say so answered the first lady warmly i was born and brought up among them i know they do feel just as keenlyeven more so perhapsas we do  the lady said indeed yawned and looked out the cabin window and finally repeated for a finale the remark with which she had begunafter all i think they are better off than they would be to be free  its undoubtedly the intention of providence that the african race should be servantskept in a low condition said a gravelooking gentleman in black a clergyman seated by the cabin door cursed be canaan a servant of servants shall he be the scripture says        gen 925  this is what noah says when he wakes out of      drunkenness and realizes that his youngest son ham father      of canaan has seen him naked  i say stranger is that ar what that text means said a tall man standing by  undoubtedly it pleased providence for some inscrutable reason to doom the race to bondage ages ago and we must not set up our opinion against that  well then well all go ahead and buy up niggers said the man if thats the way of providencewont we squire said he turning to haley who had been standing with his hands in his pockets by the stove and intently listening to the conversation  yes continued the tall man we must all be resigned to the decrees of providence niggers must be sold and trucked round and kept under its what theys made for pears like this yer view s quite refreshing ant it stranger said he to haley  i never thought on t said haley i couldnt have said as much myself i hant no larning i took up the trade just to make a living if tant right i calculated to pent on t in time ye know  and now youll save yerself the trouble wont ye said the tall man see what t is now to know scripture if yed only studied yer bible like this yer good man ye might have knowd it before and saved ye a heap o trouble ye could jist have said cussed bewhats his nameand t would all have come right and the stranger who was no other than the honest drover whom we introduced to our readers in the kentucky tavern sat down and began smoking with a curious smile on his long dry face  a tall slender young man with a face expressive of great feeling and intelligence here broke in and repeated the words all things whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you do ye even so unto them i suppose he added that is scripture as much as cursed be canaan  wal it seems quite as plain a text stranger said john the drover to poor fellows like us now and john smoked on like a volcano  the young man paused looked as if he was going to say more when suddenly the boat stopped and the company made the usual steamboat rush to see where they were landing  both them ar chaps parsons said john to one of the men as they were going out  the man nodded  as the boat stopped a black woman came running wildly up the plank darted into the crowd flew up to where the slave gang sat and threw her arms round that unfortunate piece of merchandise before enumeratejohn aged thirty and with sobs and tears bemoaned him as her husband  but what needs tell the story told too oftevery day toldof heartstrings rent and brokenthe weak broken and torn for the profit and convenience of the strong it needs not to be toldevery day is telling ittelling it too in the ear of one who is not deaf though he be long silent  the young man who had spoken for the cause of humanity and god before stood with folded arms looking on this scene he turned and haley was standing at his side my friend he said speaking with thick utterance how can you how dare you carry on a trade like this look at those poor creatures here i am rejoicing in my heart that i am going home to my wife and child and the same bell which is a signal to carry me onward towards them will part this poor man and his wife forever depend upon it god will bring you into judgment for this  the trader turned away in silence  i say now said the drover touching his elbow theres differences in parsons ant there cussed be canaan dont seem to go down with this un does it  haley gave an uneasy growl  and that ar ant the worst on t said john mabbee it wont go down with the lord neither when ye come to settle with him one o these days as all on us must i reckon  haley walked reflectively to the other end of the boat  if i make pretty handsomely on one or two next gangs he thought i reckon ill stop off this yer its really getting dangerous and he took out his pocketbook and began adding over his accountsa process which many gentlemen besides mr haley have found a specific for an uneasy conscience  the boat swept proudly away from the shore and all went on merrily as before men talked and loafed and read and smoked women sewed and children played and the boat passed on her way  one day when she lay to for a while at a small town in kentucky haley went up into the place on a little matter of business  tom whose fetters did not prevent his taking a moderate circuit had drawn near the side of the boat and stood listlessly gazing over the railing after a time he saw the trader returning with an alert step in company with a colored woman bearing in her arms a young child she was dressed quite respectably and a colored man followed her bringing along a small trunk the woman came cheerfully onward talking as she came with the man who bore her trunk and so passed up the plank into the boat the bell rung the steamer whizzed the engine groaned and coughed and away swept the boat down the river  the woman walked forward among the boxes and bales of the lower deck and sitting down busied herself with chirruping to her baby  haley made a turn or two about the boat and then coming up seated himself near her and began saying something to her in an indifferent undertone  tom soon noticed a heavy cloud passing over the womans brow and that she answered rapidly and with great vehemence  i dont believe iti wont believe it he heard her say youre jist a foolin with me  if you wont believe it look here said the man drawing out a paper this yers the bill of sale and theres your masters name to it and i paid down good solid cash for it too i can tell youso now  i dont believe masr would cheat me so it cant be true said the woman with increasing agitation  you can ask any of these men here that can read writing here he said to a man that was passing by jist read this yer wont you this yer gal wont believe me when i tell her what t is  why its a bill of sale signed by john fosdick said the man making over to you the girl lucy and her child its all straight enough for aught i see  the womans passionate exclamations collected a crowd around her and the trader briefly explained to them the cause of the agitation  he told me that i was going down to louisville to hire out as cook to the same tavern where my husband worksthats what masr told me his own self and i cant believe hed lie to me said the woman  but he has sold you my poor woman theres no doubt about it said a goodnatured looking man who had been examining the papers he has done it and no mistake  then its no account talking said the woman suddenly growing quite calm and clasping her child tighter in her arms she sat down on her box turned her back round and gazed listlessly into the river  going to take it easy after all said the trader gals got grit i see  the woman looked calm as the boat went on and a beautiful soft summer breeze passed like a compassionate spirit over her headthe gentle breeze that never inquires whether the brow is dusky or fair that it fans and she saw sunshine sparkling on the water in golden ripples and heard gay voices full of ease and pleasure talking around her everywhere but her heart lay as if a great stone had fallen on it her baby raised himself up against her and stroked her cheeks with his little hands and springing up and down crowing and chatting seemed determined to arouse her she strained him suddenly and tightly in her arms and slowly one tear after another fell on his wondering unconscious face and gradually she seemed and little by little to grow calmer and busied herself with tending and nursing him  the child a boy of ten months was uncommonly large and strong of his age and very vigorous in his limbs never for a moment still he kept his mother constantly busy in holding him and guarding his springing activity  thats a fine chap said a man suddenly stopping opposite to him with his hands in his pockets how old is he  ten months and a half said the mother  the man whistled to the boy and offered him part of a stick of candy which he eagerly grabbed at and very soon had it in a babys general depository to wit his mouth  rum fellow said the man knows whats what and he whistled and walked on when he had got to the other side of the boat he came across haley who was smoking on top of a pile of boxes  the stranger produced a match and lighted a cigar saying as he did so  decentish kind o wench youve got round there stranger  why i reckon she is tolable fair said haley blowing the smoke out of his mouth  taking her down south said the man  haley nodded and smoked on  plantation hand said the man  wal said haley im fillin out an order for a plantation and i think i shall put her in they telled me she was a good cook and they can use her for that or set her at the cottonpicking shes got the right fingers for that i looked at em sell well either way and haley resumed his cigar  they wont want the young un on the plantation said the man  i shall sell him first chance i find said haley lighting another cigar  spose youd be selling him tolable cheap said the stranger mounting the pile of boxes and sitting down comfortably  dont know bout that said haley hes a pretty smart young un straight fat strong flesh as hard as a brick  very true but then theres the bother and expense of raisin  nonsense said haley they is raised as easy as any kind of critter there is going they ant a bit more trouble than pups this yer chap will be running all around in a month  ive got a good place for raisin and i thought of takin in a little more stock said the man one cook lost a young un last weekgot drownded in a washtub while she was a hangin out the clothesand i reckon it would be well enough to set her to raisin this yer  haley and the stranger smoked a while in silence neither seeming willing to broach the test question of the interview at last the man resumed  you wouldnt think of wantin more than ten dollars for that ar chap seeing you must get him off yer hand any how  haley shook his head and spit impressively  that wont do no ways he said and began his smoking again  well stranger what will you take  well now said haley i could raise that ar chap myself or get him raised hes oncommon likely and healthy and hed fetch a hundred dollars six months hence and in a year or two hed bring two hundred if i had him in the right spot i shant take a cent less nor fifty for him now  o stranger thats rediculous altogether said the man  fact said haley with a decisive nod of his head  ill give thirty for him said the stranger but not a cent more  now ill tell ye what i will do said haley spitting again with renewed decision ill split the difference and say fortyfive and thats the most i will do  well agreed said the man after an interval  done said haley where do you land  at louisville said the man  louisville said haley very fair we get there about dusk chap will be asleepall fairget him off quietly and no screaminghappens beautifuli like to do everything quietlyi hates all kind of agitation and fluster and so after a transfer of certain bills had passed from the mans pocketbook to the traders he resumed his cigar  it was a bright tranquil evening when the boat stopped at the wharf at louisville the woman had been sitting with her baby in her arms now wrapped in a heavy sleep when she heard the name of the place called out she hastily laid the child down in a little cradle formed by the hollow among the boxes first carefully spreading under it her cloak and then she sprung to the side of the boat in hopes that among the various hotelwaiters who thronged the wharf she might see her husband in this hope she pressed forward to the front rails and stretching far over them strained her eyes intently on the moving heads on the shore and the crowd pressed in between her and the child  nows your time said haley taking the sleeping child up and handing him to the stranger dont wake him up and set him to crying now it would make a devil of a fuss with the gal the man took the bundle carefully and was soon lost in the crowd that went up the wharf  when the boat creaking and groaning and puffing had loosed from the wharf and was beginning slowly to strain herself along the woman returned to her old seat the trader was sitting therethe child was gone  why whywhere she began in bewildered surprise  lucy said the trader your childs gone you may as well know it first as last you see i knowd you couldnt take him down south and i got a chance to sell him to a firstrate family thatll raise him better than you can  the trader had arrived at that stage of christian and political perfection which has been recommended by some preachers and politicians of the north lately in which he had completely overcome every humane weakness and prejudice his heart was exactly where yours sir and mine could be brought with proper effort and cultivation the wild look of anguish and utter despair that the woman cast on him might have disturbed one less practised but he was used to it he had seen that same look hundreds of times you can get used to such things too my friend and it is the great object of recent efforts to make our whole northern community used to them for the glory of the union so the trader only regarded the mortal anguish which he saw working in those dark features those clenched hands and suffocating breathings as necessary incidents of the trade and merely calculated whether she was going to scream and get up a commotion on the boat for like other supporters of our peculiar institution he decidedly disliked agitation  but the woman did not scream the shot had passed too straight and direct through the heart for cry or tear  dizzily she sat down her slack hands fell lifeless by her side her eyes looked straight forward but she saw nothing all the noise and hum of the boat the groaning of the machinery mingled dreamily to her bewildered ear and the poor dumbstricken heart had neither cry not tear to show for its utter misery she was quite calm  the trader who considering his advantages was almost as humane as some of our politicians seemed to feel called on to administer such consolation as the case admitted of  i know this yer comes kinder hard at first lucy said he but such a smart sensible gal as you are wont give way to it you see its necessary and cant be helped  o dont masr dont said the woman with a voice like one that is smothering  youre a smart wench lucy he persisted i mean to do well by ye and get ye a nice place down river and youll soon get another husbandsuch a likely gal as you  o masr if you only wont talk to me now said the woman in a voice of such quick and living anguish that the trader felt that there was something at present in the case beyond his style of operation he got up and the woman turned away and buried her head in her cloak  the trader walked up and down for a time and occasionally stopped and looked at her  takes it hard rather he soliloquized but quiet tholet her sweat a while shell come right by and by  tom had watched the whole transaction from first to last and had a perfect understanding of its results to him it looked like something unutterably horrible and cruel because poor ignorant black soul he had not learned to generalize and to take enlarged views if he had only been instructed by certain ministers of christianity he might have thought better of it and seen in it an everyday incident of a lawful trade a trade which is the vital support of an institution which an american divine tells us has no evils but such as are inseparable from any other relations in social and domestic life but tom as we see being a poor ignorant fellow whose reading had been confined entirely to the new testament could not comfort and solace himself with views like these his very soul bled within him for what seemed to him the wrongs of the poor suffering thing that lay like a crushed reed on the boxes the feeling living bleeding yet immortal thing which american state law coolly classes with the bundles and bales and boxes among which she is lying        dr joel parker of philadelphia mrs stowes note      presbyterian clergyman 17991873 a friend of the beecher      family mrs stowe attempted unsuccessfully to have this      identifying note removed from the stereotypeplate of the      first edition  tom drew near and tried to say something but she only groaned honestly and with tears running down his own cheeks he spoke of a heart of love in the skies of a pitying jesus and an eternal home but the ear was deaf with anguish and the palsied heart could not feel  night came onnight calm unmoved and glorious shining down with her innumerable and solemn angel eyes twinkling beautiful but silent there was no speech nor language no pitying voice or helping hand from that distant sky one after another the voices of business or pleasure died away all on the boat were sleeping and the ripples at the prow were plainly heard tom stretched himself out on a box and there as he lay he heard ever and anon a smothered sob or cry from the prostrate creatureo what shall i do o lord o good lord do help me and so ever and anon until the murmur died away in silence  at midnight tom waked with a sudden start something black passed quickly by him to the side of the boat and he heard a splash in the water no one else saw or heard anything he raised his headthe womans place was vacant he got up and sought about him in vain the poor bleeding heart was still at last and the river rippled and dimpled just as brightly as if it had not closed above it  patience patience ye whose hearts swell indignant at wrongs like these not one throb of anguish not one tear of the oppressed is forgotten by the man of sorrows the lord of glory in his patient generous bosom he bears the anguish of a world bear thou like him in patience and labor in love for sure as he is god the year of his redeemed shall come  the trader waked up bright and early and came out to see to his live stock it was now his turn to look about in perplexity  where alive is that gal he said to tom  tom who had learned the wisdom of keeping counsel did not feel called upon to state his observations and suspicions but said he did not know  she surely couldnt have got off in the night at any of the landings for i was awake and on the lookout whenever the boat stopped i never trust these yer things to other folks  this speech was addressed to tom quite confidentially as if it was something that would be specially interesting to him tom made no answer  the trader searched the boat from stem to stern among boxes bales and barrels around the machinery by the chimneys in vain  now i say tom be fair about this yer he said when after a fruitless search he came where tom was standing you know something about it now dont tell mei know you do i saw the gal stretched out here about ten oclock and agin at twelve and agin between one and two and then at four she was gone and you was a sleeping right there all the time now you know somethingyou cant help it  well masr said tom towards morning something brushed by me and i kinder half woke and then i hearn a great splash and then i clare woke up and the gal was gone thats all i know on t  the trader was not shocked nor amazed because as we said before he was used to a great many things that you are not used to even the awful presence of death struck no solemn chill upon him he had seen death many timesmet him in the way of trade and got acquainted with himand he only thought of him as a hard customer that embarrassed his property operations very unfairly and so he only swore that the gal was a baggage and that he was devilish unlucky and that if things went on in this way he should not make a cent on the trip in short he seemed to consider himself an illused man decidedly but there was no help for it as the woman had escaped into a state which never will give up a fugitivenot even at the demand of the whole glorious union the trader therefore sat discontentedly down with his little accountbook and put down the missing body and soul under the head of losses  hes a shocking creature isnt hethis trader so unfeeling its dreadful really  o but nobody thinks anything of these traders they are universally despisednever received into any decent society  but who sir makes the trader who is most to blame the enlightened cultivated intelligent man who supports the system of which the trader is the inevitable result or the poor trader himself you make the public statement that calls for his trade that debauches and depraves him till he feels no shame in it and in what are you better than he  are you educated and he ignorant you high and he low you refined and he coarse you talented and he simple  in the day of a future judgment these very considerations may make it more tolerable for him than for you  in concluding these little incidents of lawful trade we must beg the world not to think that american legislators are entirely destitute of humanity as might perhaps be unfairly inferred from the great efforts made in our national body to protect and perpetuate this species of traffic  who does not know how our great men are outdoing themselves in declaiming against the foreign slavetrade there are a perfect host of clarksons and wilberforces risen up among us on that subject most edifying to hear and behold trading negroes from africa dear reader is so horrid it is not to be thought of but trading them from kentuckythats quite another thing

cookingstove rows of shining tin suggestive of unmentionable good things to the appetite glossy green wood chairs old and firm a small flagbottomed rockingchair with a patchwork cushion in it neatly contrived out of small pieces of different colored woollen goods and a larger sized one motherly and old whose wide arms breathed hospitable invitation seconded by the solicitation of its feather cushionsa real comfortable persuasive old chair and worth in the way of honest homely enjoyment a dozen of your plush or brochetelle drawingroom gentry and in the chair gently swaying back and forward her eyes bent on some fine sewing sat our fine old friend eliza yes there she is paler and thinner than in her kentucky home with a world of quiet sorrow lying under the shadow of her long eyelashes and marking the outline of her gentle mouth it was plain to see how old and firm the girlish heart was grown under the discipline of heavy sorrow and when anon her large dark eye was raised to follow the gambols of her little harry who was sporting like some tropical butterfly hither and thither over the floor she showed a depth of firmness and steady resolve that was never there in her earlier and happier days  by her side sat a woman with a bright tin pan in her lap into which she was carefully sorting some dried peaches she might be fiftyfive or sixty but hers was one of those faces that time seems to touch only to brighten and adorn the snowy lisse crape cap made after the strait quaker patternthe plain white muslin handkerchief lying in placid folds across her bosomthe drab shawl and dressshowed at once the community to which she belonged her face was round and rosy with a healthful downy softness suggestive of a ripe peach her hair partially silvered by age was parted smoothly back from a high placid forehead on which time had written no inscription except peace on earth good will to men and beneath shone a large pair of clear honest loving brown eyes you only needed to look straight into them to feel that you saw to the bottom of a heart as good and true as ever throbbed in womans bosom so much has been said and sung of beautiful young girls why dont somebody wake up to the beauty of old women if any want to get up an inspiration under this head we refer them to our good friend rachel halliday just as she sits there in her little rockingchair it had a turn for quacking and squeakingthat chair hadeither from having taken cold in early life or from some asthmatic affection or perhaps from nervous derangement but as she gently swung backward and forward the chair kept up a kind of subdued creechy crawchy that would have been intolerable in any other chair but old simeon halliday often declared it was as good as any music to him and the children all avowed that they wouldnt miss of hearing mothers chair for anything in the world for why for twenty years or more nothing but loving words and gentle moralities and motherly loving kindness had come from that chairheadaches and heartaches innumerable had been cured theredifficulties spiritual and temporal solved thereall by one good loving woman god bless her  and so thee still thinks of going to canada eliza she said as she was quietly looking over her peaches  yes maam said eliza firmly i must go onward i dare not stop  and whatll thee do when thee gets there thee must think about that my daughter  my daughter came naturally from the lips of rachel halliday for hers was just the face and form that made mother seem the most natural word in the world  elizas hands trembled and some tears fell on her fine work but she answered firmly  i shall doanything i can find i hope i can find something  thee knows thee can stay here as long as thee pleases said rachel  o thank you said eliza butshe pointed to harryi cant sleep nights i cant rest last night i dreamed i saw that man coming into the yard she said shuddering  poor child said rachel wiping her eyes but thee mustnt feel so the lord hath ordered it so that never hath a fugitive been stolen from our village i trust thine will not be the first  the door here opened and a little short round pincushiony woman stood at the door with a cheery blooming face like a ripe apple she was dressed like rachel in sober gray with the muslin folded neatly across her round plump little chest  ruth stedman said rachel coming joyfully forward how is thee ruth she said heartily taking both her hands  nicely said ruth taking off her little drab bonnet and dusting it with her handkerchief displaying as she did so a round little head on which the quaker cap sat with a sort of jaunty air despite all the stroking and patting of the small fat hands which were busily applied to arranging it certain stray locks of decidedly curly hair too had escaped here and there and had to be coaxed and cajoled into their place again and then the new comer who might have been fiveandtwenty turned from the small lookingglass before which she had been making these arrangements and looked well pleasedas most people who looked at her might have beenfor she was decidedly a wholesome wholehearted chirruping little woman as ever gladdened mans heart withal  ruth this friend is eliza harris and this is the little boy i told thee of  i am glad to see thee elizavery said ruth shaking hands as if eliza were an old friend she had long been expecting and this is thy dear boyi brought a cake for him she said holding out a little heart to the boy who came up gazing through his curls and accepted it shyly  wheres thy baby ruth said rachel  o hes coming but thy mary caught him as i came in and ran off with him to the barn to show him to the children  at this moment the door opened and mary an honest rosylooking girl with large brown eyes like her mothers came in with the baby  ah ha said rachel coming up and taking the great white fat fellow in her arms how good he looks and how he does grow  to be sure he does said little bustling ruth as she took the child and began taking off a little blue silk hood and various layers and wrappers of outer garments and having given a twitch here and a pull there and variously adjusted and arranged him and kissed him heartily she set him on the floor to collect his thoughts baby seemed quite used to this mode of proceeding for he put his thumb in his mouth as if it were quite a thing of course and seemed soon absorbed in his own reflections while the mother seated herself and taking out a long stocking of mixed blue and white yarn began to knit with briskness  mary theed better fill the kettle hadnt thee gently suggested the mother  mary took the kettle to the well and soon reappearing placed it over the stove where it was soon purring and steaming a sort of censer of hospitality and good cheer the peaches moreover in obedience to a few gentle whispers from rachel were soon deposited by the same hand in a stewpan over the fire  rachel now took down a snowy mouldingboard and tying on an apron proceeded quietly to making up some biscuits first saying to marymary hadnt thee better tell john to get a chicken ready and mary disappeared accordingly  and how is abigail peters said rachel as she went on with her biscuits  o shes better said ruth i was in this morning made the bed tidied up the house leah hills went in this afternoon and baked bread and pies enough to last some days and i engaged to go back to get her up this evening  i will go in tomorrow and do any cleaning there may be and look over the mending said rachel  ah that is well said ruth ive heard she added that hannah stanwood is sick john was up there last nighti must go there tomorrow  john can come in here to his meals if thee needs to stay all day suggested rachel  thank thee rachel will see tomorrow but here comes simeon  simeon halliday a tall straight muscular man in drab coat and pantaloons and broadbrimmed hat now entered  how is thee ruth he said warmly as he spread his broad open hand for her little fat palm and how is john  o john is well and all the rest of our folks said ruth cheerily  any news father said rachel as she was putting her biscuits into the oven  peter stebbins told me that they should be along tonight with friends said simeon significantly as he was washing his hands at a neat sink in a little back porch  indeed said rachel looking thoughtfully and glancing at eliza  did thee say thy name was harris said simeon to eliza as he reentered  rachel glanced quickly at her husband as eliza tremulously answered yes her fears ever uppermost suggesting that possibly there might be advertisements out for her  mother said simeon standing in the porch and calling rachel out  what does thee want father said rachel rubbing her floury hands as she went into the porch  this childs husband is in the settlement and will be here tonight said simeon  now thee doesnt say that father said rachel all her face radiant with joy  its really true peter was down yesterday with the wagon to the other stand and there he found an old woman and two men and one said his name was george harris and from what he told of his history i am certain who he is he is a bright likely fellow too  shall we tell her now said simeon  lets tell ruth said rachel here ruthcome here  ruth laid down her knittingwork and was in the back porch in a moment  ruth what does thee think said rachel father says elizas husband is in the last company and will be here tonight  a burst of joy from the little quakeress interrupted the speech she gave such a bound from the floor as she clapped her little hands that two stray curls fell from under her quaker cap and lay brightly on her white neckerchief  hush thee dear said rachel gently hush ruth tell us shall we tell her now  now to be surethis very minute why now suppose t was my john how should i feel do tell her right off  thee uses thyself only to learn how to love thy neighbor ruth said simeon looking with a beaming face on ruth  to be sure isnt it what we are made for if i didnt love john and the baby i should not know how to feel for her come now do tell herdo and she laid her hands persuasively on rachels arm take her into thy bedroom there and let me fry the chicken while thee does it  rachel came out into the kitchen where eliza was sewing and opening the door of a small bedroom said gently come in here with me my daughter i have news to tell thee  the blood flushed in elizas pale face she rose trembling with nervous anxiety and looked towards her boy  no no said little ruth darting up and seizing her hands never thee fear its good news elizago in go in and she gently pushed her to the door which closed after her and then turning round she caught little harry in her arms and began kissing him  theell see thy father little one does thee know it thy father is coming she said over and over again as the boy looked wonderingly at her  meanwhile within the door another scene was going on rachel halliday drew eliza toward her and said the lord hath had mercy on thee daughter thy husband hath escaped from the house of bondage  the blood flushed to elizas cheek in a sudden glow and went back to her heart with as sudden a rush she sat down pale and faint  have courage child said rachel laying her hand on her head he is among friends who will bring him here tonight  tonight eliza repeated tonight the words lost all meaning to her her head was dreamy and confused all was mist for a moment   when she awoke she found herself snugly tucked up on the bed with a blanket over her and little ruth rubbing her hands with camphor she opened her eyes in a state of dreamy delicious languor such as one who has long been bearing a heavy load and now feels it gone and would rest the tension of the nerves which had never ceased a moment since the first hour of her flight had given way and a strange feeling of security and rest came over her and as she lay with her large dark eyes open she followed as in a quiet dream the motions of those about her she saw the door open into the other room saw the suppertable with its snowy cloth heard the dreamy murmur of the singing teakettle saw ruth tripping backward and forward with plates of cake and saucers of preserves and ever and anon stopping to put a cake into harrys hand or pat his head or twine his long curls round her snowy fingers she saw the ample motherly form of rachel as she ever and anon came to the bedside and smoothed and arranged something about the bedclothes and gave a tuck here and there by way of expressing her goodwill and was conscious of a kind of sunshine beaming down upon her from her large clear brown eyes she saw ruths husband come insaw her fly up to him and commence whispering very earnestly ever and anon with impressive gesture pointing her little finger toward the room she saw her with the baby in her arms sitting down to tea she saw them all at table and little harry in a high chair under the shadow of rachels ample wing there were low murmurs of talk gentle tinkling of teaspoons and musical clatter of cups and saucers and all mingled in a delightful dream of rest and eliza slept as she had not slept before since the fearful midnight hour when she had taken her child and fled through the frosty starlight  she dreamed of a beautiful countrya land it seemed to her of restgreen shores pleasant islands and beautifully glittering water and there in a house which kind voices told her was a home she saw her boy playing free and happy child she heard her husbands footsteps she felt him coming nearer his arms were around her his tears falling on her face and she awoke it was no dream the daylight had long faded her child lay calmly sleeping by her side a candle was burning dimly on the stand and her husband was sobbing by her pillow   the next morning was a cheerful one at the quaker house mother was up betimes and surrounded by busy girls and boys whom we had scarce time to introduce to our readers yesterday and who all moved obediently to rachels gentle thee had better or more gentle hadnt thee better in the work of getting breakfast for a breakfast in the luxurious valleys of indiana is a thing complicated and multiform and like picking up the roseleaves and trimming the bushes in paradise asking other hands than those of the original mother while therefore john ran to the spring for fresh water and simeon the second sifted meal for corncakes and mary ground coffee rachel moved gently and quietly about making biscuits cutting up chicken and diffusing a sort of sunny radiance over the whole proceeding generally if there was any danger of friction or collision from the illregulated zeal of so many young operators her gentle come come or i wouldnt now was quite sufficient to allay the difficulty bards have written of the cestus of venus that turned the heads of all the world in successive generations we had rather for our part have the cestus of rachel halliday that kept heads from being turned and made everything go on harmoniously we think it is more suited to our modern days decidedly  while all other preparations were going on simeon the elder stood in his shirtsleeves before a little lookingglass in the corner engaged in the antipatriarchal operation of shaving everything went on so sociably so quietly so harmoniously in the great kitchenit seemed so pleasant to every one to do just what they were doing there was such an atmosphere of mutual confidence and good fellowship everywhereeven the knives and forks had a social clatter as they went on to the table and the chicken and ham had a cheerful and joyous fizzle in the pan as if they rather enjoyed being cooked than otherwiseand when george and eliza and little harry came out they met such a hearty rejoicing welcome no wonder it seemed to them like a dream  at last they were all seated at breakfast while mary stood at the stove baking griddlecakes which as they gained the true exact goldenbrown tint of perfection were transferred quite handily to the table  rachel never looked so truly and benignly happy as at the head of her table there was so much motherliness and fullheartedness even in the way she passed a plate of cakes or poured a cup of coffee that it seemed to put a spirit into the food and drink she offered  it was the first time that ever george had sat down on equal terms at any white mans table and he sat down at first with some constraint and awkwardness but they all exhaled and went off like fog in the genial morning rays of this simple overflowing kindness  this indeed was a homehomea word that george had never yet known a meaning for and a belief in god and trust in his providence began to encircle his heart as with a golden cloud of protection and confidence dark misanthropic pining atheistic doubts and fierce despair melted away before the light of a living gospel breathed in living faces preached by a thousand unconscious acts of love and good will which like the cup of cold water given in the name of a disciple shall never lose their reward  father what if thee should get found out again said simeon second as he buttered his cake  i should pay my fine said simeon quietly  but what if they put thee in prison  couldnt thee and mother manage the farm said simeon smiling  mother can do almost everything said the boy but isnt it a shame to make such laws  thee mustnt speak evil of thy rulers simeon said his father gravely the lord only gives us our worldly goods that we may do justice and mercy if our rulers require a price of us for it we must deliver it up  well i hate those old slaveholders said the boy who felt as unchristian as became any modern reformer  i am surprised at thee son said simeon thy mother never taught thee so i would do even the same for the slaveholder as for the slave if the lord brought him to my door in affliction  simeon second blushed scarlet but his mother only smiled and said simeon is my good boy he will grow older by and by and then he will be like his father  i hope my good sir that you are not exposed to any difficulty on our account said george anxiously  fear nothing george for therefore are we sent into the world if we would not meet trouble for a good cause we were not worthy of our name  but for me said george i could not bear it  fear not then friend george it is not for thee but for god and man we do it said simeon and now thou must lie by quietly this day and tonight at ten oclock phineas fletcher will carry thee onward to the next standthee and the rest of they company the pursuers are hard after thee we must not delay  if that is the case why wait till evening said george  thou art safe here by daylight for every one in the settlement is a friend and all are watching it has been found safer to travel by night    chapter xiv  evangeline       a young star which shone      oer lifetoo sweet an image for such glass      a lovely being scarcely formed or moulded      a rose with all its sweetest leaves yet folded  the mississippi how as by an enchanted wand have its scenes been changed since chateaubriand wrote his prosepoetic description of it as a river of mighty unbroken solitudes rolling amid undreamed wonders of vegetable and animal existence        in atala or the love and constantcy of two savages in      the desert 1801 by francois auguste rene vicomte de      chateaubriand 17681848  but as in an hour this river of dreams and wild romance has emerged to a reality scarcely less visionary and splendid what other river of the world bears on its bosom to the ocean the wealth and enterprise of such another countrya country whose products embrace all between the tropics and the poles those turbid waters hurrying foaming tearing along an apt resemblance of that headlong tide of business which is poured along its wave by a race more vehement and energetic than any the old world ever saw ah would that they did not also bear along a more fearful freightthe tears of the oppressed the sighs of the helpless the bitter prayers of poor ignorant hearts to an unknown godunknown unseen and silent but who will yet come out of his place to save all the poor of the earth  the slanting light of the setting sun quivers on the sealike expanse of the river the shivery canes and the tall dark cypress hung with wreaths of dark funereal moss glow in the golden ray as the heavilyladen steamboat marches onward  piled with cottonbales from many a plantation up over deck and sides till she seems in the distance a square massive block of gray she moves heavily onward to the nearing mart we must look some time among its crowded decks before we shall find again our humble friend tom high on the upper deck in a little nook among the everywhere predominant cottonbales at last we may find him  partly from confidence inspired by mr shelbys representations and partly from the remarkably inoffensive and quiet character of the man tom had insensibly won his way far into the confidence even of such a man as haley  at first he had watched him narrowly through the day and never allowed him to sleep at night unfettered but the uncomplaining patience and apparent contentment of toms manner led him gradually to discontinue these restraints and for some time tom had enjoyed a sort of parole of honor being permitted to come and go freely where he pleased on the boat  ever quiet and obliging and more than ready to lend a hand in every emergency which occurred among the workmen below he had won the good opinion of all the hands and spent many hours in helping them with as hearty a good will as ever he worked on a kentucky farm  when there seemed to be nothing for him to do he would climb to a nook among the cottonbales of the upper deck and busy himself in studying over his bibleand it is there we see him now  for a hundred or more miles above new orleans the river is higher than the surrounding country and rolls its tremendous volume between massive levees twenty feet in height the traveller from the deck of the steamer as from some floating castle top overlooks the whole country for miles and miles around tom therefore had spread out full before him in plantation after plantation a map of the life to which he was approaching  he saw the distant slaves at their toil he saw afar their villages of huts gleaming out in long rows on many a plantation distant from the stately mansions and pleasuregrounds of the masterand as the moving picture passed on his poor foolish heart would be turning backward to the kentucky farm with its old shadowy beechesto the masters house with its wide cool halls and near by the little cabin overgrown with the multiflora and bignonia there he seemed to see familiar faces of comrades who had grown up with him from infancy he saw his busy wife bustling in her preparations for his evening meals he heard the merry laugh of his boys at their play and the chirrup of the baby at his knee and then with a start all faded and he saw again the canebrakes and cypresses and gliding plantations and heard again the creaking and groaning of the machinery all telling him too plainly that all that phase of life had gone by forever  in such a case you write to your wife and send messages to your children but tom could not writethe mail for him had no existence and the gulf of separation was unbridged by even a friendly word or signal  is it strange then that some tears fall on the pages of his bible as he lays it on the cottonbale and with patient finger threading his slow way from word to word traces out its promises having learned late in life tom was but a slow reader and passed on laboriously from verse to verse fortunate for him was it that the book he was intent on was one which slow reading cannot injurenay one whose words like ingots of gold seem often to need to be weighed separately that the mind may take in their priceless value let us follow him a moment as pointing to each word and pronouncing each half aloud he reads  letnotyourheartbetroubled inmy fathershousearemanymansions igotoprepareaplaceforyou  cicero when he buried his darling and only daughter had a heart as full of honest grief as poor tomsperhaps no fuller for both were only menbut cicero could pause over no such sublime words of hope and look to no such future reunion and if he had seen them ten to one he would not have believedhe must fill his head first with a thousand questions of authenticity of manuscript and correctness of translation but to poor tom there it lay just what he needed so evidently true and divine that the possibility of a question never entered his simple head it must be true for if not true how could he live  as for toms bible though it had no annotations and helps in margin from learned commentators still it had been embellished with certain waymarks and guideboards of toms own invention and which helped him more than the most learned expositions could have done it had been his custom to get the bible read to him by his masters children in particular by young master george and as they read he would designate by bold strong marks and dashes with pen and ink the passages which more particularly gratified his ear or affected his heart his bible was thus marked through from one end to the other with a variety of styles and designations so he could in a moment seize upon his favorite passages without the labor of spelling out what lay between themand while it lay there before him every passage breathing of some old home scene and recalling some past enjoyment his bible seemed to him all of this life that remained as well as the promise of a future one  among the passengers on the boat was a young gentleman of fortune and family resident in new orleans who bore the name of st clare he had with him a daughter between five and six years of age together with a lady who seemed to claim relationship to both and to have the little one especially under her charge  tom had often caught glimpses of this little girlfor she was one of those busy tripping creatures that can be no more contained in one place than a sunbeam or a summer breezenor was she one that once seen could be easily forgotten  her form was the perfection of childish beauty without its usual chubbiness and squareness of outline there was about it an undulating and aerial grace such as one might dream of for some mythic and allegorical being her face was remarkable less for its perfect beauty of feature than for a singular and dreamy earnestness of expression which made the ideal start when they looked at her and by which the dullest and most literal were impressed without exactly knowing why the shape of her head and the turn of her neck and bust was peculiarly noble and the long goldenbrown hair that floated like a cloud around it the deep spiritual gravity of her violet blue eyes shaded by heavy fringes of golden brownall marked her out from other children and made every one turn and look after her as she glided hither and thither on the boat nevertheless the little one was not what you would have called either a grave child or a sad one on the contrary an airy and innocent playfulness seemed to flicker like the shadow of summer leaves over her childish face and around her buoyant figure she was always in motion always with a half smile on her rosy mouth flying hither and thither with an undulating and cloudlike tread singing to herself as she moved as in a happy dream her father and female guardian were incessantly busy in pursuit of herbut when caught she melted from them again like a summer cloud and as no word of chiding or reproof ever fell on her ear for whatever she chose to do she pursued her own way all over the boat always dressed in white she seemed to move like a shadow through all sorts of places without contracting spot or stain and there was not a corner or nook above or below where those fairy footsteps had not glided and that visionary golden head with its deep blue eyes fleeted along  the fireman as he looked up from his sweaty toil sometimes found those eyes looking wonderingly into the raging depths of the furnace and fearfully and pityingly at him as if she thought him in some dreadful danger anon the steersman at the wheel paused and smiled as the picturelike head gleamed through the window of the round house and in a moment was gone again a thousand times a day rough voices blessed her and smiles of unwonted softness stole over hard faces as she passed and when she tripped fearlessly over dangerous places rough sooty hands were stretched involuntarily out to save her and smooth her path  tom who had the soft impressible nature of his kindly race ever yearning toward the simple and childlike watched the little creature with daily increasing interest to him she seemed something almost divine and whenever her golden head and deep blue eyes peered out upon him from behind some dusky cottonbale or looked down upon him over some ridge of packages he half believed that he saw one of the angels stepped out of his new testament  often and often she walked mournfully round the place where haleys gang of men and women sat in their chains she would glide in among them and look at them with an air of perplexed and sorrowful earnestness and sometimes she would lift their chains with her slender hands and then sigh wofully as she glided away several times she appeared suddenly among them with her hands full of candy nuts and oranges which she would distribute joyfully to them and then be gone again  tom watched the little lady a great deal before he ventured on any overtures towards acquaintanceship he knew an abundance of simple acts to propitiate and invite the approaches of the little people and he resolved to play his part right skilfully he could cut cunning little baskets out of cherrystones could make grotesque faces on hickorynuts or oddjumping figures out of elderpith and he was a very pan in the manufacture of whistles of all sizes and sorts his pockets were full of miscellaneous articles of attraction which he had hoarded in days of old for his masters children and which he now produced with commendable prudence and economy one by one as overtures for acquaintance and friendship  the little one was shy for all her busy interest in everything going on and it was not easy to tame her for a while she would perch like a canarybird on some box or package near tom while busy in the little arts aforenamed and take from him with a kind of grave bashfulness the little articles he offered but at last they got on quite confidential terms  whats little missys name said tom at last when he thought matters were ripe to push such an inquiry  evangeline st clare said the little one though papa and everybody else call me eva now whats your name  my names tom the little chilen used to call me uncle tom way back thar in kentuck  then i mean to call you uncle tom because you see i like you said eva so uncle tom where are you going  i dont know miss eva  dont know said eva  no i am going to be sold to somebody i dont know who  my papa can buy you said eva quickly and if he buys you you will have good times i mean to ask him this very day  thank you my little lady said tom  the boat here stopped at a small landing to take in wood and eva hearing her fathers voice bounded nimbly away tom rose up and went forward to offer his service in wooding and soon was busy among the hands  eva and her father were standing together by the railings to see the boat start from the landingplace the wheel had made two or three revolutions in the water when by some sudden movement the little one suddenly lost her balance and fell sheer over the side of the boat into the water her father scarce knowing what he did was plunging in after her but was held back by some behind him who saw that more efficient aid had followed his child  tom was standing just under her on the lower deck as she fell he saw her strike the water and sink and was after her in a moment a broadchested strongarmed fellow it was nothing for him to keep afloat in the water till in a moment or two the child rose to the surface and he caught her in his arms and swimming with her to the boatside handed her up all dripping to the grasp of hundreds of hands which as if they had all belonged to one man were stretched eagerly out to receive her a few moments more and her father bore her dripping and senseless to the ladies cabin where as is usual in cases of the kind there ensued a very wellmeaning and kindhearted strife among the female occupants generally as to who should do the most things to make a disturbance and to hinder her recovery in every way possible   it was a sultry close day the next day as the steamer drew near to new orleans a general bustle of expectation and preparation was spread through the boat in the cabin one and another were gathering their things together and arranging them preparatory to going ashore the steward and chambermaid and all were busily engaged in cleaning furbishing and arranging the splendid boat preparatory to a grand entree  on the lower deck sat our friend tom with his arms folded and anxiously from time to time turning his eyes towards a group on the other side of the boat  there stood the fair evangeline a little paler than the day before but otherwise exhibiting no traces of the accident which had befallen her a graceful elegantlyformed young man stood by her carelessly leaning one elbow on a bale of cotton while a large pocketbook lay open before him it was quite evident at a glance that the gentleman was evas father there was the same noble cast of head the same large blue eyes the same goldenbrown hair yet the expression was wholly different in the large clear blue eyes though in form and color exactly similar there was wanting that misty dreamy depth of expression all was clear bold and bright but with a light wholly of this world the beautifully cut mouth had a proud and somewhat sarcastic expression while an air of freeandeasy superiority sat not ungracefully in every turn and movement of his fine form he was listening with a goodhumored negligent air half comic half contemptuous to haley who was very volubly expatiating on the quality of the article for which they were bargaining  all the moral and christian virtues bound in black morocco complete he said when haley had finished well now my good fellow whats the damage as they say in kentucky in short whats to be paid out for this business how much are you going to cheat me now out with it  wal said haley if i should say thirteen hundred dollars for that ar fellow i shouldnt but just save myself i shouldnt now rely  poor fellow said the young man fixing his keen mocking blue eye on him but i suppose youd let me have him for that out of a particular regard for me  well the young lady here seems to be sot on him and natlly enough  o certainly theres a call on your benevolence my friend now as a matter of christian charity how cheap could you afford to let him go to oblige a young lady thats particular sot on him  wal now just think on t said the trader just look at them limbsbroadchested strong as a horse look at his head them high forrads allays shows calculatin niggers thatll do any kind o thing ive marked that ar now a nigger of that ar heft and build is worth considerable just as you may say for his body supposin hes stupid but come to put in his calculatin faculties and them which i can show he has oncommon why of course it makes him come higher why that ar fellow managed his masters whole farm he has a strornary talent for business  bad bad very bad knows altogether too much said the young man with the same mocking smile playing about his mouth never will do in the world your smart fellows are always running off stealing horses and raising the devil generally i think youll have to take off a couple of hundred for his smartness  wal there might be something in that ar if it warnt for his character but i can show recommends from his master and others to prove he is one of your real piousthe most humble prayin pious crittur ye ever did see why hes been called a preacher in them parts he came from  and i might use him for a family chaplain possibly added the young man dryly thats quite an idea religion is a remarkably scarce article at our house  youre joking now  how do you know i am didnt you just warrant him for a preacher has he been examined by any synod or council come hand over your papers  if the trader had not been sure by a certain goodhumored twinkle in the large eye that all this banter was sure in the long run to turn out a cash concern he might have been somewhat out of patience as it was he laid down a greasy pocketbook on the cottonbales and began anxiously studying over certain papers in it the young man standing by the while looking down on him with an air of careless easy drollery  papa do buy him its no matter what you pay whispered eva softly getting up on a package and putting her arm around her fathers neck you have money enough i know i want him  what for pussy are you going to use him for a rattlebox or a rockinghorse or what  i want to make him happy  an original reason certainly  here the trader handed up a certificate signed by mr shelby which the young man took with the tips of his long fingers and glanced over carelessly  a gentlemanly hand he said and well spelt too well now but im not sure after all about this religion said he the old wicked expression returning to his eye the country is almost ruined with pious white people such pious politicians as we have just before electionssuch pious goings on in all departments of church and state that a fellow does not know wholl cheat him next i dont know either about religions being up in the market just now i have not looked in the papers lately to see how it sells how many hundred dollars now do you put on for this religion  you like to be jokin now said the trader but then theres sense under all that ar i know theres differences in religion some kinds is misrable theres your meetin pious theres your singin roarin pious them ar ant no account in black or whitebut these rayly is and ive seen it in niggers as often as any your rail softly quiet stiddy honest pious that the hull world couldnt tempt em to do nothing that they thinks is wrong and ye see in this letter what toms old master says about him  now said the young man stooping gravely over his book of bills if you can assure me that i really can buy this kind of pious and that it will be set down to my account in the book up above as something belonging to me i wouldnt care if i did go a little extra for it how dye say  wal raily i cant do that said the trader im a thinkin that every manll have to hang on his own hook in them ar quarters  rather hard on a fellow that pays extra on religion and cant trade with it in the state where he wants it most ant it now said the young man who had been making out a roll of bills while he was speaking there count your money old boy he added as he handed the roll to the trader  all right said haley his face beaming with delight and pulling out an old inkhorn he proceeded to fill out a bill of sale which in a few moments he handed to the young man  i wonder now if i was divided up and inventoried said the latter as he ran over the paper how much i might bring say so much for the shape of my head so much for a high forehead so much for arms and hands and legs and then so much for education learning talent honesty religion bless me there would be small charge on that last im thinking but come eva he said and taking the hand of his daughter he stepped across the boat and carelessly putting the tip of his finger under toms chin said goodhumoredly lookup tom and see how you like your new master  tom looked up it was not in nature to look into that gay young handsome face without a feeling of pleasure and tom felt the tears start in his eyes as he said heartily god bless you masr  well i hope he will whats your name tom quite as likely to do it for your asking as mine from all accounts can you drive horses tom  ive been allays used to horses said tom masr shelby raised heaps of em  well i think i shall put you in coachy on condition that you wont be drunk more than once a week unless in cases of emergency tom  tom looked surprised and rather hurt and said i never drink masr  ive heard that story before tom but then well see it will be a special accommodation to all concerned if you dont never mind my boy he added goodhumoredly seeing tom still looked grave i dont doubt you mean to do well  i sartin do masr said tom  and you shall have good times said eva papa is very good to everybody only he always will laugh at them  papa is much obliged to you for his recommendation said st clare laughing as he turned on his heel and walked away    chapter xv  of toms new master and various other matters   since the thread of our humble heros life has now become interwoven with that of higher ones it is necessary to give some brief introduction to them  augustine st clare was the son of a wealthy planter of louisiana the family had its origin in canada of two brothers very similar in temperament and character one had settled on a flourishing farm in vermont and the other became an opulent planter in louisiana the mother of augustine was a huguenot french lady whose family had emigrated to louisiana during the days of its early settlement augustine and another brother were the only children of their parents having inherited from his mother an exceeding delicacy of constitution he was at the instance of physicians during many years of his boyhood sent to the care of his uncle in vermont in order that his constitution might be strengthened by the cold of a more bracing climate  in childhood he was remarkable for an extreme and marked sensitiveness of character more akin to the softness of woman than the ordinary hardness of his own sex time however overgrew this softness with the rough bark of manhood and but few knew how living and fresh it still lay at the core his talents were of the very first order although his mind showed a preference always for the ideal and the aesthetic and there was about him that repugnance to the actual business of life which is the common result of this balance of the faculties soon after the completion of his college course his whole nature was kindled into one intense and passionate effervescence of romantic passion his hour camethe hour that comes only once his star rose in the horizonthat star that rises so often in vain to be remembered only as a thing of dreams and it rose for him in vain to drop the figurehe saw and won the love of a highminded and beautiful woman in one of the northern states and they were affianced he returned south to make arrangements for their marriage when most unexpectedly his letters were returned to him by mail with a short note from her guardian stating to him that ere this reached him the lady would be the wife of another stung to madness he vainly hoped as many another has done to fling the whole thing from his heart by one desperate effort too proud to supplicate or seek explanation he threw himself at once into a whirl of fashionable society and in a fortnight from the time of the fatal letter was the accepted lover of the reigning belle of the season and as soon as arrangements could be made he became the husband of a fine figure a pair of bright dark eyes and a hundred thousand dollars and of course everybody thought him a happy fellow  the married couple were enjoying their honeymoon and entertaining a brilliant circle of friends in their splendid villa near lake pontchartrain when one day a letter was brought to him in that wellremembered writing it was handed to him while he was in full tide of gay and successful conversation in a whole roomfull of company he turned deadly pale when he saw the writing but still preserved his composure and finished the playful warfare of badinage which he was at the moment carrying on with a lady opposite and a short time after was missed from the circle in his room alone he opened and read the letter now worse than idle and useless to be read it was from her giving a long account of a persecution to which she had been exposed by her guardians family to lead her to unite herself with their son and she related how for a long time his letters had ceased to arrive how she had written time and again till she became weary and doubtful how her health had failed under her anxieties and how at last she had discovered the whole fraud which had been practised on them both the letter ended with expressions of hope and thankfulness and professions of undying affection which were more bitter than death to the unhappy young man he wrote to her immediately  i have received yoursbut too late i believed all i heard i was desperate i am married and all is over only forgetit is all that remains for either of us  and thus ended the whole romance and ideal of life for augustine st clare but the real remainedthe real like the flat bare oozy tidemud when the blue sparkling wave with all its company of gliding boats and whitewinged ships its music of oars and chiming waters has gone down and there it lies flat slimy bareexceedingly real  of course in a novel peoples hearts break and they die and that is the end of it and in a story this is very convenient but in real life we do not die when all that makes life bright dies to us there is a most busy and important round of eating drinking dressing walking visiting buying selling talking reading and all that makes up what is commonly called living yet to be gone through and this yet remained to augustine had his wife been a whole woman she might yet have done somethingas woman canto mend the broken threads of life and weave again into a tissue of brightness but marie st clare could not even see that they had been broken as before stated she consisted of a fine figure a pair of splendid eyes and a hundred thousand dollars and none of these items were precisely the ones to minister to a mind diseased  when augustine pale as death was found lying on the sofa and pleaded sudden sickheadache as the cause of his distress she recommended to him to smell of hartshorn and when the paleness and headache came on week after week she only said that she never thought mr st clare was sickly but it seems he was very liable to sickheadaches and that it was a very unfortunate thing for her because he didnt enjoy going into company with her and it seemed odd to go so much alone when they were just married augustine was glad in his heart that he had married so undiscerning a woman but as the glosses and civilities of the honeymoon wore away he discovered that a beautiful young woman who has lived all her life to be caressed and waited on might prove quite a hard mistress in domestic life marie never had possessed much capability of affection or much sensibility and the little that she had had been merged into a most intense and unconscious selfishness a selfishness the more hopeless from its quiet obtuseness its utter ignorance of any claims but her own from her infancy she had been surrounded with servants who lived only to study her caprices the idea that they had either feelings or rights had never dawned upon her even in distant perspective her father whose only child she had been had never denied her anything that lay within the compass of human possibility and when she entered life beautiful accomplished and an heiress she had of course all the eligibles and noneligibles of the other sex sighing at her feet and she had no doubt that augustine was a most fortunate man in having obtained her it is a great mistake to suppose that a woman with no heart will be an easy creditor in the exchange of affection there is not on earth a more merciless exactor of love from others than a thoroughly selfish woman and the more unlovely she grows the more jealously and scrupulously she exacts love to the uttermost farthing when therefore st clare began to drop off those gallantries and small attentions which flowed at first through the habitude of courtship he found his sultana no way ready to resign her slave there were abundance of tears poutings and small tempests there were discontents pinings upbraidings st clare was goodnatured and selfindulgent and sought to buy off with presents and flatteries and when marie became mother to a beautiful daughter he really felt awakened for a time to something like tenderness  st clares mother had been a woman of uncommon elevation and purity of character and he gave to his child his mothers name fondly fancying that she would prove a reproduction of her image the thing had been remarked with petulant jealousy by his wife and she regarded her husbands absorbing devotion to the child with suspicion and dislike all that was given to her seemed so much taken from herself from the time of the birth of this child her health gradually sunk a life of constant inaction bodily and mentalthe friction of ceaseless ennui and discontent united to the ordinary weakness which attended the period of maternityin course of a few years changed the blooming young belle into a yellow faded sickly woman whose time was divided among a variety of fanciful diseases and who considered herself in every sense the most illused and suffering person in existence  there was no end of her various complaints but her principal forte appeared to lie in sickheadache which sometimes would confine her to her room three days out of six as of course all family arrangements fell into the hands of servants st clare found his menage anything but comfortable his only daughter was exceedingly delicate and he feared that with no one to look after her and attend to her her health and life might yet fall a sacrifice to her mothers inefficiency he had taken her with him on a tour to vermont and had persuaded his cousin miss ophelia st clare to return with him to his southern residence and they are now returning on this boat where we have introduced them to our readers  and now while the distant domes and spires of new orleans rise to our view there is yet time for an introduction to miss ophelia  whoever has travelled in the new england states will remember in some cool village the large farmhouse with its cleanswept grassy yard shaded by the dense and massive foliage of the sugar maple and remember the air of order and stillness of perpetuity and unchanging repose that seemed to breathe over the whole place nothing lost or out of order not a picket loose in the fence not a particle of litter in the turfy yard with its clumps of lilac bushes growing up under the windows within he will remember wide clean rooms where nothing ever seems to be doing or going to be done where everything is once and forever rigidly in place and where all household arrangements move with the punctual exactness of the old clock in the corner in the family keepingroom as it is termed he will remember the staid respectable old bookcase with its glass doors where rollins history miltons paradise lost bunyans pilgrims progress and scotts family bible stand side by side in decorous order with multitudes of other books equally solemn and respectable there are no servants in the house but the lady in the snowy cap with the spectacles who sits sewing every afternoon among her daughters as if nothing ever had been done or were to be doneshe and her girls in some longforgotten fore part of the day did up the work and for the rest of the time probably at all hours when you would see them it is done up the old kitchen floor never seems stained or spotted the tables the chairs and the various cooking utensils never seem deranged or disordered though three and sometimes four meals a day are got there though the family washing and ironing is there performed and though pounds of butter and cheese are in some silent and mysterious manner there brought into existence        the ancient history ten volumes 17301738 by the      french historian charles rollin 16611741        scotts family bible 17881792 edited with notes by      the english biblical commentator thomas scott 17471821  on such a farm in such a house and family miss ophelia had spent a quiet existence of some fortyfive years when her cousin invited her to visit his southern mansion the eldest of a large family she was still considered by her father and mother as one of the children and the proposal that she should go to orleans was a most momentous one to the family circle the old grayheaded father took down morses atlas out of the bookcase and looked out the exact latitude and longitude and read flints travels in the south and west to make up his own mind as to the nature of the country        the cerographic atlas of the united states 18421845      by sidney edwards morse 17941871 son of the geographer      jedidiah morse and brother of the painterinventor samuel      f b morse        recollections of the last ten years 1826 by timothy      flint 17801840 missionary of presbyterianism to the      transallegheny west  the good mother inquired anxiously if orleans wasnt an awful wicked place saying that it seemed to her most equal to going to the sandwich islands or anywhere among the heathen  it was known at the ministers and at the doctors and at miss peabodys milliner shop that ophelia st clare was talking about going away down to orleans with her cousin and of course the whole village could do no less than help this very important process of talking about the matter the minister who inclined strongly to abolitionist views was quite doubtful whether such a step might not tend somewhat to encourage the southerners in holding on to their slaves while the doctor who was a stanch colonizationist inclined to the opinion that miss ophelia ought to go to show the orleans people that we dont think hardly of them after all he was of opinion in fact that southern people needed encouraging when however the fact that she had resolved to go was fully before the public mind she was solemnly invited out to tea by all her friends and neighbors for the space of a fortnight and her prospects and plans duly canvassed and inquired into miss moseley who came into the house to help to do the dressmaking acquired daily accessions of importance from the developments with regard to miss ophelias wardrobe which she had been enabled to make it was credibly ascertained that squire sinclare as his name was commonly contracted in the neighborhood had counted out fifty dollars and given them to miss ophelia and told her to buy any clothes she thought best and that two new silk dresses and a bonnet had been sent for from boston as to the propriety of this extraordinary outlay the public mind was dividedsome affirming that it was well enough all things considered for once in ones life and others stoutly affirming that the money had better have been sent to the missionaries but all parties agreed that there had been no such parasol seen in those parts as had been sent on from new york and that she had one silk dress that might fairly be trusted to stand alone whatever might be said of its mistress there were credible rumors also of a hemstitched pockethandkerchief and report even went so far as to state that miss ophelia had one pockethandkerchief with lace all around itit was even added that it was worked in the corners but this latter point was never satisfactorily ascertained and remains in fact unsettled to this day  miss ophelia as you now behold her stands before you in a very shining brown linen travellingdress tall squareformed and angular her face was thin and rather sharp in its outlines the lips compressed like those of a person who is in the habit of making up her mind definitely on all subjects while the keen dark eyes had a peculiarly searching advised movement and travelled over everything as if they were looking for something to take care of  all her movements were sharp decided and energetic and though she was never much of a talker her words were remarkably direct and to the purpose when she did speak  in her habits she was a living impersonation of order method and exactness in punctuality she was as inevitable as a clock and as inexorable as a railroad engine and she held in most decided contempt and abomination anything of a contrary character  the great sin of sins in her eyesthe sum of all evilswas expressed by one very common and important word in her vocabularyshiftlessness her finale and ultimatum of contempt consisted in a very emphatic pronunciation of the word shiftless and by this she characterized all modes of procedure which had not a direct and inevitable relation to accomplishment of some purpose then definitely had in mind people who did nothing or who did not know exactly what they were going to do or who did not take the most direct way to accomplish what they set their hands to were objects of her entire contempta contempt shown less frequently by anything she said than by a kind of stony grimness as if she scorned to say anything about the matter  as to mental cultivationshe had a clear strong active mind was well and thoroughly read in history and the older english classics and thought with great strength within certain narrow limits her theological tenets were all made up labelled in most positive and distinct forms and put by like the bundles in her patch trunk there were just so many of them and there were never to be any more so also were her ideas with regard to most matters of practical lifesuch as housekeeping in all its branches and the various political relations of her native village and underlying all deeper than anything else higher and broader lay the strongest principle of her beingconscientiousness nowhere is conscience so dominant and allabsorbing as with new england women it is the granite formation which lies deepest and rises out even to the tops of the highest mountains  miss ophelia was the absolute bondslave of the ought once make her certain that the path of duty as she commonly phrased it lay in any given direction and fire and water could not keep her from it she would walk straight down into a well or up to a loaded cannons mouth if she were only quite sure that there the path lay her standard of right was so high so allembracing so minute and making so few concessions to human frailty that though she strove with heroic ardor to reach it she never actually did so and of course was burdened with a constant and often harassing sense of deficiencythis gave a severe and somewhat gloomy cast to her religious character  but how in the world can miss ophelia get along with augustine st claregay easy unpunctual unpractical scepticalin shortwalking with impudent and nonchalant freedom over every one of her most cherished habits and opinions  to tell the truth then miss ophelia loved him when a boy it had been hers to teach him his catechism mend his clothes comb his hair and bring him up generally in the way he should go and her heart having a warm side to it augustine had as he usually did with most people monopolized a large share of it for himself and therefore it was that he succeeded very easily in persuading her that the path of duty lay in the direction of new orleans and that she must go with him to take care of eva and keep everything from going to wreck and ruin during the frequent illnesses of his wife the idea of a house without anybody to take care of it went to her heart then she loved the lovely little girl as few could help doing and though she regarded augustine as very much of a heathen yet she loved him laughed at his jokes and forbore with his failings to an extent which those who knew him thought perfectly incredible but what more or other is to be known of miss ophelia our reader must discover by a personal acquaintance  there she is sitting now in her stateroom surrounded by a mixed multitude of little and big carpetbags boxes baskets each containing some separate responsibility which she is tying binding up packing or fastening with a face of great earnestness  now eva have you kept count of your things of course you haventchildren never do theres the spotted carpetbag and the little blue bandbox with your best bonnetthats two then the india rubber satchel is three and my tape and needle box is four and my bandbox five and my collarbox and that little hair trunk seven what have you done with your sunshade give it to me and let me put a paper round it and tie it to my umbrella with my shadethere now  why aunty we are only

said eva  its a dreadful shiftless one said aunty  why aunty whatll you do now said eva that trunk is too full to be shut down  it must shut down said aunty with the air of a general as she squeezed the things in and sprung upon the lidstill a little gap remained about the mouth of the trunk  get up here eva said miss ophelia courageously what has been done can be done again this trunk has got to be shut and lockedthere are no two ways about it  and the trunk intimidated doubtless by this resolute statement gave in the hasp snapped sharply in its hole and miss ophelia turned the key and pocketed it in triumph  now were ready wheres your papa i think it time this baggage was set out do look out eva and see if you see your papa  o yes hes down the other end of the gentlemens cabin eating an orange  he cant know how near we are coming said aunty hadnt you better run and speak to him  papa never is in a hurry about anything said eva and we havent come to the landing do step on the guards aunty look theres our house up that street  the boat now began with heavy groans like some vast tired monster to prepare to push up among the multiplied steamers at the levee eva joyously pointed out the various spires domes and waymarks by which she recognized her native city  yes yes dear very fine said miss ophelia but mercy on us the boat has stopped where is your father  and now ensued the usual turmoil of landingwaiters running twenty ways at oncemen tugging trunks carpetbags boxeswomen anxiously calling to their children and everybody crowding in a dense mass to the plank towards the landing  miss ophelia seated herself resolutely on the lately vanquished trunk and marshalling all her goods and chattels in fine military order seemed resolved to defend them to the last  shall i take your trunk maam shall i take your baggage let me tend to your baggage missis shant i carry out these yer missis rained down upon her unheeded she sat with grim determination upright as a darningneedle stuck in a board holding on her bundle of umbrella and parasols and replying with a determination that was enough to strike dismay even into a hackman wondering to eva in each interval what upon earth her papa could be thinking of he couldnt have fallen over nowbut something must have happenedand just as she had begun to work herself into a real distress he came up with his usually careless motion and giving eva a quarter of the orange he was eating said  well cousin vermont i suppose you are all ready  ive been ready waiting nearly an hour said miss ophelia i began to be really concerned about you  thats a clever fellow now said he well the carriage is waiting and the crowd are now off so that one can walk out in a decent and christian manner and not be pushed and shoved here he added to a driver who stood behind him take these things  ill go and see to his putting them in said miss ophelia  o pshaw cousin whats the use said st clare  well at any rate ill carry this and this and this said miss ophelia singling out three boxes and a small carpetbag  my dear miss vermont positively you mustnt come the green mountains over us that way you must adopt at least a piece of a southern principle and not walk out under all that load theyll take you for a waitingmaid give them to this fellow hell put them down as if they were eggs now  miss ophelia looked despairingly as her cousin took all her treasures from her and rejoiced to find herself once more in the carriage with them in a state of preservation  wheres tom said eva  o hes on the outside pussy im going to take tom up to mother for a peaceoffering to make up for that drunken fellow that upset the carriage  o tom will make a splendid driver i know said eva hell never get drunk  the carriage stopped in front of an ancient mansion built in that odd mixture of spanish and french style of which there are specimens in some parts of new orleans it was built in the moorish fashiona square building enclosing a courtyard into which the carriage drove through an arched gateway the court in the inside had evidently been arranged to gratify a picturesque and voluptuous ideality wide galleries ran all around the four sides whose moorish arches slender pillars and arabesque ornaments carried the mind back as in a dream to the reign of oriental romance in spain in the middle of the court a fountain threw high its silvery water falling in a neverceasing spray into a marble basin fringed with a deep border of fragrant violets the water in the fountain pellucid as crystal was alive with myriads of gold and silver fishes twinkling and darting through it like so many living jewels around the fountain ran a walk paved with a mosaic of pebbles laid in various fanciful patterns and this again was surrounded by turf smooth as green velvet while a carriagedrive enclosed the whole two large orangetrees now fragrant with blossoms threw a delicious shade and ranged in a circle round upon the turf were marble vases of arabesque sculpture containing the choicest flowering plants of the tropics huge pomegranate trees with their glossy leaves and flamecolored flowers darkleaved arabian jessamines with their silvery stars geraniums luxuriant roses bending beneath their heavy abundance of flowers golden jessamines lemonscented verbenum all united their bloom and fragrance while here and there a mystic old aloe with its strange massive leaves sat looking like some old enchanter sitting in weird grandeur among the more perishable bloom and fragrance around it  the galleries that surrounded the court were festooned with a curtain of some kind of moorish stuff and could be drawn down at pleasure to exclude the beams of the sun on the whole the appearance of the place was luxurious and romantic  as the carriage drove in eva seemed like a bird ready to burst from a cage with the wild eagerness of her delight  o isnt it beautiful lovely my own dear darling home she said to miss ophelia isnt it beautiful  t is a pretty place said miss ophelia as she alighted though it looks rather old and heathenish to me  tom got down from the carriage and looked about with an air of calm still enjoyment the negro it must be remembered is an exotic of the most gorgeous and superb countries of the world and he has deep in his heart a passion for all that is splendid rich and fanciful a passion which rudely indulged by an untrained taste draws on them the ridicule of the colder and more correct white race  st clare who was in heart a poetical voluptuary smiled as miss ophelia made her remark on his premises and turning to tom who was standing looking round his beaming black face perfectly radiant with admiration he said  tom my boy this seems to suit you  yes masr it looks about the right thing said tom  all this passed in a moment while trunks were being hustled off hackman paid and while a crowd of all ages and sizesmen women and childrencame running through the galleries both above and below to see masr come in foremost among them was a highlydressed young mulatto man evidently a very distingue personage attired in the ultra extreme of the mode and gracefully waving a scented cambric handkerchief in his hand  this personage had been exerting himself with great alacrity in driving all the flock of domestics to the other end of the verandah  back all of you i am ashamed of you he said in a tone of authority would you intrude on masters domestic relations in the first hour of his return  all looked abashed at this elegant speech delivered with quite an air and stood huddled together at a respectful distance except two stout porters who came up and began conveying away the baggage  owing to mr adolphs systematic arrangements when st clare turned round from paying the hackman there was nobody in view but mr adolph himself conspicuous in satin vest gold guardchain and white pants and bowing with inexpressible grace and suavity  ah adolph is it you said his master offering his hand to him how are you boy while adolph poured forth with great fluency an extemporary speech which he had been preparing with great care for a fortnight before  well well said st clare passing on with his usual air of negligent drollery thats very well got up adolph see that the baggage is well bestowed ill come to the people in a minute and so saying he led miss ophelia to a large parlor that opened on the verandah  while this had been passing eva had flown like a bird through the porch and parlor to a little boudoir opening likewise on the verandah  a tall darkeyed sallow woman half rose from a couch on which she was reclining  mamma said eva in a sort of a rapture throwing herself on her neck and embracing her over and over again  thatll dotake care childdont you make my head ache said the mother after she had languidly kissed her  st clare came in embraced his wife in true orthodox husbandly fashion and then presented to her his cousin marie lifted her large eyes on her cousin with an air of some curiosity and received her with languid politeness a crowd of servants now pressed to the entry door and among them a middleaged mulatto woman of very respectable appearance stood foremost in a tremor of expectation and joy at the door  o theres mammy said eva as she flew across the room and throwing herself into her arms she kissed her repeatedly  this woman did not tell her that she made her head ache but on the contrary she hugged her and laughed and cried till her sanity was a thing to be doubted of and when released from her eva flew from one to another shaking hands and kissing in a way that miss ophelia afterwards declared fairly turned her stomach  well said miss ophelia you southern children can do something that i couldnt  what now pray said st clare  well i want to be kind to everybody and i wouldnt have anything hurt but as to kissing  niggers said st clare that youre not up tohey  yes thats it how can she  st clare laughed as he went into the passage halloa here whats to pay out here here you allmammy jimmy polly sukeyglad to see masr he said as he went shaking hands from one to another look out for the babies he added as he stumbled over a sooty little urchin who was crawling upon all fours if i step upon anybody let em mention it  there was an abundance of laughing and blessing masr as st clare distributed small pieces of change among them  come now take yourselves off like good boys and girls he said and the whole assemblage dark and light disappeared through a door into a large verandah followed by eva who carried a large satchel which she had been filling with apples nuts candy ribbons laces and toys of every description during her whole homeward journey  as st clare turned to go back his eye fell upon tom who was standing uneasily shifting from one foot to the other while adolph stood negligently leaning against the banisters examining tom through an operaglass with an air that would have done credit to any dandy living  puh you puppy said his master striking down the opera glass is that the way you treat your company seems to me dolph he added laying his finger on the elegant figured satin vest that adolph was sporting seems to me thats my vest  o master this vest all stained with wine of course a gentleman in masters standing never wears a vest like this i understood i was to take it it does for a poor niggerfellow like me  and adolph tossed his head and passed his fingers through his scented hair with a grace  so thats it is it said st clare carelessly well here im going to show this tom to his mistress and then you take him to the kitchen and mind you dont put on any of your airs to him hes worth two such puppies as you  master always will have his joke said adolph laughing im delighted to see master in such spirits  here tom said st clare beckoning  tom entered the room he looked wistfully on the velvet carpets and the before unimagined splendors of mirrors pictures statues and curtains and like the queen of sheba before solomon there was no more spirit in him he looked afraid even to set his feet down  see here marie said st clare to his wife ive bought you a coachman at last to order i tell you hes a regular hearse for blackness and sobriety and will drive you like a funeral if you want open your eyes now and look at him now dont say i never think about you when im gone  marie opened her eyes and fixed them on tom without rising  i know hell get drunk she said  no hes warranted a pious and sober article  well i hope he may turn out well said the lady its more than i expect though  dolph said st clare show tom down stairs and mind yourself he added remember what i told you  adolph tripped gracefully forward and tom with lumbering tread went after  hes a perfect behemoth said marie  come now marie said st clare seating himself on a stool beside her sofa be gracious and say something pretty to a fellow  youve been gone a fortnight beyond the time said the lady pouting  well you know i wrote you the reason  such a short cold letter said the lady  dear me the mail was just going and it had to be that or nothing  thats just the way always said the lady always something to make your journeys long and letters short  see here now he added drawing an elegant velvet case out of his pocket and opening it heres a present i got for you in new york  it was a daguerreotype clear and soft as an engraving representing eva and her father sitting hand in hand  marie looked at it with a dissatisfied air  what made you sit in such an awkward position she said  well the position may be a matter of opinion but what do you think of the likeness  if you dont think anything of my opinion in one case i suppose you wouldnt in another said the lady shutting the daguerreotype  hang the woman said st clare mentally but aloud he added come now marie what do you think of the likeness dont be nonsensical now  its very inconsiderate of you st clare said the lady to insist on my talking and looking at things you know ive been lying all day with the sickheadache and theres been such a tumult made ever since you came im half dead  youre subject to the sickheadache maam said miss ophelia suddenly rising from the depths of the large armchair where she had sat quietly taking an inventory of the furniture and calculating its expense  yes im a perfect martyr to it said the lady  juniperberry tea is good for sickheadache said miss ophelia at least auguste deacon abraham perrys wife used to say so and she was a great nurse  ill have the first juniperberries that get ripe in our garden by the lake brought in for that special purpose said st clare gravely pulling the bell as he did so meanwhile cousin you must be wanting to retire to your apartment and refresh yourself a little after your journey dolph he added tell mammy to come here the decent mulatto woman whom eva had caressed so rapturously soon entered she was dressed neatly with a high red and yellow turban on her head the recent gift of eva and which the child had been arranging on her head mammy said st clare i put this lady under your care she is tired and wants rest take her to her chamber and be sure she is made comfortable and miss ophelia disappeared in the rear of mammy    chapter xvi  toms mistress and her opinions  and now marie said st clare your golden days are dawning here is our practical businesslike new england cousin who will take the whole budget of cares off your shoulders and give you time to refresh yourself and grow young and handsome the ceremony of delivering the keys had better come off forthwith  this remark was made at the breakfasttable a few mornings after miss ophelia had arrived  im sure shes welcome said marie leaning her head languidly on her hand i think shell find one thing if she does and that is that its we mistresses that are the slaves down here  o certainly she will discover that and a world of wholesome truths besides no doubt said st clare  talk about our keeping slaves as if we did it for our convenience said marie im sure if we consulted that we might let them all go at once  evangeline fixed her large serious eyes on her mothers face with an earnest and perplexed expression and said simply what do you keep them for mamma  i dont know im sure except for a plague they are the plague of my life i believe that more of my ill health is caused by them than by any one thing and ours i know are the very worst that ever anybody was plagued with  o come marie youve got the blues this morning said st clare you know t isnt so theres mammy the best creature livingwhat could you do without her  mammy is the best i ever knew said marie and yet mammy now is selfishdreadfully selfish its the fault of the whole race  selfishness is a dreadful fault said st clare gravely  well now theres mammy said marie i think its selfish of her to sleep so sound nights she knows i need little attentions almost every hour when my worst turns are on and yet shes so hard to wake i absolutely am worse this very morning for the efforts i had to make to wake her last night  hasnt she sat up with you a good many nights lately mamma said eva  how should you know that said marie sharply shes been complaining i suppose  she didnt complain she only told me what bad nights youd hadso many in succession  why dont you let jane or rosa take her place a night or two said st clare and let her rest  how can you propose it said marie st clare you really are inconsiderate so nervous as i am the least breath disturbs me and a strange hand about me would drive me absolutely frantic if mammy felt the interest in me she ought to shed wake easierof course she would ive heard of people who had such devoted servants but it never was my luck and marie sighed  miss ophelia had listened to this conversation with an air of shrewd observant gravity and she still kept her lips tightly compressed as if determined fully to ascertain her longitude and position before she committed herself  now mammy has a sort of goodness said marie shes smooth and respectful but shes selfish at heart now she never will be done fidgeting and worrying about that husband of hers you see when i was married and came to live here of course i had to bring her with me and her husband my father couldnt spare he was a blacksmith and of course very necessary and i thought and said at the time that mammy and he had better give each other up as it wasnt likely to be convenient for them ever to live together again i wish now id insisted on it and married mammy to somebody else but i was foolish and indulgent and didnt want to insist i told mammy at the time that she mustnt ever expect to see him more than once or twice in her life again for the air of fathers place doesnt agree with my health and i cant go there and i advised her to take up with somebody else but noshe wouldnt mammy has a kind of obstinacy about her in spots that everybody dont see as i do  has she children said miss ophelia  yes she has two  i suppose she feels the separation from them  well of course i couldnt bring them they were little dirty thingsi couldnt have them about and besides they took up too much of her time but i believe that mammy has always kept up a sort of sulkiness about this she wont marry anybody else and i do believe now though she knows how necessary she is to me and how feeble my health is she would go back to her husband tomorrow if she only could i do indeed said marie they are just so selfish now the best of them  its distressing to reflect upon said st clare dryly  miss ophelia looked keenly at him and saw the flush of mortification and repressed vexation and the sarcastic curl of the lip as he spoke  now mammy has always been a pet with me said marie i wish some of your northern servants could look at her closets of dressessilks and muslins and one real linen cambric she has hanging there ive worked sometimes whole afternoons trimming her caps and getting her ready to go to a party as to abuse she dont know what it is she never was whipped more than once or twice in her whole life she has her strong coffee or her tea every day with white sugar in it its abominable to be sure but st clare will have high life belowstairs and they every one of them live just as they please the fact is our servants are overindulged i suppose it is partly our fault that they are selfish and act like spoiled children but ive talked to st clare till i am tired  and i too said st clare taking up the morning paper  eva the beautiful eva had stood listening to her mother with that expression of deep and mystic earnestness which was peculiar to her she walked softly round to her mothers chair and put her arms round her neck  well eva what now said marie  mamma couldnt i take care of you one nightjust one i know i shouldnt make you nervous and i shouldnt sleep i often lie awake nights thinking  o nonsense childnonsense said marie you are such a strange child  but may i mamma i think she said timidly that mammy isnt well she told me her head ached all the time lately  o thats just one of mammys fidgets mammy is just like all the rest of themmakes such a fuss about every little headache or fingerache itll never do to encourage itnever im principled about this matter said she turning to miss ophelia youll find the necessity of it if you encourage servants in giving way to every little disagreeable feeling and complaining of every little ailment youll have your hands full i never complain myselfnobody knows what i endure i feel it a duty to bear it quietly and i do  miss ophelias round eyes expressed an undisguised amazement at this peroration which struck st clare as so supremely ludicrous that he burst into a loud laugh  st clare always laughs when i make the least allusion to my ill health said marie with the voice of a suffering martyr i only hope the day wont come when hell remember it and marie put her handkerchief to her eyes  of course there was rather a foolish silence finally st clare got up looked at his watch and said he had an engagement down street eva tripped away after him and miss ophelia and marie remained at the table alone  now thats just like st clare said the latter withdrawing her handkerchief with somewhat of a spirited flourish when the criminal to be affected by it was no longer in sight he never realizes never can never will what i suffer and have for years if i was one of the complaining sort or ever made any fuss about my ailments there would be some reason for it men do get tired naturally of a complaining wife but ive kept things to myself and borne and borne till st clare has got in the way of thinking i can bear anything  miss ophelia did not exactly know what she was expected to answer to this  while she was thinking what to say marie gradually wiped away her tears and smoothed her plumage in a general sort of way as a dove might be supposed to make toilet after a shower and began a housewifely chat with miss ophelia concerning cupboards closets linenpresses storerooms and other matters of which the latter was by common understanding to assume the directiongiving her so many cautious directions and charges that a head less systematic and businesslike than miss ophelias would have been utterly dizzied and confounded  and now said marie i believe ive told you everything so that when my next sick turn comes on youll be able to go forward entirely without consulting meonly about evashe requires watching  she seems to be a good child very said miss ophelia i never saw a better child  evas peculiar said her mother very there are things about her so singular she isnt like me now a particle and marie sighed as if this was a truly melancholy consideration  miss ophelia in her own heart said i hope she isnt but had prudence enough to keep it down  eva always was disposed to be with servants and i think that well enough with some children now i always played with fathers little negroesit never did me any harm but eva somehow always seems to put herself on an equality with every creature that comes near her its a strange thing about the child i never have been able to break her of it st clare i believe encourages her in it the fact is st clare indulges every creature under this roof but his own wife  again miss ophelia sat in blank silence  now theres no way with servants said marie but to put them down and keep them down it was always natural to me from a child eva is enough to spoil a whole housefull what she will do when she comes to keep house herself im sure i dont know i hold to being kind to servantsi always am but you must make em know their place eva never does theres no getting into the childs head the first beginning of an idea what a servants place is you heard her offering to take care of me nights to let mammy sleep thats just a specimen of the way the child would be doing all the time if she was left to herself  why said miss ophelia bluntly i suppose you think your servants are human creatures and ought to have some rest when they are tired  certainly of course im very particular in letting them have everything that comes convenientanything that doesnt put one at all out of the way you know mammy can make up her sleep some time or other theres no difficulty about that shes the sleepiest concern that ever i saw sewing standing or sitting that creature will go to sleep and sleep anywhere and everywhere no danger but mammy gets sleep enough but this treating servants as if they were exotic flowers or china vases is really ridiculous said marie as she plunged languidly into the depths of a voluminous and pillowy lounge and drew towards her an elegant cutglass vinaigrette  you see she continued in a faint and ladylike voice like the last dying breath of an arabian jessamine or something equally ethereal you see cousin ophelia i dont often speak of myself it isnt my habit t isnt agreeable to me in fact i havent strength to do it but there are points where st clare and i differ st clare never understood me never appreciated me i think it lies at the root of all my ill health st clare means well i am bound to believe but men are constitutionally selfish and inconsiderate to woman that at least is my impression  miss ophelia who had not a small share of the genuine new england caution and a very particular horror of being drawn into family difficulties now began to foresee something of this kind impending so composing her face into a grim neutrality and drawing out of her pocket about a yard and a quarter of stocking which she kept as a specific against what dr watts asserts to be a personal habit of satan when people have idle hands she proceeded to knit most energetically shutting her lips together in a way that said as plain as words could you neednt try to make me speak i dont want anything to do with your affairsin fact she looked about as sympathizing as a stone lion but marie didnt care for that she had got somebody to talk to and she felt it her duty to talk and that was enough and reinforcing herself by smelling again at her vinaigrette she went on  you see i brought my own property and servants into the connection when i married st clare and i am legally entitled to manage them my own way st clare had his fortune and his servants and im well enough content he should manage them his way but st clare will be interfering he has wild extravagant notions about things particularly about the treatment of servants he really does act as if he set his servants before me and before himself too for he lets them make him all sorts of trouble and never lifts a finger now about some things st clare is really frightfulhe frightens megoodnatured as he looks in general now he has set down his foot that come what will there shall not be a blow struck in this house except what he or i strike and he does it in a way that i really dare not cross him well you may see what that leads to for st clare wouldnt raise his hand if every one of them walked over him and iyou see how cruel it would be to require me to make the exertion now you know these servants are nothing but grownup children  i dont know anything about it and i thank the lord that i dont said miss ophelia shortly  well but you will have to know something and know it to your cost if you stay here you dont know what a provoking stupid careless unreasonable childish ungrateful set of wretches they are  marie seemed wonderfully supported always when she got upon this topic and she now opened her eyes and seemed quite to forget her languor  you dont know and you cant the daily hourly trials that beset a housekeeper from them everywhere and every way but its no use to complain to st clare he talks the strangest stuff he says we have made them what they are and ought to bear with them he says their faults are all owing to us and that it would be cruel to make the fault and punish it too he says we shouldnt do any better in their place just as if one could reason from them to us you know  dont you believe that the lord made them of one blood with us said miss ophelia shortly  no indeed not i a pretty story truly they are a degraded race  dont you think theyve got immortal souls said miss ophelia with increasing indignation  o well said marie yawning that of coursenobody doubts that but as to putting them on any sort of equality with us you know as if we could be compared why its impossible now st clare really has talked to me as if keeping mammy from her husband was like keeping me from mine theres no comparing in this way mammy couldnt have the feelings that i should its a different thing altogetherof course it isand yet st clare pretends not to see it and just as if mammy could love her little dirty babies as i love eva yet st clare once really and soberly tried to persuade me that it was my duty with my weak health and all i suffer to let mammy go back and take somebody else in her place that was a little too much even for me to bear i dont often show my feelings i make it a principle to endure everything in silence its a wifes hard lot and i bear it but i did break out that time so that he has never alluded to the subject since but i know by his looks and little things that he says that he thinks so as much as ever and its so trying so provoking  miss ophelia looked very much as if she was afraid she should say something but she rattled away with her needles in a way that had volumes of meaning in it if marie could only have understood it  so you just see she continued what youve got to manage a household without any rule where servants have it all their own way do what they please and have what they please except so far as i with my feeble health have kept up government i keep my cowhide about and sometimes i do lay it on but the exertion is always too much for me if st clare would only have this thing done as others do  and hows that  why send them to the calaboose or some of the other places to be flogged thats the only way if i wasnt such a poor feeble piece i believe i should manage with twice the energy that st clare does  and how does st clare contrive to manage said miss ophelia you say he never strikes a blow  well men have a more commanding way you know it is easier for them besides if you ever looked full in his eye its peculiarthat eyeand if he speaks decidedly theres a kind of flash im afraid of it myself and the servants know they must mind i couldnt do as much by a regular storm and scolding as st clare can by one turn of his eye if once he is in earnest o theres no trouble about st clare thats the reason hes no more feeling for me but youll find when you come to manage that theres no getting along without severitythey are so bad so deceitful so lazy  the old tune said st clare sauntering in what an awful account these wicked creatures will have to settle at last especially for being lazy you see cousin said he as he stretched himself at full length on a lounge opposite to marie its wholly inexcusable in them in the light of the example that marie and i set themthis laziness  come now st clare you are too bad said marie  am i now why i thought i was talking good quite remarkably for me i try to enforce your remarks marie always  you know you meant no such thing st clare said marie  o i must have been mistaken then thank you my dear for setting me right  you do really try to be provoking said marie  o come marie the day is growing warm and i have just had a long quarrel with dolph which has fatigued me excessively so pray be agreeable now and let a fellow repose in the light of your smile  whats the matter about dolph said marie that fellows impudence has been growing to a point that is perfectly intolerable to me i only wish i had the undisputed management of him a while id bring him down  what you say my dear is marked with your usual acuteness and good sense said st clare as to dolph the case is this that he has so long been engaged in imitating my graces and perfections that he has at last really mistaken himself for his master and i have been obliged to give him a little insight into his mistake  how said marie  why i was obliged to let him understand explicitly that i preferred to keep some of my clothes for my own personal wearing also i put his magnificence upon an allowance of colognewater and actually was so cruel as to restrict him to one dozen of my cambric handkerchiefs dolph was particularly huffy about it and i had to talk to him like a father to bring him round  o st clare when will you learn how to treat your servants its abominable the way you indulge them said marie  why after all whats the harm of the poor dogs wanting to be like his master and if i havent brought him up any better than to find his chief good in cologne and cambric handkerchiefs why shouldnt i give them to him  and why havent you brought him up better said miss ophelia with blunt determination  too much troublelaziness cousin lazinesswhich ruins more souls than you can shake a stick at if it werent for laziness i should have been a perfect angel myself im inclined to think that laziness is what your old dr botherem up in vermont used to call the essence of moral evil its an awful consideration certainly  i think you slaveholders have an awful responsibility upon you said miss ophelia i wouldnt have it for a thousand worlds you ought to educate your slaves and treat them like reasonable creatureslike immortal creatures that youve got to stand before the bar of god with thats my mind said the good lady breaking suddenly out with a tide of zeal that had been gaining strength in her mind all the morning  o come come said st clare getting up quickly what do you know about us and he sat down to the piano and rattled a lively piece of music st clare had a decided genius for music his touch was brilliant and firm and his fingers flew over the keys with a rapid and birdlike motion airy and yet decided he played piece after piece like a man who is trying to play himself into a good humor after pushing the music aside he rose up and said gayly well now cousin youve given us a good talk and done your duty on the whole i think the better of you for it i make no manner of doubt that you threw a very diamond of truth at me though you see it hit me so directly in the face that it wasnt exactly appreciated at first  for my part i dont see any use in such sort of talk said marie im sure if anybody does more for servants than we do id like to know who and it dont do em a bit goodnot a particlethey get worse and worse as to talking to them or anything like that im sure i have talked till i was tired and hoarse telling them their duty and all that and im sure they can go to church when they like though they dont understand a word of the sermon more than so many pigsso it isnt of any great use for them to go as i see but they do go and so they have every chance but as i said before they are a degraded race and always will be and there isnt any help for them you cant make anything of them if you try you see cousin ophelia ive tried and you havent i was born and bred among them and i know  miss ophelia thought she had said enough and therefore sat silent st clare whistled a tune  st clare i wish you wouldnt whistle said marie it makes my head worse  i wont said st clare is there anything else you wouldnt wish me to do  i wish you would have some kind of sympathy for my trials you never have any feeling for me  my dear accusing angel said st clare  its provoking to be talked to in that way  then how will you be talked to ill talk to orderany way youll mentiononly to give satisfaction  a gay laugh from the court rang through the silken curtains of the verandah st clare stepped out and lifting up the curtain laughed too  what is it said miss ophelia coming to the railing  there sat tom on a little mossy seat in the court every one of his buttonholes stuck full of cape jessamines and eva gayly laughing was hanging a wreath of roses round his neck and then she sat down on his knee like a chipsparrow still laughing  o tom you look so funny  tom had a sober benevolent smile and seemed in his quiet way to be enjoying the fun quite as much as his little mistress he lifted his eyes when he saw his master with a halfdeprecating apologetic air  how can you let her said miss ophelia  why not said st clare  why i dont know it seems so dreadful  you would think no harm in a childs caressing a large dog even if he was black but a creature that can think and reason and feel and is immortal you shudder at confess it cousin i know the feeling among some of you northerners well enough not that there is a particle of virtue in our not having it but custom with us does what christianity ought to doobliterates the feeling of personal prejudice i have often noticed in my travels north how much stronger this was with you than with us you loathe them as you would a snake or a toad yet you are indignant at their wrongs you would not have them abused but you dont want to have anything to do with them yourselves you would send them to africa out of your sight and smell and then send a missionary or two to do up all the selfdenial of elevating them compendiously isnt that it  well cousin said miss ophelia thoughtfully there may be some truth in this  what would the poor and lowly do without children said st clare leaning on the railing and watching eva as she tripped off leading tom with her your little child is your only true democrat tom now is a hero to eva his stories are wonders in her eyes his songs and methodist hymns are better than an opera and the traps and little bits of trash in his pocket a mine of jewels and he the most wonderful tom that ever wore a black skin this is one of the roses of eden that the lord has dropped down expressly for the poor and lowly who get few enough of any other kind  its strange cousin said miss ophelia one might almost think you were a professor to hear you talk  a professor said st clare  yes a professor of religion  not at all not a professor as your townfolks have it and what is worse im afraid not a practiser either  what makes you talk so then  nothing is easier than talking said st clare i believe shakespeare makes somebody say i could sooner show twenty what were good to be done than be one of the twenty to follow my own showing nothing like division of labor my forte lies in talking and yours cousin lies in doing        the merchant of venice act 1 scene 2 lines 1718   in toms external situation at this time there was as the world says nothing to complain of little evas fancy for himthe instinctive gratitude and loveliness of a noble naturehad led her to petition her father that he might be her especial attendant whenever she needed the escort of a servant in her walks or rides and tom had general orders to let everything else go and attend to miss eva whenever she wanted himorders which our readers may fancy were far from disagreeable to him he was kept well dressed for st clare was fastidiously particular on this point his stable services were merely a sinecure and consisted simply in a daily care and inspection and directing an underservant in his duties for marie st clare declared that she could not have any smell of the horses about him when he came near her and that he must positively not be put to any service that would make him unpleasant to her as her nervous system was entirely inadequate to any trial of that nature one snuff of anything disagreeable being according to her account quite sufficient to close the scene and put an end to all her earthly trials at once tom therefore in his wellbrushed broadcloth suit smooth beaver glossy boots faultless wristbands and collar with his grave goodnatured black face looked respectable enough to be a bishop of carthage as men of his color were in other ages  then too he was in a beautiful place a consideration to which his sensitive race was never indifferent and he did enjoy with a quiet joy the birds the flowers the fountains the perfume and light and beauty of the court the silken hangings and pictures and lustres and statuettes and gilding that made the parlors within a kind of aladdins palace to him  if ever africa shall show an elevated and cultivated raceand come it must some time her turn to figure in the great drama of human improvementlife will awake there with a gorgeousness and splendor of which our cold western tribes faintly have conceived in that faroff mystic land of gold and gems and spices and waving palms and wondrous flowers and miraculous fertility will awake new forms of art new styles of splendor and the negro race no longer despised and trodden down will perhaps show forth some of the latest and most magnificent revelations of human life certainly they will in their gentleness their lowly docility of heart their aptitude to repose on a superior mind and rest on a higher power their childlike simplicity of affection and facility of forgiveness in all these they will exhibit the highest form of the peculiarly christian life and perhaps as god chasteneth whom he loveth he hath chosen poor africa in the furnace of affliction to make her the highest and noblest in that kingdom which he will set up when every other kingdom has been tried and failed for the first shall be last and the last first  was this what marie st clare was thinking of as she stood gorgeously dressed on the verandah on sunday morning clasping a diamond bracelet on her slender wrist most likely it was or if it wasnt that it was something else for marie patronized good things and she was going now in full forcediamonds silk and lace and jewels and allto a fashionable church to be very religious marie always made a point to be very pious on sundays there she stood so slender so elegant so airy and undulating in all her motions her lace scarf enveloping her like a mist she looked a graceful creature and she felt very good and very elegant indeed miss ophelia stood at her side a perfect contrast it was not that she had not as handsome a silk dress and shawl and as fine a pockethandkerchief but stiffness and squareness and boltuprightness enveloped her with as indefinite yet appreciable a presence as did grace her elegant neighbor not the grace of god howeverthat is quite another thing  wheres eva said marie  the child stopped on the stairs to say something to mammy  and what was eva saying to mammy on the stairs listen reader and you will hear though marie does not  dear mammy i know your head is aching dreadfully  lord bless you miss eva my head allers aches lately you dont need to worry  well im glad youre going out and hereand the little girl threw her arms around hermammy you shall take my vinaigrette  what your beautiful gold thing thar with them diamonds lor miss t wouldnt be proper no ways  why not you need it and i dont mamma always uses it for headache and itll make you feel better no you shall take it to please me now  do hear the darlin talk said mammy as eva thrust it into her bosom and kissing her ran down stairs to her mother  what were you stopping for  i was just stopping to give mammy my vinaigrette to take to church with her  eva said marie stamping impatientlyyour gold vinaigrette to mammy when will you learn whats proper go right and take it back this moment  eva looked downcast and aggrieved and turned slowly  i say marie let the child alone she shall do as she pleases said st clare  st clare how will she ever get along in the world said marie  the lord knows said st clare but shell get along in heaven better than you or i  o papa dont said eva softly touching his elbow it troubles mother  well cousin are you ready to go to meeting said miss ophelia turning square about on st clare  im not going thank you  i do wish st clare ever would go to church said marie but he hasnt a particle of religion about him it really isnt respectable  i know it said st clare you ladies go to church to learn how to get along in the world i suppose and your piety sheds respectability on us if i did go at all i would go where mammy goes theres something to keep a fellow awake there at least  what those shouting methodists horrible said marie  anything but the dead sea of your respectable churches marie positively its too much to ask of a man eva do you like to go come stay at home and play with me  thank you papa but id rather go to church  isnt it dreadful tiresome said st clare  i think it is tiresome some said eva and i am sleepy too but i try to keep awake  what do you go for then  why you know papa she said in a whisper cousin told me that god wants to have us and he gives us everything you know and it isnt much to do it if he wants us to it isnt so very tiresome after all  you sweet little obliging soul said st clare kissing her go along thats a good girl and pray for me  certainly i always do said the child as she sprang after her mother into the carriage  st clare stood on the steps and kissed his hand to her as the carriage drove away large tears were in his eyes  o evangeline rightly named he said hath not god made thee an evangel to me  so he felt a moment and then he smoked a cigar and read the picayune and forgot his little gospel was he much unlike other folks  you see evangeline said her mother its always right and proper to be kind to servants but it isnt proper to treat them just as we would our relations or people in our own class of life now if mammy was sick you wouldnt want to put her in your own bed  i should feel just like it mamma said eva because then it would be handier to take care of her and because you know my bed is better than hers  marie was in utter despair at the entire want of moral perception evinced in this reply  what can i do to make this child understand me she said  nothing said miss ophelia significantly  eva looked sorry and disconcerted for a moment but children luckily do not keep to one impression long and in a few moments she was merrily laughing at various things which she saw from the coachwindows as it rattled along    well ladies said st clare as they were comfortably seated at the dinnertable and what was the bill of fare at church today  o dr g preached a splendid sermon said marie it was just such a sermon as you ought to hear it expressed all my views exactly  it must have been very improving said st clare the subject must have been an extensive one  well i mean all my views about society and such things said marie the text was he hath made everything beautiful in its season and he showed how all the orders and distinctions in society came from god and that it was so appropriate you know and beautiful that some should be high and some low and that some were born to rule and some to serve and all that you know and he applied it so well to all this ridiculous fuss that is made about slavery and he proved distinctly that the bible was on our side and supported all our institutions so convincingly i only wish youd heard him  o i didnt need it said st clare i can learn what does me as much good as that from the picayune any time and smoke a cigar besides which i cant do you know in a church  why said miss ophelia dont you believe in these views  whoi you know im such a graceless dog that these religious aspects of such subjects dont edify me much if i was to say anything on this slavery matter i would say out fair and square were in for it weve got em and mean to keep emits for our convenience and our interest for thats the long and short of itthats just the whole of what all this sanctified stuff amounts to after all and i think that it will be intelligible to everybody everywhere  i do think augustine you are so irreverent said marie i think its shocking to hear you talk  shocking its the truth this religious talk on such matterswhy dont they carry it a little further and show the beauty in its season of a fellows taking a glass too much and sitting a little too late over his cards and various providential arrangements of that sort which are pretty frequent among us young menwed like to hear that those are right and godly too  well said miss ophelia do you think slavery right or wrong  im not going to have any of your horrid new england directness cousin said st clare gayly if i answer that question i know youll be at me with half a dozen others each one harder than the last and im not a going to define my position i am one of the sort that lives by throwing stones at other peoples glass houses but i never mean to put up one for them to stone  thats just the way hes always talking said marie you cant get any satisfaction out of him i believe its just because he dont like religion that hes always running out in this way hes been doing  religion said st clare in a tone that made both ladies look at him religion is what you hear at church religion is that which can bend and turn and descend and ascend to fit every crooked phase of selfish worldly society religion is that religion which is less scrupulous less generous less just less considerate for man than even my own ungodly worldly blinded nature no when i look for a religion i must look for something above me and not something beneath  then you dont believe that the bible justifies slavery said miss ophelia  the bible was my mothers book said st clare by it she lived and died and i would be very sorry to think it did id as soon desire to have it proved that my mother could drink brandy chew tobacco and swear by way of satisfying me that i did right in doing the same it wouldnt make me at all more satisfied with these things in myself and it would take from me the comfort of respecting her and it really is a comfort in this world to have anything one can respect in short you see said he suddenly resuming his gay tone all i want is that different things be kept in different boxes the whole framework of society both in europe and america is made up of various things which will not stand the scrutiny of any very ideal standard of morality its pretty generally understood that men dont aspire after the absolute right but only to do about as well as the rest of the world now when any one speaks up like a man and says slavery is necessary to us we cant get along without it we should be beggared if we give it up and of course we mean to hold on to itthis is strong clear welldefined language it has the respectability of truth to it and if we may judge by their practice the majority of the world will bear us out in it but when he begins to put on a long face and snuffle and quote scripture i incline to think he isnt much better than he should be  you are very uncharitable said marie  well said st clare suppose that something should bring down the price of cotton once and forever and make the whole slave property a drug in the market dont you think we should soon have another version of the scripture doctrine what a flood of light would pour into the church all at once and how immediately it would be discovered that everything in the bible and reason went the other way  well at any rate said marie as she reclined herself on a lounge im thankful im born where slavery exists and i believe its rightindeed i feel it must be and at any rate im sure i couldnt get along without it  i say what do you think pussy said her father to eva who came in at this moment with a flower in her hand  what about papa  why which do you like the bestto live as they do at your uncles up in vermont or to have a housefull of servants as we do  o of course our way is the pleasantest said eva  why so said st clare stroking her head  why it makes so many more round you to love you know said eva looking up earnestly  now thats just like eva said marie just one of her odd speeches  is it an odd speech papa said eva whisperingly as she got upon his knee  rather as this world goes pussy said st clare but where has my little eva been all dinnertime  o ive been up in toms room hearing him sing and aunt dinah gave me my dinner  hearing tom sing hey  o yes he sings such beautiful things about the new jerusalem and bright angels and the land of canaan  i dare say its better than the opera isnt it  yes and hes going to teach them to me  singing lessons heyyou are coming on  yes he sings for me and i read to him in my bible and he explains what it means you know  on my word said marie laughing that is the latest joke of the season  tom isnt a bad hand now at explaining scripture ill dare swear said st clare tom has a natural genius for religion i wanted the horses out early this morning and i stole up to toms cubiculum there over the stables and there i heard him holding a meeting by himself and in fact i havent heard anything quite so savory as toms prayer this some time he put in for me with a zeal that was quite apostolic  perhaps he guessed you were listening ive heard of that trick before  if he did he wasnt very polite for he gave the lord his opinion of me pretty freely tom seemed to think there was decidedly room for improvement in me and seemed very earnest that i should be converted  i hope youll lay it to heart said miss ophelia  i suppose you are much of the same opinion said st clare well we shall seeshant we eva    chapter xvii  the freemans defence   there was a gentle bustle at the quaker house as the afternoon drew to a close rachel halliday moved quietly to and fro collecting from her household stores such needments as could be arranged in the smallest compass for the wanderers who were to go forth that night the afternoon shadows stretched eastward and the round red sun stood thoughtfully on the horizon and his beams shone yellow and calm into the little bedroom where george and his wife were sitting he was sitting with his child on his knee and his wifes hand in his both looked thoughtful and serious and traces of tears were on their cheeks  yes eliza said george i know all you say is true you are a good childa great deal better than i am and i will try to do as you say ill try to act worthy of a free man ill try to feel like a christian god almighty knows that ive meant to do welltried hard to do wellwhen everything has been against me and now ill forget all the past and put away every hard and bitter feeling and read my bible and learn to be a good man  and when we get to canada said eliza i can help you i can do dressmaking very well and i understand fine washing and ironing and between us we can find something to live on  yes eliza so long as we have each other and our boy o eliza if these people only knew what a blessing it is for a man to feel that his wife and child belong to him ive often wondered to see men that could call their wives and children their own fretting and worrying about anything else why i feel rich and strong though we have nothing but our bare hands i feel as if i could scarcely ask god for any more yes though ive worked hard every day till i am twentyfive years old and have not a cent of money nor a roof to cover me nor a spot of land to call my own yet if they will only let me alone now i will be satisfiedthankful i will work and send back the money for you and my boy as to my old master he has been paid five times over for all he ever spent for me i dont owe him anything  but yet we are not quite out of danger said eliza we are not yet in canada  true said george but it seems as if i smelt the free air and it makes me strong  at this moment voices were heard in the outer apartment in earnest conversation and very soon a rap was heard on the door eliza started and opened it  simeon halliday was there and with him a quaker brother whom he introduced as phineas fletcher phineas was tall and lathy redhaired with an expression of great acuteness and shrewdness in his face he had not the placid quiet unworldly air of simeon halliday on the contrary a particularly wideawake and au fait appearance like a man who rather prides himself on knowing what he is about and keeping a bright lookout ahead peculiarities which sorted rather oddly with his broad brim and formal phraseology  our friend phineas hath discovered something of importance to the interests of thee and thy party george said simeon it were well for thee to hear it  that i have said phineas and it shows the use of a mans always sleeping with one ear open in certain places as ive always said last night i stopped at a little lone tavern back on the road thee remembers the place simeon where we sold some apples last year to that fat woman with the great earrings well i was tired with hard driving and after my supper i stretched myself down on a pile of bags in the corner and pulled a buffalo over me to wait till my bed was ready and what does i do but get fast asleep  with one ear open phineas said simeon quietly  no i slept ears and all for an hour or two for i was pretty well tired but when i came to myself a little i found that there were some men in the room sitting round a table drinking and talking and i thought before i made much muster id just see what they were up to especially as i heard them say something about the quakers so says one they are up in the quaker settlement no doubt says he then i listened with both ears and i found that they were talking about this very party so i lay and heard them lay off all their plans this young man they said was to be sent back to kentucky to his master who was going to make an example of him to keep all niggers from running away and his wife two of them were going to run down to new orleans to sell on their own account and they calculated to get sixteen or eighteen hundred dollars for her and the child they said was going to a trader who had bought him and then there was the boy jim and his mother they were to go back to their masters in kentucky they said that there were two constables in a town a little piece ahead who would go in with em to get em taken up and the young woman was to be taken before a judge and one of the fellows who is small and smoothspoken was to swear to her for his property and get her delivered over to him to take south theyve got a right notion of the track we are going tonight and theyll be down after us six or eight strong so now whats to be done  the group that stood in various attitudes after this communication were worthy of a painter rachel halliday who had taken her hands out of a batch of biscuit to hear the news stood with them upraised and floury and with a face of the deepest concern simeon looked profoundly thoughtful eliza had thrown her arms around her husband and was looking up to him george stood with clenched hands and glowing eyes and looking as any other man might look whose wife was to be sold at auction and son sent to a trader all under the shelter of a christian nations laws  what shall we do george said eliza faintly  i know what i shall do said george as he stepped into the little room and began examining pistols  ay ay said phineas nodding his head to simeon thou seest simeon how it will work  i see said simeon sighing i pray it come not to that  i dont want to involve any one with or for me said george if you will lend me your vehicle and direct me i will drive alone to the next stand jim is a giant in strength and brave as death and despair and so am i  ah well friend said phineas but theell need a driver for all that thees quite welcome to do all the fighting thee knows but i know a thing or two about the road that thee doesnt  but i dont want to involve you said george  involve said phineas with a curious and keen expression of face when thee does involve me please to let me know  phineas is a wise and skilful man said simeon thee does well george to abide by his judgment and he added laying his hand kindly on georges shoulder and pointing to the pistols be not over hasty with theseyoung blood is hot  i will attack no man said george all i ask of this country is to be let alone and i will go out peaceably buthe paused and his brow darkened and his face workedive had a sister sold in that new orleans market i know what they are sold for and am i going to stand by and see them take my wife and sell her when god has given me a pair of strong arms to defend her no god help me ill fight to the last breath before they shall take my wife and son can you blame me  mortal man cannot blame thee george flesh and blood could not do otherwise said simeon woe unto the world because of offences but woe unto them through whom the offence cometh  would not even you sir do the same in my place  i pray that i be not tried said simeon the flesh is weak  i think my flesh would be pretty tolerable strong in such a case said phineas stretching out a pair of arms like the sails of a windmill i ant sure friend george that i shouldnt hold a fellow for thee if thee had any accounts to settle with him  if man should ever resist evil said simeon then george should feel free to do it now but the leaders of our people taught a more excellent way for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of god but it goes sorely against the corrupt will of man and none can receive it save they to whom it is given let us pray the lord that we be not tempted  and so i do said phineas but if we are tempted too muchwhy let them look out thats all  its quite plain thee wasnt born a friend said simeon smiling the old nature hath its way in thee pretty strong as yet  to tell the truth phineas had been a hearty twofisted backwoodsman a vigorous hunter and a dead shot at a buck but having wooed a pretty quakeress had been moved by the power of her charms to join the society in his neighborhood and though he was an honest sober and efficient member and nothing particular could be alleged against him yet the more spiritual among them could not but discern an exceeding lack of savor in his developments  friend phineas will ever have ways of his own said rachel halliday smiling but we all think that his heart is in the right place after all  well said george isnt it best that we hasten our flight  i got up at four oclock and came on with all speed full two or three hours ahead of them if they start at the time they planned it isnt safe to start till dark at any rate for there are some evil persons in the villages ahead that might be disposed to meddle with us if they saw our wagon and that would delay us more than the waiting but in two hours i think we may venture i will go over to michael cross and engage him to come behind on his swift nag and keep a bright lookout on the road and warn us if any company of men come on michael keeps a horse that can soon get ahead of most other horses and he could shoot ahead and let us know if there were any danger i am going out now to warn jim and the old woman to be in readiness and to see about the horse we have a pretty fair start and stand a good chance to get to the stand before they can come up with us so have good courage friend george this isnt the first ugly scrape that ive been in with thy people said phineas as he closed the door  phineas is pretty shrewd said simeon he will do the best that can be done for thee george  all i am sorry for said george is the risk to you  theell much oblige us friend george to say no more about that what we do we are conscience bound to do we can do no other way and now mother said he turning to rachel hurry thy preparations for these friends for we must not send them away fasting  and while rachel and her children were busy making corncake and cooking ham and chicken and hurrying on the et ceteras of the evening meal george and his wife sat in their little room with their arms folded about each other in such talk as husband and wife have when they know that a few hours may part them forever  eliza said george people that have friends and houses and lands and money and all those things cant love as we do who have nothing but each other till i knew you eliza no creature had loved me but my poor heartbroken mother and sister i saw poor emily that morning the trader carried her off she came to the corner where i was lying asleep and said poor george your last friend is going what will become of you poor boy and i got up and threw my arms round her and cried and sobbed and she cried too and those were the last kind words i got for ten long years and my heart all withered up and felt as dry as ashes till i met you and your loving mewhy it was almost like raising one from the dead ive been a new man ever since and now eliza ill give my last drop of blood but they shall not take you from me whoever gets you must walk over my dead body  o lord have mercy said eliza sobbing if he will only let us get out of this country together that is all we ask  is god on their side said george speaking less to his wife than pouring out his own bitter thoughts does he see all they do why does he let such things happen and they tell us that the bible is on their side certainly all the power is they are rich and healthy and happy they are members of churches expecting to go to heaven and they get along so easy in the world and have it all their own way and poor honest faithful christianschristians as good or better than theyare lying in the very dust under their feet they buy em and sell em and make trade of their hearts blood and groans and tearsand god lets them  friend george said simeon from the kitchen listen to this psalm it may do thee good  george drew his seat near the door and eliza wiping her tears came forward also to listen while simeon read as follows  but as for me my feet were almost gone my steps had wellnigh slipped for i was envious of the foolish when i saw the prosperity of the wicked they are not in trouble like other men neither are they plagued like other men therefore pride compasseth them as a chain violence covereth them as a garment their eyes stand out with fatness they have more than heart could wish they are corrupt and speak wickedly concerning oppression they speak loftily therefore his people return and the waters of a full cup are wrung out to them and they say how doth god know and is there knowledge in the most high  is not that the way thee feels george  it is so indeed said georgeas well as i could have written it myself  then hear said simeon when i thought to know this it was too painful for me until i went unto the sanctuary of god then understood i their end surely thou didst set them in slippery places thou castedst them down to destruction as a dream when one awaketh so oh lord when thou awakest thou shalt despise their image nevertheless i am continually with thee thou hast holden me by my right hand thou shalt guide me by thy counsel and afterwards receive me to glory it is good for me to draw near unto god i have put my trust in the lord god        ps 73 the end of the wicked contrasted with that of the      righteous  the words of holy trust breathed by the friendly old man stole like sacred music over the harassed and chafed spirit of george and after he ceased he sat with a gentle and subdued expression on his fine features  if this world were all george said simeon thee might indeed ask where is the lord but it is often those who have least of all in this life whom he chooseth for the kingdom put thy trust in him and no matter what befalls thee here he will make all right hereafter  if these words had been spoken by some easy selfindulgent exhorter from whose mouth they might have come merely as pious and rhetorical flourish proper to be used to people in distress perhaps they might not have had much effect but coming from one who daily and calmly risked fine and imprisonment for the cause of god and man they had a weight that could not but be felt and both the poor desolate fugitives found calmness and strength breathing into them from it  and now rachel took elizas hand kindly and led the way to the suppertable as they were sitting down a light tap sounded at the door and ruth entered  i just ran in she said with these little stockings for the boythree pair nice warm woollen ones it will be so cold thee knows in canada does thee keep up good courage eliza she added tripping round to elizas side of the table and shaking her warmly by the hand and slipping a seedcake into harrys hand i brought a little parcel of these for him she said tugging at her pocket to get out the package children thee knows will always be eating  o thank you you are too kind said eliza  come ruth sit down to supper said rachel  i couldnt any way i left john with the baby and some biscuits in the oven and i cant stay a moment else john will burn up all the biscuits and give the baby all the sugar in the bowl thats the way he does said the little quakeress laughing so goodby eliza goodby george the lord grant thee a safe journey and with a few tripping steps ruth was out of the apartment  a little while after supper a large coveredwagon drew up before the door the night was clear starlight and phineas jumped briskly down from his seat to arrange his passengers george walked out of the door with his child on one arm and his wife on the other his step was firm his face settled and resolute rachel and simeon came out after them  you get out a moment said phineas to those inside and let me fix the back of the wagon there for the womenfolks and the boy  here are the two buffaloes said rachel make the seats as comfortable as may be its hard riding all night  jim came out first and carefully assisted out his old mother who clung to his arm and looked anxiously about as if she expected the pursuer every moment  jim are your pistols all in order said george in a low firm voice  yes indeed said jim  and youve no doubt what you shall do if they come  i rather think i havent said jim throwing open his broad chest and taking a deep breath do you think ill let them get mother again  during this brief colloquy eliza had been taking her leave of her kind friend rachel and was handed into the carriage by simeon and creeping into the back part with her boy sat down among the buffaloskins the old woman was next handed in and seated and george and jim placed on a rough board seat front of them and phineas mounted in front  farewell my friends said simeon from without  god bless you answered all from within  and the wagon drove off rattling and jolting over the frozen road  there was no opportunity for conversation on account of the roughness of the way and the noise of the wheels the vehicle therefore rumbled on through long dark stretches of woodlandover wide dreary plainsup hills and down valleysand on on on they jogged hour after hour the child soon fell asleep and lay heavily in his mothers lap the poor frightened old woman at last forgot her fears and even eliza as the night waned found all her anxieties insufficient to keep her eyes from closing phineas seemed on the whole the briskest of the company and beguiled his long drive with whistling certain very unquakerlike songs as he went on  but about three oclock georges ear caught the hasty and decided click of a horses hoof coming behind them at some distance and jogged phineas by the elbow phineas pulled up his horses and listened  that must be michael he said i think i know the sound of his gallop and he rose up and stretched his head anxiously back over the road  a man riding in hot haste was now dimly descried at the top of a distant hill  there he is i do believe said phineas george and jim both sprang out of the wagon before they knew what they were doing all stood intensely silent with their faces turned towards the expected messenger on he came now he went down into a valley where they could not see him but they heard the sharp hasty tramp rising nearer and nearer at last they saw him emerge on the top of an eminence within hail  yes thats michael said phineas and raising his voice halloa there michael  phineas is that thee  yes what newsthey coming  right on behind eight or ten of them hot with brandy swearing and foaming like so many wolves  and just as he spoke a breeze brought the faint sound of galloping horsemen towards them  in with youquick boys in said phineas if you must fight wait till i get you a piece ahead and with the word both jumped in and phineas lashed the horses to a run the horseman keeping close beside them the wagon rattled jumped almost flew over the frozen ground but plainer and still plainer came the noise of pursuing horsemen behind the women heard it and looking anxiously out saw far in the rear on the brow of a distant hill a party of men looming up against the redstreaked sky of early dawn another hill and their pursuers had evidently caught sight of their wagon whose white clothcovered top made it conspicuous at some distance and a loud yell of brutal triumph came forward on the wind eliza sickened and strained her child closer to her bosom the old woman prayed and groaned and george and jim clenched their pistols with the grasp of despair the pursuers gained on them fast the carriage made a sudden turn and brought them near a ledge of a steep overhanging rock that rose in an isolated ridge or clump in a large lot which was all around it quite clear and smooth this isolated pile or range of rocks rose up black and heavy against the brightening sky and seemed to promise shelter and concealment it was a place well known to phineas who had been familiar with the spot in his hunting days and it was to gain this point he had been racing his horses  now for it said he suddenly checking his horses and springing from his seat to the ground out with you in a twinkling every one and up into these rocks with me michael thee tie thy horse to the wagon and drive ahead to amariahs and get him and his boys to come back and talk to these fellows  in a twinkling they were all out of the carriage  there said phineas catching up harry you each of you see to the women and run now if you ever did run  they needed no exhortation quicker than we can say it the whole party were over the fence making with all speed for the rocks while michael throwing himself from his horse and fastening the bridle to the wagon began driving it rapidly away  come ahead said phineas as they reached the rocks and saw in the mingled starlight and dawn the traces of a rude but plainly marked footpath leading up among them this is one of our old huntingdens come up  phineas went before springing up the rocks like a goat with the boy in his arms jim came second bearing his trembling old mother over his shoulder and george and eliza brought up the rear the party of horsemen came up to the fence and with mingled shouts and oaths were dismounting to prepare to follow them a few moments scrambling brought them to the top of the ledge the path then passed between a narrow defile where only one could walk at a time till suddenly they came to a rift or chasm more than a yard in breadth and beyond which lay a pile of rocks separate from the rest of the ledge standing full thirty feet high with its sides steep and perpendicular as those of a castle phineas easily leaped the chasm and sat down the boy on a smooth flat platform of crisp white moss that covered the top of the rock  over with you he called spring now once for your lives said he as one after another sprang across several fragments of loose stone formed a kind of breastwork which sheltered their position from the observation of those below  well here we all are said phineas peeping over the stone breastwork to watch the assailants who were coming tumultuously up under the rocks let em get us if they can whoever comes here has to walk single file between those two rocks in fair range of your pistols boys dye see  i do see said george and now as this matter is ours let us take all the risk and do all the fighting  thees quite welcome to do the fighting george said phineas chewing some checkerberryleaves as he spoke but i may have the fun of looking on i suppose but see these fellows are kinder debating down there and looking up like hens when they are going to fly up on to the roost hadnt thee better give em a word of advice before they come up just to tell em handsomely theyll be shot if they do  the party beneath now more apparent in the light of the dawn consisted of our old acquaintances tom loker and marks with two constables and a posse consisting of such rowdies at the last tavern as could be engaged by a little brandy to go and help the fun of trapping a set of niggers  well tom yer coons are farly treed said one  yes i see em go up right here said tom and heres a path im for going right up they cant jump down in a hurry and it wont take long to ferret em out  but tom they might fire at us from behind the rocks said marks that would be ugly you know  ugh said tom with a sneer always for saving your skin marks no danger niggers are too plaguy scared  i dont know why i shouldnt save my skin said marks its the best ive got and niggers do fight like the devil sometimes  at this moment george appeared on the top of a rock above them and speaking in a calm clear voice said  gentlemen who are you down there and what do you want  we want a party of runaway niggers said tom loker one george harris and eliza harris and their son and jim selden and an old woman weve got the officers here and a warrant to take em and were going to have em too dye hear ant you george harris that belongs to mr harris of shelby county kentucky  i am george harris a mr harris of kentucky did call me his property but now im a free man standing on gods free soil and my wife and my child i claim as mine jim and his mother are here we have arms to defend ourselves and we mean to do it you can come up if you like but the first one of you that comes within the range of our bullets is a dead man and the next and the next and so on till the last  o come come said a short puffy man stepping forward and blowing his nose as he did so young man this ant no kind of talk at all for you you see were officers of justice weve got the law on our side and the power and so forth so youd better give up peaceably you see for youll certainly have to give up at last  i know very well that youve got the law on your side and the power said george bitterly you mean to take my wife to sell in new orleans and put my boy like a calf in a traders pen and send jims old mother to the brute that whipped and abused her before because he couldnt abuse her son you want to send jim and me back to be whipped and tortured and ground down under the heels of them that you call masters and your laws will bear you out in itmore shame for you and them but you havent got us we dont own your laws we dont own your country we stand here as free under gods sky as you are and by the great god that made us well fight for our liberty till we die  george stood out in fair sight on the top of the rock as he made his declaration of independence the glow of dawn gave a flush to his swarthy cheek and bitter indignation and despair gave fire to his dark eye and as if appealing from man to the justice of god he raised his hand to heaven as he spoke  if it had been only a hungarian youth now bravely defending in some mountain fastness the retreat of fugitives escaping from austria into america this would have been sublime heroism but as it was a youth of african descent defending the retreat of fugitives through america into canada of course we are too well instructed and patriotic to see any heroism in it and if any of our readers do they must do it on their own private responsibility when despairing hungarian fugitives make their way against all the searchwarrants and authorities of their lawful government to america press and political cabinet ring with applause and welcome when despairing african fugitives do the same thingit iswhat is it  be it as it may it is certain that the attitude eye voice manner of the speaker for a moment struck the party below to silence there is something in boldness and determination that for a time hushes even the rudest nature marks was the only one who remained wholly untouched he was deliberately cocking his pistol and in the momentary silence that followed georges speech he fired at him  ye see ye get jist as much for him dead as alive in kentucky he said coolly as he wiped his pistol on his coatsleeve  george sprang backwardeliza uttered a shriekthe ball had passed close to his hair had nearly grazed the cheek of his wife and struck in the tree above  its nothing eliza said george quickly  theed better keep out of sight with thy speechifying said phineas theyre mean scamps  now jim said george look that your pistols are all right and watch that pass with me the first man that shows himself i fire at you take the second and so on it wont do you know to waste two shots on one  but what if you dont hit  i shall hit said george coolly  good now theres stuff in that fellow muttered phineas between his teeth  the party below after marks had fired stood for a moment rather undecided  i think you must have hit some on em said one of the men i heard a squeal  im going right up for one said tom i never was afraid of niggers and i ant going to be now who goes after he said springing up the rocks  george heard the words distinctly he drew up his pistol examined it pointed it towards that point in the defile where the first man would appear  one of the most courageous of the party followed tom and the way being thus made the whole party began pushing up the rockthe hindermost pushing the front ones faster than they would have gone of themselves on they came and in a moment the burly form of tom appeared in sight almost at the verge of the chasm  george firedthe shot entered his sidebut though wounded he would not retreat but with a yell like that of a mad bull he was leaping right across the chasm into the party  friend said phineas suddenly stepping to the front and meeting him with a push from his long arms thee isnt wanted here  down he fell into the chasm crackling down among trees bushes logs loose stones till he lay bruised and groaning thirty feet below the fall might have killed him had it not been broken and moderated by his clothes catching in the branches of a large tree but he came down with some force howevermore than was at all agreeable or convenient  lord help us they are perfect devils said marks heading the retreat down the rocks with much more of a will than he had joined the ascent while all the party came tumbling precipitately after himthe fat constable in particular blowing and puffing in a very energetic manner  i say fellers said marks you jist go round and pick up tom there while i run and get on to my horse to go back for helpthats you and without minding the hootings and jeers of his company marks was as good as his word and was soon seen galloping away  was ever such a sneaking varmint said one of the men to come on his business and he clear out and leave us this yer way  well we must pick up that feller said another cuss me if i much care whether he is dead or alive  the men led by the groans of tom scrambled and crackled through stumps logs and bushes to where that hero lay groaning and swearing with alternate vehemence  ye keep it agoing pretty loud tom said one ye much hurt  dont know get me up cant ye blast that infernal quaker if it hadnt been for him id a pitched some on em down here to see how they liked it  with much labor and groaning the fallen hero was assisted to rise and with one holding him up under each shoulder they got him as far as the horses  if you could only get me a mile back to that ar tavern give me a handkerchief or something to stuff into this place and stop this infernal bleeding  george looked over the rocks and saw them trying to lift the burly form of tom into the saddle after two or three ineffectual attempts he reeled and fell heavily to the ground  o i hope he isnt killed said eliza who with all the party stood watching the proceeding  why not said phineas serves him right  because after death comes the judgment said eliza  yes said the old woman who had been groaning and praying in her methodist fashion during all the encounter its an awful case for the poor critturs soul  on my word theyre leaving him i do believe said phineas  it was true for after some appearance of irresolution and consultation the whole party got on their horses and rode away when they were quite out of sight phineas began to bestir himself  well we must go down and walk a piece he said i told michael to go forward and bring help and be along back here with the wagon but we shall have to walk a piece along the road i reckon to meet them the lord grant he be along soon its early in the day there wont be much travel afoot yet a while we ant much more than two miles from our stoppingplace if the road hadnt been so rough last night we could have outrun em entirely  as the party neared the fence they discovered in the distance along the road their own wagon coming back accompanied by some men on horseback  well now theres michael and stephen and amariah exclaimed phineas joyfully now we are madeas safe as if wed got there  well do stop then said eliza and do something for that poor man hes groaning dreadfully  it would be no more than christian said george lets take him up and carry him on  and doctor him up among the quakers said phineas pretty well that well i dont care if we do here lets have a look at him and phineas who in the course of his hunting and backwoods life had acquired some rude experience of surgery kneeled down by the wounded man and began a careful examination of his condition  marks said tom feebly is that you marks  no i reckon tant friend said phineas much marks cares for thee if his own skins safe hes off long ago  i believe im done for said tom the cussed sneaking dog to leave me to die alone my poor old mother always told me t would be so  la sakes jist hear the poor crittur hes got a mammy now said the old negress i cant help kinder pityin on him  softly softly dont thee snap and snarl friend said phineas as tom winced and pushed his hand away thee has no chance unless i stop the bleeding and phineas busied himself with making some offhand surgical arrangements with his own pockethandkerchief and such as could be mustered in the company  you pushed me down there said tom faintly  well if i hadnt thee would have pushed us down thee sees said phineas as he stooped to apply his bandage there therelet me fix this bandage we mean well to thee we bear no malice thee shall be taken to a house where theyll nurse thee first rate well as thy own mother could  tom groaned and shut his eyes in men of his class vigor and resolution are entirely a physical matter and ooze out with the flowing of the blood and the gigantic fellow really looked piteous in his helplessness  the other party now came up the seats were taken out of the wagon the buffaloskins doubled in fours were spread all along one side and four men with great difficulty lifted the heavy form of tom into it before he was gotten in he fainted entirely the old negress in the abundance of her compassion sat down on the bottom and took his head in her lap eliza george and jim bestowed themselves as well as they could in the remaining space and the whole party set forward  what do you think of him said george who sat by phineas in front  well its only a pretty deep fleshwound but then tumbling and scratching down that place didnt help him much it has bled pretty freelypretty much drained him out courage and allbut hell get over it and may be learn a thing or two by it  im glad to hear you say so said george it would always be a heavy thought to me if id caused his death even in a just cause  yes said phineas killing is an ugly operation any way theyll fix itman or beast ive seen a buck that was shot down and a dying look that way on a feller with his eye that it reely most made a feller feel wicked for killing on him and human creatures is a more serious consideration yet bein as thy wife says that the judgment comes to em after death so i dont know as our peoples notions on these matters is too strict and considerin how i was raised i fell in with them pretty considerably  what shall you do with this poor fellow said george  o carry him along to amariahs theres old grandmam stephens theredorcas they call hershes most an amazin nurse she takes to nursing real natural and ant never better suited than when she gets a sick body to tend we may reckon on turning him over to her for a fortnight or so  a ride of about an hour more brought the party to a neat farmhouse where the weary travellers were received to an abundant breakfast tom loker was soon carefully deposited in a much cleaner and softer bed than he had ever been in the habit of occupying his wound was carefully dressed and bandaged and he lay languidly opening and shutting his eyes on the white windowcurtains and gentlygliding figures of his sick room like a weary child and here for the present we shall take our leave of one party    chapter xviii  miss ophelias experiences and opinions   our friend tom in his own simple musings often compared his more fortunate lot in the bondage into which he was cast with that of joseph in egypt and in fact as time went on and he developed more and more under the eye of his master the strength of the parallel increased  st clare was indolent and careless of money hitherto the providing and marketing had been principally done by adolph who was to the full as careless and extravagant as his master and between them both they had carried on the dispersing process with great alacrity accustomed for many years to regard his masters property as his own care tom saw with an uneasiness he could scarcely repress the wasteful expenditure of the establishment and in the quiet indirect way which his class often acquire would sometimes make his own suggestions  st clare at first employed him occasionally but struck with his soundness of mind and good business capacity he confided in him more and more till gradually all the marketing and providing for the family were intrusted to him  no no adolph he said one day as adolph was deprecating the passing of power out of his hands let tom alone you only understand what you want tom understands cost and come to and there may be some end to money bye and bye if we dont let somebody do that  trusted to an unlimited extent by a careless master who handed him a bill without looking at it and pocketed the change without counting it tom had every facility and temptation to dishonesty and nothing but an impregnable simplicity of nature strengthened by christian faith could have kept him from it but to that nature the very unbounded trust reposed in him was bond and seal for the most scrupulous accuracy  with adolph the case had been different thoughtless and selfindulgent and unrestrained by a master who found it easier to indulge than to regulate he had fallen into an absolute confusion as to meum tuum with regard to himself and his master which sometimes troubled even st clare his own good sense taught him that such a training of his servants was unjust and dangerous a sort of chronic remorse went with him everywhere although not strong enough to make any decided change in his course and this very remorse reacted again into indulgence he passed lightly over the most serious faults because he told himself that if he had done his part his dependents had not fallen into them  tom regarded his gay airy handsome young master with an odd mixture of fealty reverence and fatherly solicitude that he never read the bible never went to church that he jested and made free with any and every thing that came in the way of his wit that he spent his sunday evenings at the opera or theatre that he went to wine parties and clubs and suppers oftener than was at all expedientwere all things that tom could see as plainly as anybody and on which he based a conviction that masr wasnt a christiana conviction however which he would have been very slow to express to any one else but on which he founded many prayers in his own simple fashion when he was by himself in his little dormitory not that tom had not his own way of speaking his mind occasionally with something of the tact often observable in his class as for example the very day after the sabbath we have described st clare was invited out to a convivial party of choice spirits and was helped home between one and two oclock at night in a condition when the physical had decidedly attained the upper hand of the intellectual tom and adolph assisted to get him composed for the night the latter in high spirits evidently regarding the matter as a good joke and laughing heartily at the rusticity of toms horror who really was simple enough to lie awake most of the rest of the night praying for his young master  well tom what are you waiting for said st clare the next day as he sat in his library in dressinggown and slippers st clare had just been entrusting tom with some money and various commissions isnt all right there tom he added as tom still stood waiting  im fraid not masr said tom with a grave face  st clare laid down his paper and set down his coffeecup and looked at tom  why tom whats the case you look as solemn as a coffin  i feel very bad masr i allays have thought that masr would be good to everybody  well tom havent i been come now what do you want theres something you havent got i suppose and this is the preface  masr allays been good to me i havent nothing to complain of on that head but there is one that masr isnt good to  why tom whats got into you speak out what do you mean  last night between one and two i thought so i studied upon the matter then masr isnt good to himself  tom said this with his back to his master and his hand on the doorknob st clare felt his face flush crimson but he laughed  o thats all is it he said gayly  all said tom turning suddenly round and falling on his knees o my dear young masr im fraid it will be loss of allallbody and soul the good book says it biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an adder my dear masr  toms voice choked and the tears ran down his cheeks  you poor silly fool said st clare with tears in his own eyes get up tom im not worth crying over  but tom wouldnt rise and looked imploring  well i wont go to any more of their cursed nonsense tom said st clare on my honor i wont i dont know why i havent stopped long ago ive always despised it and myself for itso now tom wipe up your eyes and go about your errands come come he added no blessings im not so wonderfully good now he said as he gently pushed tom to the door there ill pledge my honor to you tom you dont see me so again he said and tom went off wiping his eyes with great satisfaction  ill keep my faith with him too said st clare as he closed the door  and st clare did sofor gross sensualism in any form was not the peculiar temptation of his nature  but all this time who shall detail the tribulations manifold of our friend miss ophelia who had begun the labors of a southern housekeeper  there is all the difference in the world in the servants of southern establishments according to the character and capacity of the mistresses who have brought them up  south as well as north there are women who have an extraordinary talent for command and tact in educating such are enabled with apparent ease and without severity to subject to their will and bring into harmonious and systematic order the various members of their small estateto regulate their peculiarities and so balance and compensate the deficiencies of one by the excess of another as to produce a harmonious and orderly system  such a housekeeper was mrs shelby whom we have already described and such our readers may remember to have met with if they are not common at the south it is because they are not common in the world they are to be found there as often as anywhere and when existing find in that peculiar state of society a brilliant opportunity to exhibit their domestic talent  such a housekeeper marie st clare was not nor her mother before her indolent and childish unsystematic and improvident it was not to be expected that servants trained under her care should not be so likewise and she had very justly described to miss ophelia the state of confusion she would find in the family though she had not ascribed it to the proper cause  the first morning of her regency miss ophelia was up at four oclock and having attended to all the adjustments of her own chamber as she had done ever since she came there to the great amazement of the chambermaid she prepared for a vigorous onslaught on the cupboards and closets of the establishment of which she had the keys  the storeroom the linenpresses the chinacloset the kitchen and cellar that day all went under an awful review hidden things of darkness were brought to light to an extent that alarmed all the principalities and powers of kitchen and chamber and caused many wonderings and murmurings about dese yer northern ladies from the domestic cabinet  old dinah the head cook and principal of all rule and authority in the kitchen department was filled with wrath at what she considered an invasion of privilege no feudal baron in magna charta times could have more thoroughly resented some incursion of the crown  dinah was a character in her own way and it would be injustice to her memory not to give the reader a little idea of her she was a native and essential cook as much as aunt chloecooking being an indigenous talent of the african race but chloe was a trained and methodical one who moved in an orderly domestic harness while dinah was a selftaught genius and like geniuses in general was positive opinionated and erratic to the last degree  like a certain class of modern philosophers dinah perfectly scorned logic and reason in every shape and always took refuge in intuitive certainty and here she was perfectly impregnable no possible amount of talent or authority or explanation could ever make her believe that any other way was better than her own or that the course she had pursued in the smallest matter could be in the least modified this had been a conceded point with her old mistress maries mother and miss marie as dinah always called her young mistress even after her marriage found it easier to submit than contend and so dinah had ruled supreme this was the easier in that she was perfect mistress of that diplomatic art which unites the utmost subservience of manner with the utmost inflexibility as to measure  dinah was mistress of the whole art and mystery of excusemaking in all its branches indeed it was an axiom with her that the cook can do no wrong and a cook in a southern kitchen finds abundance of heads and shoulders on which to lay off every sin and frailty so as to maintain her own immaculateness entire if any part of the dinner was a failure there were fifty indisputably good reasons for it and it was the fault undeniably of fifty other people whom dinah berated with unsparing zeal  but it was very seldom that there was any failure in dinahs last results though her mode of doing everything was peculiarly meandering and circuitous and without any sort of calculation as to time and placethough her kitchen generally looked as if it had been arranged by a hurricane blowing through it and she had about as many places for each cooking utensil as there were days in the yearyet if one would have patience to wait her own good time up would come her dinner in perfect order and in a style of preparation with which an epicure could find no fault  it was now the season of incipient preparation for dinner dinah who required large intervals of reflection and repose and was studious of ease in all her arrangements was seated on the kitchen floor smoking a short stumpy pipe to which she was much addicted and which she always kindled up as a sort of censer whenever she felt the need of an inspiration in her arrangements it was dinahs mode of invoking the domestic muses  seated around her were various members of that rising race with which a southern household abounds engaged in shelling peas peeling potatoes picking pinfeathers out of fowls and other preparatory arrangementsdinah every once in a while interrupting her meditations to give a poke or a rap on the head to some of the young operators with the puddingstick that lay by her side in fact dinah ruled over the woolly heads of the younger members with a rod of iron and seemed to consider them born for no earthly purpose but to save her steps as she phrased it it was the spirit of the system under which she had grown up and she carried it out to its full extent  miss ophelia after passing on her reformatory tour through all the other parts of the establishment now entered the kitchen dinah had heard from various sources what was going on and resolved to stand on defensive and conservative groundmentally determined to oppose and ignore every new measure without any actual observable contest  the kitchen was a large brickfloored apartment with a great oldfashioned fireplace stretching along one side of itan arrangement which st clare had vainly tried to persuade dinah to exchange for the convenience of a modern cookstove not she no puseyite or conservative of any school was ever more inflexibly attached to timehonored inconveniences than dinah        edward bouverie pusey 18001882 champion of the      orthodoxy of revealed religion defender of the oxford      movement and regius professor of hebrew and canon of christ      church oxford  when st clare had first returned from the north impressed with the system and order of his uncles kitchen arrangements he had largely provided his own with an array of cupboards drawers and various apparatus to induce systematic regulation under the sanguine illusion that it would be of any possible assistance to dinah in her arrangements he might as well have provided them for a squirrel or a magpie the more drawers and closets there were the more hidingholes could dinah make for the accommodation of old rags haircombs old shoes ribbons castoff artificial flowers and other articles of vertu wherein her soul delighted  when miss ophelia entered the kitchen dinah did not rise but smoked on in sublime tranquillity regarding her movements obliquely out of the corner of her eye but apparently intent only on the operations around her  miss ophelia commenced opening a set of drawers  what is this drawer for dinah she said  its handy for most anything missis said dinah so it appeared to be from the variety it contained miss ophelia pulled out first a fine damask tablecloth stained with blood having evidently been used to envelop some raw meat  whats this dinah you dont wrap up meat in your mistress best tablecloths  o lor missis no the towels was all a missinso i jest did it i laid out to wash that athats why i put it thar  shifless said miss ophelia to herself proceeding to tumble over the drawer where she found a nutmeggrater and two or three nutmegs a methodist hymnbook a couple of soiled madras handkerchiefs some yarn and knittingwork a paper of tobacco and a pipe a few crackers one or two gilded chinasaucers with some pomade in them one or two thin old shoes a piece of flannel carefully pinned up enclosing some small white onions several damask tablenapkins some coarse crash towels some twine and darningneedles and several broken papers from which sundry sweet herbs were sifting into the drawer  where do you keep your nutmegs dinah said miss ophelia with the air of one who prayed for patience  most anywhar missis theres some in that cracked teacup up there and theres some over in that ar cupboard  here are some in the grater said miss ophelia holding them up  laws yes i put em there this morningi likes to keep my things handy said dinah you jake what are you stopping for youll cotch it be still thar she added with a dive of her stick at the criminal  whats this said miss ophelia holding up the saucer of pomade  laws its my har greasei put it thar to have it handy  do you use your mistress best saucers for that  law it was cause i was driv and in sich a hurryi was gwine to change it this very day  here are two damask tablenapkins  them tablenapkins i put thar to get em washed out some day  dont you have some place here on purpose for things to be washed  well masr st clare got dat ar chest he said for dat but i likes to mix up biscuit and hev my things on it some days and then it ant handy a liftin up the lid  why dont you mix your biscuits on the pastrytable there  law missis it gets sot so full of dishes and one thing and another der ant no room noway  but you should wash your dishes and clear them away  wash my dishes said dinah in a high key as her wrath began to rise over her habitual respect of manner what does ladies know bout work i want to know when d masr ever get his dinner if i vas to spend all my time a washin and a puttin up dishes miss marie never telled me so nohow  well here are these onions  laws yes said dinah thar is whar i put em now i couldnt member them s particular onions i was a savin for dis yer very stew id forgot they was in dat ar old flannel  miss ophelia lifted out the sifting papers of sweet herbs  i wish missis wouldnt touch dem ar i likes to keep my things where i knows whar to go to em said dinah rather decidedly  but you dont want these holes in the papers  them s handy for siftin on t out said dinah  but you see it spills all over the drawer  laws yes if missis will go a tumblin things all up so it will missis has spilt lots dat ar way said dinah coming uneasily to the drawers if missis only will go up stars till my clarin up time comes ill have everything right but i cant do nothin when ladies is round a henderin you sam dont you gib the baby dat ar sugarbowl ill crack ye over if ye dont mind  im going through the kitchen and going to put everything in order once dinah and then ill expect you to keep it so  lor now miss phelia dat ar ant no way for ladies to do i never did see ladies doin no sich my old missis nor miss marie never did and i dont see no kinder need on t and dinah stalked indignantly about while miss ophelia piled and sorted dishes emptied dozens of scattering bowls of sugar into one receptacle sorted napkins tablecloths and towels for washing washing wiping and arranging with her own hands and with a speed and alacrity which perfectly amazed dinah  lor now if dat ar de way dem northern ladies do dey ant ladies nohow she said to some of her satellites when at a safe hearing distance i has things as straight as anybody when my clarin up times comes but i dont want ladies round a henderin and getting my things all where i cant find em  to do dinah justice she had at irregular periods paroxyms of reformation and arrangement which she called clarin up times when she would begin with great zeal and turn every drawer and closet wrong side outward on to the floor or tables and make the ordinary confusion sevenfold more confounded then she would light her pipe and leisurely go over her arrangements looking things over and discoursing upon them making all the young fry scour most vigorously on the tin things and keeping up for several hours a most energetic state of confusion which she would explain to the satisfaction of all inquirers by the remark that she was a clarin up she couldnt hev things a gwine on so as they had been and she was gwine to make these yer young ones keep better order for dinah herself somehow indulged the illusion that she herself was the soul of order and it was only the young uns and the everybody else in the house that were the cause of anything that fell short of perfection in this respect when all the tins were scoured and the tables scrubbed snowy white and everything that could offend tucked out of sight in holes and corners dinah would dress herself up in a smart dress clean apron and high brilliant madras turban and tell all marauding young uns to keep out of the kitchen for she was gwine to have things kept nice indeed these periodic seasons were often an inconvenience to the whole household for dinah would contract such an immoderate attachment to her scoured tin as to insist upon it that it shouldnt be used again for any possible purposeat least till the ardor of the clarin up period abated  miss ophelia in a few days thoroughly reformed every department of the house to a systematic pattern but her labors in all departments that depended on the cooperation of servants were like those of sisyphus or the danaides in despair she one day appealed to st clare  there is no such thing as getting anything like a system in this family  to be sure there isnt said st clare  such shiftless management such waste such confusion i never saw  i dare say you didnt  you would not take it so coolly if you were housekeeper  my dear cousin you may as well understand once for all that we masters are divided into two classes oppressors and oppressed we who are goodnatured and hate severity make up our minds to a good deal of inconvenience if we will keep a shambling loose untaught set in the community for our convenience why we must take the consequence some rare cases i have seen of persons who by a peculiar tact can produce order and system without severity but im not one of themand so i made up my mind long ago to let things go just as they do i will not have the poor devils thrashed and cut to pieces and they know itand of course they know the staff is in their own hands  but to have no time no place no orderall going on in this shiftless way  my dear vermont you natives up by the north pole set an extravagant value on time what on earth is the use of time to a fellow who has twice as much of it as he knows what to do with as to order and system where there is nothing to be done but to lounge on the sofa and read an hour sooner or later in breakfast or dinner isnt of much account now theres dinah gets you a capital dinnersoup ragout roast fowl dessert icecreams and alland she creates it all out of chaos and old night down there in that kitchen i think it really sublime the way she manages but heaven bless us if we are to go down there and view all the smoking and squatting about and hurryscurryation of the preparatory process we should never eat more my good cousin absolve yourself from that its more than a catholic penance and does no more good youll only lose your own temper and utterly confound dinah let her go her own way  but augustine you dont know how i found things  dont i dont i know that the rollingpin is under her bed and the nutmeggrater in her pocket with her tobaccothat there are sixtyfive different sugarbowls one in every hole in the housethat she washes dishes with a dinnernapkin one day and with a fragment of an old petticoat the next but the upshot is she gets up glorious dinners makes superb coffee and you must judge her as warriors and statesmen are judged by her success  but the wastethe expense  o well lock everything you can and keep the key give out by driblets and never inquire for odds and endsit isnt best  that troubles me augustine i cant help feeling as if these servants were not strictly honest are you sure they can be relied on  augustine laughed immoderately at the grave and anxious face with which miss ophelia propounded the question  o cousin thats too goodhonestas if thats a thing to be expected honestwhy of course they arnt why should they be what upon earth is to make them so  why dont you instruct  instruct o fiddlestick what instructing do you think i should do i look like it as to marie she has spirit enough to be sure to kill off a whole plantation if id let her manage but she wouldnt get the cheatery out of them  are there no honest ones  well now and then one whom nature makes so impracticably simple truthful and faithful that the worst possible influence cant destroy it but you see from the mothers breast the colored child feels and sees that there are none but underhand ways open to it it can get along no other way with its parents its mistress its young master and missie playfellows cunning and deception become necessary inevitable habits it isnt fair to expect anything else of him he ought not to be punished for it as to honesty the slave is kept in that dependent semichildish state that there is no making him realize the rights of property or feel that his masters goods are not his own if he can get them for my part i dont see how they can be honest such a fellow as tom here isis a moral miracle  and what becomes of their souls said miss ophelia  that isnt my affair as i know of said st clare i am only dealing in facts of the present life the fact is that the whole race are pretty generally understood to be turned over to the devil for our benefit in this world however it may turn out in another  this is perfectly horrible said miss ophelia you ought to be ashamed of yourselves  i dont know as i am we are in pretty good company for all that said st clare as people in the broad road generally are look at the high and the low all the world over and its the same storythe lower class used up body soul and spirit for the good of the upper it is so in england it is so everywhere and yet all christendom stands aghast with virtuous indignation because we do the thing in a little different shape from what they do it  it isnt so in vermont  ah well in new england and in the free states you have the better of us i grant but theres the bell so cousin let us for a while lay aside our sectional prejudices and come out to dinner  as miss ophelia was in the kitchen in the latter part of the afternoon some of the sable children called out la sakes thars prue a coming grunting along like she allers does  a tall bony colored woman now entered the kitchen bearing on her head a basket of rusks and hot rolls  ho prue youve come said dinah  prue had a peculiar scowling expression of countenance and a sullen grumbling voice she set down her basket squatted herself down and resting her elbows on her knees said  o lord i wisht i s dead  why do you wish you were dead said miss ophelia  id be out o my misery said the woman gruffly without taking her eyes from the floor  what need you getting drunk then and cutting up prue said a spruce quadroon chambermaid dangling as she spoke a pair of coral eardrops  the woman looked at her with a sour surly glance  maybe youll come to it one of these yer days id be glad to see you i would then youll be glad of a drop like me to forget your misery  come prue said dinah lets look at your rusks heres missis will pay for them  miss ophelia took out a couple of dozen  thars some tickets in that ar old cracked jug on the top shelf said dinah you jake climb up and get it down  ticketswhat are they for said miss ophelia  we buy tickets of her masr and she gives us bread for em  and they counts my money and tickets when i gets home to see if i s got the change and if i hant they half kills me  and serves you right said jane the pert chambermaid if you will take their money to get drunk on thats what she does missis  and thats what i will doi cant live no other waysdrink and forget my misery  you are very wicked and very foolish said miss ophelia to steal your masters money to make yourself a brute with  its mighty likely missis but i will do ityes i will o lord i wish i s dead i doi wish i s dead and out of my misery and slowly and stiffly the old creature rose and got her basket on her head again but before she went out she looked at the quadroon girt who still stood playing with her eardrops  ye think yere mighty fine with them ar a frolickin and a tossin your head and a lookin down on everybody well never mindyou may live to be a poor old cutup crittur like me hope to the lord ye will i do then see if ye wont drinkdrinkdrinkyerself into torment and sarve ye right toough and with a malignant howl the woman left the room  disgusting old beast said adolph who was getting his masters shavingwater if i was her master id cut her up worse than she is  ye couldnt do that ar no ways said dinah her backs a far sight nowshe cant never get a dress together over it  i think such low creatures ought not to be allowed to go round to genteel families said miss jane what do you think mr st clare she said coquettishly tossing her head at adolph  it must be observed that among other appropriations from his masters stock adolph was in the habit of adopting his name and address and that the style under which he moved among the colored circles of new orleans was that of mr st clare  im certainly of your opinion miss benoir said adolph  benoir was the name of marie st clares family and jane was one of her servants  pray miss benoir may i be allowed to ask if those drops are for the ball tomorrow night they are certainly bewitching  i wonder now mr st clare what the impudence of you men will come to said jane tossing her pretty head til the eardrops twinkled again i shant dance with you for a whole evening if you go to asking me any more questions  o you couldnt be so cruel now i was just dying to know whether you would appear in your pink tarletane said adolph  what is it said rosa a bright piquant little quadroon who came skipping down stairs at this moment  why mr st clares so impudent  on my honor said adolph ill leave it to miss rosa now  i know hes always a saucy creature said rosa poising herself on one of her little feet and looking maliciously at adolph hes always getting me so angry with him  o ladies ladies you will certainly break my heart between you said adolph i shall be found dead in my bed some morning and youll have it to answer for  do hear the horrid creature talk said both ladies laughing immoderately  comeclar out you i cant have you cluttering up the kitchen said dinah in my way foolin round here  aunt dinahs glum because she cant go to the ball said rosa  dont want none o your lightcolored balls said dinah cuttin round makin blieve yous white folks arter all yous niggers much as i am  aunt dinah greases her wool stiff every day to make it lie straight said jane  and it will be wool after all said rosa maliciously shaking down her long silky curls  well in the lords sight ant wool as good as har any time said dinah id like to have missis say which is worth the mosta couple such as you or one like me get out wid ye ye trumperyi wont have ye round  here the conversation was interrupted in a twofold manner st clares voice was heard at the head of the stairs asking adolph if he meant to stay all night with his shavingwater and miss ophelia coming out of the diningroom said  jane and rosa what are you wasting your time for here go in and attend to your muslins  our friend tom who had been in the kitchen during the conversation with the old ruskwoman had followed her out into the street he saw her go on giving every once in a while a suppressed groan at last she set her basket down on a doorstep and began arranging the old faded shawl which covered her shoulders  ill carry your basket a piece said tom compassionately  why should ye said the woman i dont want no help  you seem to be sick or in trouble or somethin said tom  i ant sick said the woman shortly  i wish said tom looking at her earnestlyi wish i could persuade you to leave off drinking dont you know it will be the ruin of ye body and soul  i knows im gwine to torment said the woman sullenly ye dont need to tell me that ar i s ugly i s wickedi s gwine straight to torment o lord i wish i s thar  tom shuddered at these frightful words spoken with a sullen impassioned earnestness  o lord have mercy on ye poor crittur hant ye never heard of jesus christ  jesus christwhos he  why hes the lord said tom  i think ive hearn tell o the lord and the judgment and torment ive heard o that  but didnt anybody ever tell you of the lord jesus that loved us poor sinners and died for us  dont know nothin bout that said the woman nobody hant never loved me since my old man died  where was you raised said tom  up in kentuck a man kept me to breed chilen for market and sold em as fast as they got big enough last of all he sold me to a speculator and my masr got me o him  what set you into this bad way of drinkin  to get shet o my misery i had one child after i come here and i thought then id have one to raise cause masr wasnt a speculator it was de peartest little thing and missis she seemed to think a heap on t at first it never criedit was likely and fat but missis tuck sick and i tended her and i tuck the fever and my milk all left me and the child it pined to skin and bone and missis wouldnt buy milk for it she wouldnt hear to me when i telled her i hadnt milk she said she knowed i could feed it on what other

so she said as with her usual groan she got her basket on her head and walked sullenly away  tom turned and walked sorrowfully back to the house in the court he met little evaa crown of tuberoses on her head and her eyes radiant with delight  o tom here you are im glad ive found you papa says you may get out the ponies and take me in my little new carriage she said catching his hand but whats the matter tomyou look sober  i feel bad miss eva said tom sorrowfully but ill get the horses for you  but do tell me tom what is the matter i saw you talking to cross old prue  tom in simple earnest phrase told eva the womans history she did not exclaim or wonder or weep as other children do her cheeks grew pale and a deep earnest shadow passed over her eyes she laid both hands on her bosom and sighed heavily     volume ii    chapter xix  miss ophelias experiences and opinions continued   tom you neednt get me the horses i dont want to go she said  why not miss eva  these things sink into my heart tom said evathey sink into my heart she repeated earnestly i dont want to go and she turned from tom and went into the house  a few days after another woman came in old prues place to bring the rusks miss ophelia was in the kitchen  lor said dinah whats got prue  prue isnt coming any more said the woman mysteriously  why not said dinah she ant dead is she  we doesnt exactly know shes down cellar said the woman glancing at miss ophelia  after miss ophelia had taken the rusks dinah followed the woman to the door  what has got prue any how she said  the woman seemed desirous yet reluctant to speak and answered in low mysterious tone  well you mustnt tell nobody prue she got drunk aginand they had her down cellarand thar they left her all dayand i hearn em saying that the flies had got to herand shes dead  dinah held up her hands and turning saw close by her side the spiritlike form of evangeline her large mystic eyes dilated with horror and every drop of blood driven from her lips and cheeks  lor bless us miss evas gwine to faint away what go us all to let her har such talk her pall be rail mad  i shant faint dinah said the child firmly and why shouldnt i hear it it ant so much for me to hear it as for poor prue to suffer it  lor sakes it isnt for sweet delicate young ladies like youthese yer stories isnt its enough to kill em  eva sighed again and walked up stairs with a slow and melancholy step  miss ophelia anxiously inquired the womans story dinah gave a very garrulous version of it to which tom added the particulars which he had drawn from her that morning  an abominable businessperfectly horrible she exclaimed as she entered the room where st clare lay reading his paper  pray what iniquity has turned up now said he  what now why those folks have whipped prue to death said miss ophelia going on with great strength of detail into the story and enlarging on its most shocking particulars  i thought it would come to that some time said st clare going on with his paper  thought soant you going to do anything about it said miss ophelia havent you got any selectmen or anybody to interfere and look after such matters  its commonly supposed that the property interest is a sufficient guard in these cases if people choose to ruin their own possessions i dont know whats to be done it seems the poor creature was a thief and a drunkard and so there wont be much hope to get up sympathy for her  it is perfectly outrageousit is horrid augustine it will certainly bring down vengeance upon you  my dear cousin i didnt do it and i cant help it i would if i could if lowminded brutal people will act like themselves what am i to do they have absolute control they are irresponsible despots there would be no use in interfering there is no law that amounts to anything practically for such a case the best we can do is to shut our eyes and ears and let it alone its the only resource left us  how can you shut your eyes and ears how can you let such things alone  my dear child what do you expect here is a whole classdebased uneducated indolent provokingput without any sort of terms or conditions entirely into the hands of such people as the majority in our world are people who have neither consideration nor selfcontrol who havent even an enlightened regard to their own interestfor thats the case with the largest half of mankind of course in a community so organized what can a man of honorable and humane feelings do but shut his eyes all he can and harden his heart i cant buy every poor wretch i see i cant turn knighterrant and undertake to redress every individual case of wrong in such a city as this the most i can do is to try and keep out of the way of it  st clares fine countenance was for a moment overcast he said  come cousin dont stand there looking like one of the fates youve only seen a peep through the curtaina specimen of what is going on the world over in some shape or other if we are to be prying and spying into all the dismals of life we should have no heart to anything t is like looking too close into the details of dinahs kitchen and st clare lay back on the sofa and busied himself with his paper  miss ophelia sat down and pulled out her knittingwork and sat there grim with indignation she knit and knit but while she mused the fire burned at last she broke outi tell you augustine i cant get over things so if you can its a perfect abomination for you to defend such a systemthats my mind  what now said st clare looking up at it again hey  i say its perfectly abominable for you to defend such a system said miss ophelia with increasing warmth  i defend it my dear lady who ever said i did defend it said st clare  of course you defend ityou all doall you southerners what do you have slaves for if you dont  are you such a sweet innocent as to suppose nobody in this world ever does what they dont think is right dont you or didnt you ever do anything that you did not think quite right  if i do i repent of it i hope said miss ophelia rattling her needles with energy  so do i said st clare peeling his orange im repenting of it all the time  what do you keep on doing it for  didnt you ever keep on doing wrong after youd repented my good cousin  well only when ive been very much tempted said miss ophelia  well im very much tempted said st clare thats just my difficulty  but i always resolve i wont and i try to break off  well i have been resolving i wont off and on these ten years said st clare but i havent some how got clear have you got clear of all your sins cousin  cousin augustine said miss ophelia seriously and laying down her knittingwork i suppose i deserve that you should reprove my shortcomings i know all you say is true enough nobody else feels them more than i do but it does seem to me after all there is some difference between me and you it seems to me i would cut off my right hand sooner than keep on from day to day doing what i thought was wrong but then my conduct is so inconsistent with my profession i dont wonder you reprove me  o now cousin said augustine sitting down on the floor and laying his head back in her lap dont take on so awfully serious you know what a goodfornothing saucy boy i always was i love to poke you upthats alljust to see you get earnest i do think you are desperately distressingly good it tires me to death to think of it  but this is a serious subject my boy auguste said miss ophelia laying her hand on his forehead  dismally so said he and iwell i never want to talk seriously in hot weather what with mosquitos and all a fellow cant get himself up to any very sublime moral flights and i believe said st clare suddenly rousing himself up theres a theory now i understand now why northern nations are always more virtuous than southern onesi see into that whole subject  o augustine you are a sad rattlebrain  am i well so i am i suppose but for once i will be serious now but you must hand me that basket of orangesyou see youll have to stay me with flagons and comfort me with apples if im going to make this effort now said augustine drawing the basket up ill begin when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for a fellow to hold two or three dozen of his fellowworms in captivity a decent regard to the opinions of society requires  i dont see that you are growing more serious said miss ophelia  waitim coming onyoull hear the short of the matter is cousin said he his handsome face suddenly settling into an earnest and serious expression on this abstract question of slavery there can as i think be but one opinion planters who have money to make by itclergymen who have planters to pleasepoliticians who want to rule by itmay warp and bend language and ethics to a degree that shall astonish the world at their ingenuity they can press nature and the bible and nobody knows what else into the service but after all neither they nor the world believe in it one particle the more it comes from the devil thats the short of itand to my mind its a pretty respectable specimen of what he can do in his own line  miss ophelia stopped her knitting and looked surprised and st clare apparently enjoying her astonishment went on  you seem to wonder but if you will get me fairly at it ill make a clean breast of it this cursed business accursed of god and man what is it strip it of all its ornament run it down to the root and nucleus of the whole and what is it why because my brother quashy is ignorant and weak and i am intelligent and strongbecause i know how and can do ittherefore i may steal all he has keep it and give him only such and so much as suits my fancy whatever is too hard too dirty too disagreeable for me i may set quashy to doing because i dont like work quashy shall work because the sun burns me quashy shall stay in the sun quashy shall earn the money and i will spend it quashy shall lie down in every puddle that i may walk over dryshod quashy shall do my will and not his all the days of his mortal life and have such chance of getting to heaven at last as i find convenient this i take to be about what slavery is i defy anybody on earth to read our slavecode as it stands in our lawbooks and make anything else of it talk of the abuses of slavery humbug the thing itself is the essence of all abuse and the only reason why the land dont sink under it like sodom and gomorrah is because it is used in a way infinitely better than it is for pitys sake for shames sake because we are men born of women and not savage beasts many of us do not and dare notwe would scorn to use the full power which our savage laws put into our hands and he who goes the furthest and does the worst only uses within limits the power that the law gives him  st clare had started up and as his manner was when excited was walking with hurried steps up and down the floor his fine face classic as that of a greek statue seemed actually to burn with the fervor of his feelings his large blue eyes flashed and he gestured with an unconscious eagerness miss ophelia had never seen him in this mood before and she sat perfectly silent  i declare to you said he suddenly stopping before his cousin its no sort of use to talk or to feel on this subject but i declare to you there have been times when i have thought if the whole country would sink and hide all this injustice and misery from the light i would willingly sink with it when i have been travelling up and down on our boats or about on my collecting tours and reflected that every brutal disgusting mean lowlived fellow i met was allowed by our laws to become absolute despot of as many men women and children as he could cheat steal or gamble money enough to buywhen i have seen such men in actual ownership of helpless children of young girls and womeni have been ready to curse my country to curse the human race  augustine augustine said miss ophelia im sure youve said enough i never in my life heard anything like this even at the north  at the north said st clare with a sudden change of expression and resuming something of his habitual careless tone pooh your northern folks are coldblooded you are cool in everything you cant begin to curse up hill and down as we can when we get fairly at it  well but the question is said miss ophelia  o yes to be sure the question isand a deuce of a question it is how came you in this state of sin and misery well i shall answer in the good old words you used to teach me sundays i came so by ordinary generation my servants were my fathers and what is more my mothers and now they are mine they and their increase which bids fair to be a pretty considerable item my father you know came first from new england and he was just such another man as your fathera regular old romanupright energetic nobleminded with an iron will your father settled down in new england to rule over rocks and stones and to force an existence out of nature and mine settled in louisiana to rule over men and women and force existence out of them my mother said st clare getting up and walking to a picture at the end of the room and gazing upward with a face fervent with veneration she was divine dont look at me soyou know what i mean she probably was of mortal birth but as far as ever i could observe there was no trace of any human weakness or error about her and everybody that lives to remember her whether bond or free servant acquaintance relation all say the same why cousin that mother has been all that has stood between me and utter unbelief for years she was a direct embodiment and personification of the new testamenta living fact to be accounted for and to be accounted for in no other way than by its truth o mother mother said st clare clasping his hands in a sort of transport and then suddenly checking himself he came back and seating himself on an ottoman he went on  my brother and i were twins and they say you know that twins ought to resemble each other but we were in all points a contrast he had black fiery eyes coalblack hair a strong fine roman profile and a rich brown complexion i had blue eyes golden hair a greek outline and fair complexion he was active and observing i dreamy and inactive he was generous to his friends and equals but proud dominant overbearing to inferiors and utterly unmerciful to whatever set itself up against him truthful we both were he from pride and courage i from a sort of abstract ideality we loved each other about as boys generally dooff and on and in generalhe was my fathers pet and i my mothers  there was a morbid sensitiveness and acuteness of feeling in me on all possible subjects of which he and my father had no kind of understanding and with which they could have no possible sympathy but mother did and so when i had quarreled with alfred and father looked sternly on me i used to go off to mothers room and sit by her i remember just how she used to look with her pale cheeks her deep soft serious eyes her white dressshe always wore white and i used to think of her whenever i read in revelations about the saints that were arrayed in fine linen clean and white she had a great deal of genius of one sort and another particularly in music and she used to sit at her organ playing fine old majestic music of the catholic church and singing with a voice more like an angel than a mortal woman and i would lay my head down on her lap and cry and dream and feeloh immeasurablythings that i had no language to say  in those days this matter of slavery had never been canvassed as it has now nobody dreamed of any harm in it  my father was a born aristocrat i think in some preexistent state he must have been in the higher circles of spirits and brought all his old court pride along with him for it was ingrain bred in the bone though he was originally of poor and not in any way of noble family my brother was begotten in his image  now an aristocrat you know the world over has no human sympathies beyond a certain line in society in england the line is in one place in burmah in another and in america in another but the aristocrat of all these countries never goes over it what would be hardship and distress and injustice in his own class is a cool matter of course in another one my fathers dividing line was that of color among his equals never was a man more just and generous but he considered the negro through all possible gradations of color as an intermediate link between man and animals and graded all his ideas of justice or generosity on this hypothesis i suppose to be sure if anybody had asked him plump and fair whether they had human immortal souls he might have hemmed and hawed and said yes but my father was not a man much troubled with spiritualism religious sentiment he had none beyond a veneration for god as decidedly the head of the upper classes  well my father worked some five hundred negroes he was an inflexible driving punctilious business man everything was to move by systemto be sustained with unfailing accuracy and precision now if you take into account that all this was to be worked out by a set of lazy twaddling shiftless laborers who had grown up all their lives in the absence of every possible motive to learn how to do anything but shirk as you vermonters say and youll see that there might naturally be on his plantation a great many things that looked horrible and distressing to a sensitive child like me  besides all he had an overseergreat tall slabsided twofisted renegade son of vermontbegging your pardonwho had gone through a regular apprenticeship in hardness and brutality and taken his degree to be admitted to practice my mother never could endure him nor i but he obtained an entire ascendency over my father and this man was the absolute despot of the estate  i was a little fellow then but i had the same love that i have now for all kinds of human thingsa kind of passion for the study of humanity come in what shape it would i was found in the cabins and among the fieldhands a great deal and of course was a great favorite and all sorts of complaints and grievances were breathed in my ear and i told them to mother and we between us formed a sort of committee for a redress of grievances we hindered and repressed a great deal of cruelty and congratulated ourselves on doing a vast deal of good till as often happens my zeal overacted stubbs complained to my father that he couldnt manage the hands and must resign his position father was a fond indulgent husband but a man that never flinched from anything that he thought necessary and so he put down his foot like a rock between us and the fieldhands he told my mother in language perfectly respectful and deferential but quite explicit that over the houseservants she should be entire mistress but that with the fieldhands he could allow no interference he revered and respected her above all living beings but he would have said it all the same to the virgin mary herself if she had come in the way of his system  i used sometimes to hear my mother reasoning cases with himendeavoring to excite his sympathies he would listen to the most pathetic appeals with the most discouraging politeness and equanimity it all resolves itself into this he would say must i part with stubbs or keep him stubbs is the soul of punctuality honesty and efficiencya thorough business hand and as humane as the general run we cant have perfection and if i keep him i must sustain his administration as a whole even if there are now and then things that are exceptionable all government includes some necessary hardness general rules will bear hard on particular cases this last maxim my father seemed to consider a settler in most alleged cases of cruelty after he had said that he commonly drew up his feet on the sofa like a man that has disposed of a business and betook himself to a nap or the newspaper as the case might be  the fact is my father showed the exact sort of talent for a statesman he could have divided poland as easily as an orange or trod on ireland as quietly and systematically as any man living at last my mother gave up in despair it never will be known till the last account what noble and sensitive natures like hers have felt cast utterly helpless into what seems to them an abyss of injustice and cruelty and which seems so to nobody about them it has been an age of long sorrow of such natures in such a hellbegotten sort of world as ours what remained for her but to train her children in her own views and sentiments well after all you say about training children will grow up substantially what they are by nature and only that from the cradle alfred was an aristocrat and as he grew up instinctively all his sympathies and all his reasonings were in that line and all mothers exhortations went to the winds as to me they sunk deep into me she never contradicted in form anything my father said or seemed directly to differ from him but she impressed burnt into my very soul with all the force of her deep earnest nature an idea of the dignity and worth of the meanest human soul i have looked in her face with solemn awe when she would point up to the stars in the evening and say to me see there auguste the poorest meanest soul on our place will be living when all these stars are gone foreverwill live as long as god lives  she had some fine old paintings one in particular of jesus healing a blind man they were very fine and used to impress me strongly see there auguste she would say the blind man was a beggar poor and loathsome therefore he would not heal him afar off he called him to him and put his hands on him remember this my boy if i had lived to grow up under her care she might have stimulated me to i know not what of enthusiasm i might have been a saint reformer martyrbut alas alas i went from her when i was only thirteen and i never saw her again  st clare rested his head on his hands and did not speak for some minutes after a while he looked up and went on  what poor mean trash this whole business of human virtue is a mere matter for the most part of latitude and longitude and geographical position acting with natural temperament the greater part is nothing but an accident your father for example settles in vermont in a town where all are in fact free and equal becomes a regular church member and deacon and in due time joins an abolition society and thinks us all little better than heathens yet he is for all the world in constitution and habit a duplicate of my father i can see it leaking out in fifty different waysjust the same strong overbearing dominant spirit you know very well how impossible it is to persuade some of the folks in your village that squire sinclair does not feel above them the fact is though he has fallen on democratic times and embraced a democratic theory he is to the heart an aristocrat as much as my father who ruled over five or six hundred slaves  miss ophelia felt rather disposed to cavil at this picture and was laying down her knitting to begin but st clare stopped her  now i know every word you are going to say i do not say they were alike in fact one fell into a condition where everything acted against the natural tendency and the other where everything acted for it and so one turned out a pretty wilful stout overbearing old democrat and the other a wilful stout old despot if both had owned plantations in louisiana they would have been as like as two old bullets cast in the same mould  what an undutiful boy you are said miss ophelia  i dont mean them any disrespect said st clare you know reverence is not my forte but to go back to my history  when father died he left the whole property to us twin boys to be divided as we should agree there does not breathe on gods earth a noblersouled more generous fellow than alfred in all that concerns his equals and we got on admirably with this property question without a single unbrotherly word or feeling we undertook to work the plantation together and alfred whose outward life and capabilities had double the strength of mine became an enthusiastic planter and a wonderfully successful one  but two years trial satisfied me that i could not be a partner in that matter to have a great gang of seven hundred whom i could not know personally or feel any individual interest in bought and driven housed fed worked like so many horned cattle strained up to military precisionthe question of how little of lifes commonest enjoyments would keep them in working order being a constantly recurring problemthe necessity of drivers and overseersthe evernecessary whip first last and only argumentthe whole thing was insufferably disgusting and loathsome to me and when i thought of my mothers estimate of one poor human soul it became even frightful  its all nonsense to talk to me about slaves enjoying all this to this day i have no patience with the unutterable trash that some of your patronizing northerners have made up as in their zeal to apologize for our sins we all know better tell me that any man living wants to work all his days from daydawn till dark under the constant eye of a master without the power of putting forth one irresponsible volition on the same dreary monotonous unchanging toil and all for two pairs of pantaloons and a pair of shoes a year with enough food and shelter to keep him in working order any man who thinks that human beings can as a general thing be made about as comfortable that way as any other i wish he might try it id buy the dog and work him with a clear conscience  i always have supposed said miss ophelia that you all of you approved of these things and thought them rightaccording to scripture  humbug we are not quite reduced to that yet alfred who is as determined a despot as ever walked does not pretend to this kind of defenceno he stands high and haughty on that good old respectable ground the right of the strongest and he says and i think quite sensibly that the american planter is only doing in another form what the english aristocracy and capitalists are doing by the lower classes that is i take it appropriating them body and bone soul and spirit to their use and convenience he defends bothand i think at least consistently he says that there can be no high civilization without enslavement of the masses either nominal or real there must he says be a lower class given up to physical toil and confined to an animal nature and a higher one thereby acquires leisure and wealth for a more expanded intelligence and improvement and becomes the directing soul of the lower so he reasons because as i said he is born an aristocratso i dont believe because i was born a democrat  how in the world can the two things be compared said miss ophelia the english laborer is not sold traded parted from his family whipped  he is as much at the will of his employer as if he were sold to him the slaveowner can whip his refractory slave to deaththe capitalist can starve him to death as to family security it is hard to say which is the worstto have ones children sold or see them starve to death at home  but its no kind of apology for slavery to prove that it isnt worse than some other bad thing  i didnt give it for onenay ill say besides that ours is the more bold and palpable infringement of human rights actually buying a man up like a horselooking at his teeth cracking his joints and trying his paces and then paying down for himhaving speculators breeders traders and brokers in human bodies and soulssets the thing before the eyes of the civilized world in a more tangible form though the thing done be after all in its nature the same that is appropriating one set of human beings to the use and improvement of another without any regard to their own  i never thought of the matter in this light said miss ophelia  well ive travelled in england some and ive looked over a good many documents as to the state of their lower classes and i really think there is no denying alfred when he says that his slaves are better off than a large class of the population of england you see you must not infer from what i have told you that alfred is what is called a hard master for he isnt he is despotic and unmerciful to insubordination he would shoot a fellow down with as little remorse as he would shoot a buck if he opposed him but in general he takes a sort of pride in having his slaves comfortably fed and accommodated  when i was with him i insisted that he should do something for their instruction and to please me he did get a chaplain and used to have them catechized sunday though i believe in his heart that he thought it would do about as much good to set a chaplain over his dogs and horses and the fact is that a mind stupefied and animalized by every bad influence from the hour of birth spending the whole of every weekday in unreflecting toil cannot be done much with by a few hours on sunday the teachers of sundayschools among the manufacturing population of england and among plantationhands in our country could perhaps testify to the same result there and here yet some striking exceptions there are among us from the fact that the negro is naturally more impressible to religious sentiment than the white  well said miss ophelia how came you to give up your plantation life  well we jogged on together some time till alfred saw plainly that i was no planter he thought it absurd after he had reformed and altered and improved everywhere to suit my notions that i still remained unsatisfied the fact was it was after all the thing that i hatedthe using these men and women the perpetuation of all this ignorance brutality and vicejust to make money for me  besides i was always interfering in the details being myself one of the laziest of mortals i had altogether too much fellowfeeling for the lazy and when poor shiftless dogs put stones at the bottom of their cottonbaskets to make them weigh heavier or filled their sacks with dirt with cotton at the top it seemed so exactly like what i should do if i were they i couldnt and wouldnt have them flogged for it well of course there was an end of plantation discipline and alf and i came to about the same point that i and my respected father did years before so he told me that i was a womanish sentimentalist and would never do for business life and advised me to take the bankstock and the new orleans family mansion and go to writing poetry and let him manage the plantation so we parted and i came here  but why didnt you free your slaves  well i wasnt up to that to hold them as tools for moneymaking i could nothave them to help spend money you know didnt look quite so ugly to me some of them were old houseservants to whom i was much attached and the younger ones were children to the old all were well satisfied to be as they were he paused and walked reflectively up and down the room  there was said st clare a time in my life when i had plans and hopes of doing something in this world more than to float and drift i had vague indistinct yearnings to be a sort of emancipatorto free my native land from this spot and stain all young men have had such feverfits i suppose some timebut then  why didnt you said miss opheliayou ought not to put your hand to the plough and look back  o well things didnt go with me as i expected and i got the despair of living that solomon did i suppose it was a necessary incident to wisdom in us both but some how or other instead of being actor and regenerator in society i became a piece of driftwood and have been floating and eddying about ever since alfred scolds me every time we meet and he has the better of me i grantfor he really does something his life is a logical result of his opinions and mine is a contemptible non sequitur  my dear cousin can you be satisfied with such a way of spending your probation  satisfied was i not just telling you i despised it but then to come back to this pointwe were on this liberation business i dont think my feelings about slavery are peculiar i find many men who in their hearts think of it just as i do the land groans under it and bad as it is for the slave it is worse if anything for the master it takes no spectacles to see that a great class of vicious improvident degraded people among us are an evil to us as well as to themselves the capitalist and aristocrat of england cannot feel that as we do because they do not mingle with the class they degrade as we do they are in our homes they are the associates of our children and they form their minds faster than we can for they are a race that children always will cling to and assimilate with if eva now was not more angel than ordinary she would be ruined we might as well allow the smallpox to run among them and think our children would not take it as to let them be uninstructed and vicious and think our children will not be affected by that yet our laws positively and utterly forbid any efficient general educational system and they do it wisely too for just begin and thoroughly educate one generation and the whole thing would be blown sky high if we did not give them liberty they would take it  and what do you think will be the end of this said miss ophelia  i dont know one thing is certainthat there is a mustering among the masses the world over and there is a dies iræ coming on sooner or later the same thing is working in europe in england and in this country my mother used to tell me of a millennium that was coming when christ should reign and all men should be free and happy and she taught me when i was a boy to pray thy kingdom come sometimes i think all this sighing and groaning and stirring among the dry bones foretells what she used to tell me was coming but who may abide the day of his appearing  augustine sometimes i think you are not far from the kingdom said miss ophelia laying down her knitting and looking anxiously at her cousin  thank you for your good opinion but its up and down with meup to heavens gate in theory down in earths dust in practice but theres the teabelldo lets goand dont say now i havent had one downright serious talk for once in my life  at table marie alluded to the incident of prue i suppose youll think cousin she said that we are all barbarians  i think thats a barbarous thing said miss ophelia but i dont think you are all barbarians  well now said marie i know its impossible to get along with some of these creatures they are so bad they ought not to live i dont feel a particle of sympathy for such cases if theyd only behave themselves it would not happen  but mamma said eva the poor creature was unhappy thats what made her drink  o fiddlestick as if that were any excuse im unhappy very often i presume she said pensively that ive had greater trials than ever she had its just because they are so bad theres some of them that you cannot break in by any kind of severity i remember father had a man that was so lazy he would run away just to get rid of work and lie round in the swamps stealing and doing all sorts of horrid things that man was caught and whipped time and again and it never did him any good and the last time he crawled off though he couldnt but just go and died in the swamp there was no sort of reason for it for fathers hands were always treated kindly  i broke a fellow in once said st clare that all the overseers and masters had tried their hands on in vain  you said marie well id be glad to know when you ever did anything of the sort  well he was a powerful gigantic fellowa nativeborn african and he appeared to have the rude instinct of freedom in him to an uncommon degree he was a regular african lion they called him scipio nobody could do anything with him and he was sold round from overseer to overseer till at last alfred bought him because he thought he could manage him well one day he knocked down the overseer and was fairly off into the swamps i was on a visit to alfs plantation for it was after we had dissolved partnership alfred was greatly exasperated but i told him that it was his own fault and laid him any wager that i could break the man and finally it was agreed that if i caught him i should have him to experiment on so they mustered out a party of some six or seven with guns and dogs for the hunt people you know can get up as much enthusiasm in hunting a man as a deer if it is only customary in fact i got a little excited myself though i had only put in as a sort of mediator in case he was caught  well the dogs bayed and howled and we rode and scampered and finally we started him he ran and bounded like a buck and kept us well in the rear for some time but at last he got caught in an impenetrable thicket of cane then he turned to bay and i tell you he fought the dogs right gallantly he dashed them to right and left and actually killed three of them with only his naked fists when a shot from a gun brought him down and he fell wounded and bleeding almost at my feet the poor fellow looked up at me with manhood and despair both in his eye i kept back the dogs and the party as they came pressing up and claimed him as my prisoner it was all i could do to keep them from shooting him in the flush of success but i persisted in my bargain and alfred sold him to me well i took him in hand and in one fortnight i had him tamed down as submissive and tractable as heart could desire  what in the world did you do to him said marie  well it was quite a simple process i took him to my own room had a good bed made for him dressed his wounds and tended him myself until he got fairly on his feet again and in process of time i had free papers made out for him and told him he might go where he liked  and did he go said miss ophelia  no the foolish fellow tore the paper in two and absolutely refused to leave me i never had a braver better fellowtrusty and true as steel he embraced christianity afterwards and became as gentle as a child he used to oversee my place on the lake and did it capitally too i lost him the first cholera season in fact he laid down his life for me for i was sick almost to death and when through the panic everybody else fled scipio worked for me like a giant and actually brought me back into life again but poor fellow he was taken right after and there was no saving him i never felt anybodys loss more  eva had come gradually nearer and nearer to her father as he told the storyher small lips apart her eyes wide and earnest with absorbing interest  as he finished she suddenly threw her arms around his neck burst into tears and sobbed convulsively  eva dear child what is the matter said st clare as the childs small frame trembled and shook with the violence of her feelings this child he added ought not to hear any of this kind of thingshes nervous  no papa im not nervous said eva controlling herself suddenly with a strength of resolution singular in such a child im not nervous but these things sink into my heart  what do you mean eva  i cant tell you papa i think a great many thoughts perhaps some day i shall tell you  well think away dearonly dont cry and worry your papa said st clare look heresee what a beautiful peach i have got for you  eva took it and smiled though there was still a nervous twiching about the corners of her mouth  come look at the goldfish said st clare taking her hand and stepping on to the verandah a few moments and merry laughs were heard through the silken curtains as eva and st clare were pelting each other with roses and chasing each other among the alleys of the court   there is danger that our humble friend tom be neglected amid the adventures of the higher born but if our readers will accompany us up to a little loft over the stable they may perhaps learn a little of his affairs it was a decent room containing a bed a chair and a small rough stand where lay toms bible and hymnbook and where he sits at present with his slate before him intent on something that seems to cost him a great deal of anxious thought  the fact was that toms homeyearnings had become so strong that he had begged a sheet of writingpaper of eva and mustering up all his small stock of literary attainment acquired by masr georges instructions he conceived the bold idea of writing a letter and he was busy now on his slate getting out his first draft tom was in a good deal of trouble for the forms of some of the letters he had forgotten entirely and of what he did remember he did not know exactly which to use and while he was working and breathing very hard in his earnestness eva alighted like a bird on the round of his chair behind him and peeped over his shoulder  o uncle tom what funny things you are making there  im trying to write to my poor old woman miss eva and my little chilen said tom drawing the back of his hand over his eyes but some how im feard i shant make it out  i wish i could help you tom ive learnt to write some last year i could make all the letters but im afraid ive forgotten  so eva put her golden head close to his and the two commenced a grave and anxious discussion each one equally earnest and about equally ignorant and with a deal of consulting and advising over every word the composition began as they both felt very sanguine to look quite like writing  yes uncle tom it really begins to look beautiful said eva gazing delightedly on it how pleased your wifell be and the poor little children o its a shame you ever had to go away from them i mean to ask papa to let you go back some time  missis said that she would send down money for me as soon as they could get it together said tom im spectin she will young masr george he said hed come for me and he gave me this yer dollar as a sign and tom drew from under his clothes the precious dollar  o hell certainly come then said eva im so glad  and i wanted to send a letter you know to let em know whar i was and tell poor chloe that i was well offcause she felt so drefful poor soul  i say tom said st clares voice coming in the door at this moment  tom and eva both started  whats here said st clare coming up and looking at the slate  o its toms letter im helping him to write it said eva isnt it nice  i wouldnt discourage either of you said st clare but i rather think tom youd better get me to write your letter for you ill do it when i come home from my ride  its very important he should write said eva because his mistress is going to send down money to redeem him you know papa he told me they told him so  st clare thought in his heart that this was probably only one of those things which goodnatured owners say to their servants to alleviate their horror of being sold without any intention of fulfilling the expectation thus excited but he did not make any audible comment upon itonly ordered tom to get the horses out for a ride  toms letter was written in due form for him that evening and safely lodged in the postoffice  miss ophelia still persevered in her labors in the housekeeping line it was universally agreed among all the household from dinah down to the youngest urchin that miss ophelia was decidedly curisa term by which a southern servant implies that his or her betters dont exactly suit them  the higher circle in the familyto wit adolph jane and rosaagreed that she was no lady ladies never keep working about as she didthat she had no air at all and they were surprised that she should be any relation of the st clares even marie declared that it was absolutely fatiguing to see cousin ophelia always so busy and in fact miss ophelias industry was so incessant as to lay some foundation for the complaint she sewed and stitched away from daylight till dark with the energy of one who is pressed on by some immediate urgency and then when the light faded and the work was folded away with one turn out came the everready knittingwork and there she was again going on as briskly as ever it really was a labor to see her    chapter xx  topsy   one morning while miss ophelia was busy in some of her domestic cares st clares voice was heard calling her at the foot of the stairs  come down here cousin ive something to show you  what is it said miss ophelia coming down with her sewing in her hand  ive made a purchase for your departmentsee here said st clare and with the word he pulled along a little negro girl about eight or nine years of age  she was one of the blackest of her race and her round shining eyes glittering as glass beads moved with quick and restless glances over everything in the room her mouth half open with astonishment at the wonders of the new masrs parlor displayed a white and brilliant set of teeth her woolly hair was braided in sundry little tails which stuck out in every direction the expression of her face was an odd mixture of shrewdness and cunning over which was oddly drawn like a kind of veil an expression of the most doleful gravity and solemnity she was dressed in a single filthy ragged garment made of bagging and stood with her hands demurely folded before her altogether there was something odd and goblinlike about her appearancesomething as miss ophelia afterwards said so heathenish as to inspire that good lady with utter dismay and turning to st clare she said  augustine what in the world have you brought that thing here for  for you to educate to be sure and train in the way she should go i thought she was rather a funny specimen in the jim crow line here topsy he added giving a whistle as a man would to call the attention of a dog give us a song now and show us some of your dancing  the black glassy eyes glittered with a kind of wicked drollery and the thing struck up in a clear shrill voice an odd negro melody to which she kept time with her hands and feet spinning round clapping her hands knocking her knees together in a wild fantastic sort of time and producing in her throat all those odd guttural sounds which distinguish the native music of her race and finally turning a summerset or two and giving a prolonged closing note as odd and unearthly as that of a steamwhistle she came suddenly down on the carpet and stood with her hands folded and a most sanctimonious expression of meekness and solemnity over her face only broken by the cunning glances which she shot askance from the corners of her eyes  miss ophelia stood silent perfectly paralyzed with amazement st clare like a mischievous fellow as he was appeared to enjoy her astonishment and addressing the child again said  topsy this is your new mistress im going to give you up to her see now that you behave yourself  yes masr said topsy with sanctimonious gravity her wicked eyes twinkling as she spoke  youre going to be good topsy you understand said st clare  o yes masr said topsy with another twinkle her hands still devoutly folded  now augustine what upon earth is this for said miss ophelia your house is so full of these little plagues now that a body cant set down their foot without treading on em i get up in the morning and find one asleep behind the door and see one black head poking out from under the table one lying on the doormatand they are mopping and mowing and grinning between all the railings and tumbling over the kitchen floor what on earth did you want to bring this one for  for you to educatedidnt i tell you youre always preaching about educating i thought i would make you a present of a freshcaught specimen and let you try your hand on her and bring her up in the way she should go  i dont want her i am surei have more to do with em now than i want to  thats you christians all overyoull get up a society and get some poor missionary to spend all his days among just such heathen but let me see one of you that would take one into your house with you and take the labor of their conversion on yourselves no when it comes to that they are dirty and disagreeable and its too much care and so on  augustine you know i didnt think of it in that light said miss ophelia evidently softening well it might be a real missionary work said she looking rather more favorably on the child  st clare had touched the right string miss ophelias conscientiousness was ever on the alert but she added i really didnt see the need of buying this onethere are enough now in your house to take all my time and skill  well then cousin said st clare drawing her aside i ought to beg your pardon for my goodfornothing speeches you are so good after all that theres no sense in them why the fact is this concern belonged to a couple of drunken creatures that keep a low restaurant that i have to pass by every day and i was tired of hearing her screaming and them beating and swearing at her she looked bright and funny too as if something might be made of herso i bought her and ill give her to you try now and give her a good orthodox new england bringing up and see what itll make of her you know i havent any gift that way but id like you to try  well ill do what i can said miss ophelia and she approached her new subject very much as a person might be supposed to approach a black spider supposing them to have benevolent designs toward it  shes dreadfully dirty and half naked she said  well take her down stairs and make some of them clean and clothe her up  miss ophelia carried her to the kitchen regions  dont see what masr st clare wants of nother nigger said dinah surveying the new arrival with no friendly air wont have her around under my feet i know  pah said rosa and jane with supreme disgust let her keep out of our way what in the world masr wanted another of these low niggers for i cant see  you go long no more nigger dan you be miss rosa said dinah who felt this last remark a reflection on herself you seem to tink yourself white folks you ant nerry one black nor white id like to be one or turrer  miss ophelia saw that there was nobody in the camp that would undertake to oversee the cleansing and dressing of the new arrival and so she was forced to do it herself with some very ungracious and reluctant assistance from jane  it is not for ears polite to hear the particulars of the first toilet of a neglected abused child in fact in this world multitudes must live and die in a state that it would be too great a shock to the nerves of their fellowmortals even to hear described miss ophelia had a good strong practical deal of resolution and she went through all the disgusting details with heroic thoroughness though it must be confessed with no very gracious airfor endurance was the utmost to which her principles could bring her when she saw on the back and shoulders of the child great welts and calloused spots ineffaceable marks of the system under which she had grown up thus far her heart became pitiful within her  see there said jane pointing to the marks dont that show shes a limb well have fine works with her i reckon i hate these nigger young uns so disgusting i wonder that masr would buy her  the young un alluded to heard all these comments with the subdued and doleful air which seemed habitual to her only scanning with a keen and furtive glance of her flickering eyes the ornaments which jane wore in her ears when arrayed at last in a suit of decent and whole clothing her hair cropped short to her head miss ophelia with some satisfaction said she looked more christianlike than she did and in her own mind began to mature some plans for her instruction  sitting down before her she began to question her  how old are you topsy  dun no missis said the image with a grin that showed all her teeth  dont know how old you are didnt anybody ever tell you who was your mother  never had none said the child with another grin  never had any mother what do you mean where were you born  never was born persisted topsy with another grin that looked so goblinlike that if miss ophelia had been at all nervous she might have fancied that she had got hold of some sooty gnome from the land of diablerie but miss ophelia was not nervous but plain and businesslike and she said with some sternness  you mustnt answer me in that way child im not playing with you tell me where you were born and who your father and mother were  never was born reiterated the creature more emphatically never had no father nor mother nor nothin i was raised by a speculator with lots of others old aunt sue used to take car on us  the child was evidently sincere and jane breaking into a short laugh said  laws missis theres heaps of em speculators buys em up cheap when theys little and gets em raised for market  how long have you lived with your master and mistress  dun no missis  is it a year or more or less  dun no missis  laws missis those low negroesthey cant tell they dont know anything about time said jane they dont know what a year is they dont know their own ages  have you ever heard anything about god topsy  the child looked bewildered but grinned as usual  do you know who made you  nobody as i knows on said the child with a short laugh  the idea appeared to amuse her considerably for her eyes twinkled and she added  i spect i growd dont think nobody never made me  do you know how to sew said miss ophelia who thought she would turn her inquiries to something more tangible  no missis  what can you dowhat did you do for your master and mistress  fetch water and wash dishes and rub knives and wait on folks  were they good to you  spect they was said the child scanning miss ophelia cunningly  miss ophelia rose from this encouraging colloquy st clare was leaning over the back of her chair  you find virgin soil there cousin put in your own ideasyou wont find many to pull up  miss ophelias ideas of education like all her other ideas were very set and definite and of the kind that prevailed in new england a century ago and which are still preserved in some very retired and unsophisticated parts where there are no railroads as nearly as could be expressed they could be comprised in very few words to teach them to mind when they were spoken to to teach them the catechism sewing and reading and to whip them if they told lies and though of course in the flood of light that is now poured on education these are left far away in the rear yet it is an undisputed fact that our grandmothers raised some tolerably fair men and women under this regime as many of us can remember and testify at all events miss ophelia knew of nothing else to do and therefore applied her mind to her heathen with the best diligence she could command  the child was announced and considered in the family as miss ophelias girl and as she was looked upon with no gracious eye in the kitchen miss ophelia resolved to confine her sphere of operation and instruction chiefly to her own chamber with a selfsacrifice which some of our readers will appreciate she resolved instead of comfortably making her own bed sweeping and dusting her own chamberwhich she had hitherto done in utter scorn of all offers of help from the chambermaid of the establishmentto condemn herself to the martyrdom of instructing topsy to perform these operationsah woe the day did any of our readers ever do the same they will appreciate the amount of her selfsacrifice  miss ophelia began with topsy by taking her into her chamber the first morning and solemnly commencing a course of instruction in the art and mystery of bedmaking  behold then topsy washed and shorn of all the little braided tails wherein her heart had delighted arrayed in a clean gown with wellstarched apron standing reverently before miss ophelia with an expression of solemnity well befitting a funeral  now topsy im going to show you just how my bed is to be made i am very particular about my bed you must learn exactly how to do it  yes maam says topsy with a deep sigh and a face of woful earnestness  now topsy look herethis is the hem of the sheetthis is the right side of the sheet and this is the wrongwill you remember  yes maam says topsy with another sigh  well now the under sheet you must bring over the bolstersoand tuck it clear down under the mattress nice and smoothsodo you see  yes maam said topsy with profound attention  but the upper sheet said miss ophelia must be brought down in this way and tucked under firm and smooth at the footsothe narrow hem at the foot  yes maam said topsy as beforebut we will add what miss ophelia did not see that during the time when the good ladys back was turned in the zeal of her manipulations the young disciple had contrived to snatch a pair of gloves and a ribbon which she had adroitly slipped into her sleeves and stood with her hands dutifully folded as before  now topsy lets see you do this said miss ophelia pulling off the clothes and seating herself  topsy with great gravity and adroitness went through the exercise completely to miss ophelias satisfaction smoothing the sheets patting out every wrinkle and exhibiting through the whole process a gravity and seriousness with which her instructress was greatly edified by an unlucky slip however a fluttering fragment of the ribbon hung out of one of her sleeves just as she was finishing and caught miss ophelias attention instantly she pounced upon it whats this you naughty wicked childyouve been stealing this  the ribbon was pulled out of topsys own sleeve yet was she not in the least disconcerted she only looked at it with an air of the most surprised and unconscious innocence  laws why that ars miss feelys ribbon ant it how could it a got caught in my sleeve  topsy you naughty girl dont you tell me a lieyou stole that ribbon  missis i declar for t i didntnever seed it till dis yer blessed minnit  topsy said miss ophelia dont you now its wicked to tell lies  i never tell no lies miss feely said topsy with virtuous gravity its jist the truth ive been a tellin now and ant nothin else  topsy i shall have to whip you if you tell lies so  laws missis if yous to whip all day couldnt say no other way said topsy beginning to blubber i never seed dat arit must a got caught in my sleeve miss feeley must have left it on the bed and it got caught in the clothes and so got in my sleeve  miss ophelia was so indignant at the barefaced lie that she caught the child and shook her  dont you tell me that again  the shake brought the glove on to the floor from the other sleeve  there you said miss ophelia will you tell me now you didnt steal the ribbon  topsy now confessed to the gloves but still persisted in denying the ribbon  now topsy said miss ophelia if youll confess all about it i wont whip you this time thus adjured topsy confessed to the ribbon and gloves with woful protestations of penitence  well now tell me i know you must have taken other things since you have been in the house for i let you run about all day yesterday now tell me if you took anything and i shant whip you  laws missis i took miss evas red thing she wars on her neck  you did you naughty childwell what else  i took rosas yerringsthem red ones  go bring them to me this minute both of em  laws missis i cantthey s burnt up  burnt upwhat a story go get em or ill whip you  topsy with loud protestations and tears and groans declared that she could not they s burnt upthey was  what did you burn em for said miss ophelia  cause i s wickedi is i s mighty wicked any how i cant help it  just at this moment eva came innocently into the room with the identical coral necklace on her neck  why eva where did you get your necklace said miss ophelia  get it why ive had it on all day said eva  did you have it on yesterday  yes and what is funny aunty i had it on all night i forgot to take it off when i went to bed  miss ophelia looked perfectly bewildered the more so as rosa at that instant came into the room with a basket of newlyironed linen poised on her head and the coral eardrops shaking in her ears  im sure i cant tell anything what to do with such a child she said in despair what in the world did you tell me you took those things for topsy  why missis said i must fess and i couldnt think of nothin else to fess said topsy rubbing her eyes  but of course i didnt want you to confess things you didnt do said miss ophelia thats telling a lie just as much as the other  laws now is it said topsy with an air of innocent wonder  la there ant any such thing as truth in that limb said rosa looking indignantly at topsy if i was masr st clare id whip her till the blood run i wouldid let her catch it  no no rosa said eva with an air of command which the child could assume at times you mustnt talk so rosa i cant bear to hear it  la sakes miss eva you s so good you dont know nothing how to get along with niggers theres no way but to cut em well up i tell ye  rosa said eva hush dont you say another word of that sort and the eye of the child flashed and her cheek deepened its color  rosa was cowed in a moment  miss eva has got the st clare blood in her thats plain she can speak for all the world just like her papa she said as she passed out of the room  eva stood looking at topsy  there stood the two children representatives of the two extremes of society the fair highbred child with her golden head her deep eyes her spiritual noble brow and princelike movements and her black keen subtle cringing yet acute neighbor they stood the representatives of their races the saxon born of ages of cultivation command education physical and moral eminence the afric born of ages of oppression submission ignorance toil and vice  something perhaps of such thoughts struggled through evas mind but a childs thoughts are rather dim undefined instincts and in evas noble nature many such were yearning and working for which she had no power of utterance when miss ophelia expatiated on topsys naughty wicked conduct the child looked perplexed and sorrowful but said sweetly  poor topsy why need you steal youre going to be taken good care of now im sure id rather give you anything of mine than have you steal it  it was the first word of kindness the child had ever heard in her life and the sweet tone and manner struck strangely on the wild rude heart and a sparkle of something like a tear shone in the keen round glittering eye but it was followed by the short laugh and habitual grin no the ear that has never heard anything but abuse is strangely incredulous of anything so heavenly as kindness and topsy only thought evas speech something funny and inexplicableshe did not believe it  but what was to be done with topsy miss ophelia found the case a puzzler her rules for bringing up didnt seem to apply she thought she would take time to think of it and by the way of gaining time and in hopes of some indefinite moral virtues supposed to be inherent in dark closets miss ophelia shut topsy up in one till she had arranged her ideas further on the subject  i dont see said miss ophelia to st clare how im going to manage that child without whipping her  well whip her then to your hearts content ill give you full power to do what you like  children always have to be whipped said miss ophelia i never heard of bringing them up without  o well certainly said st clare do as you think best only ill make one suggestion ive seen this child whipped with a poker knocked down with the shovel or tongs whichever came handiest c and seeing that she is used to that style of operation i think your whippings will have to be pretty energetic to make much impression  what is to be done with her then said miss ophelia  you have started a serious question said st clare i wish youd answer it what is to be done with a human being that can be governed only by the lashthat failsits a very common state of things down here  im sure i dont know i never saw such a child as this  such children are very common among us and such men and women too how are they to be governed said st clare  im sure its more than i can say said miss ophelia  or i either said st clare the horrid cruelties and outrages that once and a while find their way into the paperssuch cases as prues for examplewhat do they come from in many cases it is a gradual hardening process on both sidesthe owner growing more and more cruel as the servant more and more callous whipping and abuse are like laudanum you have to double the dose as the sensibilities decline i saw this very early when i became an owner and i resolved never to begin because i did not know when i should stopand i resolved at least to protect my own moral nature the consequence is that my servants act like spoiled children but i think that better than for us both to be brutalized together you have talked a great deal about our responsibilities in educating cousin i really wanted you to try with one child who is a specimen of thousands among us  it is your system makes such children said miss ophelia  i know it but they are madethey existand what is to be done with them  well i cant say i thank you for the experiment but then as it appears to be a duty i shall persevere and try and do the best i can said miss ophelia and miss ophelia after this did labor with a commendable degree of zeal and energy on her new subject she instituted regular hours and employments for her and undertook to teach her to read and sew  in the former art the child was quick enough she learned her letters as if by magic and was very soon able to read plain reading but the sewing was a more difficult matter the creature was as lithe as a cat and as active as a monkey and the confinement of sewing was her abomination so she broke her needles threw them slyly out of the window or down in chinks of the walls she tangled broke and dirtied her thread or with a sly movement would throw a spool away altogether her motions were almost as quick as those of a practised conjurer and her command of her face quite as great and though miss ophelia could not help feeling that so many accidents could not possibly happen in succession yet she could not without a watchfulness which would leave her no time for anything else detect her  topsy was soon a noted character in the establishment her talent for every species of drollery grimace and mimicryfor dancing tumbling climbing singing whistling imitating every sound that hit her fancyseemed inexhaustible in her playhours she invariably had every child in the establishment at her heels openmouthed with admiration and wondernot excepting miss eva who appeared to be fascinated by her wild diablerie as a dove is sometimes charmed by a glittering serpent miss ophelia was uneasy that eva should fancy topsys society so much and implored st clare to forbid it  poh let the child alone said st clare topsy will do her good  but so depraved a childare you not afraid she will teach her some mischief  she cant teach her mischief she might teach it to some children but evil rolls off evas mind like dew off a cabbageleafnot a drop sinks in  dont be too sure said miss ophelia i know id never let a child of mine play with topsy  well your children neednt said st clare but mine may if eva could have been spoiled it would have been done years ago  topsy was at first despised and contemned by the upper servants they soon found reason to alter their opinion it was very soon discovered that whoever cast an indignity on topsy was sure to meet with some inconvenient accident shortly aftereither a pair of earrings or some cherished trinket would be missing or an article of dress would be suddenly found utterly ruined or the person would stumble accidently into a pail of hot water or a libation of dirty slop would unaccountably deluge them from above when in full gala dressand on all these occasions when investigation was made there was nobody found to stand sponsor for the indignity topsy was cited and had up before all the domestic judicatories time and again but always sustained her examinations with most edifying innocence and gravity of appearance nobody in the world ever doubted who did the things but not a scrap of any direct evidence could be found to establish the suppositions and miss ophelia was too just to feel at liberty to proceed to any length without it  the mischiefs done were always so nicely timed also as further to shelter the aggressor thus the times for revenge on rosa and jane the two chamber maids were always chosen in those seasons when as not unfrequently happened they were in disgrace with their mistress when any complaint from them would of course meet with no sympathy in short topsy soon made the household understand the propriety of letting her alone and she was let alone accordingly  topsy was smart and energetic in all manual operations learning everything that was taught her with surprising quickness with a few lessons she had learned to do the proprieties of miss ophelias chamber in a way with which even that particular lady could find no fault mortal hands could not lay spread smoother adjust pillows more accurately sweep and dust and arrange more perfectly than topsy when she chosebut she didnt very often choose if miss ophelia after three or four days of careful patient supervision was so sanguine as to suppose that topsy had at last fallen into her way could do without overlooking and so go off and busy herself about something else topsy would hold a perfect carnival of confusion for some one or two hours instead of making the bed she would amuse herself with pulling off the pillowcases butting her woolly head among the pillows till it would sometimes be grotesquely ornamented with feathers sticking out in various directions she would climb the posts and hang head downward from the tops flourish the sheets and spreads all over the apartment dress the bolster up in miss ophelias nightclothes and enact various performances with thatsinging and whistling and making grimaces at herself in the lookingglass in short as miss ophelia phrased it raising cain generally  on one occasion miss ophelia found topsy with her very best scarlet india canton crape shawl wound round her head for a turban going on with her rehearsals before the glass in great stylemiss ophelia having with carelessness most unheardof in her left the key for once in her drawer  topsy she would say when at the end of all patience what does make you act so  dunno missisi spects cause i s so wicked  i dont know anything what i shall do with you topsy  law missis you must whip me my old missis allers whipped me i ant used to workin unless i gets whipped  why topsy i dont want to whip you you can do well if youve a mind to what is the reason you wont  laws missis i s used to whippin i spects its good for me  miss ophelia tried the recipe and topsy invariably made a terrible commotion screaming groaning and imploring though half an hour afterwards when roosted on some projection of the balcony and surrounded by a flock of admiring young uns she would express the utmost contempt of the whole affair  law miss feely whipwouldnt kill a skeeter her whippins oughter see how old masr made the flesh fly old masr knowd how  topsy always made great capital of her own sins and enormities evidently considering them as something peculiarly distinguishing  law you niggers she would say to some of her auditors does you know you s all sinners well you iseverybody is white folks is sinners toomiss feely says so but i spects niggers is the biggest ones but lor ye ant any on ye up to me i s so awful wicked there cant nobody do nothin with me i used to keep old missis a swarin at me half de time i spects i s the wickedest critter in the world and topsy would cut a summerset and come up brisk and shining on to a higher perch and evidently plume herself on the distinction  miss ophelia busied herself very earnestly on sundays teaching topsy the catechism topsy had an uncommon verbal memory and committed with a fluency that greatly encouraged her instructress  what good do you expect it is going to do her said st clare  why it always has done children good its what children always have to learn you know said miss ophelia  understand it or not said st clare  o children never understand it at the time but after they are grown up itll come to them  mine hasnt come to me yet said st clare though ill bear testimony that you put it into me pretty thoroughly when i was a boy  ah you were always good at learning augustine i used to have great hopes of you said miss ophelia  well havent you now said st clare  i wish you were as good as you were when you were a boy augustine  so do i thats a fact cousin said st clare well go ahead and catechize topsy may be youll make out something yet  topsy who had stood like a black statue during this discussion with hands decently folded now at a signal from miss ophelia went on  our first parents being left to the freedom of their own will fell from the state wherein they were created  topsys eyes twinkled and she looked inquiringly  what is it topsy said miss ophelia  please missis was dat ar state kintuck  what state topsy  dat state dey fell out of i used to hear masr tell how we came down from kintuck  st clare laughed  youll have to give her a meaning or shell make one said he there seems to be a theory of emigration suggested there  o augustine be still said miss ophelia how can i do anything if you will be laughing  well i wont disturb the exercises again on my honor and st clare took his paper into the parlor and sat down till topsy had finished her recitations they were all very well only that now and then she would oddly transpose some important words and persist in the mistake in spite of every effort to the contrary and st clare after all his promises of goodness took a wicked pleasure in these mistakes calling topsy to him whenever he had a mind to amuse himself and getting her to repeat the offending passages in spite of miss ophelias remonstrances  how do you think i can do anything with the child if you will go on so augustine she would say  well it is too badi wont again but i do like to hear the droll little image stumble over those big words  but you confirm her in the wrong way  whats the odds one word is as good as another to her  you wanted me to bring her up right and you ought to remember she is a reasonable creature and be careful of your influence over her  o dismal so i ought but as topsy herself says i s so wicked  in very much this way topsys training proceeded for a year or twomiss ophelia worrying herself from day to day with her as a kind of chronic plague to whose inflictions she became in time as accustomed as persons sometimes do to the neuralgia or sick headache  st clare took the same kind of amusement in the child that a man might in the tricks of a parrot or a pointer topsy whenever her sins brought her into disgrace in other quarters always took refuge behind his chair and st clare in one way or other would make peace for her from him she got many a stray picayune which she laid out in nuts and candies and distributed with careless generosity to all the children in the family for topsy to do her justice was goodnatured and liberal and only spiteful in selfdefence she is fairly introduced into our corps de ballet and will figure from time to time in her turn with other performers    chapter xxi  kentuck   our readers may not be unwilling to glance back for a brief interval at uncle toms cabin on the kentucky farm and see what has been transpiring among those whom he had left behind  it was late in the summer afternoon and the doors and windows of the large parlor all stood open to invite any stray breeze that might feel in a good humor to enter mr shelby sat in a large hall opening into the room and running through the whole length of the house to a balcony on either end leisurely tipped back on one chair with his heels in another he was enjoying his afterdinner cigar mrs shelby sat in the door busy about some fine sewing she seemed like one who had something on her mind which she was seeking an opportunity to introduce  do you know she said that chloe has had a letter from tom  ah has she tom s got some friend there it seems how is the old boy  he has been bought by a very fine family i should think said mrs shelbyis kindly treated and has not much to do  ah well im glad of itvery glad said mr shelby heartily tom i suppose will get reconciled to a southern residencehardly want to come up here again  on the contrary he inquires very anxiously said mrs shelby when the money for his redemption is to be raised  im sure i dont know said mr shelby once get business running wrong there does seem to be no end to it its like jumping from one bog to another all through a swamp borrow of one to pay another and then borrow of another to pay oneand these confounded notes falling due before a man has time to smoke a cigar and turn rounddunning letters and dunning messagesall scamper and hurryscurry  it does seem to me my dear that something might be done to straighten matters suppose we sell off all the horses and sell one of your farms and pay up square  o ridiculous emily you are the finest woman in kentucky but still you havent sense to know that you dont understand businesswomen never do and never can  but at least said mrs shelby could not you give me some little insight into yours a list of all your debts at least and of all that is owed to you and let me try and see if i cant help you to economize  o bother dont plague me emilyi cant tell exactly i know somewhere about what things are likely to be but theres no trimming and squaring my affairs as chloe trims crust off her pies you dont know anything about business i tell you  and mr shelby not knowing any other way of enforcing his ideas raised his voicea mode of arguing very convenient and convincing when a gentleman is discussing matters of business with his wife  mrs shelby ceased talking with something of a sigh the fact was that though her husband had stated she was a woman she had a clear energetic practical mind and a force of character every way superior to that of her husband so that it would not have been so very absurd a supposition to have allowed her capable of managing as mr shelby supposed her heart was set on performing her promise to tom and aunt chloe and she sighed as discouragements thickened around her  dont you think we might in some way contrive to raise that money poor aunt chloe her heart is so set on it  im sorry if it is i think i was premature in promising im not sure now but its the best way to tell chloe and let her make up her mind to it tomll have another wife in a year or two and she had better take up with somebody else  mr shelby i have taught my people that their marriages are as sacred as ours i never could think of giving chloe such advice  its a pity wife that you have burdened them with a morality above their condition and prospects i always thought so  its only the morality of the bible mr shelby  well well emily i dont pretend to interfere with your religious notions only they seem extremely unfitted for people in that condition  they are indeed said mrs shelby and that is why from my soul i hate the whole thing i tell you my dear i cannot absolve myself from the promises i make to these helpless creatures if i can get the money no other way i will take musicscholarsi could get enough i know and earn the money myself  you wouldnt degrade yourself that way emily i never could consent to it  degrade would it degrade me as much as to break my faith with the helpless no indeed  well you are always heroic and transcendental said mr shelby but i think you had better think before you undertake such a piece of quixotism  here the conversation was interrupted by the appearance of aunt chloe at the end of the verandah  if you please missis said she  well chloe what is it said her mistress rising and going to the end of the balcony  if missis would come and look at dis yer lot o poetry  chloe had a particular fancy for calling poultry poetryan application of language in which she always persisted notwithstanding frequent corrections and advisings from the young members of the family  la sakes she would say i cant see one jis good as turrypoetry suthin good any how and so poetry chloe continued to call it  mrs shelby smiled as she saw a prostrate lot of chickens and ducks over which chloe stood with a very grave face of consideration  im a thinkin whether missis would be a havin a chicken pie o dese yer  really aunt chloe i dont much careserve them any way you like  chloe stood handling them over abstractedly it was quite evident that the chickens were not what she was thinking of at last with the short laugh with which her tribe often introduce a doubtful proposal she said  laws me missis what should masr and missis be a troublin theirselves bout de money and not a usin whats right in der hands and chloe laughed again  i dont understand you chloe said mrs shelby nothing doubting from her knowledge of chloes manner that she had heard every word of the conversation

yes you may go and your wages shall every cent of them be laid aside for your husbands redemption  as when a bright sunbeam turns a dark cloud to silver so chloes dark face brightened immediatelyit

passes with us all a day at a time so it passed with our friend tom till two years were gone though parted from all his soul held dear and though often yearning for what lay beyond still was he never positively and consciously miserable for so well is the harp of human feeling strung that nothing but a crash that breaks every string can wholly mar its harmony and on looking back to seasons which in review appear to us as those of deprivation and trial we can remember that each hour as it glided brought its diversions and alleviations so that though not happy wholly we were not either wholly miserable  tom read in his only literary cabinet of one who had learned in whatsoever state he was therewith to be content it seemed to him good and reasonable doctrine and accorded well with the settled and thoughtful habit which he had acquired from the reading of that same book  his letter homeward as we related in the last chapter was in due time answered by master george in a good round schoolboy hand that tom said might be read most acrost the room it contained various refreshing items of home intelligence with which our reader is fully acquainted stated how aunt chloe had been hired out to a confectioner in louisville where her skill in the pastry line was gaining wonderful sums of money all of which tom was informed was to be laid up to go to make up the sum of his redemption money mose and pete were thriving and the baby was trotting all about the house under the care of sally and the family generally  toms cabin was shut up for the present but george expatiated brilliantly on ornaments and additions to be made to it when tom came back  the rest of this letter gave a list of georges school studies each one headed by a flourishing capital and also told the names of four new colts that appeared on the premises since tom left and stated in the same connection that father and mother were well the style of the letter was decidedly concise and terse but tom thought it the most wonderful specimen of composition that had appeared in modern times he was never tired of looking at it and even held a council with eva on the expediency of getting it framed to hang up in his room nothing but the difficulty of arranging it so that both sides of the page would show at once stood in the way of this undertaking  the friendship between tom and eva had grown with the childs growth it would be hard to say what place she held in the soft impressible heart of her faithful attendant he loved her as something frail and earthly yet almost worshipped her as something heavenly and divine he gazed on her as the italian sailor gazes on his image of the child jesuswith a mixture of reverence and tenderness and to humor her graceful fancies and meet those thousand simple wants which invest childhood like a manycolored rainbow was toms chief delight in the market at morning his eyes were always on the flowerstalls for rare bouquets for her and the choicest peach or orange was slipped into his pocket to give to her when he came back and the sight that pleased him most was her sunny head looking out the gate for his distant approach and her childish questionswell uncle tom what have you got for me today  nor was eva less zealous in kind offices in return though a child she was a beautiful readera fine musical ear a quick poetic fancy and an instinctive sympathy with whats grand and noble made her such a reader of the bible as tom had never before heard at first she read to please her humble friend but soon her own earnest nature threw out its tendrils and wound itself around the majestic book and eva loved it because it woke in her strange yearnings and strong dim emotions such as impassioned imaginative children love to feel  the parts that pleased her most were the revelations and the propheciesparts whose dim and wondrous imagery and fervent language impressed her the more that she questioned vainly of their meaningand she and her simple friend the old child and the young one felt just alike about it all that they knew was that they spoke of a glory to be revealeda wondrous something yet to come wherein their soul rejoiced yet knew not why and though it be not so in the physical yet in moral science that which cannot be understood is not always profitless for the soul awakes a trembling stranger between two dim eternitiesthe eternal past the eternal future the light shines only on a small space around her therefore she needs must yearn towards the unknown and the voices and shadowy movings which come to her from out the cloudy pillar of inspiration have each one echoes and answers in her own expecting nature its mystic imagery are so many talismans and gems inscribed with unknown hieroglyphics she folds them in her bosom and expects to read them when she passes beyond the veil  at this time in our story the whole st clare establishment is for the time being removed to their villa on lake pontchartrain the heats of summer had driven all who were able to leave the sultry and unhealthy city to seek the shores of the lake and its cool seabreezes  st clares villa was an east indian cottage surrounded by light verandahs of bamboowork and opening on all sides into gardens and pleasuregrounds the common sittingroom opened on to a large garden fragrant with every picturesque plant and flower of the tropics where winding paths ran down to the very shores of the lake whose silvery sheet of water lay there rising and falling in the sunbeamsa picture never for an hour the same yet every hour more beautiful  it is now one of those intensely golden sunsets which kindles the whole horizon into one blaze of glory and makes the water another sky the lake lay in rosy or golden streaks save where whitewinged vessels glided hither and thither like so many spirits and little golden stars twinkled through the glow and looked down at themselves as they trembled in the water  tom and eva were seated on a little mossy seat in an arbor at the foot of the garden it was sunday evening and evas bible lay open on her knee she readand i saw a sea of glass mingled with fire  tom said eva suddenly stopping and pointing to the lake there t is  what miss eva  dont you seethere said the child pointing to the glassy water which as it rose and fell reflected the golden glow of the sky theres a sea of glass mingled with fire  true enough miss eva said tom and tom sang       o had i the wings of the morning      id fly away to canaans shore      bright angels should convey me home      to the new jerusalem  where do you suppose new jerusalem is uncle tom said eva  o up in the clouds miss eva  then i think i see it said eva look in those cloudsthey look like great gates of pearl and you can see beyond themfar far offits all gold tom sing about spirits bright  tom sung the words of a wellknown methodist hymn       i see a band of spirits bright      that taste the glories there      they all are robed in spotless white      and conquering palms they bear  uncle tom ive seen them said eva  tom had no doubt of it at all it did not surprise him in the least if eva had told him she had been to heaven he would have thought it entirely probable  they come to me sometimes in my sleep those spirits and evas eyes grew dreamy and she hummed in a low voice       they are all robed in spotless white      and conquering palms they bear  uncle tom said eva im going there  where miss eva  the child rose and pointed her little hand to the sky the glow of evening lit her golden hair and flushed cheek with a kind of unearthly radiance and her eyes were bent earnestly on the skies  im going there she said to the spirits bright tom im going before long  the faithful old heart felt a sudden thrust and tom thought how often he had noticed within six months that evas little hands had grown thinner and her skin more transparent and her breath shorter and how when she ran or played in the garden as she once could for hours she became soon so tired and languid he had heard miss ophelia speak often of a cough that all her medicaments could not cure and even now that fervent cheek and little hand were burning with hectic fever and yet the thought that evas words suggested had never come to him till now  has there ever been a child like eva yes there have been but their names are always on gravestones and their sweet smiles their heavenly eyes their singular words and ways are among the buried treasures of yearning hearts in how many families do you hear the legend that all the goodness and graces of the living are nothing to the peculiar charms of one who is not it is as if heaven had an especial band of angels whose office it was to sojourn for a season here and endear to them the wayward human heart that they might bear it upward with them in their homeward flight when you see that deep spiritual light in the eyewhen the little soul reveals itself in words sweeter and wiser than the ordinary words of childrenhope not to retain that child for the seal of heaven is on it and the light of immortality looks out from its eyes  even so beloved eva fair star of thy dwelling thou art passing away but they that love thee dearest know it not  the colloquy between tom and eva was interrupted by a hasty call from miss ophelia  evaevawhy child the dew is falling you mustnt be out there  eva and tom hastened in  miss ophelia was old and skilled in the tactics of nursing she was from new england and knew well the first guileful footsteps of that soft insidious disease which sweeps away so many of the fairest and loveliest and before one fibre of life seems broken seals them irrevocably for death  she had noted the slight dry cough the daily brightening cheek nor could the lustre of the eye and the airy buoyancy born of fever deceive her  she tried to communicate her fears to st clare but he threw back her suggestions with a restless petulance unlike his usual careless goodhumor  dont be croaking cousini hate it he would say dont you see that the child is only growing children always lose strength when they grow fast  but she has that cough  o nonsense of that coughit is not anything she has taken a little cold perhaps  well that was just the way eliza jane was taken and ellen and maria sanders  o stop these hobgoblin nurse legends you old hands got so wise that a child cannot cough or sneeze but you see desperation and ruin at hand only take care of the child keep her from the night air and dont let her play too hard and shell do well enough  so st clare said but he grew nervous and restless he watched eva feverishly day by day as might be told by the frequency with which he repeated over that the child was quite wellthat there wasnt anything in that coughit was only some little stomach affection such as children often had but he kept by her more than before took her oftener to ride with him brought home every few days some receipt or strengthening mixturenot he said that the child needed it but then it would not do her any harm  if it must be told the thing that struck a deeper pang to his heart than anything else was the daily increasing maturity of the childs mind and feelings while still retaining all a childs fanciful graces yet she often dropped unconsciously words of such a reach of thought and strange unworldly wisdom that they seemed to be an inspiration at such times st clare would feel a sudden thrill and clasp her in his arms as if that fond clasp could save her and his heart rose up with wild determination to keep her never to let her go  the childs whole heart and soul seemed absorbed in works of love and kindness impulsively generous she had always been but there was a touching and womanly thoughtfulness about her now that every one noticed she still loved to play with topsy and the various colored children but she now seemed rather a spectator than an actor of their plays and she would sit for half an hour at a time laughing at the odd tricks of topsyand then a shadow would seem to pass across her face her eyes grew misty and her thoughts were afar  mamma she said suddenly to her mother one day why dont we teach our servants to read  what a question child people never do  why dont they said eva  because it is no use for them to read it dont help them to work any better and they are not made for anything else  but they ought to read the bible mamma to learn gods will  o they can get that read to them all they need  it seems to me mamma the bible is for every one to read themselves they need it a great many times when there is nobody to read it  eva you are an odd child said her mother  miss ophelia has taught topsy to read continued eva  yes and you see how much good it does topsy is the worst creature i ever saw  heres poor mammy said eva she does love the bible so much and wishes so she could read and what will she do when i cant read to her  marie was busy turning over the contents of a drawer as she answered  well of course by and by eva you will have other things to think of besides reading the bible round to servants not but that is very proper ive done it myself when i had health but when you come to be dressing and going into company you wont have time see here she added these jewels im going to give you when you come out i wore them to my first ball i can tell you eva i made a sensation  eva took the jewelcase and lifted from it a diamond necklace her large thoughtful eyes rested on them but it was plain her thoughts were elsewhere  how sober you look child said marie  are these worth a great deal of money mamma  to be sure they are father sent to france for them they are worth a small fortune  i wish i had them said eva to do what i pleased with  what would you do with them  id sell them and buy a place in the free states and take all our people there and hire teachers to teach them to read and write  eva was cut short by her mothers laughing  set up a boardingschool wouldnt you teach them to play on the piano and paint on velvet  id teach them to read their own bible and write their own letters and read letters that are written to them said eva steadily i know mamma it does come very hard on them that they cant do these things tom feels itmammy doesa great many of them do i think its wrong  come come eva you are only a child you dont know anything about these things said marie besides your talking makes my head ache  marie always had a headache on hand for any conversation that did not exactly suit her  eva stole away but after that she assiduously gave mammy reading lessons    chapter xxiii  henrique   about this time st clares brother alfred with his eldest son a boy of twelve spent a day or two with the family at the lake  no sight could be more singular and beautiful than that of these twin brothers nature instead of instituting resemblances between them had made them opposites on every point yet a mysterious tie seemed to unite them in a closer friendship than ordinary  they used to saunter arm in arm up and down the alleys and walks of the garden augustine with his blue eyes and golden hair his ethereally flexible form and vivacious features and alfred darkeyed with haughty roman profile firmlyknit limbs and decided bearing they were always abusing each others opinions and practices and yet never a whit the less absorbed in each others society in fact the very contrariety seemed to unite them like the attraction between opposite poles of the magnet  henrique the eldest son of alfred was a noble darkeyed princely boy full of vivacity and spirit and from the first moment of introduction seemed to be perfectly fascinated by the spirituelle graces of his cousin evangeline  eva had a little pet pony of a snowy whiteness it was easy as a cradle and as gentle as its little mistress and this pony was now brought up to the back verandah by tom while a little mulatto boy of about thirteen led along a small black arabian which had just been imported at a great expense for henrique  henrique had a boys pride in his new possession and as he advanced and took the reins out of the hands of his little groom he looked carefully over him and his brow darkened  whats this dodo you little lazy dog you havent rubbed my horse down this morning  yes masr said dodo submissively he got that dust on his own self  you rascal shut your mouth said henrique violently raising his ridingwhip how dare you speak  the boy was a handsome brighteyed mulatto of just henriques size and his curling hair hung round a high bold forehead he had white blood in his veins as could be seen by the quick flush in his cheek and the sparkle of his eye as he eagerly tried to speak  masr henrique he began  henrique struck him across the face with his ridingwhip and seizing one of his arms forced him on to his knees and beat him till he was out of breath  there you impudent dog now will you learn not to answer back when i speak to you take the horse back and clean him properly ill teach you your place  young masr said tom i specs what he was gwine to say was that the horse would roll when he was bringing him up from the stable hes so full of spiritsthats the way he got that dirt on him i looked to his cleaning  you hold your tongue till youre asked to speak said henrique turning on his heel and walking up the steps to speak to eva who stood in her ridingdress  dear cousin im sorry this stupid fellow has kept you waiting he said lets sit down here on this seat till they come whats the matter cousinyou look sober  how could you be so cruel and wicked to poor dodo asked eva  cruelwicked said the boy with unaffected surprise what do you mean dear eva  i dont want you to call me dear eva when you do so said eva  dear cousin you dont know dodo its the only way to manage him hes so full of lies and excuses the only way is to put him down at oncenot let him open his mouth thats the way papa manages  but uncle tom said it was an accident and he never tells what isnt true  hes an uncommon old nigger then said henrique dodo will lie as fast as he can speak  you frighten him into deceiving if you treat him so  why eva youve really taken such a fancy to dodo that i shall be jealous  but you beat himand he didnt deserve it  o well it may go for some time when he does and dont get it a few cuts never come amiss with dodohes a regular spirit i can tell you but i wont beat him again before you if it troubles you  eva was not satisfied but found it in vain to try to make her handsome cousin understand her feelings  dodo soon appeared with the horses  well dodo youve done pretty well this time said his young master with a more gracious air come now and hold miss evas horse while i put her on to the saddle  dodo came and stood by evas pony his face was troubled his eyes looked as if he had been crying  henrique who valued himself on his gentlemanly adroitness in all matters of gallantry soon had his fair cousin in the saddle and gathering the reins placed them in her hands  but eva bent to the other side of the horse where dodo was standing and said as he relinquished the reinsthats a good boy dodothank you  dodo looked up in amazement into the sweet young face the blood rushed to his cheeks and the tears to his eyes  here dodo said his master imperiously  dodo sprang and held the horse while his master mounted  theres a picayune for you to buy candy with dodo said henrique go get some  and henrique cantered down the walk after eva dodo stood looking after the two children one had given him money and one had given him what he wanted far morea kind word kindly spoken dodo had been only a few months away from his mother his master had bought him at a slave warehouse for his handsome face to be a match to the handsome pony and he was now getting his breaking in at the hands of his young master  the scene of the beating had been witnessed by the two brothers st clare from another part of the garden  augustines cheek flushed but he only observed with his usual sarcastic carelessness  i suppose thats what we may call republican education alfred  henrique is a devil of a fellow when his bloods up said alfred carelessly  i suppose you consider this an instructive practice for him said augustine drily  i couldnt help it if i didnt henrique is a regular little tempesthis mother and i have given him up long ago but then that dodo is a perfect spriteno amount of whipping can hurt him  and this by way of teaching henrique the first verse of a republicans catechism all men are born free and equal  poh said alfred one of tom jeffersons pieces of french sentiment and humbug its perfectly ridiculous to have that going the rounds among us to this day  i think it is said st clare significantly  because said alfred we can see plainly enough that all men are not born free nor born equal they are born anything else for my part i think half this republican talk sheer humbug it is the educated the intelligent the wealthy the refined who ought to have equal rights and not the canaille  if you can keep the canaille of that opinion said augustine they took their turn once in france  of course they must be kept down consistently steadily as i should said alfred setting his foot hard down as if he were standing on somebody  it makes a terrible slip when they get up said augustinein st domingo for instance  poh said alfred well take care of that in this country we must set our face against all this educating elevating talk that is getting about now the lower class must not be educated  that is past praying for said augustine educated they will be and we have only to say how our system is educating them in barbarism and brutality we are breaking all humanizing ties and making them brute beasts and if they get the upper hand such we shall find them  they shall never get the upper hand said alfred  thats right said st clare put on the steam fasten down the escapevalve and sit on it and see where youll land  well said alfred we will see im not afraid to sit on the escapevalve as long as the boilers are strong and the machinery works well  the nobles in louis xvis time thought just so and austria and pius ix think so now and some pleasant morning you may all be caught up to meet each other in the air when the boilers burst  dies declarabit said alfred laughing  i tell you said augustine if there is anything that is revealed with the strength of a divine law in our times it is that the masses are to rise and the under class become the upper one  thats one of your red republican humbugs augustine why didnt you ever take to the stumpyoud make a famous stump orator well i hope i shall be dead before this millennium of your greasy masses comes on  greasy or not greasy they will govern you when their time comes said augustine and they will be just such rulers as you make them the french noblesse chose to have the people sans culottes and they had sans culotte governors to their hearts content the people of hayti  o come augustine as if we hadnt had enough of that abominable contemptible hayti the haytiens were not anglo saxons if they had been there would have been another story the anglo saxon is the dominant race of the world and is to be so        in august 1791 as a consequence of the french revolution      the black slaves and mulattoes on haiti rose in revolt      against the whites and in the period of turmoil that      followed enormous cruelties were practised by both sides      the emperor dessalines come to power in 1804 massacred      all the whites on the island  haitian bloodshed became an      argument to show the barbarous nature of the negro a      doctrine wendell phillips sought to combat in his celebrated      lecture on toussaint louverture  well there is a pretty fair infusion of anglo saxon blood among our slaves now said augustine there are plenty among them who have only enough of the african to give a sort of tropical warmth and fervor to our calculating firmness and foresight if ever the san domingo hour comes anglo saxon blood will lead on the day sons of white fathers with all our haughty feelings burning in their veins will not always be bought and sold and traded they will rise and raise with them their mothers race  stuffnonsense  well said augustine there goes an old saying to this effect as it was in the days of noah so shall it bethey ate they drank they planted they builded and knew not till the flood came and took them  on the whole augustine i think your talents might do for a circuit rider said alfred laughing never you fear for us possession is our nine points weve got the power this subject race said he stamping firmly is down and shall stay down we have energy enough to manage our own powder  sons trained like your henrique will be grand guardians of your powdermagazines said augustineso cool and selfpossessed the proverb says they that cannot govern themselves cannot govern others  there is a trouble there said alfred thoughtfully theres no doubt that our system is a difficult one to train children under it gives too free scope to the passions altogether which in our climate are hot enough i find trouble with henrique the boy is generous and warmhearted but a perfect firecracker when excited i believe i shall send him north for his education where obedience is more fashionable and where he will associate more with equals and less with dependents  since training children is the staple work of the human race said augustine i should think it something of a consideration that our system does not work well there  it does not for some things said alfred for others again it does it makes boys manly and courageous and the very vices of an abject race tend to strengthen in them the opposite virtues i think henrique now has a keener sense of the beauty of truth from seeing lying and deception the universal badge of slavery  a christianlike view of the subject certainly said augustine  its true christianlike or not and is about as christianlike as most other things in the world said alfred  that may be said st clare  well theres no use in talking augustine i believe weve been round and round this old track five hundred times more or less what do you say to a game of backgammon  the two brothers ran up the verandah steps and were soon seated at a light bamboo stand with the backgammonboard between them as they were setting their men alfred said  i tell you augustine if i thought as you do i should do something  i dare say you wouldyou are one of the doing sortbut what  why elevate your own servants for a specimen said alfred with a halfscornful smile  you might as well set mount Ætna on them flat and tell them to stand up under it as tell me to elevate my servants under all the superincumbent mass of society upon them one man can do nothing against the whole action of a community education to do anything must be a state education or there must be enough agreed in it to make a current  you take the first throw said alfred and the brothers were soon lost in the game and heard no more till the scraping of horses feet was heard under the verandah  there come the children said augustine rising look here alf did you ever see anything so beautiful and in truth it was a beautiful sight henrique with his bold brow and dark glossy curls and glowing cheek was laughing gayly as he bent towards his fair cousin as they came on she was dressed in a blue riding dress with a cap of the same color exercise had given a brilliant hue to her cheeks and heightened the effect of her singularly transparent skin and golden hair  good heavens what perfectly dazzling beauty said alfred i tell you auguste wont she make some hearts ache one of these days  she will too trulygod knows im afraid so said st clare in a tone of sudden bitterness as he hurried down to take her off her horse  eva darling youre not much tired he said as he clasped her in his arms  no papa said the child but her short hard breathing alarmed her father  how could you ride so fast dearyou know its bad for you  i felt so well papa and liked it so much i forgot  st clare carried her in his arms into the parlor and laid her on the sofa  henrique you must be careful of eva said he you mustnt ride fast with her  ill take her under my care said henrique seating himself by the sofa and taking evas hand  eva soon found herself much better her father and uncle resumed their game and the children were left together  do you know eva im sorry papa is only going to stay two days here and then i shant see you again for ever so long if i stay with you id try to be good and not be cross to dodo and so on i dont mean to treat dodo ill but you know ive got such a quick temper im not really bad to him though i give him a picayune now and then and you see he dresses well i think on the whole dodo s pretty well off  would you think you were well off if there were not one creature in the world near you to love you  iwell of course not  and you have taken dodo away from all the friends he ever had and now he has not a creature to love himnobody can be good that way  well i cant help it as i know of i cant get his mother and i cant love him myself nor anybody else as i know of  why cant you said eva  love dodo why eva you wouldnt have me i may like him well enough but you dont love your servants  i do indeed  how odd  dont the bible say we must love everybody  o the bible to be sure it says a great many such things but then nobody ever thinks of doing themyou know eva nobody does  eva did not speak her eyes were fixed and thoughtful for a few moments  at any rate she said dear cousin do love poor dodo and be kind to him for my sake  i could love anything for your sake dear cousin for i really think you are the loveliest creature that i ever saw and henrique spoke with an earnestness that flushed his handsome face eva received it with perfect simplicity without even a change of feature merely saying im glad you feel so dear henrique i hope you will remember  the dinnerbell put an end to the interview    chapter xxiv  foreshadowings   two days after this alfred st clare and augustine parted and eva who had been stimulated by the society of her young cousin to exertions beyond her strength began to fail rapidly st clare was at last willing to call in medical advicea thing from which he had always shrunk because it was the admission of an unwelcome truth  but for a day or two eva was so unwell as to be confined to the house and the doctor was called  marie st clare had taken no notice of the childs gradually decaying health and strength because she was completely absorbed in studying out two or three new forms of disease to which she believed she herself was a victim it was the first principle of maries belief that nobody ever was or could be so great a sufferer as herself and therefore she always repelled quite indignantly any suggestion that any one around her could be sick she was always sure in such a case that it was nothing but laziness or want of energy and that if they had had the suffering she had they would soon know the difference  miss ophelia had several times tried to awaken her maternal fears about eva but to no avail  i dont see as anything ails the child she would say she runs about and plays  but she has a cough  cough you dont need to tell me about a cough ive always been subject to a cough all my days when i was of evas age they thought i was in a consumption night after night mammy used to sit up with me o evas cough is not anything  but she gets weak and is shortbreathed  law ive had that years and years its only a nervous affection  but she sweats so nights  well i have these ten years very often night after night my clothes will be wringing wet there wont be a dry thread in my nightclothes and the sheets will be so that mammy has to hang them up to dry eva doesnt sweat anything like that  miss ophelia shut her mouth for a season but now that eva was fairly and visibly prostrated and a doctor called marie all on a sudden took a new turn  she knew it she said she always felt it that she was destined to be the most miserable of mothers here she was with her wretched health and her only darling child going down to the grave before her eyesand marie routed up mammy nights and rumpussed and scolded with more energy than ever all day on the strength of this new misery  my dear marie dont talk so said st clare you ought not to give up the case so at once  you have not a mothers feelings st clare you never could understand meyou dont now  but dont talk so as if it were a gone case  i cant take it as indifferently as you can st clare if you dont feel when your only child is in this alarming state i do its a blow too much for me with all i was bearing before  its true said st clare that eva is very delicate that i always knew and that she has grown so rapidly as to exhaust her strength and that her situation is critical but just now she is only prostrated by the heat of the weather and by the excitement of her cousins visit and the exertions she made the physician says there is room for hope  well of course if you can look on the bright side pray do its a mercy if people havent sensitive feelings in this world i am sure i wish i didnt feel as i do it only makes me completely wretched i wish i could be as easy as the rest of you  and the rest of them had good reason to breathe the same prayer for marie paraded her new misery as the reason and apology for all sorts of inflictions on every one about her every word that was spoken by anybody everything that was done or was not done everywhere was only a new proof that she was surrounded by hardhearted insensible beings who were unmindful of her peculiar sorrows poor eva heard some of these speeches and nearly cried her little eyes out in pity for her mamma and in sorrow that she should make her so much distress  in a week or two there was a great improvement of symptomsone of those deceitful lulls by which her inexorable disease so often beguiles the anxious heart even on the verge of the grave evas step was again in the gardenin the balconies she played and laughed againand her father in a transport declared that they should soon have her as hearty as anybody miss ophelia and the physician alone felt no encouragement from this illusive truce there was one other heart too that felt the same certainty and that was the little heart of eva what is it that sometimes speaks in the soul so calmly so clearly that its earthly time is short is it the secret instinct of decaying nature or the souls impulsive throb as immortality draws on be it what it may it rested in the heart of eva a calm sweet prophetic certainty that heaven was near calm as the light of sunset sweet as the bright stillness of autumn there her little heart reposed only troubled by sorrow for those who loved her so dearly  for the child though nursed so tenderly and though life was unfolding before her with every brightness that love and wealth could give had no regret for herself in dying  in that book which she and her simple old friend had read so much together she had seen and taken to her young heart the image of one who loved the little child and as she gazed and mused he had ceased to be an image and a picture of the distant past and come to be a living allsurrounding reality his love enfolded her childish heart with more than mortal tenderness and it was to him she said she was going and to his home  but her heart yearned with sad tenderness for all that she was to leave behind her father mostfor eva though she never distinctly thought so had an instinctive perception that she was more in his heart than any other she loved her mother because she was so loving a creature and all the selfishness that she had seen in her only saddened and perplexed her for she had a childs implicit trust that her mother could not do wrong there was something about her that eva never could make out and she always smoothed it over with thinking that after all it was mamma and she loved her very dearly indeed  she felt too for those fond faithful servants to whom she was as daylight and sunshine children do not usually generalize but eva was an uncommonly mature child and the things that she had witnessed of the evils of the system under which they were living had fallen one by one into the depths of her thoughtful pondering heart she had vague longings to do something for themto bless and save not only them but all in their conditionlongings that contrasted sadly with the feebleness of her little frame  uncle tom she said one day when she was reading to her friend i can understand why jesus wanted to die for us  why miss eva  because ive felt so too  what is it miss evai dont understand  i cant tell you but when i saw those poor creatures on the boat you know when you came up and isome had lost their mothers and some their husbands and some mothers cried for their little childrenand when i heard about poor prueoh wasnt that dreadfuland a great many other times ive felt that i would be glad to die if my dying could stop all this misery i would die for them tom if i could said the child earnestly laying her little thin hand on his  tom looked at the child with awe and when she hearing her fathers voice glided away he wiped his eyes many times as he looked after her  its jest no use tryin to keep miss eva here he said to mammy whom he met a moment after shes got the lords mark in her forehead  ah yes yes said mammy raising her hands ive allers said so she wasnt never like a child thats to livethere was allers something deep in her eyes ive told missis so many the time its a comin truewe all sees itdear little blessed lamb  eva came tripping up the verandah steps to her father it was late in the afternoon and the rays of the sun formed a kind of glory behind her as she came forward in her white dress with her golden hair and glowing cheeks her eyes unnaturally bright with the slow fever that burned in her veins  st clare had called her to show a statuette that he had been buying for her but her appearance as she came on impressed him suddenly and painfully there is a kind of beauty so intense yet so fragile that we cannot bear to look at it her father folded her suddenly in his arms and almost forgot what he was going to tell her  eva dear you are better nowadaysare you not  papa said eva with sudden firmness ive had things i wanted to say to you a great while i want to say them now before i get weaker  st clare trembled as eva seated herself in his lap she laid her head on his bosom and said  its all no use papa to keep it to myself any longer the time is coming that i am going to leave you i am going and never to come back and eva sobbed  o now my dear little eva said st clare trembling as he spoke but speaking cheerfully youve got nervous and lowspirited you mustnt indulge such gloomy thoughts see here ive bought a statuette for you  no papa said eva putting it gently away dont deceive yourselfi am not any better i know it perfectly welland i am going before long i am not nervousi am not lowspirited if it were not for you papa and my friends i should be perfectly happy i want to goi long to go  why dear child what has made your poor little heart so sad you have had everything to make you happy that could be given you  i had rather be in heaven though only for my friends sake i would be willing to live there are a great many things here that make me sad that seem dreadful to me i had rather be there but i dont want to leave youit almost breaks my heart  what makes you sad and seems dreadful eva  o things that are done and done all the time i feel sad for our poor people they love me dearly and they are all good and kind to me i wish papa they were all free  why eva child dont you think they are well enough off now  o but papa if anything should happen to you what would become of them there are very few men like you papa uncle alfred isnt like you and mamma isnt and then think of poor old prues owners what horrid things people do and can do and eva shuddered  my dear child you are too sensitive im sorry i ever let you hear such stories  o thats what troubles me papa you want me to live so happy and never to have any painnever suffer anythingnot even hear a sad story when other poor creatures have nothing but pain and sorrow all their livesit seems selfish i ought to know such things i ought to feel about them such things always sunk into my heart they went down deep ive thought and thought about them papa isnt there any way to have all slaves made free  thats a difficult question dearest theres no doubt that this way is a very bad one a great many people think so i do myself i heartily wish that there were not a slave in the land but then i dont know what is to be done about it  papa you are such a good man and so noble and kind and you always have a way of saying things that is so pleasant couldnt you go all round and try to persuade people to do right about this when i am dead papa then you will think of me and do it for my sake i would do it if i could  when you are dead eva said st clare passionately o child dont talk to me so you are all i have on earth  poor old prues child was all that she hadand yet she had to hear it crying and she couldnt help it papa these poor creatures love their children as much as you do me o do something for them theres poor mammy loves her children ive seen her cry when she talked about them and tom loves his children and its dreadful papa that such things are happening all the time  there there darling said st clare soothingly only dont distress yourself dont talk of dying and i will do anything you wish  and promise me dear father that tom shall have his freedom as soon asshe stopped and said in a hesitating tonei am gone  yes dear i will do anything in the worldanything you could ask me to  dear papa said the child laying her burning cheek against his how i wish we could go together  where dearest said st clare  to our saviours home its so sweet and peaceful thereit is all so loving there the child spoke unconsciously as of a place where she had often been dont you want to go papa she said  st clare drew her closer to him but was silent  you will come to me said the child speaking in a voice of calm certainty which she often used unconsciously  i shall come after you i shall not forget you  the shadows of the solemn evening closed round them deeper and deeper as st clare sat silently holding the little frail form to his bosom he saw no more the deep eyes but the voice came over him as a spirit voice and as in a sort of judgment vision his whole past life rose in a moment before his eyes his mothers prayers and hymns his own early yearnings and aspirings for good and between them and this hour years of worldliness and scepticism and what man calls respectable living we can think much very much in a moment st clare saw and felt many things but spoke nothing and as it grew darker he took his child to her bedroom and when she was prepared for rest he sent away the attendants and rocked her in his arms and sung to her till she was asleep    chapter xxv  the little evangelist  it was sunday afternoon st clare was stretched on a bamboo lounge in the verandah solacing himself with a cigar marie lay reclined on a sofa opposite the window opening on the verandah closely secluded under an awning of transparent gauze from the outrages of the mosquitos and languidly holding in her hand an elegantly bound prayerbook she was holding it because it was sunday and she imagined she had been reading itthough in fact she had been only taking a succession of short naps with it open in her hand  miss ophelia who after some rummaging had hunted up a small methodist meeting within riding distance had gone out with tom as driver to attend it and eva had accompanied them  i say augustine said marie after dozing a while i must send to the city after my old doctor posey im sure ive got the complaint of the heart  well why need you send for him this doctor that attends eva seems skilful  i would not trust him in a critical case said marie and i think i may say mine is becoming so ive been thinking of it these two or three nights past i have such distressing pains and such strange feelings  o marie you are blue i dont believe its heart complaint  i dare say you dont said marie i was prepared to expect that you can be alarmed enough if eva coughs or has the least thing the matter with her but you never think of me  if its particularly agreeable to you to have heart disease why ill try and maintain you have it said st clare i didnt know it was  well i only hope you wont be sorry for this when its too late said marie but believe it or not my distress about eva and the exertions i have made with that dear child have developed what i have long suspected  what the exertions were which marie referred to it would have been difficult to state st clare quietly made this commentary to himself and went on smoking like a hardhearted wretch of a man as he was till a carriage drove up before the verandah and eva and miss ophelia alighted  miss ophelia marched straight to her own chamber to put away her bonnet and shawl as was always her manner before she spoke a word on any subject while eva came at st clares call and was sitting on his knee giving him an account of the services they had heard  they soon heard loud exclamations from miss ophelias room which like the one in which they were sitting opened on to the verandah and violent reproof addressed to somebody  what new witchcraft has tops been brewing asked st clare that commotion is of her raising ill be bound  and in a moment after miss ophelia in high indignation came dragging the culprit along  come out here now she said i will tell your master  whats the case now asked augustine  the case is that i cannot be plagued with this child any longer its past all bearing flesh and blood cannot endure it here i locked her up and gave her a hymn to study and what does she do but spy out where i put my key and has gone to my bureau and got a bonnettrimming and cut it all to pieces to make dolls jackets i never saw anything like it in my life  i told you cousin said marie that youd find out that these creatures cant be brought up without severity if i had my way now she said looking reproachfully at st clare id send that child out and have her thoroughly whipped id have her whipped till she couldnt stand  i dont doubt it said st clare tell me of the lovely rule of woman i never saw above a dozen women that wouldnt half kill a horse or a servant either if they had their own way with themlet alone a man  there is no use in this shillyshally way of yours st clare said marie cousin is a woman of sense and she sees it now as plain as i do  miss ophelia had just the capability of indignation that belongs to the thoroughpaced housekeeper and this had been pretty actively roused by the artifice and wastefulness of the child in fact many of my lady readers must own that they should have felt just so in her circumstances but maries words went beyond her and she felt less heat  i wouldnt have the child treated so for the world she said but i am sure augustine i dont know what to do ive taught and taught ive talked till im tired ive whipped her ive punished her in every way i can think of and shes just what she was at first  come here tops you monkey said st clare calling the child up to him  topsy came up her round hard eyes glittering and blinking with a mixture of apprehensiveness and their usual odd drollery  what makes you behave so said st clare who could not help being amused with the childs expression  spects its my wicked heart said topsy demurely miss feely says so  dont you see how much miss ophelia has done for you she says she has done everything she can think of  lor yes masr old missis used to say so too she whipped me a heap harder and used to pull my har and knock my head agin the door but it didnt do me no good i spects if they s to pull every spire o har out o my head it wouldnt do no good neitheri s so wicked laws i s nothin but a nigger no ways  well i shall have to give her up said miss ophelia i cant have that trouble any longer  well id just like to ask one question said st clare  what is it  why if your gospel is not strong enough to save one heathen child that you can have at home here all to yourself whats the use of sending one or two poor missionaries off with it among thousands of just such i suppose this child is about a fair sample of what thousands of your heathen are  miss ophelia did not make an immediate answer and eva who had stood a silent spectator of the scene thus far made a silent sign to topsy to follow her there was a little glassroom at the corner of the verandah which st clare used as a sort of readingroom and eva and topsy disappeared into this place  whats eva going about now said st clare i mean to see  and advancing on tiptoe he lifted up a curtain that covered the glassdoor and looked in in a moment laying his finger on his lips he made a silent gesture to miss ophelia to come and look there sat the two children on the floor with their side faces towards them topsy with her usual air of careless drollery and unconcern but opposite to her eva her whole face fervent with feeling and tears in her large eyes  what does make you so bad topsy why wont you try and be good dont you love anybody topsy  donno nothing bout love i loves candy and sich thats all said topsy  but you love your father and mother  never had none ye know i telled ye that miss eva  o i know said eva sadly but hadnt you any brother or sister or aunt or  no none on emnever had nothing nor nobody  but topsy if youd only try to be good you might  couldnt never be nothin but a nigger if i was ever so good said topsy if i could be skinned and come white id try then  but people can love you if you are black topsy miss ophelia would love you if you were good  topsy gave the short blunt laugh that was her common mode of expressing incredulity  dont you think so said eva  no she cant bar me cause im a niggershed s soon have a toad touch her there cant nobody love niggers and niggers cant do nothin i dont care said topsy beginning to whistle  o topsy poor child i love you said eva with a sudden burst of feeling and laying her little thin white hand on topsys shoulder i love you because you havent had any father or mother or friendsbecause youve been a poor abused child i love you and i want you to be good i am very unwell topsy and i think i shant live a great while and it really grieves me to have you be so naughty i wish you would try to be good for my sakeits only a little while i shall be with you  the round keen eyes of the black child were overcast with tearslarge bright drops rolled heavily down one by one and fell on the little white hand yes in that moment a ray of real belief a ray of heavenly love had penetrated the darkness of her heathen soul she laid her head down between her knees and wept and sobbedwhile the beautiful child bending over her looked like the picture of some bright angel stooping to reclaim a sinner  poor topsy said eva dont you know that jesus loves all alike he is just as willing to love you as me he loves you just as i doonly more because he is better he will help you to be good and you can go to heaven at last and be an angel forever just as much as if you were white only think of it topsyyou can be one of those spirits bright uncle tom sings about  o dear miss eva dear miss eva said the child i will try i will try i never did care nothin about it before  st clare at this instant dropped the curtain it puts me in mind of mother he said to miss ophelia it is true what she told me if we want to give sight to the blind we must be willing to do as christ didcall them to us and put our hands on them  ive always had a prejudice against negroes said miss ophelia and its a fact i never could bear to have that child touch me but i dont think she knew it  trust any child to find that out said st clare theres no keeping it from them but i believe that all the trying in the world to benefit a child and all the substantial favors you can do them will never excite one emotion of gratitude while that feeling of repugnance remains in the heartits a queer kind of a factbut so it is  i dont know how i can help it said miss ophelia they are disagreeable to methis child in particularhow can i help feeling so  eva does it seems  well shes so loving after all though shes no more than christlike said miss ophelia i wish i were like her she might teach me a lesson  it wouldnt be the first time a little child had been used to instruct an old disciple if it were so said st clare    chapter xxvi  death       weep not for those whom the veil of the tomb      in lifes early morning hath hid from our eyes         weep not for those a poem by thomas moore 17791852  evas bedroom was a spacious apartment which like all the other rooms in the house opened on to the broad verandah the room communicated on one side with her father and mothers apartment on the other with that appropriated to miss ophelia st clare had gratified his own eye and taste in furnishing this room in a style that had a peculiar keeping with the character of her for whom it was intended the windows were hung with curtains of rosecolored and white muslin the floor was spread with a matting which had been ordered in paris to a pattern of his own device having round it a border of rosebuds and leaves and a centrepiece with fullflown roses the bedstead chairs and lounges were of bamboo wrought in peculiarly graceful and fanciful patterns over the head of the bed was an alabaster bracket on which a beautiful sculptured angel stood with drooping wings holding out a crown of myrtleleaves from this depended over the bed light curtains of rosecolored gauze striped with silver supplying that protection from mosquitos which is an indispensable addition to all sleeping accommodation in that climate the graceful bamboo lounges were amply supplied with cushions of rosecolored damask while over them depending from the hands of sculptured figures were gauze curtains similar to those of the bed a light fanciful bamboo table stood in the middle of the room where a parian vase wrought in the shape of a white lily with its buds stood ever filled with flowers on this table lay evas books and little trinkets with an elegantly wrought alabaster writingstand which her father had supplied to her when he saw her trying to improve herself in writing there was a fireplace in the room and on the marble mantle above stood a beautifully wrought statuette of jesus receiving little children and on either side marble vases for which it was toms pride and delight to offer bouquets every morning two or three exquisite paintings of children in various attitudes embellished the wall in short the eye could turn nowhere without meeting images of childhood of beauty and of peace those little eyes never opened in the morning light without falling on something which suggested to the heart soothing and beautiful thoughts  the deceitful strength which had buoyed eva up for a little while was fast passing away seldom and more seldom her light footstep was heard in the verandah and oftener and oftener she was found reclined on a little lounge by the open window her large deep eyes fixed on the rising and falling waters of the lake  it was towards the middle of the afternoon as she was so recliningher bible half open her little transparent fingers lying listlessly between the leavessuddenly she heard her mothers voice in sharp tones in the verandah  what now you baggagewhat new piece of mischief youve been picking the flowers hey and eva heard the sound of a smart slap  law missis they s for miss eva she heard a voice say which she knew belonged to topsy  miss eva a pretty excuseyou suppose she wants your flowers you goodfornothing nigger get along off with you  in a moment eva was off from her lounge and in the verandah  o dont mother i should like the flowers do give them to me i want them  why eva your room is full now  i cant have too many said eva topsy do bring them here  topsy who had stood sullenly holding down her head now came up and offered her flowers she did it with a look of hesitation and bashfulness quite unlike the eldrich boldness and brightness which was usual with her  its a beautiful bouquet said eva looking at it  it was rather a singular onea brilliant scarlet geranium and one single white japonica with its glossy leaves it was tied up with an evident eye to the contrast of color and the arrangement of every leaf had carefully been studied  topsy looked pleased as eva saidtopsy you arrange flowers very prettily here she said is this vase i havent any flowers for i wish youd arrange something every day for it  well thats odd said marie what in the world do you want that for  never mind mamma youd as lief as not topsy should do ithad you not  of course anything you please dear topsy you hear your young mistresssee that you mind  topsy made a short courtesy and looked down and as she turned away eva saw a tear roll down her dark cheek  you see mamma i knew poor topsy wanted to do something for me said eva to her mother  o nonsense its only because she likes to do mischief she knows she mustnt pick flowersso she does it thats all there is to it but if you fancy to have her pluck them so be it  mamma i think topsy is different from what she used to be shes trying to be a good girl  shell have to try a good while before she gets to be good said marie with a careless laugh  well you know mamma poor topsy everything has always been against her  not since shes been here im sure if she hasnt been talked to and preached to and every earthly thing done that anybody could doand shes just so ugly and always will be you cant make anything of the creature  but mamma its so different to be brought up as ive been with so many friends so many things to make me good and happy and to be brought up as shes been all the time till she came here  most likely said marie yawningdear me how hot it is  mamma you believe dont you that topsy could become an angel as well as any of us if she were a christian  topsy what a ridiculous idea nobody but you would ever think of it i suppose she could though  but mamma isnt god her father as much as ours isnt jesus her saviour  well that may be i suppose god made everybody said marie where is my smellingbottle  its such a pityoh such a pity said eva looking out on the distant lake and speaking half to herself  whats a pity said marie  why that any one who could be a bright angel and live with angels should go all down down down and nobody help themoh dear  well we cant help it its no use worrying eva i dont know whats to be done we ought to be thankful for our own advantages  i hardly can be said eva im so sorry to think of poor folks that havent any  thats odd enough said marieim sure my religion makes me thankful for my advantages  mamma said eva i want to have some of my hair cut offa good deal of it  what for said marie  mamma i want to give some away to my friends while i am able to give it to them myself wont you ask aunty to come and cut it for me  marie raised her voice and called miss ophelia from the other room  the child half rose from her pillow as she came in and shaking down her long goldenbrown curls said rather playfully come aunty shear the sheep  whats that said st clare who just then entered with some fruit he had been out to get for her  papa i just want aunty to cut off some of my hairtheres too much of it and it makes my head hot besides i want to give some of it away  miss ophelia came with her scissors  take caredont spoil the looks of it said her father cut underneath where it wont show evas curls are my pride  o papa said eva sadly  yes and i want them kept handsome against the time i take you up to your uncles plantation to see cousin henrique said st clare in a gay tone  i shall never go there papai am going to a better country o do believe me dont you see papa that i get weaker every day  why do you insist that i shall believe such a cruel thing eva said her father  only because it is true papa and if you will believe it now perhaps you will get to feel about it as i do  st clare closed his lips and stood gloomily eying the long beautiful curls which as they were separated from the childs head were laid one by one in her lap she raised them up looked earnestly at them twined them around her thin fingers and looked from time to time anxiously at her father  its just what ive been foreboding said marie its just what has been preying on my health from day to day bringing me downward to the grave though nobody regards it i have seen this long st clare you will see after a while that i was right  which will afford you great consolation no doubt said st clare in a dry bitter tone  marie lay back on a lounge and covered her face with her cambric handkerchief  evas clear blue eye looked earnestly from one to the other it was the calm comprehending gaze of a soul half loosed from its earthly bonds it was evident she saw felt and appreciated the difference between the two  she beckoned with her hand to her father he came and sat down by her  papa my strength fades away every day and i know i must go there are some things i want to say and dothat i ought to do and you are so unwilling to have me speak a word on this subject but it must come theres no putting it off do be willing i should speak now  my child i am willing said st clare covering his eyes with one hand and holding up evas hand with the other  then i want to see all our people together i have some things i must say to them said eva  well said st clare in a tone of dry endurance  miss ophelia despatched a messenger and soon the whole of the servants were convened in the room  eva lay back on her pillows her hair hanging loosely about her face her crimson cheeks contrasting painfully with the intense whiteness of her complexion and the thin contour of her limbs and features and her large soullike eyes fixed earnestly on every one  the servants were struck with a sudden emotion the spiritual face the long locks of hair cut off and lying by her her fathers averted face and maries sobs struck at once upon the feelings of a sensitive and impressible race and as they came in they looked one on another sighed and shook their heads there was a deep silence like that of a funeral  eva raised herself and looked long and earnestly round at every one all looked sad and apprehensive many of the women hid their faces in their aprons  i sent for you all my dear friends said eva because i love you i love you all and i have something to say to you which i want you always to remember    i am going to leave you in a few more weeks you will see me no more  here the child was interrupted by bursts of groans sobs and lamentations which broke from all present and in which her slender voice was lost entirely she waited a moment and then speaking in a tone that checked the sobs of all she said  if you love me you must not interrupt me so listen to what i say i want to speak to you about your souls    many of you i am afraid are very careless you are thinking only about this world i want you to remember that there is a beautiful world where jesus is i am going there and you can go there it is for you as much as me but if you want to go there you must not live idle careless thoughtless lives you must be christians you must remember that each one of you can become angels and be angels forever    if you want to be christians jesus will help you you must pray to him you must read  the child checked herself looked piteously at them and said sorrowfully  o dear you cant readpoor souls and she hid her face in the pillow and sobbed while many a smothered sob from those she was addressing who were kneeling on the floor aroused her  never mind she said raising her face and smiling brightly through her tears i have prayed for you and i know jesus will help you even if you cant read try all to do the best you can pray every day ask him to help you and get the bible read to you whenever you can and i think i shall see you all in heaven  amen was the murmured response from the lips of tom and mammy and some of the elder ones who belonged to the methodist church the younger and more thoughtless ones for the time completely overcome were sobbing with their heads bowed upon their knees  i know said eva you all love me  yes oh yes indeed we do lord bless her was the involuntary answer of all  yes i know you do there isnt one of you that hasnt always been very kind to me and i want to give you something that when you look at you shall always remember me im going to give all of you a curl of my hair and when you look at it think that i loved you and am gone to heaven and that i want to see you all there  it is impossible to describe the scene as with tears and sobs they gathered round the little creature and took from her hands what seemed to them a last mark of her love they fell on their knees they sobbed and prayed and kissed the hem of her garment and the elder ones poured forth words of endearment mingled in prayers and blessings after the manner of their susceptible race  as each one took their gift miss ophelia who was apprehensive for the effect of all this excitement on her little patient signed to each one to pass out of the apartment  at last all were gone but tom and mammy  here uncle tom said eva is a beautiful one for you o i am so happy uncle tom to think i shall see you in heavenfor im sure i shall and mammydear good kind mammy she said fondly throwing her arms round her old nursei know youll be there too  o miss eva dont see how i can live without ye no how said the faithful creature pears like its just taking everything off the place to oncet and mammy gave way to a passion of grief  miss ophelia pushed her and tom gently from the apartment and thought they were all gone but as she turned topsy was standing there  where did you start up from she said suddenly  i was here said topsy wiping the tears from her eyes o miss eva ive been a bad girl but wont you give me one too  yes poor topsy to be sure i will thereevery time you look at that think that i love you and wanted you to be a good girl  o miss eva i is tryin said topsy earnestly but lor its so hard to be good pears like i ant used to it no ways  jesus knows it topsy he is sorry for you he will help you  topsy with her eyes hid in her apron was silently passed from the apartment by miss ophelia but as she went she hid the precious curl in her bosom  all being gone miss ophelia shut the door that worthy lady had wiped away many tears of her own during the scene but concern for the consequence of such an excitement to her young charge was uppermost in her mind  st clare had been sitting during the whole time with his hand shading his eyes in the same attitude  when they were all gone he sat so still  papa said eva gently laying her hand on his  he gave a sudden start and shiver but made no answer  dear papa said eva  i cannot said st clare rising i cannot have it so the almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me and st clare pronounced these words with a bitter emphasis indeed  augustine has not god a right to do what he will with his own said miss ophelia  perhaps so but that doesnt make it any easier to bear said he with a dry hard tearless manner as he turned away  papa you break my heart said eva rising and throwing herself into his arms you must not feel so and the child sobbed and wept with a violence which alarmed them all and turned her fathers thoughts at once to another channel  there evathere dearest hush hush i was wrong i was wicked i will feel any way do any wayonly dont distress yourself dont sob so i will be resigned i was wicked to speak as i did  eva soon lay like a wearied dove in her fathers arms and he bending over her soothed her by every tender word he could think of  marie rose and threw herself out of the apartment into her own when she fell into violent hysterics  you didnt give me a curl eva said her father smiling sadly  they are all yours papa said she smilingyours and mammas and you must give dear aunty as many as she wants i only gave them to our poor people myself because you know papa they might be forgotten when i am gone and because i hoped it might help them remember    you are a christian are you not papa said eva doubtfully  why do you ask me  i dont know you are so good i dont see how you can help it  what is being a christian eva  loving christ most of all said eva  do you eva  certainly i do  you never saw him said st clare  that makes no difference said eva i believe him and in a few days i shall see him and the young face grew fervent radiant with joy  st clare said no more it was a feeling which he had seen before in his mother but no chord within vibrated to it  eva after this declined rapidly there was no more any doubt of the event the fondest hope could not be blinded her beautiful room was avowedly a sick room and miss ophelia day and night performed the duties of a nurseand never did her friends appreciate her value more than in that capacity with so welltrained a hand and eye such perfect adroitness and practice in every art which could promote neatness and comfort and keep out of sight every disagreeable incident of sicknesswith such a perfect sense of time such a clear untroubled head such exact accuracy in remembering every prescription and direction of the doctorsshe was everything to him they who had shrugged their shoulders at her little peculiarities and setnesses so unlike the careless freedom of southern manners acknowledged that now she was the exact person that was wanted  uncle tom was much in evas room the child suffered much from nervous restlessness and it was a relief to her to be carried and it was toms greatest delight to carry her little frail form in his arms resting on a pillow now up and down her room now out into the verandah and when the fresh seabreezes blew from the lakeand the child felt freshest in the morninghe would sometimes walk with her under the orangetrees in the garden or sitting down in some of their old seats sing to her their favorite old hymns  her father often did the same thing but his frame was slighter and when he was weary eva would say to him  o papa let tom take me poor fellow it pleases him and you know its all he can do now and he wants to do something  so do i eva said her father  well papa you can do everything and are everything to me you read to meyou sit up nightsand tom has only this one thing and his singing and i know too he does it easier than you can he carries me so strong  the desire to do something was not confined to tom every servant in the establishment showed the same feeling and in their way did what they could  poor mammys heart yearned towards her darling but she found no opportunity night or day as marie declared that the state of her mind was such it was impossible for her to rest and of course it was against her principles to let any one else rest twenty times in a night mammy would be roused to rub her feet to bathe her head to find her pockethandkerchief to see what the noise was in evas room to let down a curtain because it was too light or to put it up because it was too dark and in the daytime when she longed to have some share in the nursing of her pet marie seemed unusually ingenious in keeping her busy anywhere and everywhere all over the house or about her own person so that stolen interviews and momentary glimpses were all she could obtain  i feel it my duty to be particularly careful of myself now she would say feeble as i am and with the whole care and nursing of that dear child upon me  indeed my dear said st clare i thought our cousin relieved you of that  you talk like a man st clarejust as if a mother could be relieved of the care of a child in that state but then its all alikeno one ever knows what i feel i cant throw things off as you do  st clare smiled you must excuse him he couldnt help itfor st clare could smile yet for so bright and placid was the farewell voyage of the little spiritby such sweet and fragrant breezes was the small bark borne towards the heavenly shoresthat it was impossible to realize that it was death that was approaching the child felt no painonly a tranquil soft weakness daily and almost insensibly increasing and she was so beautiful so loving so trustful so happy that one could not resist the soothing influence of that air of innocence and peace which seemed to breathe around her st clare found a strange calm coming over him it was not hopethat was impossible it was not resignation it was only a calm resting in the present which seemed so beautiful that he wished to think of no future it was like that hush of spirit which we feel amid the bright mild woods of autumn when the bright hectic flush is on the trees and the last lingering flowers by the brook and we joy in it all the more because we know that soon it will all pass away  the friend who knew most of evas own imaginings and foreshadowings was her faithful bearer tom to him she said what she would not disturb her father by saying to him she imparted those mysterious intimations which the soul feels as the cords begin to unbind ere it leaves its clay forever  tom at last would not sleep in his room but lay all night in the outer verandah ready to rouse at every call  uncle tom what alive have you taken to sleeping anywhere and everywhere like a dog for said miss ophelia i thought you was one of the orderly sort that liked to lie in bed in a christian way  i do miss feely said tom mysteriously i do but now  well what now  we mustnt speak loud masr st clare wont hear on t but miss feely you know there must be somebody watchin for

into the kingdom theyll open the door so wide well all get a look in at the glory miss feely  uncle tom did miss eva say she felt more unwell than usual tonight  no but she telled me this morning she was coming nearerthars them that tells it to the child miss feely its the angelsits the trumpet sound afore the break o day said tom quoting from a favorite hymn  this dialogue passed between miss ophelia and tom between ten and eleven one evening after her arrangements had all been made for the night when on going to bolt her outer door she found tom stretched along by it in the outer verandah  she was not nervous or impressible but the solemn heartfelt manner struck her eva had been unusually bright and cheerful that afternoon and had sat raised in her bed and looked over all her little trinkets and precious things and designated the friends to whom she would have them given and her manner was more animated and her voice more natural than they had known it for weeks her father had been in in the evening and had said that eva appeared more like her former self than ever she had done since her sickness and when he kissed her for the night he said to miss opheliacousin we may keep her with us after all she is certainly better and he had retired with a lighter heart in his bosom than he had had there for weeks  but at midnightstrange mystic hourwhen the veil between the frail present and the eternal future grows thinthen came the messenger  there was a sound in that chamber first of one who stepped quickly it was miss ophelia who had resolved to sit up all night with her little charge and who at the turn of the night had discerned what experienced nurses significantly call a change the outer door was quickly opened and tom who was watching outside was on the alert in a moment  go for the doctor tom lose not a moment said miss ophelia and stepping across the room she rapped at st clares door  cousin she said i wish you would come  those words fell on his heart like clods upon a coffin why did they he was up and in the room in an instant and bending over eva who still slept  what was it he saw that made his heart stand still why was no word spoken between the two thou canst say who hast seen that same expression on the face dearest to theethat look indescribable hopeless unmistakable that says to thee that thy beloved is no longer thine  on the face of the child however there was no ghastly imprintonly a high and almost sublime expressionthe overshadowing presence of spiritual natures the dawning of immortal life in that childish soul  they stood there so still gazing upon her that even the ticking of the watch seemed too loud in a few moments tom returned with the doctor he entered gave one look and stood silent as the rest  when did this change take place said he in a low whisper to miss ophelia  about the turn of the night was the reply  marie roused by the entrance of the doctor appeared hurriedly from the next room  augustine cousinowhat she hurriedly began  hush said st clare hoarsely she is dying  mammy heard the words and flew to awaken the servants the house was soon rousedlights were seen footsteps heard anxious faces thronged the verandah and looked tearfully through the glass doors but st clare heard and said nothinghe saw only that look on the face of the little sleeper  o if she would only wake and speak once more he said and stooping over her he spoke in her eareva darling  the large blue eyes uncloseda smile passed over her faceshe tried to raise her head and to speak  do you know me eva  dear papa said the child with a last effort throwing her arms about his neck in a moment they dropped again and as st clare raised his head he saw a spasm of mortal agony pass over the faceshe struggled for breath and threw up her little hands  o god this is dreadful he said turning away in agony and wringing toms hand scarce conscious what he was doing o tom my boy it is killing me  tom had his masters hands between his own and with tears streaming down his dark cheeks looked up for help where he had always been used to look  pray that this may be cut short said st clarethis wrings my heart  o bless the lord its overits over dear master said tom look at her  the child lay panting on her pillows as one exhaustedthe large clear eyes rolled up and fixed ah what said those eyes that spoke so much of heaven earth was pastand earthly pain but so solemn so mysterious was the triumphant brightness of that face that it checked even the sobs of sorrow they pressed around her in breathless stillness  eva said st clare gently  she did not hear  o eva tell us what you see what is it said her father  a bright a glorious smile passed over her face and she said brokenlyo lovejoypeace gave one sigh and passed from death unto life  farewell beloved child the bright eternal doors have closed after thee we shall see thy sweet face no more o woe for them who watched thy entrance into heaven when they shall wake and find only the cold gray sky of daily life and thou gone forever    chapter xxvii  this is the last of earth         this is the last of earth  i am content last words of      john quincy adams uttered february 21 1848  the statuettes and pictures in evas room were shrouded in white napkins and only hushed breathings and muffled footfalls were heard there and the light stole in solemnly through windows partially darkened by closed blinds  the bed was draped in white and there beneath the drooping angelfigure lay a little sleeping formsleeping never to waken  there she lay robed in one of the simple white dresses she had been wont to wear when living the rosecolored light through the curtains cast over the icy coldness of death a warm glow the heavy eyelashes drooped softly on the pure cheek the head was turned a little to one side as if in natural sleep but there was diffused over every lineament of the face that high celestial expression that mingling of rapture and repose which showed it was no earthly or temporary sleep but the long sacred rest which he giveth to his beloved  there is no death to such as thou dear eva neither darkness nor shadow of death only such a bright fading as when the morning star fades in the golden dawn thine is the victory without the battlethe crown without the conflict  so did st clare think as with folded arms he stood there gazing ah who shall say what he did think for from the hour that voices had said in the dying chamber she is gone it had been all a dreary mist a heavy dimness of anguish he had heard voices around him he had had questions asked and answered them they had asked him when he would have the funeral and where they should lay her and he had answered impatiently that he cared not  adolph and rosa had arranged the chamber volatile fickle and childish as they generally were they were softhearted and full of feeling and while miss ophelia presided over the general details of order and neatness it was their hands that added those soft poetic touches to the arrangements that took from the deathroom the grim and ghastly air which too often marks a new england funeral  there were still flowers on the shelvesall white delicate and fragrant with graceful drooping leaves evas little table covered with white bore on it her favorite vase with a single white moss rosebud in it the folds of the drapery the fall of the curtains had been arranged and rearranged by adolph and rosa with that nicety of eye which characterizes their race even now while st clare stood there thinking little rosa tripped softly into the chamber with a basket of white flowers she stepped back when she saw st clare and stopped respectfully but seeing that he did not observe her she came forward to place them around the dead st clare saw her as in a dream while she placed in the small hands a fair cape jessamine and with admirable taste disposed other flowers around the couch  the door opened again and topsy her eyes swelled with crying appeared holding something under her apron rosa made a quick forbidding gesture but she took a step into the room  you must go out said rosa in a sharp positive whisper you havent any business here  o do let me i brought a flowersuch a pretty one said topsy holding up a halfblown tea rosebud do let me put just one there  get along said rosa more decidedly  let her stay said st clare suddenly stamping his foot she shall come  rosa suddenly retreated and topsy came forward and laid her offering at the feet of the corpse then suddenly with a wild and bitter cry she threw herself on the floor alongside the bed and wept and moaned aloud  miss ophelia hastened into the room and tried to raise and silence her but in vain  o miss eva oh miss eva i wish i s dead tooi do  there was a piercing wildness in the cry the blood flushed into st clares white marblelike face and the first tears he had shed since eva died stood in his eyes  get up child said miss ophelia in a softened voice dont cry so miss eva is gone to heaven she is an angel  but i cant see her said topsy i never shall see her and she sobbed again  they all stood a moment in silence  she said she loved me said topsyshe did o dear oh dear there ant nobody left nowthere ant  thats true enough said st clare but do he said to miss ophelia see if you cant comfort the poor creature  i jist wish i hadnt never been born said topsy i didnt want to be born no ways and i dont see no use on t  miss ophelia raised her gently but firmly and took her from the room but as she did so some tears fell from her eyes  topsy you poor child she said as she led her into her room dont give up i can love you though i am not like that dear little child i hope ive learnt something of the love of christ from her i can love you i do and ill try to help you to grow up a good christian girl  miss ophelias voice was more than her words and more than that were the honest tears that fell down her face from that hour she acquired an influence over the mind of the destitute child that she never lost  o my eva whose little hour on earth did so much of good thought st clare what account have i to give for my long years  there were for a while soft whisperings and footfalls in the chamber as one after another stole in to look at the dead and then came the little coffin and then there was a funeral and carriages drove to the door and strangers came and were seated and there were white scarfs and ribbons and crape bands and mourners dressed in black crape and there were words read from the bible and prayers offered and st clare lived and walked and moved as one who has shed every tearto the last he saw only one thing that golden head in the coffin but then he saw the cloth spread over it the lid of the coffin closed and he walked when he was put beside the others down to a little place at the bottom of the garden and there by the mossy seat where she and tom had talked and sung and read so often was the little grave st clare stood beside itlooked vacantly down he saw them lower the little coffin he heard dimly the solemn words i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and as the earth was cast in and filled up the little grave he could not realize that it was his eva that they were hiding from his sight  nor was itnot eva but only the frail seed of that bright immortal form with which she shall yet come forth in the day of the lord jesus  and then all were gone and the mourners went back to the place which should know her no more and maries room was darkened and she lay on the bed sobbing and moaning in uncontrollable grief and calling every moment for the attentions of all her servants of course they had no time to crywhy should they the grief was her grief and she was fully convinced that nobody on earth did could or would feel it as she did  st clare did not shed a tear she said he didnt sympathize with her it was perfectly wonderful to think how hardhearted and unfeeling he was when he must know how she suffered  so much are people the slave of their eye and ear that many of the servants really thought that missis was the principal sufferer in the case especially as marie began to have hysterical spasms and sent for the doctor and at last declared herself dying and in the running and scampering and bringing up hot bottles and heating of flannels and chafing and fussing that ensued there was quite a diversion  tom however had a feeling at his own heart that drew him to his master he followed him wherever he walked wistfully and sadly and when he saw him sitting so pale and quiet in evas room holding before his eyes her little open bible though seeing no letter or word of what was in it there was more sorrow to tom in that still fixed tearless eye than in all maries moans and lamentations  in a few days the st clare family were back again in the city augustine with the restlessness of grief longing for another scene to change the current of his thoughts so they left the house and garden with its little grave and came back to new orleans and st clare walked the streets busily and strove to fill up the chasm in his heart with hurry and bustle and change of place and people who saw him in the street or met him at the cafe knew of his loss only by the weed on his hat for there he was smiling and talking and reading the newspaper and speculating on politics and attending to business matters and who could see that all this smiling outside was but a hollowed shell over a heart that was a dark and silent sepulchre  mr st clare is a singular man said marie to miss ophelia in a complaining tone i used to think if there was anything in the world he did love it was our dear little eva but he seems to be forgetting her very easily i cannot ever get him to talk about her i really did think he would show more feeling  still waters run deepest they used to tell me said miss ophelia oracularly  o i dont believe in such things its all talk if people have feeling they will show itthey cant help it but then its a great misfortune to have feeling id rather have been made like st clare my feelings prey upon me so  sure missis masr st clare is gettin thin as a shader they say he dont never eat nothin said mammy i know he dont forget miss eva i know there couldnt nobodydear little blessed cretur she added wiping her eyes  well at all events he has no consideration for me said marie he hasnt spoken one word of sympathy and he must know how much more a mother feels than any man can  the heart knoweth its own bitterness said miss ophelia gravely  thats just what i think i know just what i feelnobody else seems to eva used to but she is gone and marie lay back on her lounge and began to sob disconsolately  marie was one of those unfortunately constituted mortals in whose eyes whatever is lost and gone assumes a value which it never had in possession whatever she had she seemed to survey only to pick flaws in it but once fairly away there was no end to her valuation of it  while this conversation was taking place in the parlor another was going on in st clares library  tom who was always uneasily following his master about had seen him go to his library some hours before and after vainly waiting for him to come out determined at last to make an errand in he entered softly st clare lay on his lounge at the further end of the room he was lying on his face with evas bible open before him at a little distance tom walked up and stood by the sofa he hesitated and while he was hesitating st clare suddenly raised himself up the honest face so full of grief and with such an imploring expression of affection and sympathy struck his master he laid his hand on toms and bowed down his forehead on it  o tom my boy the whole world is as empty as an eggshell  i know it masri know it said tom but oh if masr could only look upup where our dear miss eva isup to the dear lord jesus  ah tom i do look up but the trouble is i dont see anything when i do i wish i could  tom sighed heavily  it seems to be given to children and poor honest fellows like you to see what we cant said st clare how comes it  thou has hid from the wise and prudent and revealed unto babes murmured tom even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight  tom i dont believei cant believeive got the habit of doubting said st clare i want to believe this bibleand i cant  dear masr pray to the good lordlord i believe help thou my unbelief  who knows anything about anything said st clare his eyes wandering dreamily and speaking to himself was all that beautiful love and faith only one of the evershifting phases of human feeling having nothing real to rest on passing away with the little breath and is there no more evano heavenno christnothing  o dear masr there is i know it im sure of it said tom falling on his knees do do dear masr believe it  how do you know theres any christ tom you never saw the lord  felt him in my soul masrfeel him now o masr when i was sold away from my old woman and the children i was jest amost broke up i felt as if there warnt nothin left and then the good lord he stood by me and he says fear not tom and he brings light and joy in a poor fellers soulmakes all peace and i s so happy and loves everybody and feels willin jest to be the lords and have the lords will done and be put jest where the lord wants to put me i know it couldnt come from me cause i s a poor complainin cretur it comes from the lord and i know hes willin to do for masr  tom spoke with fastrunning tears and choking voice st clare leaned his head on his shoulder and wrung the hard faithful black hand  tom you love me he said  i s willin to lay down my life this blessed day to see masr a christian  poor foolish boy said st clare halfraising himself im not worth the love of one good honest heart like yours  o masr deres more than me loves youthe blessed lord jesus loves you  how do you know that tom said st clare  feels it in my soul o masr the love of christ that passeth knowledge  singular said st clare turning away that the story of a man that lived and died eighteen hundred years ago can affect people so yet but he was no man he added suddenly no man ever had such long and living power o that i could believe what my mother taught me and pray as i did when i was a boy  if masr pleases said tom miss eva used to read this so beautifully i wish masrd be so good as read it dont get no readin hardly now miss evas gone  the chapter was the eleventh of johnthe touching account of the raising of lazarus st clare read it aloud often pausing to wrestle down feelings which were roused by the pathos of the story tom knelt before him with clasped hands and with an absorbed expression of love trust adoration on his quiet face  tom said his master this is all real to you  i can jest fairly see it masr said tom  i wish i had your eyes tom  i wish to the dear lord masr had  but tom you know that i have a great deal more knowledge than you what if i should tell you that i dont believe this bible  o masr said tom holding up his hands with a deprecating gesture  wouldnt it shake your faith some tom  not a grain said tom  why tom you must know i know the most  o masr havent you jest read how he hides from the wise and prudent and reveals unto babes but masr wasnt in earnest for sartin now said tom anxiously  no tom i was not i dont disbelieve and i think there is reason to believe and still i dont its a troublesome bad habit ive got tom  if masr would only pray  how do you know i dont tom  does masr  i would tom if there was anybody there when i pray but its all speaking unto nothing when i do but come tom you pray now and show me how  toms heart was full he poured it out in prayer like waters that have been long suppressed one thing was plain enough tom thought there was somebody to hear whether there were or not in fact st clare felt himself borne on the tide of his faith and feeling almost to the gates of that heaven he seemed so vividly to conceive it seemed to bring him nearer to eva  thank you my boy said st clare when tom rose i like to hear you tom but go now and leave me alone some other time ill talk more  tom silently left the room    chapter xxviii  reunion   week after week glided away in the st clare mansion and the waves of life settled back to their usual flow where that little bark had gone down for how imperiously how coolly in disregard of all ones feeling does the hard cold uninteresting course of daily realities move on still must we eat and drink and sleep and wake againstill bargain buy sell ask and answer questionspursue in short a thousand shadows though all interest in them be over the cold mechanical habit of living remaining after all vital interest in it has fled  all the interests and hopes of st clares life had unconsciously wound themselves around this child it was for eva that he had managed his property it was for eva that he had planned the disposal of his time and to do this and that for evato buy improve alter and arrange or dispose something for herhad been so long his habit that now she was gone there seemed nothing to be thought of and nothing to be done  true there was another lifea life which once believed in stands as a solemn significant figure before the otherwise unmeaning ciphers of time changing them to orders of mysterious untold value st clare knew this well and often in many a weary hour he heard that slender childish voice calling him to the skies and saw that little hand pointing to him the way of life but a heavy lethargy of sorrow lay on himhe could not arise he had one of those natures which could better and more clearly conceive of religious things from its own perceptions and instincts than many a matteroffact and practical christian the gift to appreciate and the sense to feel the finer shades and relations of moral things often seems an attribute of those whose whole life shows a careless disregard of them hence moore byron goethe often speak words more wisely descriptive of the true religious sentiment than another man whose whole life is governed by it in such minds disregard of religion is a more fearful treasona more deadly sin  st clare had never pretended to govern himself by any religious obligation and a certain fineness of nature gave him such an instinctive view of the extent of the requirements of christianity that he shrank by anticipation from what he felt would be the exactions of his own conscience if he once did resolve to assume them for so inconsistent is human nature especially in the ideal that not to undertake a thing at all seems better than to undertake and come short  still st clare was in many respects another man he read his little evas bible seriously and honestly he thought more soberly and practically of his relations to his servantsenough to make him extremely dissatisfied with both his past and present course and one thing he did soon after his return to new orleans and that was to commence the legal steps necessary to toms emancipation which was to be perfected as soon as he could get through the necessary formalities meantime he attached himself to tom more and more every day in all the wide world there was nothing that seemed to remind him so much of eva and he would insist on keeping him constantly about him and fastidious and unapproachable as he was with regard to his deeper feelings he almost thought aloud to tom nor would any one have wondered at it who had seen the expression of affection and devotion with which tom continually followed his young master  well tom said st clare the day after he had commenced the legal formalities for his enfranchisement im going to make a free man of youso have your trunk packed and get ready to set out for kentuck  the sudden light of joy that shone in toms face as he raised his hands to heaven his emphatic bless the lord rather discomposed st clare he did not like it that tom should be so ready to leave him  you havent had such very bad times here that you need be in such a rapture tom he said drily  no no masr tant thatits bein a freeman thats what im joyin for  why tom dont you think for your own part youve been better off than to be free  no indeed masr st clare said tom with a flash of energy no indeed  why tom you couldnt possibly have earned by your work such clothes and such living as i have given you  knows all that masr st clare masrs been too good but masr id rather have poor clothes poor house poor everything and have em mine than have the best and have em any mans elsei had so masr i think its natur masr  i suppose so tom and youll be going off and leaving me in a month or so he added rather discontentedly though why you shouldnt no mortal knows he said in a gayer tone and getting up he began to walk the floor  not while masr is in trouble said tom ill stay with masr as long as he wants meso as i can be any use  not while im in trouble tom said st clare looking sadly out of the window    and when will my trouble be over  when masr st clares a christian said tom  and you really mean to stay by till that day comes said st clare half smiling as he turned from the window and laid his hand on toms shoulder ah tom you soft silly boy i wont keep you till that day go home to your wife and children and give my love to all  i s faith to believe that day will come said tom earnestly and with tears in his eyes the lord has a work for masr  a work hey said st clare well now tom give me your views on what sort of a work it islets hear  why even a poor fellow like me has a work from the lord and masr st clare that has larnin and riches and friendshow much he might do for the lord  tom you seem to think the lord needs a great deal done for him said st clare smiling  we does for the lord when we does for his critturs said tom  good theology tom better than dr b preaches i dare swear said st clare  the conversation was here interrupted by the announcement of some visitors  marie st clare felt the loss of eva as deeply as she could feel anything and as she was a woman that had a great faculty of making everybody unhappy when she was her immediate attendants had still stronger reason to regret the loss of their young mistress whose winning ways and gentle intercessions had so often been a shield to them from the tyrannical and selfish exactions of her mother poor old mammy in particular whose heart severed from all natural domestic ties had consoled itself with this one beautiful being was almost heartbroken she cried day and night and was from excess of sorrow less skilful and alert in her ministrations of her mistress than usual which drew down a constant storm of invectives on her defenceless head  miss ophelia felt the loss but in her good and honest heart it bore fruit unto everlasting life she was more softened more gentle and though equally assiduous in every duty it was with a chastened and quiet air as one who communed with her own heart not in vain she was more diligent in teaching topsytaught her mainly from the bibledid not any longer shrink from her touch or manifest an illrepressed disgust because she felt none she viewed her now through the softened medium that evas hand had first held before her eyes and saw in her only an immortal creature whom god had sent to be led by her to glory and virtue topsy did not become at once a saint but the life and death of eva did work a marked change in her the callous indifference was gone there was now sensibility hope desire and the striving for gooda strife irregular interrupted suspended oft but yet renewed again  one day when topsy had been sent for by miss ophelia she came hastily thrusting something into her bosom  what are you doing there you limb youve been stealing something ill be bound said the imperious little rosa who had been sent to call her seizing her at the same time roughly by the arm  you go long miss rosa said topsy pulling from her tant none o your business  none o your sace said rosa i saw you hiding somethingi know yer tricks and rosa seized her arm and tried to force her hand into her bosom while topsy enraged kicked and fought valiantly for what she considered her rights the clamor and confusion of the battle drew miss ophelia and st clare both to the spot  shes been stealing said rosa  i hant neither vociferated topsy sobbing with passion  give me that whatever it is said miss ophelia firmly  topsy hesitated but on a second order pulled out of her bosom a little parcel done up in the foot of one of her own old stockings  miss ophelia turned it out there was a small book which had been given to topsy by eva containing a single verse of scripture arranged for every day in the year and in a paper the curl of hair that she had given her on that memorable day when she had taken her last farewell  st clare was a good deal affected at the sight of it the little book had been rolled in a long strip of black crape torn from the funeral weeds  what did you wrap this round the book for said st clare holding up the crape  causecausecause t was miss eva o dont take em away please she said and sitting flat down on the floor and putting her apron over her head she began to sob vehemently  it was a curious mixture of the pathetic and the ludicrousthe little old stockingsblack crapetextbookfair soft curland topsys utter distress  st clare smiled but there were tears in his eyes as he said  come comedont cry you shall have them and putting them together he threw them into her lap and drew miss ophelia with him into the parlor  i really think you can make something of that concern he said pointing with his thumb backward over his shoulder any mind that is capable of a real sorrow is capable of good you must try and do something with her  the child has improved greatly said miss ophelia i have great hopes of her but augustine she said laying her hand on his arm one thing i want to ask whose is this child to beyours or mine  why i gave her to you said augustine  but not legallyi want her to be mine legally said miss ophelia  whew cousin said augustine what will the abolition society think theyll have a day of fasting appointed for this backsliding if you become a slaveholder  o nonsense i want her mine that i may have a right to take her to the free states and give her her liberty that all i am trying to do be not undone  o cousin what an awful doing evil that good may come i cant encourage it  i dont want you to joke but to reason said miss ophelia there is no use in my trying to make this child a christian child unless i save her from all the chances and reverses of slavery and if you really are willing i should have her i want you to give me a deed of gift or some legal paper  well well said st clare i will and he sat down and unfolded a newspaper to read  but i want it done now said miss ophelia  whats your hurry  because now is the only time there ever is to do a thing in said miss ophelia come now heres paper pen and ink just write a paper  st clare like most men of his class of mind cordially hated the present tense of action generally and therefore he was considerably annoyed by miss ophelias downrightness  why whats the matter said he cant you take my word one would think you had taken lessons of the jews coming at a fellow so  i want to make sure of it said miss ophelia you may die or fail and then topsy be hustled off to auction spite of all i can do  really you are quite provident well seeing im in the hands of a yankee there is nothing for it but to concede and st clare rapidly wrote off a deed of gift which as he was well versed in the forms of law he could easily do and signed his name to it in sprawling capitals concluding by a tremendous flourish  there isnt that black and white now miss vermont he said as he handed it to her  good boy said miss ophelia smiling but must it not be witnessed  o botheryes here he said opening the door into maries apartment marie cousin wants your autograph just put your name down here  whats this said marie as she ran over the paper ridiculous i thought cousin was too pious for such horrid things she added as she carelessly wrote her name but if she has a fancy for that article i am sure shes welcome  there now shes yours body and soul said st clare handing the paper  no more mine now than she was before miss ophelia nobody but god has a right to give her to me but i can protect her now  well shes yours by a fiction of law then said st clare as he turned back into the parlor and sat down to his paper  miss ophelia who seldom sat much in maries company followed him into the parlor having first carefully laid away the paper  augustine she said suddenly as she sat knitting have you ever made any provision for your servants in case of your death  no said st clare as he read on  then all your indulgence to them may prove a great cruelty by and by  st clare had often thought the same thing himself but he answered negligently  well i mean to make a provision by and by  when said miss ophelia  o one of these days  what if you should die first  cousin whats the matter said st clare laying down his paper and looking at her do you think i show symptoms of yellow fever or cholera that you are making post mortem arrangements with such zeal  in the midst of life we are in death said miss ophelia  st clare rose up and laying the paper down carelessly walked to the door that stood open on the verandah to put an end to a conversation that was not agreeable to him mechanically he repeated the last word againdeathand as he leaned against the railings and watched the sparkling water as it rose and fell in the fountain and as in a dim and dizzy haze saw flowers and trees and vases of the courts he repeated again the mystic word so common in every mouth yet of such fearful powerdeath strange that there should be such a word he said and such a thing and we ever forget it that one should be living warm and beautiful full of hopes desires and wants one day and the next be gone utterly gone and forever  it was a warm golden evening and as he walked to the other end of the verandah he saw tom busily intent on his bible pointing as he did so with his finger to each successive word and whispering them to himself with an earnest air  want me to read to you tom said st clare seating himself carelessly by him  if masr pleases said tom gratefully masr makes it so much plainer  st clare took the book and glanced at the place and began reading one of the passages which tom had designated by the heavy marks around it it ran as follows  when the son of man shall come in his glory and all his holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats st clare read on in an animated voice till he came to the last of the verses  then shall the king say unto him on his left hand depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire for i was an hungered and ye gave me no meat i was thirsty and ye gave me no drink i was a stranger and ye took me not in naked and ye clothed me not i was sick and in prison and ye visited me not then shall they answer unto him lord when saw we thee an hungered or athirst or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister unto thee then shall he say unto them inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these my brethren ye did it not to me  st clare seemed struck with this last passage for he read it twicethe second time slowly and as if he were revolving the words in his mind  tom he said these folks that get such hard measure seem to have been doing just what i haveliving good easy respectable lives and not troubling themselves to inquire how many of their brethren were hungry or athirst or sick or in prison  tom did not answer  st clare rose up and walked thoughtfully up and down the verandah seeming to forget everything in his own thoughts so absorbed was he that tom had to remind him twice that the teabell had rung before he could get his attention  st clare was absent and thoughtful all teatime after tea he and marie and miss ophelia took possession of the parlor almost in silence  marie disposed herself on a lounge under a silken mosquito curtain and was soon sound asleep miss ophelia silently busied herself with her knitting st clare sat down to the piano and began playing a soft and melancholy movement with the Æolian accompaniment he seemed in a deep reverie and to be soliloquizing to himself by music after a little he opened one of the drawers took out an old musicbook whose leaves were yellow with age and began turning it over  there he said to miss ophelia this was one of my mothers booksand here is her handwritingcome and look at it she copied and arranged this from mozarts requiem miss ophelia came accordingly  it was something she used to sing often said st clare i think i can hear her now  he struck a few majestic chords and began singing that grand old latin piece the dies iræ  tom who was listening in the outer verandah was drawn by the sound to the very door where he stood earnestly he did not understand the words of course but the music and manner of singing appeared to affect him strongly especially when st clare sang the more pathetic parts tom would have sympathized more heartily if he had known the meaning of the beautiful words      recordare jesu pie      quod sum causa tuær viæ      ne me perdas illa die      quærens me sedisti lassus      redemisti crucem passus      tantus labor non sit cassus         these lines have been thus rather inadequately translated      think o jesus for what reason      thou enduredst earths spite and treason      nor me lose in that dread season      seeking me thy worn feet hasted      on the cross thy soul death tasted      let not all these toils be wasted      mrs stowes note  st clare threw a deep and pathetic expression into the words for the shadowy veil of years seemed drawn away and he seemed to hear his mothers voice leading his voice and instrument seemed both living and threw out with vivid sympathy those strains which the ethereal mozart first conceived as his own dying requiem  when st clare had done singing he sat leaning his head upon his hand a few moments and then began walking up and down the floor  what a sublime conception is that of a last judgment said hea righting of all the wrongs of agesa solving of all moral problems by an unanswerable wisdom it is indeed a wonderful image  it is a fearful one to us said miss ophelia  it ought to be to me i suppose said st clare stopping thoughtfully i was reading to tom this afternoon that chapter in matthew that gives an account of it and i have been quite struck with it one should have expected some terrible enormities charged to those who are excluded from heaven as the reason but nothey are condemned for not doing positive good as if that included every possible harm  perhaps said miss ophelia it is impossible for a person who does no good not to do harm  and what said st clare speaking abstractedly but with deep feeling what shall be said of one whose own heart whose education and the wants of society have called in vain to some noble purpose who has floated on a dreamy neutral spectator of the struggles agonies and wrongs of man when he should have been a worker  i should say said miss ophelia that he ought to repent and begin now  always practical and to the point said st clare his face breaking out into a smile you never leave me any time for general reflections cousin you always bring me short up against the actual present you have a kind of eternal now always in your mind  now is all the time i have anything to do with said miss ophelia  dear little evapoor child said st clare she had set her little simple soul on a good work for me  it was the first time since evas death that he had ever said as many words as these to her and he spoke now evidently repressing very strong feeling  my view of christianity is such he added that i think no man can consistently profess it without throwing the whole weight of his being against this monstrous system of injustice that lies at the foundation of all our society and if need be sacrificing himself in the battle that is i mean that i could not be a christian otherwise though i have certainly had intercourse with a great many enlightened and christian people who did no such thing and i confess that the apathy of religious people on this subject their want of perception of wrongs that filled me with horror have engendered in me more scepticism than any other thing  if you knew all this said miss ophelia why didnt you do it  o because i have had only that kind of benevolence which consists in lying on a sofa and cursing the church and clergy for not being martyrs and confessors one can see you know very easily how others ought to be martyrs  well are you going to do differently now said miss ophelia  god only knows the future said st clare i am braver than i was because i have lost all and he who has nothing to lose can afford all risks  and what are you going to do  my duty i hope to the poor and lowly as fast as i find it out said st clare beginning with my own servants for whom i have yet done nothing and perhaps at some future day it may appear that i can do something for a whole class something to save my country from the disgrace of that false position in which she now stands before all civilized nations  do you suppose it possible that a nation ever will voluntarily emancipate said miss ophelia  i dont know said st clare this is a day of great deeds heroism and disinterestedness are rising up here and there in the earth the hungarian nobles set free millions of serfs at an immense pecuniary loss and perhaps among us may be found generous spirits who do not estimate honor and justice by dollars and cents  i hardly think so said miss ophelia  but suppose we should rise up tomorrow and emancipate who would educate these millions and teach them how to use their freedom they never would rise to do much among us the fact is we are too lazy and unpractical ourselves ever to give them much of an idea of that industry and energy which is necessary to form them into men they will have to go north where labor is the fashionthe universal custom and tell me now is there enough christian philanthropy among your northern states to bear with the process of their education and elevation you send thousands of dollars to foreign missions but could you endure to have the heathen sent into your towns and villages and give your time and thoughts and money to raise them to the christian standard thats what i want to know if we emancipate are you willing to educate how many families in your town would take a negro man and woman teach them bear with them and seek to make them christians how many merchants would take adolph if i wanted to make him a clerk or mechanics if i wanted him taught a trade if i wanted to put jane and rosa to a school how many schools are there in the northern states that would take them in how many families that would board them and yet they are as white as many a woman north or south you see cousin i want justice done us we are in a bad position we are the more obvious oppressors of the negro but the unchristian prejudice of the north is an oppressor almost equally severe  well cousin i know it is so said miss opheliai know it was so with me till i saw that it was my duty to overcome it but i trust i have overcome it and i know there are many good people at the north who in this matter need only to be taught what their duty is to do it it would certainly be a greater selfdenial to receive heathen among us than to send missionaries to them but i think we would do it  you would i know said st clare id like to see anything you wouldnt do if you thought it your duty  well im not uncommonly good said miss ophelia others would if they saw things as i do i intend to take topsy home when i go i suppose our folks will wonder at first but i think they will be brought to see as i do besides i know there are many people at the north who do exactly what you said  yes but they are a minority and if we should begin to emancipate to any extent we should soon hear from you  miss ophelia did not reply there was a pause of some moments and st clares countenance was overcast by a sad dreamy expression  i dont know what makes me think of my mother so much tonight he said i have a strange kind of feeling as if she were near me i keep thinking of things she used to say strange what brings these past things so vividly back to us sometimes  st clare walked up and down the room for some minutes more and then said  i believe ill go down street a few moments and hear the news tonight  he took his hat and passed out  tom followed him to the passage out of the court and asked if he should attend him  no my boy said st clare i shall be back in an hour  tom sat down in the verandah it was a beautiful moonlight evening and he sat watching the rising and falling spray of the fountain and listening to its murmur tom thought of his home and that he should soon be a free man and able to return to it at will he thought how he should work to buy his wife and boys he felt the muscles of his brawny arms with a sort of joy as he thought they would soon belong to himself and how much they could do to work out the freedom of his family then he thought of his noble young master and ever second to that came the habitual prayer that he had always offered for him and then his thoughts passed on to the beautiful eva whom he now thought of among the angels and he thought till he almost fancied that that bright face and golden hair were looking upon him out of the spray of the fountain and so musing he fell asleep and dreamed he saw her coming bounding towards him just as she used to come with a wreath of jessamine in her hair her cheeks bright and her eyes radiant with delight but as he looked she seemed to rise from the ground her cheeks wore a paler hueher eyes had a deep divine radiance a golden halo seemed around her headand she vanished from his sight and tom was awakened by a loud knocking and a sound of many voices at the gate  he hastened to undo it and with smothered voices and heavy tread came several men bringing a body wrapped in a cloak and lying on a shutter the light of the lamp fell full on the face and tom gave a wild cry of amazement and despair that rung through all the galleries as the men advanced with their burden to the open parlor door where miss ophelia still sat knitting  st clare had turned into a cafe to look over an evening paper as he was reading an affray arose between two gentlemen in the room who were both partially intoxicated st clare and one or two others made an effort to separate them and st clare received a fatal stab in the side with a bowieknife which he was attempting to wrest from one of them  the house was full of cries and lamentations shrieks and screams servants frantically tearing their hair throwing themselves on the ground or running distractedly about lamenting tom and miss ophelia alone seemed to have any presence of mind for marie was in strong hysteric convulsions at miss ophelias direction one of the lounges in the parlor was hastily prepared and the bleeding form laid upon it st clare had fainted through pain and loss of blood but as miss ophelia applied restoratives he revived opened his eyes looked fixedly on them looked earnestly around the room his eyes travelling wistfully over every object and finally they rested on his mothers picture  the physician now arrived and made his examination it was evident from the expression of his face that there was no hope but he applied himself to dressing the wound and he and miss ophelia and tom proceeded composedly with this work amid the lamentations and sobs and cries of the affrighted servants who had clustered about the doors and windows of the verandah  now said the physician we must turn all these creatures out all depends on his being kept quiet  st clare opened his eyes and looked fixedly on the distressed beings whom miss ophelia and the doctor were trying to urge from the apartment poor creatures he said and an expression of bitter selfreproach passed over his face adolph absolutely refused to go terror had deprived him of all presence of mind he threw himself along the floor and nothing could persuade him to rise the rest yielded to miss ophelias urgent representations that their masters safety depended on their stillness and obedience  st clare could say but little he lay with his eyes shut but it was evident that he wrestled with bitter thoughts after a while he laid his hand on toms who was kneeling beside him and said tom poor fellow  what masr said tom earnestly  i am dying said st clare pressing his hand pray  if you would like a clergyman said the physician  st clare hastily shook his head and said again to tom more earnestly pray  and tom did pray with all his mind and strength for the soul that was passingthe soul that seemed looking so steadily and mournfully from those large melancholy blue eyes it was literally prayer offered with strong crying and tears  when tom ceased to speak st clare reached out and took his hand looking earnestly at him but saying nothing he closed his eyes but still retained his hold for in the gates of eternity the black hand and the white hold each other with an equal clasp he murmured softly to himself at broken intervals       recordare jesu pie                  ne me perdasilla die      quærens mesedisti lassus  it was evident that the words he had been singing that evening were passing through his mindwords of entreaty addressed to infinite pity his lips moved at intervals as parts of the hymn fell brokenly from them  his mind is wandering said the doctor  no it is coming home at last said st clare energetically at last at last  the effort of speaking exhausted him the sinking paleness of death fell on him but with it there fell as if shed from the wings of some pitying spirit a beautiful expression of peace like that of a wearied child who sleeps  so he lay for a few moments they saw that the mighty hand was on him just before the spirit parted he opened his eyes with a sudden light as of joy and recognition and said mother and then he was gone    chapter xxix  the unprotected   we hear often of the distress of the negro servants on the loss of a kind master and with good reason for no creature on gods earth is left more utterly unprotected and desolate than the slave in these circumstances  the child who has lost a father has still the protection of friends and of the law he is something and can do somethinghas acknowledged rights and position the slave has none the law regards him in every respect as devoid of rights as a bale of merchandise the only possible acknowledgment of any of the longings and wants of a human and immortal creature which are given to him comes to him through the sovereign and irresponsible will of his master and when that master is stricken down nothing remains  the number of those men who know how to use wholly irresponsible power humanely and generously is small everybody knows this and the slave knows it best of all so that he feels that there are ten chances of his finding an abusive and tyrannical master to one of his finding a considerate and kind one therefore is it that the wail over a kind master is loud and long as well it may be  when st clare breathed his last terror and consternation took hold of all his household he had been stricken down so in a moment in the flower and strength of his youth every room and gallery of the house resounded with sobs and shrieks of despair  marie whose nervous system had been enervated by a constant course of selfindulgence had nothing to support the terror of the shock and at the time her husband breathed his last was passing from one fainting fit to another and he to whom she had been joined in the mysterious tie of marriage passed from her forever without the possibility of even a parting word  miss ophelia with characteristic strength and selfcontrol had remained with her kinsman to the lastall eye all ear all attention doing everything of the little that could be done and joining with her whole soul in the tender and impassioned prayers which the poor slave had poured forth for the soul of his dying master  when they were arranging him for his last rest they found upon his bosom a small plain miniature case opening with a spring it was the miniature of a noble and beautiful female face and on the reverse under a crystal a lock of dark hair they laid them back on the lifeless breastdust to dustpoor mournful relics of early dreams which once made that cold heart beat so warmly  toms whole soul was filled with thoughts of eternity and while he ministered around the lifeless clay he did not once think that the sudden stroke had left him in hopeless slavery he felt at peace about his master for in that hour when he had poured forth his prayer into the bosom of his father he had found an answer of quietness and assurance springing up within himself in the depths of his own affectionate nature he felt able to perceive something of the fulness of divine love for an old oracle hath thus writtenhe that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him tom hoped and trusted and was at peace  but the funeral passed with all its pageant of black crape and prayers and solemn faces and back rolled the cool muddy waves of everyday life and up came the everlasting hard inquiry of what is to be done next  it rose to the mind of marie as dressed in loose morningrobes and surrounded by anxious servants she sat up in a great easychair and inspected samples of crape and bombazine it rose to miss ophelia who began to turn her thoughts towards her northern home it rose in silent terrors to the minds of the servants who well knew the unfeeling tyrannical character of the mistress in whose hands they were left all knew very well that the indulgences which had been accorded to them were not from their mistress but from their master and that now he was gone there would be no screen between them and every tyrannous infliction which a temper soured by affliction might devise  it was about a fortnight after the funeral that miss ophelia busied one day in her apartment heard a gentle tap at the door she opened it and there stood rosa the pretty young quadroon whom we have before often noticed her hair in disorder and her eyes swelled with crying  o miss feeley she said falling on her knees and catching the skirt of her dress do do go to miss marie for me do plead for me shes goin to send me out to be whippedlook there and she handed to miss ophelia a paper  it was an order written in maries delicate italian hand to the master of a whippingestablishment to give the bearer fifteen lashes  what have you been doing said miss ophelia  you know miss feely ive got such a bad temper its very bad of me i was trying on miss maries dress and she slapped my face and i spoke out before i thought and was saucy and she said that shed bring me down and have me know once for all that i wasnt going to be so topping as i had been and she wrote this and says i shall carry it id rather shed kill me right out  miss ophelia stood considering with the paper in her hand  you see miss feely said rosa i dont mind the whipping so much if miss marie or you was to do it but to be sent to a man and such a horrid manthe shame of it miss feely  miss ophelia well knew that it was the universal custom to send women and young girls to whippinghouses to the hands of the lowest of menmen vile enough to make this their professionthere to be subjected to brutal exposure and shameful correction she had known it before but hitherto she had never realized it till she saw the slender form of rosa almost convulsed with distress all the honest blood of womanhood the strong new england blood of liberty flushed to her cheeks and throbbed bitterly in her indignant heart but with habitual prudence and selfcontrol she mastered herself and crushing the paper firmly in her hand she merely said to rosa  sit down child while i go to your mistress  shameful monstrous outrageous she said to herself as she was crossing the parlor  she found marie sitting up in her easychair with mammy standing by her combing her hair jane sat on the ground before her busy in chafing her feet  how do you find yourself today said miss ophelia  a deep sigh and a closing of the eyes was the only reply for a moment and then marie answered o i dont know cousin i suppose im as well as i ever shall be and marie wiped her eyes with a cambric handkerchief bordered with an inch deep of black  i came said miss ophelia with a short dry cough such as commonly introduces a difficult subjecti came to speak with you about poor rosa  maries eyes were open wide enough now and a flush rose to her sallow cheeks as she answered sharply  well what about her  she is very sorry for her fault  she is is she shell be sorrier before ive done with her ive endured that childs impudence long enough and now ill bring her downill make her lie in the dust  but could not you punish her some other waysome way that would be less shameful  i mean to shame her thats just what i want she has all her life presumed on her delicacy and her good looks and her ladylike airs till she forgets who she isand ill give her one lesson that will bring her down i fancy  but cousin consider that if you destroy delicacy and a sense of shame in a young girl you deprave her very fast  delicacy said marie with a scornful laugha fine word for such as she ill teach her with all her airs that shes no better than the raggedest black wench that walks the streets shell take no more airs with me  you will answer to god for such cruelty said miss ophelia with energy  crueltyid like to know what the cruelty is i wrote orders for only fifteen lashes and told him to put them on lightly im sure theres no cruelty there  no cruelty said miss ophelia im sure any girl might rather be killed outright  it might seem so to anybody with your feeling but all these creatures get used to it its the only way they can be kept in order once let them feel that they are to take any airs about delicacy and all that and theyll run all over you just as my servants always have ive begun now to bring them under and ill have them all to know that ill send one out to be whipped as soon as another if they dont mind themselves said marie looking around her decidedly  jane hung her head and cowered at this for she felt as if it was particularly directed to her miss ophelia sat for a moment as if she had swallowed some explosive mixture and were ready to burst then recollecting the utter uselessness of contention with such a nature she shut her lips resolutely gathered herself up and walked out of the room  it was hard to go back and tell rosa that she could do nothing for her and shortly after one of the manservants came to say that her mistress had ordered him to take rosa with him to the whippinghouse whither she was hurried in spite of her tears and entreaties  a few days after tom was standing musing by the balconies when he was joined by adolph who since the death of his master had been entirely crestfallen and disconsolate adolph knew that he had always been an object of dislike to marie but while his master lived he had paid but little attention to it now that he was gone he had moved about in daily dread and trembling not knowing what might befall him next marie had held several consultations with her lawyer after communicating with st clares brother it was determined to sell the place and all the servants except her own personal property and these she intended to take with her and go back to her fathers plantation  do ye know tom that weve all got to be sold said adolph  how did you hear that said tom  i hid myself behind the curtains when missis was talking with the lawyer in a few days we shall be sent off to auction tom  the lords will be done said tom folding his arms and sighing heavily  well never get another such a master said adolph apprehensively but id rather be sold than take my chance under missis  tom turned away his heart was full the hope of liberty the thought of distant wife and children rose up before his patient soul as to the mariner shipwrecked almost in port rises the vision of the churchspire and loving roofs of his native village seen over the top of some black wave only for one last farewell he drew his arms tightly over his bosom and choked back the bitter tears and tried to pray the poor old soul had such a singular unaccountable prejudice in favor of liberty that it was a hard wrench for him and the more he said thy will be done the worse he felt  he sought miss ophelia who ever since evas death had treated him with marked and respectful kindness  miss feely he said masr st clare promised me my freedom he told me that he had begun to take it out for me and now perhaps if miss feely would be good enough to speak bout it to missis she would feel like goin on with it was it as masr st clares wish  ill speak for you tom and do my best said miss ophelia but if it depends on mrs st clare i cant hope much for younevertheless i will try  this incident occurred a few days after that of rosa while miss ophelia was busied in preparations to return north  seriously reflecting within herself she considered that perhaps she had shown too hasty a warmth of language in her former interview with marie and she resolved that she would now endeavor to moderate her zeal and to be as conciliatory as possible so the good soul gathered herself up and taking her knitting resolved to go into maries room be as agreeable as possible and negotiate toms case with all the diplomatic skill of which she was mistress  she found marie reclining at length upon a lounge supporting herself on one elbow by pillows while jane who had been out shopping was displaying before her certain samples of thin black stuffs  that will do said marie selecting one only im not sure about its being properly mourning  laws missis said jane volubly mrs general derbennon wore just this very thing after the general died last summer it makes up lovely  what do you think said marie to miss ophelia  its a matter of custom i suppose said miss ophelia you can judge about it better than i  the fact is said marie that i havent a dress in the world that i can wear and as i am going to break up the establishment and go off next week i must decide upon something  are you going so soon  yes st clares brother has written and he and the lawyer think that the servants and furniture had better be put up at auction and the place left with our lawyer  theres one thing i wanted to speak with you about said miss ophelia augustine promised tom his liberty and began the legal forms necessary to it i hope you will use your influence to have it perfected  indeed i shall do no such thing said marie sharply tom is one of the most valuable servants on the placeit couldnt be afforded any way besides what does he want of liberty hes a great deal better off as he is  but he does desire it very earnestly and his master promised it said miss ophelia  i dare say he does want it said marie they all want it just because they are a discontented setalways wanting what they havent got now im principled against emancipating in any case keep a negro under the care of a master and he does well enough and is respectable but set them free and they get lazy and wont work and take to drinking and go all down to be mean worthless fellows ive seen it tried hundreds of times its no favor to set them free  but tom is so steady industrious and pious  o you neednt tell me ive see a hundred like him hell do very well as long as hes taken care ofthats all  but then consider said miss ophelia when you set him up for sale the chances of his getting a bad master  o thats all humbug said marie it isnt one time in a hundred that a good fellow gets a bad master most masters are good for all the talk that is made ive lived and grown up here in the south and i never yet was acquainted with a master that didnt treat his servants wellquite as well as is worth while i dont feel any fears on that head  well said miss ophelia energetically i know it was one of the last wishes of your husband that tom should have his liberty it was one of the promises that he made to dear little eva on her deathbed and i should not think you would feel at liberty to disregard it  marie had her face covered with her handkerchief at this appeal and began sobbing and using her smellingbottle with great vehemence  everybody goes against me she said everybody is so inconsiderate i shouldnt have expected that you would bring up all these remembrances of my troubles to meits so inconsiderate but nobody ever does considermy trials are so peculiar its so hard that when i had only one daughter she should have been takenand when i had a husband that just exactly suited meand im so hard to be suitedhe should be taken and you seem to have so little feeling for me and keep bringing it up to me so carelesslywhen you know how it overcomes me i suppose you mean well but it is very inconsideratevery and marie sobbed and gasped for breath and called mammy to open the window and to bring her the camphorbottle and to bathe her head and unhook her dress and in the general confusion that ensued miss ophelia made her escape to her apartment  she saw at once that it would do no good to say anything more for marie had an indefinite capacity for hysteric fits and after this whenever her husbands or evas wishes with regard to the servants were alluded to she always found it convenient to set one in operation miss ophelia therefore did the next best thing she could for tomshe wrote a letter to mrs shelby for him stating his troubles and urging them to send to his relief  the next day tom and adolph and some half a dozen other servants were marched down to a slavewarehouse to await the convenience of the trader who was going to make up a lot for auction    chapter xxx  the slave warehouse  a slave warehouse perhaps some of my readers conjure up horrible visions of such a place they fancy some foul obscure den some horrible tartarus informis ingens cui lumen ademptum but no innocent friend in these days men have learned the art of sinning expertly and genteelly so as not to shock the eyes and senses of respectable society human property is high in the market and is therefore well fed well cleaned tended and looked after that it may come to sale sleek and strong and shining a slavewarehouse in new orleans is a house externally not much unlike many others kept with neatness and where every day you may see arranged under a sort of shed along the outside rows of men and women who stand there as a sign of the property sold within  then you shall be courteously entreated to call and examine and shall find an abundance of husbands wives brothers sisters fathers mothers and young children to be sold separately or in lots to suit the convenience of the purchaser and that soul immortal once bought with blood and anguish by the son of god when the earth shook and the rocks rent and the graves were opened can be sold leased mortgaged exchanged for groceries or dry goods to suit the phases of trade or the fancy of the purchaser  it was a day or two after the conversation between marie and miss ophelia that tom adolph and about half a dozen others of the st clare estate were turned over to the loving kindness of mr skeggs the keeper of a depot on  street to await the auction next day  tom had with him quite a sizable trunk full of clothing as had most others of them they were ushered for the night into a long room where many other men of all ages sizes and shades of complexion were assembled and from which roars of laughter and unthinking merriment were proceeding  ah ha thats right go it boysgo it said mr skeggs the keeper my people are always so merry sambo i see he said speaking approvingly to a burly negro who was performing tricks of low buffoonery which occasioned the shouts which tom had heard  as might be imagined tom was in no humor to join these proceedings and therefore setting his trunk as far as possible from the noisy group he sat down on it and leaned his face against the wall  the dealers in the human article make scrupulous and systematic efforts to promote noisy mirth among them as a means of drowning reflection and rendering them insensible to their condition the whole object of the training to which the negro is put from the time he is sold in the northern market till he arrives south is systematically directed towards making him callous unthinking and brutal the slavedealer collects his gang in virginia or kentucky and drives them to some convenient healthy placeoften a watering placeto be fattened here they are fed full daily and because some incline to pine a fiddle is kept commonly going among them and they are made to dance daily and he who refuses to be merryin whose soul thoughts of wife or child or home are too strong for him to be gayis marked as sullen and dangerous and subjected to all the evils which the ill will of an utterly irresponsible and hardened man can inflict upon him briskness alertness and cheerfulness of appearance especially before observers are constantly enforced upon them both by the hope of thereby getting a good master and the fear of all that the driver may bring upon them if they prove unsalable  what dat ar nigger doin here said sambo coming up to tom after mr skeggs had left the room sambo was a full black of great size very lively voluble and full of trick and grimace  what you doin here said sambo coming up to tom and poking him facetiously in the side meditatin eh  i am to be sold at the auction tomorrow said tom quietly  sold at auctionhaw haw boys ant this yer fun i wisht i was gwine that ar waytell ye wouldnt i make em laugh but how is itdis yer

enraged at this taunt flew furiously at his adversary swearing and striking on every side of him the rest laughed and shouted and the uproar brought the keeper to the door  what now boys orderorder he said coming in and flourishing a large whip  all fled in different directions except sambo who presuming on the favor which the keeper had to him as a licensed wag stood his ground ducking his head with a facetious grin whenever the master made a dive at him  lor masr tant uswe s reglar stiddyits these yer new hands they s real aggravatinkinder pickin at us all time  the keeper at this turned upon tom and adolph and distributing a few kicks and cuffs without much inquiry and leaving general orders for all to be good boys and go to sleep left the apartment  while this scene was going on in the mens sleepingroom the reader may be curious to take a peep at the corresponding apartment allotted to the women stretched out in various attitudes over the floor he may see numberless sleeping forms of every shade of complexion from the purest ebony to white and of all years from childhood to old age lying now asleep here is a fine bright girl of ten years whose mother was sold out yesterday and who tonight cried herself to sleep when nobody was looking at her here a worn old negress whose thin arms and callous fingers tell of hard toil waiting to be sold tomorrow as a castoff article for what can be got for her and some forty or fifty others with heads variously enveloped in blankets or articles of clothing lie stretched around them but in a corner sitting apart from the rest are two females of a more interesting appearance than common one of these is a respectablydressed mulatto woman between forty and fifty with soft eyes and a gentle and pleasing physiognomy she has on her head a highraised turban made of a gay red madras handkerchief of the first quality her dress is neatly fitted and of good material showing that she has been provided for with a careful hand by her side and nestling closely to her is a young girl of fifteenher daughter she is a quadroon as may be seen from her fairer complexion though her likeness to her mother is quite discernible she has the same soft dark eye with longer lashes and her curling hair is of a luxuriant brown she also is dressed with great neatness and her white delicate hands betray very little acquaintance with servile toil these two are to be sold tomorrow in the same lot with the st clare servants and the gentleman to whom they belong and to whom the money for their sale is to be transmitted is a member of a christian church in new york who will receive the money and go thereafter to the sacrament of his lord and theirs and think no more of it  these two whom we shall call susan and emmeline had been the personal attendants of an amiable and pious lady of new orleans by whom they had been carefully and piously instructed and trained they had been taught to read and write diligently instructed in the truths of religion and their lot had been as happy an one as in their condition it was possible to be but the only son of their protectress had the management of her property and by carelessness and extravagance involved it to a large amount and at last failed one of the largest creditors was the respectable firm of b  co in new york b  co wrote to their lawyer in new orleans who attached the real estate these two articles and a lot of plantation hands formed the most valuable part of it and wrote word to that effect to new york brother b being as we have said a christian man and a resident in a free state felt some uneasiness on the subject he didnt like trading in slaves and souls of menof course he didnt but then there were thirty thousand dollars in the case and that was rather too much money to be lost for a principle and so after much considering and asking advice from those that he knew would advise to suit him brother b wrote to his lawyer to dispose of the business in the way that seemed to him the most suitable and remit the proceeds  the day after the letter arrived in new orleans susan and emmeline were attached and sent to the depot to await a general auction on the following morning and as they glimmer faintly upon us in the moonlight which steals through the grated window we may listen to their conversation both are weeping but each quietly that the other may not hear  mother just lay your head on my lap and see if you cant sleep a little says the girl trying to appear calm  i havent any heart to sleep em i cant its the last night we may be together  o mother dont say so perhaps we shall get sold togetherwho knows  if t was anybodys else case i should say so too em said the woman but im so feard of losin you that i dont see anything but the danger  why mother the man said we were both likely and would sell well  susan remembered the mans looks and words with a deadly sickness at her heart she remembered how he had looked at emmelines hands and lifted up her curly hair and pronounced her a firstrate article susan had been trained as a christian brought up in the daily reading of the bible and had the same horror of her childs being sold to a life of shame that any other christian mother might have but she had no hopeno protection  mother i think we might do first rate if you could get a place as cook and i as chambermaid or seamstress in some family i dare say we shall lets both look as bright and lively as we can and tell all we can do and perhaps we shall said emmeline  i want you to brush your hair all back straight tomorrow said susan  what for mother i dont look near so well that way  yes but youll sell better so  i dont see why said the child  respectable families would be more apt to buy you if they saw you looked plain and decent as if you wasnt trying to look handsome i know their ways better n you do said susan  well mother then i will  and emmeline if we shouldnt ever see each other again after tomorrowif im sold way up on a plantation somewhere and you somewhere elsealways remember how youve been brought up and all missis has told you take your bible with you and your hymnbook and if youre faithful to the lord hell be faithful to you  so speaks the poor soul in sore discouragement for she knows that tomorrow any man however vile and brutal however godless and merciless if he only has money to pay for her may become owner of her daughter body and soul and then how is the child to be faithful she thinks of all this as she holds her daughter in her arms and wishes that she were not handsome and attractive it seems almost an aggravation to her to remember how purely and piously how much above the ordinary lot she has been brought up but she has no resort but to pray and many such prayers to god have gone up from those same trim neatlyarranged respectable slaveprisonsprayers which god has not forgotten as a coming day shall show for it is written who causeth one of these little ones to offend it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depths of the sea  the soft earnest quiet moonbeam looks in fixedly marking the bars of the grated windows on the prostrate sleeping forms the mother and daughter are singing together a wild and melancholy dirge common as a funeral hymn among the slaves       o where is weeping mary      o where is weeping mary      rived in the goodly land      she is dead and gone to heaven      she is dead and gone to heaven      rived in the goodly land  these words sung by voices of a peculiar and melancholy sweetness in an air which seemed like the sighing of earthy despair after heavenly hope floated through the dark prison rooms with a pathetic cadence as verse after verse was breathed out       o where are paul and silas      o where are paul and silas      gone to the goodly land      they are dead and gone to heaven      they are dead and gone to heaven      rived in the goodly land  sing on poor souls the night is short and the morning will part you forever  but now it is morning and everybody is astir and the worthy mr skeggs is busy and bright for a lot of goods is to be fitted out for auction there is a brisk lookout on the toilet injunctions passed around to every one to put on their best face and be spry and now all are arranged in a circle for a last review before they are marched up to the bourse  mr skeggs with his palmetto on and his cigar in his mouth walks around to put farewell touches on his wares  hows this he said stepping in front of susan and emmeline wheres your curls gal  the girl looked timidly at her mother who with the smooth adroitness common among her class answers  i was telling her last night to put up her hair smooth and neat and not havin it flying about in curls looks more respectable so  bother said the man peremptorily turning to the girl you go right along and curl yourself real smart he added giving a crack to a rattan he held in his hand and be back in quick time too  you go and help her he added to the mother them curls may make a hundred dollars difference in the sale of her   beneath a splendid dome were men of all nations moving to and fro over the marble pave on every side of the circular area were little tribunes or stations for the use of speakers and auctioneers two of these on opposite sides of the area were now occupied by brilliant and talented gentlemen enthusiastically forcing up in english and french commingled the bids of connoisseurs in their various wares a third one on the other side still unoccupied was surrounded by a group waiting the moment of sale to begin and here we may recognize the st clare servantstom adolph and others and there too susan and emmeline awaiting their turn with anxious and dejected faces various spectators intending to purchase or not intending examining and commenting on their various points and faces with the same freedom that a set of jockeys discuss the merits of a horse  hulloa alf what brings you here said a young exquisite slapping the shoulder of a sprucelydressed young man who was examining adolph through an eyeglass  well i was wanting a valet and i heard that st clares lot was going i thought id just look at his  catch me ever buying any of st clares people spoilt niggers every one impudent as the devil said the other  never fear that said the first if i get em ill soon have their airs out of them theyll soon find that theyve another kind of master to deal with than monsieur st clare pon my word ill buy that fellow i like the shape of him  youll find itll take all youve got to keep him hes deucedly extravagant  yes but my lord will find that he cant be extravagant with me just let him be sent to the calaboose a few times and thoroughly dressed down ill tell you if it dont bring him to a sense of his ways o ill reform him up hill and downyoull see i buy him thats flat  tom had been standing wistfully examining the multitude of faces thronging around him for one whom he would wish to call master and if you should ever be under the necessity sir of selecting out of two hundred men one who was to become your absolute owner and disposer you would perhaps realize just as tom did how few there were that you would feel at all comfortable in being made over to tom saw abundance of mengreat burly gruff men little chirping dried men longfavored lank hard men and every variety of stubbedlooking commonplace men who pick up their fellowmen as one picks up chips putting them into the fire or a basket with equal unconcern according to their convenience but he saw no st clare  a little before the sale commenced a short broad muscular man in a checked shirt considerably open at the bosom and pantaloons much the worse for dirt and wear elbowed his way through the crowd like one who is going actively into a business and coming up to the group began to examine them systematically from the moment that tom saw him approaching he felt an immediate and revolting horror at him that increased as he came near he was evidently though short of gigantic strength his round bullet head large lightgray eyes with their shaggy sandy eyebrows and stiff wiry sunburned hair were rather unprepossessing items it is to be confessed his large coarse mouth was distended with tobacco the juice of which from time to time he ejected from him with great decision and explosive force his hands were immensely large hairy sunburned freckled and very dirty and garnished with long nails in a very foul condition this man proceeded to a very free personal examination of the lot he seized tom by the jaw and pulled open his mouth to inspect his teeth made him strip up his sleeve to show his muscle turned him round made him jump and spring to show his paces  where was you raised he added briefly to these investigations  in kintuck masr said tom looking about as if for deliverance  what have you done  had care of masrs farm said tom  likely story said the other shortly as he passed on he paused a moment before dolph then spitting a discharge of tobaccojuice on his wellblacked boots and giving a contemptuous umph he walked on again he stopped before susan and emmeline he put out his heavy dirty hand and drew the girl towards him passed it over her neck and bust felt her arms looked at her teeth and then pushed her back against her mother whose patient face showed the suffering she had been going through at every motion of the hideous stranger  the girl was frightened and began to cry  stop that you minx said the salesman no whimpering herethe sale is going to begin and accordingly the sale begun  adolph was knocked off at a good sum to the young gentlemen who had previously stated his intention of buying him and the other servants of the st clare lot went to various bidders  now up with you boy dye hear said the auctioneer to tom  tom stepped upon the block gave a few anxious looks round all seemed mingled in a common indistinct noisethe clatter of the salesman crying off his qualifications in french and english the quick fire of french and english bids and almost in a moment came the final thump of the hammer and the clear ring on the last syllable of the word dollars as the auctioneer announced his price and tom was made overhe had a master  he was pushed from the blockthe short bulletheaded man seizing him roughly by the shoulder pushed him to one side saying in a harsh voice stand there you  tom hardly realized anything but still the bidding went onratting clattering now french now english down goes the hammer againsusan is sold she goes down from the block stops looks wistfully backher daughter stretches her hands towards her she looks with agony in the face of the man who has bought hera respectable middleaged man of benevolent countenance  o masr please do buy my daughter  id like to but im afraid i cant afford it said the gentleman looking with painful interest as the young girl mounted the block and looked around her with a frightened and timid glance  the blood flushes painfully in her otherwise colorless cheek her eye has a feverish fire and her mother groans to see that she looks more beautiful than she ever saw her before the auctioneer sees his advantage and expatiates volubly in mingled french and english and bids rise in rapid succession  ill do anything in reason said the benevolentlooking gentleman pressing in and joining with the bids in a few moments they have run beyond his purse he is silent the auctioneer grows warmer but bids gradually drop off it lies now between an aristocratic old citizen and our bulletheaded acquaintance the citizen bids for a few turns contemptuously measuring his opponent but the bullethead has the advantage over him both in obstinacy and concealed length of purse and the controversy lasts but a moment the hammer fallshe has got the girl body and soul unless god help her  her master is mr legree who owns a cotton plantation on the red river she is pushed along into the same lot with tom and two other men and goes off weeping as she goes  the benevolent gentleman is sorry but then the thing happens every day one sees girls and mothers crying at these sales always it cant be helped c and he walks off with his acquisition in another direction  two days after the lawyer of the christian firm of b  co new york send on their money to them on the reverse of that draft so obtained let them write these words of the great paymaster to whom they shall make up their account in a future day when he maketh inquisition for blood he forgetteth not the cry of the humble    chapter xxxi  the middle passage  thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil and canst not look upon iniquity wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than hehab 1 13   on the lower part of a small mean boat on the red river tom satchains on his wrists chains on his feet and a weight heavier than chains lay on his heart all had faded from his skymoon and star all had passed by him as the trees and banks were now passing to return no more kentucky home with wife and children and indulgent owners st clare home with all its refinements and splendors the golden head of eva with its saintlike eyes the proud gay handsome seemingly careless yet everkind st clare hours of ease and indulgent leisureall gone and in place thereof what remains  it is one of the bitterest apportionments of a lot of slavery that the negro sympathetic and assimilative after acquiring in a refined family the tastes and feelings which form the atmosphere of such a place is not the less liable to become the bondslave of the coarsest and most brutaljust as a chair or table which once decorated the superb saloon comes at last battered and defaced to the barroom of some filthy tavern or some low haunt of vulgar debauchery the great difference is that the table and chair cannot feel and the man can for even a legal enactment that he shall be taken reputed adjudged in law to be a chattel personal cannot blot out his soul with its own private little world of memories hopes loves fears and desires  mr simon legree toms master had purchased slaves at one place and another in new orleans to the number of eight and driven them handcuffed in couples of two and two down to the good steamer pirate which lay at the levee ready for a trip up the red river  having got them fairly on board and the boat being off he came round with that air of efficiency which ever characterized him to take a review of them stopping opposite to tom who had been attired for sale in his best broadcloth suit with wellstarched linen and shining boots he briefly expressed himself as follows  stand up  tom stood up  take off that stock and as tom encumbered by his fetters proceeded to do it he assisted him by pulling it with no gentle hand from his neck and putting it in his pocket  legree now turned to toms trunk which previous to this he had been ransacking and taking from it a pair of old pantaloons and dilapidated coat which tom had been wont to put on about his stablework he said liberating toms hands from the handcuffs and pointing to a recess in among the boxes  you go there and put these on  tom obeyed and in a few moments returned  take off your boots said mr legree  tom did so  there said the former throwing him a pair of coarse stout shoes such as were common among the slaves put these on  in toms hurried exchange he had not forgotten to transfer his cherished bible to his pocket it was well he did so for mr legree having refitted toms handcuffs proceeded deliberately to investigate the contents of his pockets he drew out a silk handkerchief and put it into his own pocket several little trifles which tom had treasured chiefly because they had amused eva he looked upon with a contemptuous grunt and tossed them over his shoulder into the river  toms methodist hymnbook which in his hurry he had forgotten he now held up and turned over  humph pious to be sure so whats yer nameyou belong to the church eh  yes masr said tom firmly  well ill soon have that out of you i have none o yer bawling praying singing niggers on my place so remember now mind yourself he said with a stamp and a fierce glance of his gray eye directed at tom im your church now you understandyouve got to be as i say  something within the silent black man answered no and as if repeated by an invisible voice came the words of an old prophetic scroll as eva had often read them to himfear not for i have redeemed thee i have called thee by name thou art mine  but simon legree heard no voice that voice is one he never shall hear he only glared for a moment on the downcast face of tom and walked off he took toms trunk which contained a very neat and abundant wardrobe to the forecastle where it was soon surrounded by various hands of the boat with much laughing at the expense of niggers who tried to be gentlemen the articles very readily were sold to one and another and the empty trunk finally put up at auction it was a good joke they all thought especially to see how tom looked after his things as they were going this way and that and then the auction of the trunk that was funnier than all and occasioned abundant witticisms  this little affair being over simon sauntered up again to his property  now tom ive relieved you of any extra baggage you see take mighty good care of them clothes itll be long enough fore you get more i go in for making niggers careful one suit has to do for one year on my place  simon next walked up to the place where emmeline was sitting chained to another woman  well my dear he said chucking her under the chin keep up your spirits  the involuntary look of horror fright and aversion with which the girl regarded him did not escape his eye he frowned fiercely  none o your shines gal yous got to keep a pleasant face when i speak to yedye hear and you you old yellow poco moonshine he said giving a shove to the mulatto woman to whom emmeline was chained dont you carry that sort of face yous got to look chipper i tell ye  i say all on ye he said retreating a pace or two back look at melook at melook me right in the eyestraight now said he stamping his foot at every pause  as by a fascination every eye was now directed to the glaring greenishgray eye of simon  now said he doubling his great heavy fist into something resembling a blacksmiths hammer dye see this fist heft it he said bringing it down on toms hand look at these yer bones well i tell ye this yer fist has got as hard as iron knocking down niggers i never see the nigger yet i couldnt bring down with one crack said he bringing his fist down so near to the face of tom that he winked and drew back i dont keep none o yer cussed overseers i does my own overseeing and i tell you things is seen to yous every one on ye got to toe the mark i tell ye quickstraightthe moment i speak thats the way to keep in with me ye wont find no soft spot in me nowhere so now mind yerselves for i dont show no mercy  the women involuntarily drew in their breath and the whole gang sat with downcast dejected faces meanwhile simon turned on his heel and marched up to the bar of the boat for a dram  thats the way i begin with my niggers he said to a gentlemanly man who had stood by him during his speech its my system to begin strongjust let em know what to expect  indeed said the stranger looking upon him with the curiosity of a naturalist studying some outoftheway specimen  yes indeed im none o yer gentlemen planters with lily fingers to slop round and be cheated by some old cuss of an overseer just feel of my knuckles now look at my fist tell ye sir the flesh on t has come jest like a stone practising on niggerfeel on it  the stranger applied his fingers to the implement in question and simply said  t is hard enough and i suppose he added practice has made your heart just like it  why yes i may say so said simon with a hearty laugh i reckon theres as little soft in me as in any one going tell you nobody comes it over me niggers never gets round me neither with squalling nor soft soapthats a fact  you have a fine lot there  real said simon theres that tom they telled me he was suthin uncommon i paid a little high for him tendin him for a driver and a managing chap only get the notions out that hes larnt by bein treated as niggers never ought to be hell do prime the yellow woman i got took in on i rayther think shes sickly but i shall put her through for what shes worth she may last a year or two i dont go for savin niggers use up and buy more s my waymakes you less trouble and im quite sure it comes cheaper in the end and simon sipped his glass  and how long do they generally last said the stranger  well donno cordin as their constitution is stout fellers last six or seven years trashy ones gets worked up in two or three i used to when i fust begun have considerable trouble fussin with em and trying to make em hold outdoctorin on em up when theys sick and givin on em clothes and blankets and what not tryin to keep em all sort o decent and comfortable law t wasnt no sort o use i lost money on em and t was heaps o trouble now you see i just put em straight through sick or well when one niggers dead i buy another and i find it comes cheaper and easier every way  the stranger turned away and seated himself beside a gentleman who had been listening to the conversation with repressed uneasiness  you must not take that fellow to be any specimen of southern planters said he  i should hope not said the young gentleman with emphasis  he is a mean low brutal fellow said the other  and yet your laws allow him to hold any number of human beings subject to his absolute will without even a shadow of protection and low as he is you cannot say that there are not many such  well said the other there are also many considerate and humane men among planters  granted said the young man but in my opinion it is you considerate humane men that are responsible for all the brutality and outrage wrought by these wretches because if it were not for your sanction and influence the whole system could not keep foothold for an hour if there were no planters except such as that one said he pointing with his finger to legree who stood with his back to them the whole thing would go down like a millstone it is your respectability and humanity that licenses and protects his brutality  you certainly have a high opinion of my good nature said the planter smiling but i advise you not to talk quite so loud as there are people on board the boat who might not be quite so tolerant to opinion as i am you had better wait till i get up to my plantation and there you may abuse us all quite at your leisure  the young gentleman colored and smiled and the two were soon busy in a game of backgammon meanwhile another conversation was going on in the lower part of the boat between emmeline and the mulatto woman with whom she was confined as was natural they were exchanging with each other some particulars of their history  who did you belong to said emmeline  well my masr was mr ellislived on leveestreet praps youve seen the house  was he good to you said emmeline  mostly till he tuk sick hes lain sick off and on more than six months and been orful oneasy pears like he warnt willin to have nobody rest day or night and got so curous there couldnt nobody suit him pears like he just grew crosser every day kep me up nights till i got farly beat out and couldnt keep awake no longer and cause i got to sleep one night lors he talk so orful to me and he tell me hed sell me to just the hardest master he could find and hed promised me my freedom too when he died  had you any friends said emmeline  yes my husbandhes a blacksmith masr genly hired him out they took me off so quick i didnt even have time to see him and is got four children o dear me said the woman covering her face with her hands  it is a natural impulse in every one when they hear a tale of distress to think of something to say by way of consolation emmeline wanted to say something but she could not think of anything to say what was there to be said as by a common consent they both avoided with fear and dread all mention of the horrible man who was now their master  true there is religious trust for even the darkest hour the mulatto woman was a member of the methodist church and had an unenlightened but very sincere spirit of piety emmeline had been educated much more intelligentlytaught to read and write and diligently instructed in the bible by the care of a faithful and pious mistress yet would it not try the faith of the firmest christian to find themselves abandoned apparently of god in the grasp of ruthless violence how much more must it shake the faith of christs poor little ones weak in knowledge and tender in years  the boat moved onfreighted with its weight of sorrowup the red muddy turbid current through the abrupt tortuous windings of the red river and sad eyes gazed wearily on the steep redclay banks as they glided by in dreary sameness at last the boat stopped at a small town and legree with his party disembarked    chapter xxxii  dark places   the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty        ps 7420  trailing wearily behind a rude wagon and over a ruder road tom and his associates faced onward  in the wagon was seated simon legree and the two women still fettered together were stowed away with some baggage in the back part of it and the whole company were seeking legrees plantation which lay a good distance off  it was a wild forsaken road now winding through dreary pine barrens where the wind whispered mournfully and now over log causeways through long cypress swamps the doleful trees rising out of the slimy spongy ground hung with long wreaths of funeral black moss while ever and anon the loathsome form of the mocassin snake might be seen sliding among broken stumps and shattered branches that lay here and there rotting in the water  it is disconsolate enough this riding to the stranger who with wellfilled pocket and wellappointed horse threads the lonely way on some errand of business but wilder drearier to the man enthralled whom every weary step bears further from all that man loves and prays for  so one should have thought that witnessed the sunken and dejected expression on those dark faces the wistful patient weariness with which those sad eyes rested on object after object that passed them in their sad journey  simon rode on however apparently well pleased occasionally pulling away at a flask of spirit which he kept in his pocket  i say you he said as he turned back and caught a glance at the dispirited faces behind him strike up a song boyscome  the men looked at each other and the come was repeated with a smart crack of the whip which the driver carried in his hands tom began a methodist hymn       jerusalem my happy home      name ever dear to me      when shall my sorrows have an end      thy joys when shall        jerusalem my happy home anonymous hymn dating from      the latter part of the sixteenth century sung to the tune      of st stephen  words derive from st augustines      meditations  shut up you black cuss roared legree did ye think i wanted any o yer infernal old methodism i say tune up now something real rowdyquick  one of the other men struck up one of those unmeaning songs common among the slaves       masr seed me cotch a coon      high boys high      he laughed to splitdye see the moon      ho ho ho boys ho      ho yo hie oh  the singer appeared to make up the song to his own pleasure generally hitting on rhyme without much attempt at reason and the party took up the chorus at intervals       ho ho ho boys ho      higheoh higheoh  it was sung very boisterouly and with a forced attempt at merriment but no wail of despair no words of impassioned prayer could have had such a depth of woe in them as the wild notes of the chorus as if the poor dumb heart threatenedprisonedtook refuge in that inarticulate sanctuary of music and found there a language in which to breathe its prayer to god there was a prayer in it which simon could not hear he only heard the boys singing noisily and was well pleased he was making them keep up their spirits  well my little dear said he turning to emmeline and laying his hand on her shoulder were almost home  when legree scolded and stormed emmeline was terrified but when he laid his hand on her and spoke as he now did she felt as if she had rather he would strike her the expression of his eyes made her soul sick and her flesh creep involuntarily she clung closer to the mulatto woman by her side as if she were her mother  you didnt ever wear earrings he said taking hold of her small ear with his coarse fingers  no masr said emmeline trembling and looking down  well ill give you a pair when we get home if youre a good girl you neednt be so frightened i dont mean to make you work very hard youll have fine times with me and live like a ladyonly be a good girl  legree had been drinking to that degree that he was inclining to be very gracious and it was about this time that the enclosures of the plantation rose to view the estate had formerly belonged to a gentleman of opulence and taste who had bestowed some considerable attention to the adornment of his grounds having died insolvent it had been purchased at a bargain by legree who used it as he did everything else merely as an implement for moneymaking the place had that ragged forlorn appearance which is always produced by the evidence that the care of the former owner has been left to go to utter decay  what was once a smoothshaven lawn before the house dotted here and there with ornamental shrubs was now covered with frowsy tangled grass with horseposts set up here and there in it where the turf was stamped away and the ground littered with broken pails cobs of corn and other slovenly remains here and there a mildewed jessamine or honeysuckle hung raggedly from some ornamental support which had been pushed to one side by being used as a horsepost what once was a large garden was now all grown over with weeds through which here and there some solitary exotic reared its forsaken head what had been a conservatory had now no windowshades and on the mouldering shelves stood some dry forsaken flowerpots with sticks in them whose dried leaves showed they had once been plants  the wagon rolled up a weedy gravel walk under a noble avenue of china trees whose graceful forms and everspringing foliage seemed to be the only things there that neglect could not daunt or alterlike noble spirits so deeply rooted in goodness as to flourish and grow stronger amid discouragement and decay  the house had been large and handsome it was built in a manner common at the south a wide verandah of two stories running round every part of the house into which every outer door opened the lower tier being supported by brick pillars  but the place looked desolate and uncomfortable some windows stopped up with boards some with shattered panes and shutters hanging by a single hingeall telling of coarse neglect and discomfort  bits of board straw old decayed barrels and boxes garnished the ground in all directions and three or four ferociouslooking dogs roused by the sound of the wagonwheels came tearing out and were with difficulty restrained from laying hold of tom and his companions by the effort of the ragged servants who came after them  ye see what yed get said legree caressing the dogs with grim satisfaction and turning to tom and his companions ye see what yed get if ye try to run off these yer dogs has been raised to track niggers and theyd jest as soon chaw one on ye up as eat their supper so mind yerself how now sambo he said to a ragged fellow without any brim to his hat who was officious in his attentions how have things been going  fust rate masr  quimbo said legree to another who was making zealous demonstrations to attract his attention ye minded what i telled ye  guess i did didnt i  these two colored men were the two principal hands on the plantation legree had trained them in savageness and brutality as systematically as he had his bulldogs and by long practice in hardness and cruelty brought their whole nature to about the same range of capacities it is a common remark and one that is thought to militate strongly against the character of the race that the negro overseer is always more tyrannical and cruel than the white one this is simply saying that the negro mind has been more crushed and debased than the white it is no more true of this race than of every oppressed race the world over the slave is always a tyrant if he can get a chance to be one  legree like some potentates we read of in history governed his plantation by a sort of resolution of forces sambo and quimbo cordially hated each other the plantation hands one and all cordially hated them and by playing off one against another he was pretty sure through one or the other of the three parties to get informed of whatever was on foot in the place  nobody can live entirely without social intercourse and legree encouraged his two black satellites to a kind of coarse familiarity with hima familiarity however at any moment liable to get one or the other of them into trouble for on the slightest provocation one of them always stood ready at a nod to be a minister of his vengeance on the other  as they stood there now by legree they seemed an apt illustration of the fact that brutal men are lower even than animals their coarse dark heavy features their great eyes rolling enviously on each other their barbarous guttural halfbrute intonation their dilapidated garments fluttering in the windwere all in admirable keeping with the vile and unwholesome character of everything about the place  here you sambo said legree take these yer boys down to the quarters and heres a gal ive got for you said he as he separated the mulatto woman from emmeline and pushed her towards himi promised to bring you one you know  the woman gave a start and drawing back said suddenly  o masr i left my old man in new orleans  what of that you wont you want one here none o your wordsgo long said legree raising his whip  come mistress he said to emmeline you go in here with me  a dark wild face was seen for a moment to glance at the window of the house and as legree opened the door a female voice said something in a quick imperative tone tom who was looking with anxious interest after emmeline as she went in noticed this and heard legree answer angrily you may hold your tongue ill do as i please for all you  tom heard no more for he was soon following sambo to the quarters the quarters was a little sort of street of rude shanties in a row in a part of the plantation far off from the house they had a forlorn brutal forsaken air toms heart sunk when he saw them he had been comforting himself with the thought of a cottage rude indeed but one which he might make neat and quiet and where he might have a shelf for his bible and a place to be alone out of his laboring hours he looked into several they were mere rude shells destitute of any species of furniture except a heap of straw foul with dirt spread confusedly over the floor which was merely the bare ground trodden hard by the tramping of innumerable feet  which of these will be mine said he to sambo submissively  dunno ken turn in here i spose said sambo spects thars room for another thar thars a pretty smart heap o niggers to each on em now sure i dunno what i s to do with more   it was late in the evening when the weary occupants of the shanties came flocking homemen and women in soiled and tattered garments surly and uncomfortable and in no mood to look pleasantly on newcomers the small village was alive with no inviting sounds hoarse guttural voices contending at the handmills where their morsel of hard corn was yet to be ground into meal to fit it for the cake that was to constitute their only supper from the earliest dawn of the day they had been in the fields pressed to work under the driving lash of the overseers for it was now in the very heat and hurry of the season and no means was left untried to press every one up to the top of their capabilities true says the negligent lounger picking cotton isnt hard work isnt it and it isnt much inconvenience either to have one drop of water fall on your head yet the worst torture of the inquisition is produced by drop after drop drop after drop falling moment after moment with monotonous succession on the same spot and work in itself not hard becomes so by being pressed hour after hour with unvarying unrelenting sameness with not even the consciousness of freewill to take from its tediousness tom looked in vain among the gang as they poured along for companionable faces he saw only sullen scowling imbruted men and feeble discouraged women or women that were not womenthe strong pushing away the weakthe gross unrestricted animal selfishness of human beings of whom nothing good was expected and desired and who treated in every way like brutes had sunk as nearly to their level as it was possible for human beings to do to a late hour in the night the sound of the grinding was protracted for the mills were few in number compared with the grinders and the weary and feeble ones were driven back by the strong and came on last in their turn  ho yo said sambo coming to the mulatto woman and throwing down a bag of corn before her what a cuss yo name  lucy said the woman  wal lucy yo my woman now yo grind dis yer corn and get my supper baked ye har  i ant your woman and i wont be said the woman with the sharp sudden courage of despair you go long  ill kick yo then said sambo raising his foot threateningly  ye may kill me if ye choosethe sooner the better wisht i was dead said she  i say sambo you go to spilin the hands ill tell masr o you said quimbo who was busy at the mill from which he had viciously driven two or three tired women who were waiting to grind their corn  and ill tell him ye wont let the women come to the mills yo old nigger said sambo yo jes keep to yo own row  tom was hungry with his days journey and almost faint for want of food  thar yo said quimbo throwing down a coarse bag which contained a peck of corn thar nigger grab take car on tyo wont get no more dis yer week  tom waited till a late hour to get a place at the mills and then moved by the utter weariness of two women whom he saw trying to grind their corn there he ground for them put together the decaying brands of the fire where many had baked cakes before them and then went about getting his own supper it was a new kind of work therea deed of charity small as it was but it woke an answering touch in their heartsan expression of womanly kindness came over their hard faces they mixed his cake for him and tended its baking and tom sat down by the light of the fire and drew out his biblefor he had need for comfort  whats that said one of the woman  a bible said tom  good lord hant seen un since i was in kentuck  was you raised in kentuck said tom with interest  yes and well raised too never spected to come to dis yer said the woman sighing  whats dat ar book any way said the other woman  why the bible  laws a me whats dat said the woman  do tell you never hearn on t said the other woman i used to har missis a readin on t

ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest  thems good words enough said the woman who says em  the lord said tom  i jest wish i knowd whar to find him said the woman i would go pears like i never should get rested again my flesh is fairly sore and i tremble all over every day and sambos allers a jawin at me cause i doesnt pick faster and nights its most midnight fore i can get my

you ant gwine to make me believe dat ar i know de lord ant here said the woman tant no use talking though is jest gwine to camp down and sleep while i ken  the women went off to their cabins and tom sat alone by the smouldering fire that flickered up redly in his face  the silver fairbrowed moon rose in the purple sky and looked down calm and silent as god looks on the scene of misery and oppressionlooked calmly on the lone black man as he sat with his arms folded and his bible on his knee  is god here ah how is it possible for the untaught heart to keep its faith unswerving in the face of dire misrule and palpable unrebuked injustice in that simple heart waged a fierce conflict the crushing sense of wrong the foreshadowing of a whole life of future misery the wreck of all past hopes mournfully tossing in the souls sight like dead corpses of wife and child and friend rising from the dark wave and surging in the face of the halfdrowned mariner ah was it easy here to believe and hold fast the great password of christian faith that god is and is the rewarder of them that diligently seek him  tom rose disconsolate and stumbled into the cabin that had been allotted to him the floor was already strewn with weary sleepers and the foul air of the place almost repelled him but the heavy nightdews were chill and his limbs weary and wrapping about him a tattered blanket which formed his only bedclothing he stretched himself in the straw and fell asleep  in dreams a gentle voice came over his ear he was sitting on the mossy seat in the garden by lake pontchartrain and eva with her serious eyes bent downward was reading to him from the bible and he heard her read  when thou passest through the waters i will be with thee and the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walkest through the fire thou shalt not be burned neither shall the flame kindle upon thee for i am the lord thy god the holy one of israel thy saviour  gradually the words seemed to melt and fade as in a divine music the child raised her deep eyes and fixed them lovingly on him and rays of warmth and comfort seemed to go from them to his heart and as if wafted on the music she seemed to rise on shining wings from which flakes and spangles of gold fell off like stars and she was gone  tom woke was it a dream let it pass for one but who shall say that that sweet young spirit which in life so yearned to comfort and console the distressed was forbidden of god to assume this ministry after death       it is a beautiful belief      that ever round our head      are hovering on angel wings      the spirits of the dead    chapter xxxiii  cassy   and behold the tears of such as were oppressed and they had no comforter and on the side of their oppressors there was power but they had no comfortereccl 41  it took but a short time to familiarize tom with all that was to be hoped or feared in his new way of life he was an expert and efficient workman in whatever he undertook and was both from habit and principle prompt and faithful quiet and peaceable in his disposition he hoped by unremitting diligence to avert from himself at least a portion of the evils of his condition he saw enough of abuse and misery to make him sick and weary but he determined to toil on with religious patience committing himself to him that judgeth righteously not without hope that some way of escape might yet be opened to him  legree took a silent note of toms availability he rated him as a firstclass hand and yet he felt a secret dislike to himthe native antipathy of bad to good he saw plainly that when as was often the case his violence and brutality fell on the helpless tom took notice of it for so subtle is the atmosphere of opinion that it will make itself felt without words and the opinion even of a slave may annoy a master tom in various ways manifested a tenderness of feeling a commiseration for his fellowsufferers strange and new to them which was watched with a jealous eye by legree he had purchased tom with a view of eventually making him a sort of overseer with whom he might at times intrust his affairs in short absences and in his view the first second and third requisite for that place was hardness legree made up his mind that as tom was not hard to his hand he would harden him forthwith and some few weeks after tom had been on the place he determined to commence the process  one morning when the hands were mustered for the field tom noticed with surprise a new comer among them whose appearance excited his attention it was a woman tall and slenderly formed with remarkably delicate hands and feet and dressed in neat and respectable garments by the appearance of her face she might have been between thirtyfive and forty and it was a face that once seen could never be forgottenone of those that at a glance seem to convey to us an idea of a wild painful and romantic history her forehead was high and her eyebrows marked with beautiful clearness her straight wellformed nose her finelycut mouth and the graceful contour of her head and neck showed that she must once have been beautiful but her face was deeply wrinkled with lines of pain and of proud and bitter endurance her complexion was sallow and unhealthy her cheeks thin her features sharp and her whole form emaciated but her eye was the most remarkable featureso large so heavily black overshadowed by long lashes of equal darkness and so wildly mournfully despairing there was a fierce pride and defiance in every line of her face in every curve of the flexible lip in every motion of her body but in her eye was a deep settled night of anguishan expression so hopeless and unchanging as to contrast fearfully with the scorn and pride expressed by her whole demeanor  where she came from or who she was tom did not know the first he did know she was walking by his side erect and proud in the dim gray of the dawn to the gang however she was known for there was much looking and turning of heads and a smothered yet apparent exultation among the miserable ragged halfstarved creatures by whom she was surrounded  got to come to it at lastglad of it said one  he he he said another youll know how good it is misse  well see her work  wonder if shell get a cutting up at night like the rest of us  id be glad to see her down for a flogging ill bound said another  the woman took no notice of these taunts but walked on with the same expression of angry scorn as if she heard nothing tom had always lived among refined and cultivated people and he felt intuitively from her air and bearing that she belonged to that class but how or why she could be fallen to those degrading circumstances he could not tell the women neither looked at him nor spoke to him though all the way to the field she kept close at his side  tom was soon busy at his work but as the woman was at no great distance from him he often glanced an eye to her at her work he saw at a glance that a native adroitness and handiness made the task to her an easier one than it proved to many she picked very fast and very clean and with an air of scorn as if she despised both the work and the disgrace and humiliation of the circumstances in which she was placed  in the course of the day tom was working near the mulatto woman who had been bought in the same lot with himself she was evidently in a condition of great suffering and tom often heard her praying as she wavered and trembled and seemed about to fall down tom silently as he came near to her transferred several handfuls of cotton from his own sack to hers  o dont dont said the woman looking surprised itll get you into trouble  just then sambo came up he seemed to have a special spite against this woman and flourishing his whip said in brutal guttural tones what dis yer lucefoolin a and with the word kicking the woman with his heavy cowhide shoe he struck tom across the face with his whip  tom silently resumed his task but the woman before at the last point of exhaustion fainted  ill bring her to said the driver with a brutal grin ill give her something better than camphire and taking a pin from his coatsleeve he buried it to the head in her flesh the woman groaned and half rose get up you beast and work will yer or ill show yer a trick more  the woman seemed stimulated for a few moments to an unnatural strength and worked with desperate eagerness  see that you keep to dat ar said the man or yerll wish yers dead tonight i reckin  that i do now tom heard her say and again he heard her say o lord how long o lord why dont you help us  at the risk of all that he might suffer tom came forward again and put all the cotton in his sack into the womans  o you mustnt you donno what theyll do to ye said the woman  i can bar it said tom better n you and he was at his place again it passed in a moment  suddenly the stranger woman whom we have described and who had in the course of her work come near enough to hear toms last words raised her heavy black eyes and fixed them for a second on him then taking a quantity of cotton from her basket she placed it in his  you know nothing about this place she said or you wouldnt have done that when youve been here a month youll be done helping anybody youll find it hard enough to take care of your own skin  the lord forbid missis said tom using instinctively to his field companion the respectful form proper to the high bred with whom he had lived  the lord never visits these parts said the woman bitterly as she went nimbly forward with her work and again the scornful smile curled her lips  but the action of the woman had been seen by the driver across the field and flourishing his whip he came up to her  what what he said to the woman with an air of triumph you a foolin go along yer under me nowmind yourself or yerll cotch it  a glance like sheetlightning suddenly flashed from those black eyes and facing about with quivering lip and dilated nostrils she drew herself up and fixed a glance blazing with rage and scorn on the driver  dog she said touch me if you dare ive power enough yet to have you torn by the dogs burnt alive cut to inches ive only to say the word  what de devil you here for den said the man evidently cowed and sullenly retreating a step or two didnt mean no harm misse cassy  keep your distance then said the woman and in truth the man seemed greatly inclined to attend to something at the other end of the field and started off in quick time  the woman suddenly turned to her work and labored with a despatch that was perfectly astonishing to tom she seemed to work by magic before the day was through her basket was filled crowded down and piled and she had several times put largely into toms long after dusk the whole weary train with their baskets on their heads defiled up to the building appropriated to the storing and weighing the cotton legree was there busily conversing with the two drivers  dat ar toms gwine to make a powerful deal o trouble kept a puttin into lucys basketone o these yer dat will get all der niggers to feelin bused if masir dont watch him said sambo  heydey the black cuss said legree hell have to get a breakin in wont he boys  both negroes grinned a horrid grin at this intimation  ay ay let masr legree alone for breakin in de debil heself couldnt beat masr

agin lucy  well masr knows she sot herself up agin masr and wouldnt have me when he telled her to  id a flogged her into t said legree spitting only theres such a press o work it dont seem wuth a

for her  he did eh wal then tom shall have the pleasure of flogging her itll be a good practice for him and he wont put it on to the gal like you devils neither  ho ho haw haw haw laughed both the sooty wretches and the diabolical sounds seemed in truth a not unapt expression of the fiendish character which legree gave them  wal but masr tom and misse cassy and dey among em filled lucys basket i ruther guess der weight s in it masr  i do the weighing said legree emphatically  both the drivers again laughed their diabolical laugh  so he added misse cassy did her days work  she picks like de debil and all his angels  shes got em all in her i believe said legree and growling a brutal oath he proceeded to the weighingroom   slowly the weary dispirited creatures wound their way into the room and with crouching reluctance presented their baskets to be weighed  legree noted on a slate on the side of which was pasted a list of names the amount  toms basket was weighed and approved and he looked with an anxious glance for the success of the woman he had befriended  tottering with weakness she came forward and delivered her basket it was of full weight as legree well perceived but affecting anger he said  what you lazy beast short again stand aside youll catch it pretty soon  the woman gave a groan of utter despair and sat down on a board  the person who had been called misse cassy now came forward and with a haughty negligent air delivered her basket as she delivered it legree looked in her eyes with a sneering yet inquiring glance  she fixed her black eyes steadily on him her lips moved slightly and she said something in french what it was no one knew but legrees face became perfectly demoniacal in its expression as she spoke he half raised his hand as if to strikea gesture which she regarded with fierce disdain as she turned and walked away  and now said legree come here you tom you see i telled ye i didnt buy ye jest for the common work i mean to promote ye and make a driver of ye and tonight ye may jest as well begin to get yer hand in now ye jest take this yer gal and flog her yeve seen enough ont to know how  i beg masrs pardon said tom hopes masr wont set me at that its what i ant used tonever didand cant do no way possible  yell larn a pretty smart chance of things ye never did know before ive done with ye said legree taking up a cowhide and striking tom a heavy blow cross the cheek and following up the infliction by a shower of blows  there he said as he stopped to rest now will ye tell me ye cant do it  yes masr said tom putting up his hand to wipe the blood that trickled down his face im willin to work night and day and work while theres life and breath in me but this yer thing i cant feel it right to doand masr i never shall do itnever  tom had a remarkably smooth soft voice and a habitually respectful manner that had given legree an idea that he would be cowardly and easily subdued when he spoke these last words a thrill of amazement went through every one the poor woman clasped her hands and said o lord and every one involuntarily looked at each other and drew in their breath as if to prepare for the storm that was about to burst  legree looked stupefied and confounded but at last burst forthwhat ye blasted black beast tell me ye dont think it right to do what i tell ye what have any of you cussed cattle to do with thinking whats right ill put a stop to it why what do ye think ye are may be ye think yer a gentleman master tom to be a telling your master whats right and what aint so you pretend its wrong to flog the gal  i think so masr said tom the poor critturs sick and feeble t would be downright cruel and its what i never will do nor begin to masr if you mean to kill me kill me but as to my raising my hand agin any one here i never shallill die first  tom spoke in a mild voice but with a decision that could not be mistaken legree shook with anger his greenish eyes glared fiercely and his very whiskers seemed to curl with passion but like some ferocious beast that plays with its victim before he devours it he kept back his strong impulse to proceed to immediate violence and broke out into bitter raillery  well heres a pious dog at last let down among us sinnersa saint a gentleman and no less to talk to us sinners about our sins powerful holy critter he must be here you rascal you make believe to be so piousdidnt you never hear out of yer bible servants obey yer masters ant i yer master didnt i pay down twelve hundred dollars cash for all there is inside yer old cussed black shell ant yer mine now body and soul he said giving tom a violent kick with his heavy boot tell me  in the very depth of physical suffering bowed by brutal oppression this question shot a gleam of joy and triumph through toms soul he suddenly stretched himself up and looking earnestly to heaven while the tears and blood that flowed down his face mingled he exclaimed  no no no my soul ant yours masr you havent bought itye cant buy it its been bought and paid for by one that is able to keep itno matter no matter you cant harm me  i cant said legree with a sneer well seewell see here sambo quimbo give this dog such a breakin in as he wont get over this month  the two gigantic negroes that now laid hold of tom with fiendish exultation in their faces might have formed no unapt personification of powers of darkness the poor woman screamed with apprehension and all rose as by a general impulse while they dragged him unresisting from the place    chapter xxxiv  the quadroons story   and behold the tears of such as are oppressed and on the side of their oppressors there was power wherefore i praised the dead that are already dead more than the living that are yet aliveeccl 41  it was late at night and tom lay groaning and bleeding alone in an old forsaken room of the ginhouse among pieces of broken machinery piles of damaged cotton and other rubbish which had there accumulated  the night was damp and close and the thick air swarmed with myriads of mosquitos which increased the restless torture of his wounds whilst a burning thirsta torture beyond all othersfilled up the uttermost measure of physical anguish  o good lord do look downgive me the victorygive me the victory over all prayed poor tom in his anguish  a footstep entered the room behind him and the light of a lantern flashed on his eyes  whos there o for the lords massy please give me some water  the woman cassyfor it was sheset down her lantern and pouring water from a bottle raised his head and gave him drink another and another cup were drained with feverish eagerness  drink all ye want she said i knew how it would be it isnt the first time ive been out in the night carrying water to such as you  thank you missis said tom when he had done drinking  dont call me missis im a miserable slave like yourselfa lower one than you can ever be said she bitterly but now said she going to the door and dragging in a small pallaise over which she had spread linen cloths wet with cold water try my poor fellow to roll yourself on to this  stiff with wounds and bruises tom was a long time in accomplishing this movement but when done he felt a sensible relief from the cooling application to his wounds  the woman whom long practice with the victims of brutality had made familiar with many healing arts went on to make many applications to toms wounds by means of which he was soon somewhat relieved  now said the woman when she had raised his head on a roll of damaged cotton which served for a pillow theres the best i can do for you  tom thanked her and the woman sitting down on the floor drew up her knees and embracing them with her arms looked fixedly before her with a bitter and painful expression of countenance her bonnet fell back and long wavy streams of black hair fell around her singular and melancholyface  its no use my poor fellow she broke out at last its of no use this youve been trying to do you were a brave fellowyou had the right on your side but its all in vain and out of the question for you to struggle you are in the devils handshe is the strongest and you must give up  give up and had not human weakness and physical agony whispered that before tom started for the bitter woman with her wild eyes and melancholy voice seemed to him an embodiment of the temptation with which he had been wrestling  o lord o lord he groaned how can i give up  theres no use calling on the lordhe never hears said the woman steadily there isnt any god i believe or if there is hes taken sides against us all goes against us heaven and earth everything is pushing us into hell why shouldnt we go  tom closed his eyes and shuddered at the dark atheistic words  you see said the woman you dont know anything about iti do ive been on this place five years body and soul under this mans foot and i hate him as i do the devil here you are on a lone plantation ten miles from any other in the swamps not a white person here who could testify if you were burned aliveif you were scalded cut into inchpieces set up for the dogs to tear or hung up and whipped to death theres no law here of god or man that can do you or any one of us the least good and this man theres no earthly thing that hes too good to do i could make any ones hair rise and their teeth chatter if i should only tell what ive seen and been knowing to hereand its no use resisting did i want to live with him wasnt i a woman delicately bred and hegod in heaven what was he and is he and yet ive lived with him these five years and cursed every moment of my lifenight and day and now hes got a new onea young thing only fifteen and she brought up she says piously her good mistress taught her to read the bible and shes brought her bible hereto hell with herand the woman laughed a wild and doleful laugh that rung with a strange supernatural sound through the old ruined shed  tom folded his hands all was darkness and horror  o jesus lord jesus have you quite forgot us poor critturs burst forth at lasthelp lord i perish  the woman sternly continued  and what are these miserable low dogs you work with that you should suffer on their account every one of them would turn against you the first time they got a chance they are all of em as low and cruel to each other as they can be theres no use in your suffering to keep from hurting them  poor critturs said tomwhat made em crueland if i give out i shall get used to t and grow little by little just like em no no missis ive lost everythingwife and children and home and a kind masrand he would have set me free if hed only lived a week longer ive lost everything in this world and its clean gone foreverand now i cant lose heaven too no i cant get to be wicked besides all  but it cant be that the lord will lay sin to our account said the woman he wont charge it to us when were forced to it hell charge it to them that drove us to it  yes said tom but that wont keep us from growing wicked if i get to be as hardhearted as that ar sambo and as wicked it wont make much odds to me how i come so its the bein sothat ars what im a dreadin  the woman fixed a wild and startled look on tom as if a new thought had struck her and then heavily groaning said  o god a mercy you speak the truth oooand with groans she fell on the floor like one crushed and writhing under the extremity of mental anguish  there was a silence a while in which the breathing of both parties could be heard when tom faintly said o please missis  the woman suddenly rose up with her face composed to its usual stern melancholy expression  please missis i saw em throw my coat in that ar corner and in my coatpocket is my bibleif missis would please get it for me  cassy went and got it tom opened at once to a heavily marked passage much worn of the last scenes in the life of him by whose stripes we are healed  if missis would only be so good as read that arits better than water  cassy took the book with a dry proud air and looked over the passage she then read aloud in a soft voice and with a beauty of intonation that was peculiar that touching account of anguish and of glory often as she read her voice faltered and sometimes failed her altogether when she would stop with an air of frigid composure till she had mastered herself when she came to the touching words father forgive them for they know not what they do she threw down the book and burying her face in the heavy masses of her hair she sobbed aloud with a convulsive violence  tom was weeping also and occasionally uttering a smothered ejaculation  if we only could keep up to that ar said tomit seemed to come so natural to him and we have to fight so hard for t o lord help us o blessed lord jesus do help us  missis said tom after a while i can see that some how youre quite bove me in everything but theres one thing missis might learn even from poor tom ye said the lord took sides against us because he lets us be bused and knocked round but ye see what come on his own sonthe blessed lord of glorywant he allays poor and have we any on us yet come so low as he come the lord hant forgot usim sartin o that ar if we suffer with him we shall also reign scripture says but if we deny him he also will deny us didnt they all sufferthe lord and all his it tells how they was stoned and sawn asunder and wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins and was destitute afflicted tormented sufferin ant no reason to make us think the lords turned agin us but jest the contrary if only we hold on to him and doesnt give up to sin  but why does he put us where we cant help but sin said the woman  i think we can help it said tom  youll see said cassy whatll you do tomorrow theyll be at you again i know em ive seen all their doings i cant bear to think of all theyll bring you toand theyll make you give out at last  lord jesus said tom you will take care of my soul o lord dodont let me give out  o dear said cassy ive heard all this crying and praying before and yet theyve been broken down and brought under theres emmeline shes trying to hold on and youre tryingbut what use you must give up or be killed by inches  well then i will die said tom spin it out as long as they can they cant help my dying some timeand after that they cant do no more im clar im set i know the lordll help me and bring me through  the woman did not answer she sat with her black eyes intently fixed on the floor  may be its the way she murmured to herself but those that have given up theres no hope for themnone we live in filth and grow loathsome till we loathe ourselves and we long to die and we dont dare to kill ourselvesno hope no hope no hopethis girl nowjust as old as i was  you see me now she said speaking to tom very rapidly see what i am well i was brought up in luxury the first i remember is playing about when i was a child in splendid parlorswhen i was kept dressed up like a doll and company and visitors used to praise me there was a garden opening from the saloon windows and there i used to play hideandgoseek under the orangetrees with my brothers and sisters i went to a convent and there i learned music french and embroidery and what not and when i was fourteen i came out to my fathers funeral he died very suddenly and when the property came to be settled they found that there was scarcely enough to cover the debts and when the creditors took an inventory of the property i was set down in it my mother was a slave woman and my father had always meant to set me free but he had not done it and so i was set down in the list id always known who i was but never thought much about it nobody ever expects that a strong healthy man is going to die my father was a well man only four hours before he diedit was one of the first cholera cases in new orleans the day after the funeral my fathers wife took her children and went up to her fathers plantation i thought they treated me strangely but didnt know there was a young lawyer who they left to settle the business and he came every day and was about the house and spoke very politely to me he brought with him one day a young man whom i thought the handsomest i had ever seen i shall never forget that evening i walked with him in the garden i was lonesome and full of sorrow and he was so kind and gentle to me and he told me that he had seen me before i went to the convent and that he had loved me a great while and that he would be my friend and protectorin short though he didnt tell me he had paid two thousand dollars for me and i was his propertyi became his willingly for i loved him loved said the woman stopping o how i did love that man how i love him nowand always shall while i breathe he was so beautiful so high so noble he put me into a beautiful house with servants horses and carriages and furniture and dresses everything that money could buy he gave me but i didnt set any value on all thati only cared for him i loved him better than my god and my own soul and if i tried i couldnt do any other way from what he wanted me to  i wanted only one thingi did want him to marry me i thought if he loved me as he said he did and if i was what he seemed to think i was he would be willing to marry me and set me free but he convinced me that it would be impossible and he told me that if we were only faithful to each other it was marriage before god if that is true wasnt i that mans wife wasnt i faithful for seven years didnt i study every look and motion and only live and breathe to please him he had the yellow fever and for twenty days and nights i watched with him i aloneand gave him all his medicine and did everything for him and then he called me his good angel and said id saved his life we had two beautiful children the first was a boy and we called him henry he was the image of his fatherhe had such beautiful eyes such a forehead and his hair hung all in curls around it and he had all his fathers spirit and his talent too little elise he said looked like me he used to tell me that i was the most beautiful woman in louisiana he was so proud of me and the children he used to love to have me dress them up and take them and me about in an open carriage and hear the remarks that people would make on us and he used to fill my ears constantly with the fine things that were said in praise of me and the children o those were happy days i thought i was as happy as any one could be but then there came evil times he had a cousin come to new orleans who was his particular friendhe thought all the world of himbut from the first time i saw him i couldnt tell why i dreaded him for i felt sure he was going to bring misery on us he got henry to going out with him and often he would not come home nights till two or three oclock i did not dare say a word for henry was so high spirited i was afraid to he got him to the gaminghouses and he was one of the sort that when he once got a going there there was no holding back and then he introduced him to another lady and i saw soon that his heart was gone from me he never told me but i saw iti knew it day after dayi felt my heart breaking but i could not say a word at this the wretch offered to buy me and the children of henry to clear off his gambling debts which stood in the way of his marrying as he wishedand he sold us he told me one day that he had business in the country and should be gone two or three weeks he spoke kinder than usual and said he should come back but it didnt deceive me i knew that the time had come i was just like one turned into stone i couldnt speak nor shed a tear he kissed me and kissed the children a good many times and went out i saw him get on his horse and i watched him till he was quite out of sight and then i fell down and fainted  then he came the cursed wretch he came to take possession he told me that he had bought me and my children and showed me the papers i cursed him before god and told him id die sooner than live with him  just as you please said he but if you dont behave reasonably ill sell both the children where you shall never see them again he told me that he always had meant to have me from the first time he saw me and that he had drawn henry on and got him in debt on purpose to make him willing to sell me that he got him in love with another woman and that i might know after all that that he should not give up for a few airs and tears and things of that sort  i gave up for my hands were tied he had my childrenwhenever i resisted his will anywhere he would talk about selling them and he made me as submissive as he desired o what a life it was to live with my heart breaking every dayto keep on on on loving when it was only misery and to be bound body and soul to one i hated i used to love to read to henry to play to him to waltz with him and sing to him but everything i did for this one was a perfect dragyet i was afraid to refuse anything he was very imperious and harsh to the children elise was a timid little thing but henry was bold and highspirited like his father and he had never been brought under in the least by any one he was always finding fault and quarrelling with him and i used to live in daily fear and dread i tried to make the child respectfuli tried to keep them apart for i held on to those children like death but it did no good he sold both those children he took me to ride one day and when i came home they were nowhere to be found he told me he had sold them he showed me the money the price of their blood then it seemed as if all good forsook me i raved and cursedcursed god and man and for a while i believe he really was afraid of me but he didnt give up so he told me that my children were sold but whether i ever saw their faces again depended on him and that if i wasnt quiet they should smart for it well you can do anything with a woman when youve got her children he made me submit he made me be peaceable he flattered me with hopes that perhaps he would buy them back and so things went on a week or two one day i was out walking and passed by the calaboose i saw a crowd about the gate and heard a childs voiceand suddenly my henry broke away from two or three men who were holding him and ran screaming and caught my dress they came up to him swearing dreadfully and one man whose face i shall never forget told him that he wouldnt get away so that he was going with him into the calaboose and hed get a lesson there hed never forget i tried to beg and pleadthey only laughed the poor boy screamed and looked into my face and held on to me until in tearing him off they tore the skirt of my dress half away and they carried him in screaming mother mother mother there was one man stood there seemed to pity me i offered him all the money i had if hed only interfere he shook his head and said that the boy had been impudent and disobedient ever since he bought him that he was going to break him in once for all i turned and ran and every step of the way i thought that i heard him scream i got into the house ran all out of breath to the parlor where i found butler i told him and begged him to go and interfere he only laughed and told me the boy had got his deserts hed got to be broken inthe sooner the better what did i expect he asked  it seemed to me something in my head snapped at that moment i felt dizzy and furious i remember seeing a great sharp bowieknife on the table i remember something about catching it and flying upon him and then all grew dark and i didnt know any morenot for days and days  when i came to myself i was in a nice roombut not mine an old black woman tended me and a doctor came to see me and there was a great deal of care taken of me after a while i found that he had gone away and left me at this house to be sold and thats why they took such pains with me  i didnt mean to get well and hoped i shouldnt but in spite of me the fever went off and i grew healthy and finally got up then they made me dress up every day and gentlemen used to come in and stand and smoke their cigars and look at me and ask questions and debate my price i was so gloomy and silent that none of them wanted me they threatened to whip me if i wasnt gayer and didnt take some pains to make myself agreeable at length one day came a gentleman named stuart he seemed to have some feeling for me he saw that something dreadful was on my heart and he came to see me alone a great many times and finally persuaded me to tell him he bought me at last and promised to do all he could to find and buy back my children he went to the hotel where my henry was they told him he had been sold to a planter up on pearl river that was the last that i ever heard then he found where my daughter was an old woman was keeping her he offered an immense sum for her but they would not sell her butler found out that it was for me he wanted her and he sent me word that i should never have her captain stuart was very kind to me he had a splendid plantation and took me to it in the course of a year i had a son born o that childhow i loved it how just like my poor henry the little thing looked but i had made up my mindyes i had i would never again let a child live to grow up i took the little fellow in my arms when he was two weeks old and kissed him and cried over him and then i gave him laudanum and held him close to my bosom while he slept to death how i mourned and cried over it and who ever dreamed that it was anything but a mistake that had made me give it the laudanum but its one of the few things that im glad of now i am not sorry to this day he at least is out of pain what better than death could i give him poor child after a while the cholera came and captain stuart died everybody died that wanted to liveand ii though i went down to deaths doori lived then i was sold and passed from hand to hand till i grew faded and wrinkled and i had a fever and then this wretch bought me and brought me hereand here i am  the woman stopped she had hurried on through her story with a wild passionate utterance sometimes seeming to address it to tom and sometimes speaking as in a soliloquy so vehement and overpowering was the force with which she spoke that for a season tom was beguiled even from the pain of his wounds and raising himself on one elbow watched her as she paced restlessly up and down her long black hair swaying heavily about her as she moved  you tell me she said after a pause that there is a goda god that looks down and sees all these things may be its so the sisters in the convent used to tell me of a day of judgment when everything is coming to lightwont there be vengeance then  they think its nothing what we suffernothing what our children suffer its all a small matter yet ive walked the streets when it seemed as if i had misery enough in my one heart to sink the city ive wished the houses would fall on me or the stones sink under me yes and in the judgment day i will stand up before god a witness against those that have ruined me and my children body and soul  when i was a girl i thought i was religious i used to love god and prayer now im a lost soul pursued by devils that torment me day and night they keep pushing me on and onand ill do it too some of these days she said clenching her hand while an insane light glanced in her heavy black eyes ill send him where he belongsa short way tooone of these nights if they burn me alive for it a wild long laugh rang through the deserted room and ended in a hysteric sob she threw herself on the floor in convulsive sobbing and struggles  in a few moments the frenzy fit seemed to pass off she rose slowly and seemed to collect herself  can i do anything more for you my poor fellow she said approaching where tom lay shall i give you some more water  there was a graceful and compassionate sweetness in her voice and manner as she said this that formed a strange contrast with the former wildness  tom drank the water and looked earnestly and pitifully into her face  o missis i wish youd go to him that can give you living waters  go to him where is he who is he said cassy  him that you read of to methe lord  i used to see the picture of him over the altar when i was a girl said cassy her dark eyes fixing themselves in an expression of mournful reverie but he isnt here theres nothing here but sin and long long long despair o she laid her land on her breast and drew in her breath as if to lift a heavy weight  tom looked as if he would speak again but she cut him short with a decided gesture  dont talk my poor fellow try to sleep if you can and placing water in his reach and making whatever little arrangements for his comforts she could cassy left the shed    chapter xxxv  the tokens       and slight withal may be the things that bring      back on the heart the weight which it would fling      aside forever it may be a sound      a flower the wind the ocean which shall wound      striking the electric chain wherewith were darkly bound      childe harolds pilgrimage can 4  the sittingroom of legrees establishment was a large long room with a wide ample fireplace it had once been hung with a showy and expensive paper which now hung mouldering torn and discolored from the damp walls the place had that peculiar sickening unwholesome smell compounded of mingled damp dirt and decay which one often notices in close old houses the wallpaper was defaced in spots by slops of beer and wine or garnished with chalk memorandums and long sums footed up as if somebody had been practising arithmetic there in the fireplace stood a brazier full of burning charcoal for though the weather was not cold the evenings always seemed damp and chilly in that great room and legree moreover wanted a place to light his cigars and heat his water for punch the ruddy glare of the charcoal displayed the confused and unpromising aspect of the roomsaddles bridles several sorts of harness ridingwhips overcoats and various articles of clothing scattered up and down the room in confused variety and the dogs of whom we have before spoken had encamped themselves among them to suit their own taste and convenience  legree was just mixing himself a tumbler of punch pouring his hot water from a cracked and brokennosed pitcher grumbling as he did so  plague on that sambo to kick up this yer row between me and the new hands the fellow wont be fit to work for a week nowright in the press of the season  yes just like you said a voice behind his chair it was the woman cassy who had stolen upon his soliloquy  hah you shedevil youve come back have you  yes i have she said coolly come to have my own way too  you lie you jade ill be up to my word either behave yourself or stay down to the quarters and fare and work with the rest  id rather ten thousand times said the woman live in the dirtiest hole at the quarters than be under your hoof  but you are under my hoof for all that said he turning upon her with a savage grin thats one comfort so sit down here on my knee my dear and hear to reason said he laying hold on her wrist  simon legree take care said the woman with a sharp flash of her eye a glance so wild and insane in its light as to be almost appalling youre afraid of me simon she said deliberately and youve reason to be but be careful for ive got the devil in me  the last words she whispered in a hissing tone close to his ear  get out i believe to my soul you have said legree pushing her from him and looking uncomfortably at her after all cassy he said why cant you be friends with me as you used to  used to said she bitterly she stopped shorta word of choking feelings rising in her heart kept her silent  cassy had always kept over legree the kind of influence that a strong impassioned woman can ever keep over the most brutal man but of late she had grown more and more irritable and restless under the hideous yoke of her servitude and her irritability at times broke out into raving insanity and this liability made her a sort of object of dread to legree who had that superstitious horror of insane persons which is common to coarse and uninstructed minds when legree brought emmeline to the house all the smouldering embers of womanly feeling flashed up in the worn heart of cassy and she took part with the girl and a fierce quarrel ensued between her and legree legree in a fury swore she should be put to field service if she would not be peaceable cassy with proud scorn declared she would go to the field and she worked there one day as we have described to show how perfectly she scorned the threat  legree was secretly uneasy all day for cassy had an influence over him from which he could not free himself when she presented her basket at the scales he had hoped for some concession and addressed her in a sort of half conciliatory half scornful tone and she had answered with the bitterest contempt  the outrageous treatment of poor tom had roused her still more and she had followed legree to the house with no particular intention but to upbraid him for his brutality  i wish cassy said legree youd behave yourself decently  you talk about behaving decently and what have you been doingyou who havent even sense enough to keep from spoiling one of your best hands right in the most pressing season just for your devilish temper  i was a fool its a fact to let any such brangle come up said legree but when the boy set up his will he had to be broke in  i reckon you wont break him in  wont i said legree rising passionately id like to know if i wont hell be the first nigger that ever came it round me ill break every bone in his body but he shall give up  just then the door opened and sambo entered he came forward bowing and holding out something in a paper  whats that you dog said legree  its a witch thing masr  a what  something that niggers gets from witches keeps em from feelin when they s flogged he had it tied round his neck with a black string  legree like most godless and cruel men was superstitious he took the paper and opened it uneasily  there dropped out of it a silver dollar and a long shining curl of fair hairhair which like a living thing twined itself round legrees fingers  damnation he screamed in sudden passion stamping on the floor and pulling furiously at the hair as if it burned him where did this come from take it offburn it upburn it up he screamed tearing it off and throwing it into the charcoal what did you bring it to me for  sambo stood with his heavy mouth wide open and aghast with wonder and cassy who was preparing to leave the apartment stopped and looked at him in perfect amazement  dont you bring me any more of your devilish things said he shaking his fist at sambo who retreated hastily towards the door and picking up the silver dollar he sent it smashing through the windowpane out into the darkness  sambo was glad to make his escape when he was gone legree seemed a little ashamed of his fit of alarm he sat doggedly down in his chair and began sullenly sipping his tumbler of punch  cassy prepared herself for going out unobserved by him and slipped away to minister to poor tom as we have already related  and what was the matter with legree and what was there in a simple curl of fair hair to appall that brutal man familiar with every form of cruelty to answer this we must carry the reader backward in his history hard and reprobate as the godless man seemed now there had been a time when he had been rocked on the bosom of a mothercradled with prayers and pious hymnshis now seared brow bedewed with the waters of holy baptism in early childhood a fairhaired woman had led him at the sound of sabbath bell to worship and to pray far in new england that mother had trained her only son with long unwearied love and patient prayers born of a hardtempered sire on whom that gentle woman had wasted a world of unvalued love legree had followed in the steps of his father boisterous unruly and tyrannical he despised all her counsel and would none of her reproof and at an early age broke from her to seek his fortunes at sea he never came home but once after and then his mother with the yearning of a heart that must love something and has nothing else to love clung to him and sought with passionate prayers and entreaties to win him from a life of sin to his souls eternal good  that was legrees day of grace then good angels called him then he was almost persuaded and mercy held him by the hand his heart inly relentedthere was a conflictbut sin got the victory and he set all the force of his rough nature against the conviction of his conscience he drank and sworewas wilder and more brutal than ever and one night when his mother in the last agony of her despair knelt at his feet he spurned her from himthrew her senseless on the floor and with brutal curses fled to his ship the next legree heard of his mother was when one night as he was carousing among drunken companions a letter was put into his hand he opened it and a lock of long curling hair fell from it and twined about his fingers the letter told him his mother was dead and that dying she blest and forgave him  there is a dread unhallowed necromancy of evil that turns things sweetest and holiest to phantoms of horror and affright that pale loving motherher dying prayers her forgiving lovewrought in that demoniac heart of sin only as a damning sentence bringing with it a fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation legree burned the hair and burned the letter and when he saw them hissing and crackling in the flame inly shuddered as he thought of everlasting fires he tried to drink and revel and swear away the memory but often in the deep night whose solemn stillness arraigns the bad soul in forced communion with herself he had seen that pale mother rising by his bedside and felt the soft twining of that hair around his fingers till the cold sweat would roll down his face and he would spring from his bed in horror ye who have wondered to hear in the same evangel that god is love and that god is a consuming fire see ye not how to the soul resolved in evil perfect love is the most fearful torture the seal and sentence of the direst despair  blast it said legree to himself as he sipped his liquor where did he get that if it didnt look just likewhoo i thought id forgot that curse me if i think theres any such thing as forgetting anything any howhang it im lonesome i mean to call em she hates methe monkey i dont careill make her come  legree stepped out into a large entry which went up stairs by what had formerly been a superb winding staircase but the passageway was dirty and dreary encumbered with boxes and unsightly litter the stairs uncarpeted seemed winding up in the gloom to nobody knew where the pale moonlight streamed through a shattered fanlight over the door the air was unwholesome and chilly like that of a vault  legree stopped at the foot of the stairs and heard a voice singing it seemed strange and ghostlike in that dreary old house perhaps because of the already tremulous state of his nerves hark what is it  a wild pathetic voice chants a hymn common among the slaves       o therell be mourning mourning mourning      o therell be mourning at the judgmentseat of christ  blast the girl said legree ill choke herem em he called harshly but only a mocking echo from the walls answered him the sweet voice still sung on       parents and children there shall part      parents and children there shall part      shall part to meet no more  and clear and loud swelled through the empty halls the refrain       o therell be mourning mourning mourning      o therell be mourning at the judgmentseat of christ  legree stopped he would have been ashamed to tell of it but large drops of sweat stood on his forehead his heart beat heavy and thick with fear he even thought he saw something white rising and glimmering in the gloom before him and shuddered to think what if the form of his dead mother should suddenly appear to him  i know one thing he said to himself as he stumbled back in the sittingroom and sat down ill let that fellow alone after this what did i want of his cussed paper i blieve i am bewitched sure enough ive been shivering and sweating ever since where did he get that hair it couldnt have been that i burnt that up i know i did it would be a joke if hair could rise from the dead  ah legree that golden tress was charmed each hair had in it a spell of terror and remorse for thee and was used by a mightier power to bind thy cruel hands from inflicting uttermost evil on the helpless  i say said legree stamping and whistling to the dogs wake up some of you and keep me company but the dogs only opened one eye at him sleepily and closed it again  ill have sambo and quimbo up here to sing and dance one of their hell dances and keep off these horrid notions said legree and putting on his hat he went on to the verandah and blew a horn with which he commonly summoned his two sable drivers  legree was often wont when in a gracious humor to get these two worthies into his sittingroom and after warming them up with whiskey amuse himself by setting them to singing dancing or fighting as the humor took him  it was between one and two oclock at night as cassy was returning from her ministrations to poor tom that she heard the sound of wild shrieking whooping halloing and singing from the sittingroom mingled with the barking of dogs and other symptoms of general uproar  she came up on the verandah steps and looked in legree and both the drivers in a state of furious intoxication were singing whooping upsetting chairs and making all manner of ludicrous and horrid grimaces at each other  she rested her small slender hand on the windowblind and looked fixedly at themthere was a world of anguish scorn and fierce bitterness in her black eyes as she did so would it be a sin to rid the world of such a wretch she said to herself  she turned hurriedly away and passing round to a back door glided up stairs and tapped at emmelines door    chapter xxxvi  emmeline and cassy   cassy entered the room and found emmeline sitting pale with fear in the furthest corner of it as she came in the girl started up nervously but on seeing who it was rushed forward and catching her arm said o cassy is it you im so glad youve come i was afraid it was o you dont know what a horrid noise there has been down stairs all this evening  i ought to know said cassy dryly ive heard it often enough  o cassy do tell mecouldnt we get away from this place i dont care whereinto the swamp among the snakesanywhere couldnt we get somewhere away from here  nowhere but into our graves said cassy  did you ever try  ive seen enough of trying and what comes of it said cassy  id be willing to live in the swamps and gnaw the bark from trees i ant afraid of snakes id rather have one near me than him said emmeline eagerly  there have been a good many here of your opinion said cassy but you couldnt stay in the swampsyoud be tracked by the dogs and brought back and thenthen  what would he do said the girl looking with breathless interest into her face  what wouldnt he do youd better ask said cassy hes learned his trade well among the pirates in the west indies you wouldnt sleep much if i should tell you things ive seenthings that he tells of sometimes for good jokes ive heard screams here that i havent been able to get out of my head for weeks and weeks theres a place way out down by the quarters where you can see a black blasted tree and the ground all covered with black ashes ask anyone what was done there and see if they will dare to tell you  o what do you mean  i wont tell you i hate to think of it and i tell you the lord only knows what we may see tomorrow if that poor fellow holds out as hes begun  horrid said emmeline every drop of blood receding from her cheeks o cassy do tell me what i shall do  what ive done do the best you cando what you mustand make it up in hating and cursing  he wanted to make me drink some of his hateful brandy said emmeline and i hate it so  youd better drink said cassy i hated it too and now i cant live without it one must have somethingthings dont look so dreadful when you take that  mother used to tell me never to touch any such thing said emmeline  mother told you said cassy with a thrilling and bitter emphasis on the word mother what use is it for mothers to say anything you are all to be bought and paid for and your souls belong to whoever gets you thats the way it goes i say drink brandy drink all you can and itll make things come easier  o cassy do pity me  pity youdont i havent i a daughterlord knows where she is and whose she is nowgoing the way her mother went before her i suppose and that her children must go after her theres no end to the curseforever  i wish id never been born said emmeline wringing her hands  thats an old wish with me said cassy ive got used to wishing that id die if i dared to she said looking out into the darkness with that still fixed despair which was the habitual expression of her face when at rest  it would be wicked to kill ones self said emmeline  i dont know whyno wickeder than things we live and do day after day but the sisters told me things when i was in the convent that make me afraid to die if it would only be the end of us why then  emmeline turned away and hid her face in her hands  while this conversation was passing in the chamber legree overcome with his carouse had sunk to sleep in the room below legree was not an habitual drunkard his coarse strong nature craved and could endure a continual stimulation that would have utterly wrecked and crazed a finer one but a deep underlying spirit of cautiousness prevented his often yielding to appetite in such measure as to lose control of himself  this night however in his feverish efforts to banish from his mind those fearful elements of woe and remorse which woke within him he had indulged more than common so that when he had discharged his sable attendants he fell heavily on a settle in the room and was sound asleep  o how dares the bad soul to enter the shadowy world of sleepthat land whose dim outlines lie so fearfully near to the mystic scene of retribution legree dreamed in his heavy and feverish sleep a veiled form stood beside him and laid a cold soft hand upon him he thought he knew who it was and shuddered with creeping horror though the face was veiled then he thought he felt that hair twining round his fingers and then that it slid smoothly round his neck and tightened and tightened and he could not draw his breath and then he thought voices whispered to himwhispers that chilled him with horror then it seemed to him he was on the edge of a frightful abyss holding on and struggling in mortal fear while dark hands stretched up and were pulling him over and cassy came behind him laughing and pushed him and then rose up that solemn veiled figure and drew aside the veil it was his mother and she turned away from him and he fell down down down amid a confused noise of shrieks and groans and shouts of demon laughterand legree awoke  calmly the rosy hue of dawn was stealing into the room the morning star stood with its solemn holy eye of light looking down on the man of sin from out the brightening sky o with what freshness what solemnity and beauty is each new day born as if to say to insensate man behold thou hast one more chance strive for immortal glory there is no speech nor language where this voice is not heard but the bold bad man heard it not he woke with an oath and a curse what to him was the gold and purple the daily miracle of morning what to him the sanctity of the star which the son of god has hallowed as his own emblem brutelike he saw without perceiving and stumbling forward poured out a tumbler of brandy and drank half of it  ive had a hl of a night he said to cassy who just then entered from an opposite door  youll get plenty of the same sort by and by said she dryly  what do you mean you minx  youll find out one of these days returned cassy in the same tone now simon ive one piece of advice to give you  the devil you have  my advice is said cassy steadily as she began adjusting some things about the room that you let tom alone  what business is t of yours  what to be sure i dont know what it should be if you want to pay twelve hundred for a fellow and use him right up in the press of the season just to serve your own spite its no business of mine ive done what i could for him  you have what business have you meddling in my matters  none to be sure ive saved you some thousands of dollars at different times by taking care of your handsthats all the thanks i get if your crop comes shorter into market than any of theirs you wont lose your bet i suppose tompkins wont lord it over you i supposeand youll pay down your money like a lady wont you i think i see you doing it  legree like many other planters had but one form of ambitionto have in the heaviest crop of the seasonand he had several bets on this very present season pending in the next town cassy therefore with womans tact touched the only string that could be made to vibrate  well ill let him off at what hes got said legree but he shall beg my pardon and promise better fashions  that he wont do said cassy  wonteh  no he wont said cassy  id like to know why mistress said legree in the extreme of scorn  because hes done right and he knows it and wont say hes done wrong  who a cuss cares what he knows the nigger shall say what i please or  or youll lose your bet on the cotton crop by keeping him out of the field just at this very press  but he will give upcourse he will dont i know what niggers is hell beg like a dog this morning  he wont simon you dont know this kind you may kill him by inchesyou wont get the first word of confession out of him  well seewhere is he said legree going out  in the wasteroom of the ginhouse said cassy  legree though he talked so stoutly to cassy still sallied forth from the house with a degree of misgiving which was not common with him his dreams of the past night mingled with cassys prudential suggestions considerably affected his mind he resolved that nobody should be witness of his encounter with tom and determined if he could not subdue him by bullying to defer his vengeance to be wreaked in a more convenient season  the solemn light of dawnthe angelic glory of the morningstarhad looked in through the rude window of the shed where tom was lying and as if descending on that starbeam came the solemn words i am the root and offspring of david and the bright and morning star the mysterious warnings and intimations of cassy so far from discouraging his soul in the end had roused it as with a heavenly call he did not know but that the day of his death was dawning in the sky and his heart throbbed with solemn throes of joy and desire as he thought that the wondrous all of which he had often ponderedthe great white throne with its ever radiant rainbow the whiterobed multitude with voices as many waters the crowns the palms the harpsmight all break upon his vision before that sun should set again and therefore without shuddering or trembling he heard the voice of his persecutor as he drew near  well my boy said legree with a contemptuous kick how do you find yourself didnt i tell yer i could larn yer a thing or two how do yer like iteh how did yer whaling agree with yer tom ant quite so crank as ye was last night ye couldnt treat a poor sinner now to a bit of sermon could yeeh  tom answered nothing  get up you beast said legree kicking him again  this was a difficult matter for one so bruised and faint and as tom made efforts to do so legree laughed brutally  what makes ye so spry this morning tom cotched cold may be last night  tom by this time had gained his feet and was confronting his master with a steady unmoved front  the devil you can said legree looking him over i believe you havent got enough yet now tom get right down on yer knees and beg my pardon for yer shines last night  tom did not move  down you dog said legree striking him with his ridingwhip  masr legree said tom i cant do it i did only what i thought was right i shall do just so again if ever the time comes i never will do a cruel thing come what may  yes but ye dont know what may come master tom ye think what youve got is something i tell you tant anythingnothing t all how would ye like to be tied to a tree and have a slow fire lit up around yewouldnt that be pleasanteh tom  masr said tom i know ye can do dreadful things buthe stretched himself upward and clasped his handsbut after yeve killed the body there ant no more ye can do and o theres all eternity to come after that  eternitythe word thrilled through the black mans soul with light and power as he spoke it thrilled through the sinners soul too like the bite of a scorpion legree gnashed on him with his teeth but rage kept him silent and tom like a man disenthralled spoke in a clear and cheerful voice  masr legree as ye bought me ill be a true and faithful servant to ye ill give ye all the work of my hands all my time all my strength but my soul i wont give up to mortal man i will hold on to the lord and put his commands before alldie or live you may be sure on t masr legree i aint a grain afeard to die id as soon die as not ye may whip me starve me burn meitll only send me sooner where i want to go  ill make ye give out though fore ive done said legree in a rage  i shall have help said tom youll never do it  who the devils going to help you said legree scornfully  the lord almighty said tom  dn you said legree as with one blow of his fist he felled tom to the earth  a cold soft hand fell on legrees at this moment he turnedit was cassys but the cold soft touch recalled his dream of the night before and flashing through the chambers of his brain came all the fearful images of the nightwatches with a portion of the horror that accompanied them  will you be a fool said cassy in french let him go let me alone to get him fit to be in the field again isnt it just as i told you  they say the alligator the rhinoceros though enclosed in bulletproof mail have each a spot where they are vulnerable and fierce reckless unbelieving reprobates have commonly this point in superstitious dread  legree turned away determined to let the point go for the time  well have it your own way he said doggedly to cassy  hark ye he said to tom i wont deal with ye now because the business is pressing and i want all my hands but i never forget ill score it against ye and sometime ill have my pay out o yer old black hidemind ye  legree turned and went out  there you go said cassy looking darkly after him your reckonings to come yetmy poor fellow how are you  the lord god hath sent his angel and shut the lions mouth for this time said tom  for this time to be sure said cassy but now youve got his ill will upon you to follow you day in day out hanging like a dog on your throatsucking your blood bleeding away your life drop by drop i know the man    chapter xxxvii  liberty   no matter with what solemnities he may have been devoted upon the altar of slavery the moment he touches the sacred soil of britain the altar and the god sink together in the dust and he stands redeemed regenerated and disenthralled by the irresistible genius of universal emancipation curran        john philpot curran 17501817 irish orator and judge      who worked for catholic emancipation  a while we must leave tom in the hands of his persecutors while we turn to pursue the fortunes of george and his wife whom we left in friendly hands in a farmhouse on the roadside  tom loker we left groaning and touzling in a most immaculately clean quaker bed under the motherly supervision of aunt dorcas who found him to the full as tractable a patient as a sick bison  imagine a tall dignified spiritual woman whose clear muslin cap shades waves of silvery hair parted on a broad clear forehead which overarches thoughtful gray eyes a snowy handkerchief of lisse crape is folded neatly across her bosom her glossy brown silk dress rustles peacefully as she glides up and down the chamber  the devil says tom loker giving a great throw to the bedclothes  i must request thee thomas not to use such language says aunt dorcas as she quietly rearranged the bed  well i wont granny if i can help it says tom but it is enough to make a fellow swearso cursedly hot  dorcas removed a comforter from the bed straightened the clothes again and tucked them in till tom looked something like a chrysalis remarking as she did so  i wish friend thee would leave off cursing and swearing and think upon thy ways  what the devil said tom should i think of them for last thing ever i want to think ofhang it all and tom flounced over untucking and disarranging everything in a manner frightful to behold  that fellow and gal are here i spose said he sullenly after a pause  they are so said dorcas  theyd better be off up to the lake said tom the quicker the better  probably they will do so said aunt dorcas knitting peacefully  and hark ye said tom weve got correspondents in sandusky that watch the boats for us i dont care if i tell now i hope they will get away just to spite marksthe cursed puppydn him  thomas said dorcas  i tell you granny if you bottle a fellow up too tight i shall split said tom but about the galtell em to dress her up some way sos to alter her her descriptions out in sandusky  we will attend to that matter said dorcas with characteristic composure  as we at this place take leave of tom loker we may as well say that having lain three weeks at the quaker dwelling sick with a rheumatic fever which set in in company with his other afflictions tom arose from his bed a somewhat sadder and wiser man and in place of slavecatching betook himself to life in one of the new settlements where his talents developed themselves more happily in trapping bears wolves and other inhabitants of the forest in which he made himself quite a name in the land tom always spoke reverently of the quakers nice people he would say wanted to convert me but couldnt come it exactly but tell ye what stranger they do fix up a sick fellow first rateno mistake make jist the tallest kind o broth and knicknacks  as tom had informed them that their party would be looked for in sandusky it was thought prudent to divide them jim with his old mother was forwarded separately and a night or two after george and eliza with their child were driven privately into sandusky and lodged beneath a hospital roof preparatory to taking their last passage on the lake  their night was now far spent and the morning star of liberty rose fair before themelectric word what is it is there anything more in it than a namea rhetorical flourish why men and women of america does your hearts blood thrill at that word for which your fathers bled and your braver mothers were willing that their noblest and best should die  is there anything in it glorious and dear for a nation that is not also glorious and dear for a man what is freedom to a nation but freedom to the individuals in it what is freedom to that young man who sits there with his arms folded over his broad chest the tint of african blood in his cheek its dark fires in his eyeswhat is freedom to george harris to your fathers freedom was the right of a nation to be a nation to him it is the right of a man to be a man and not a brute the right to call the wife of his bosom his wife and to protect her from lawless violence the right to protect and educate his child the right to have a home of his own a religion of his own a character of his own unsubject to the will of another all these thoughts were rolling and seething in georges breast as he was pensively leaning his head on his hand watching his wife as she was adapting to her slender and pretty form the articles of mans attire in which it was deemed safest she should make her escape  now for it said she as she stood before the glass and shook down her silky abundance of black curly hair i say george its almost a pity isnt it she said as she held up some of it playfullypity its all got to come off  george smiled sadly and made no answer  eliza turned to the glass and the scissors glittered as one long lock after another was detached from her head  there now thatll do she said taking up a hairbrush now for a few fancy touches  there ant i a pretty young fellow she said turning around to her husband laughing and blushing at the same time  you always will be pretty do what you will said george  what does make you so sober said eliza kneeling on one knee and laying her hand on his we are only within twentyfour hours of canada they say only a day and a night on the lake and thenoh then  o eliza said george drawing her towards him that is it now my fate is all narrowing down to a point to come so near to be almost in sight and then lose all i should never live under it eliza  dont fear said his wife hopefully the good lord would not have brought us so far if he didnt mean to carry us through i seem to feel him with us george  you are a blessed woman eliza said george clasping her with a convulsive grasp butoh tell me can this great mercy be for us will these years and years of misery come to an endshall we be free  i am sure of it george said eliza looking upward while tears of hope and enthusiasm shone on her long dark lashes i feel it in me that god is going to bring us out of bondage this very day  i will believe you eliza said george rising suddenly up i will believecome lets be off well indeed said he holding her off at arms length and looking admiringly at her you are a pretty little fellow that crop of little short curls is quite becoming put on your cap soa little to one side i never saw you look quite so pretty but its almost time for the carriagei wonder if mrs smyth has got harry rigged  the door opened and a respectable middleaged woman entered leading little harry dressed in girls clothes  what a pretty girl he makes said eliza turning him round we call him harriet you seedont the name come nicely  the child stood gravely regarding his mother in her new and strange attire observing a profound silence and occasionally drawing deep sighs and peeping at her from under his dark curls  does harry know mamma said eliza stretching her hands toward him  the child clung shyly to the woman  come eliza why do you try to coax him when you know that he has got to be kept away from you  i know its foolish said eliza yet i cant bear to have him turn away from me but comewheres my cloak herehow is it men put on cloaks george  you must wear it so said her husband throwing it over his shoulders  so then said eliza imitating the motionand i must stamp and take long steps and try to look saucy  dont exert yourself said george there is now and then a modest young man and i think it would be easier for you to act that character  and these gloves mercy upon us said eliza why my hands are lost in them  i advise you to keep them on pretty strictly said george your slender paw might bring us all out now mrs smyth you are to go under our charge and be our auntyyou mind  ive heard said mrs smyth that there have been men down warning all the packet captains against a man and woman with a little boy  they have said george well if we see any such people we can tell them  a hack now drove to the door and the friendly family who had received the fugitives crowded around them with farewell greetings  the disguises the party had assumed were in accordance with the hints of tom loker mrs smyth a respectable woman from the settlement in canada whither they were fleeing being fortunately about crossing the lake to return thither had consented to appear as the aunt of little harry and in order to attach him to her he had been allowed to remain the two last days under her sole charge and an extra amount of petting jointed to an indefinite amount of seedcakes and candy had cemented a very close attachment on the part of the young gentleman  the hack drove to the wharf the two young men as they appeared walked up the plank into the boat eliza gallantly giving her arm to mrs smyth and george attending to their baggage  george was standing at the captains office settling for his party when he overheard two men talking by his side  ive watched every one that came on board said one and i know theyre not on this boat  the voice was that of the clerk of the boat the speaker whom he addressed was our sometime friend marks who with that valuable perseverance which characterized him had come on to sandusky seeking whom he might devour  you would scarcely know the woman from a white one said marks the man is a very light mulatto he has a brand in one of his hands  the hand with which george was taking the tickets and change trembled a little but he turned coolly around fixed an unconcerned glance on the face of the speaker and walked leisurely toward another part of the boat where eliza stood waiting for him  mrs smyth with little harry sought the seclusion of the ladies cabin where the dark beauty of the supposed little girl drew many flattering comments from the passengers  george had the satisfaction as the bell rang out its farewell peal to see marks walk down the plank to the shore and drew a long sigh of relief when the boat had put a returnless distance between them  it was a superb day the blue waves of lake erie danced rippling and sparkling in the sunlight a fresh breeze blew from the shore and the lordly boat ploughed her way right gallantly onward  o what an untold world there is in one human heart who thought as george walked calmly up and down the deck of the steamer with his shy companion at his side of all that was burning in his bosom the mighty good that seemed approaching seemed too good too fair even to be a reality and he felt a jealous dread every moment of the day that something would rise to snatch it from him  but the boat swept on hours fleeted and at last clear and full rose the blessed english shores shores charmed by a mighty spellwith one touch to dissolve every incantation of slavery no matter in what language pronounced or by what national power confirmed  george and his wife stood arm in arm as the boat neared the small town of amherstberg in canada his breath grew thick and short a mist gathered before his eyes he silently pressed the little hand that lay trembling on his arm the bell rang the boat stopped scarcely seeing what he did he looked out his baggage and gathered his little party the little company were landed on the shore they stood still till the boat had cleared and then with tears and embracings the husband and wife with their wondering child in their arms knelt down and lifted up their hearts to god       t was something like the burst from death to life      from the graves cerements to the robes of heaven      from sins dominion and from passions strife      to the pure freedom of a soul forgiven      where all the bonds of death and hell are riven      and mortal puts on immortality      when mercys hand hath turned the golden key      and mercys voice hath said rejoice thy soul is free  the little party were soon guided by mrs smyth to the hospitable abode of a good missionary whom christian charity has placed here as a shepherd to the outcast and wandering who are constantly finding an asylum on this shore  who can speak the blessedness of that first day of freedom is not the sense of liberty a higher and a finer one than any of the five to move speak and breathego out and come in unwatched and free from danger who can speak the blessings of that rest which comes down on the free mans pillow under laws which insure to him the rights that god has given to man how fair and precious to that mother was that sleeping childs face endeared by the memory of a thousand dangers how impossible was it to sleep in the exuberant possession of such blessedness and yet these two had not one acre of groundnot a roof that they could call their ownthey had spent their all to the last dollar they had nothing more than the birds of the air or the flowers of the fieldyet they could not sleep for joy o ye who take freedom from man with what words shall ye answer it to god    chapter xxxviii  the victory   thanks be unto god who giveth us the victory        i cor 1557  have not many of us in the weary way of life felt in some hours how far easier it were to die than to live  the martyr when faced even by a death of bodily anguish and horror finds in the very terror of his doom a strong stimulant and tonic there is a vivid excitement a thrill and fervor which may carry through any crisis of suffering that is the birthhour of eternal glory and rest  but to liveto wear on day after day of mean bitter low harassing servitude every nerve dampened and depressed every power of feeling gradually smotheredthis long and wasting heartmartyrdom this slow daily bleeding away of the inward life drop by drop hour after hourthis is the true searching test of what there may be in man or woman  when tom stood face to face with his persecutor and heard his threats and thought in his very soul that his hour was come his heart swelled bravely in him and he thought he could bear torture and fire bear anything with the vision of jesus and heaven but just a step beyond but when he was gone and the present excitement passed off came back the pain of his bruised and weary limbscame back the sense of his utterly degraded hopeless forlorn estate and the day passed wearily enough  long before his wounds were healed legree insisted that he should be put to the regular fieldwork and then came day after day of pain and weariness aggravated by every kind of injustice and indignity that the illwill of a mean and malicious mind could devise whoever in our circumstances has made trial of pain even with all the alleviations which for us usually attend it must know the irritation that comes with it tom no longer wondered at the habitual surliness of his associates nay he found the placid sunny temper which had been the habitude of his life broken in on and sorely strained by the inroads of the same thing he had flattered himself on leisure to read his bible but there was no such thing as leisure there in the height of the season legree did not hesitate to press all his hands through sundays and weekdays alike why shouldnt hehe made more cotton by it and gained his wager and if it wore out a few more hands he could buy better ones at first tom used to read a verse or two of his bible by the flicker of the fire after he had returned from his daily toil but after the cruel treatment he received he used to come home so exhausted that his head swam and his eyes failed when he tried to read and he was fain to stretch himself down with the others in utter exhaustion  is it strange that the religious peace and trust which had upborne him hitherto should give way to tossings of soul and despondent darkness the gloomiest problem of this mysterious life was constantly before his eyessouls crushed and ruined evil triumphant and god silent it was weeks and months that tom wrestled in his own soul in darkness and sorrow he thought of miss ophelias letter to his kentucky friends and would pray earnestly that god would send him deliverance and then he would watch day after day in the vague hope of seeing somebody sent to redeem him and when nobody came he would crush back to his soul bitter thoughtsthat it was vain to serve god that god had forgotten him he sometimes saw cassy and sometimes when summoned to the house caught a glimpse of the dejected form of emmeline but held very little communion with either in fact there was no time for him to commune with anybody  one evening he was sitting in utter dejection and prostration by a few decaying brands where his coarse supper was baking he put a few bits of brushwood on the fire and strove to raise the light and then drew his worn bible from his pocket there were all the marked passages which had thrilled his soul so oftenwords of patriarchs and seers poets and sages who from early time had spoken courage to manvoices from the great cloud of witnesses who ever surround us in the race of life had the word lost its power or could the failing eye and weary sense no longer answer to the touch of that mighty inspiration heavily sighing he put it in his pocket a coarse laugh roused him he looked uplegree was standing opposite to him  well old boy he said you find your religion dont work it seems i thought i should get that through your wool at last  the cruel taunt was more than hunger and cold and nakedness tom was silent  you were a fool said legree for i meant to do well by you when i bought you you might have been better off than sambo or quimbo either and had easy times and instead of getting cut up and thrashed every day or two ye might have had liberty to lord it round and cut up the other niggers and ye might have had now and then a good warming of whiskey punch come tom dont you think youd better be reasonableheave that ar old pack of trash in the fire and join my church  the lord forbid said tom fervently  you see the lord ant going to help you if he had been he wouldnt have let me get you this yer religion is all a mess of lying trumpery tom i know all about it yed better hold to me im somebody and can do something  no masr said tom ill hold on the lord may help me or not help but ill hold to him and believe him to the last  the more fool you said legree spitting scornfully at him and spurning him with his foot never mind ill chase you down yet and bring you underyoull see and legree turned away  when a heavy weight presses the soul to the lowest level at which endurance is possible there is an instant and desperate effort of every physical and moral nerve to throw off the weight and hence the heaviest anguish often precedes a return tide of joy and courage so was it now with tom the atheistic taunts of his cruel master sunk his before dejected soul to the lowest ebb and though the hand of faith still held to the eternal rock it was a numb despairing grasp tom sat like one stunned at the fire suddenly everything around him seemed to fade and a vision rose before him of one crowned with thorns buffeted and bleeding tom gazed in awe and wonder at the majestic patience of the face the deep pathetic eyes thrilled him to his inmost heart his soul woke as with floods of emotion he stretched out his hands and fell upon his kneeswhen gradually the vision changed the sharp thorns became rays of glory and in splendor inconceivable he saw that same face bending compassionately towards him and a voice said he that overcometh shall sit down with me on my throne even as i also overcome and am set down with my father on his throne  how long tom lay there he knew not when he came to himself the fire was gone out his clothes were wet with the chill and drenching dews but the dread soulcrisis was past and in the joy that filled him he no longer felt hunger cold degradation disappointment wretchedness from his deepest soul he that hour loosed and parted from every hope in life that now is and offered his own will an unquestioning sacrifice to the infinite tom looked up to the silent everliving starstypes of the angelic hosts who ever look down on man and the solitude of the night rung with the triumphant words of a hymn which he had sung often in happier days but never with such feeling as now      the earth shall be dissolved like snow      the sun shall cease to shine      but god who called me here below      shall be forever mine      and when this mortal life shall fail      and flesh and sense shall cease      i shall possess within the veil      a life of joy and peace      when weve been there ten thousand years      bright shining like the sun      weve no less days to sing gods praise      than when we first begun  those who have been familiar with the religious histories of the slave population know that relations like what we have narrated are very common among them we have heard some from their own lips of a very touching and affecting character the psychologist tells us of a state in which the affections and images of the mind become so dominant and overpowering that they press into their service the outward imagining who shall measure what an allpervading spirit may do with these capabilities of our mortality or the ways in which he may encourage the desponding souls of the desolate if the poor forgotten slave believes that jesus hath appeared and spoken to him who shall contradict him did he not say that his mission in all ages was to bind up the brokenhearted and set at liberty them that are bruised  when the dim gray of dawn woke the slumberers to go forth to the field there was among those tattered and shivering wretches one who walked with an exultant tread for firmer than the ground he trod on was his strong faith in almighty eternal love ah legree try all your forces now utmost agony woe degradation want and loss of all things shall only hasten on the process by which he shall be made a king and a priest unto god  from this time an inviolable sphere of peace encompassed the lowly heart of the oppressed onean everpresent saviour hallowed it as a temple past now the bleeding of earthly regrets past its fluctuations of hope and fear and desire the human will bent and bleeding and struggling long was now entirely merged in the divine so short now seemed the remaining voyage of lifeso near so vivid seemed eternal blessednessthat lifes uttermost woes fell from him unharming  all noticed the change in his appearance cheerfulness and alertness seemed to return to him and a quietness which no insult or injury could ruffle seemed to possess him  what the devils got into tom legree said to sambo a while ago he was all down in the mouth and now hes peart as a cricket  dunno masr gwine to run off mebbe  like to see him try that said legree with a savage grin wouldnt we sambo  guess we would haw haw ho said the sooty gnome laughing obsequiously lord de fun to see him stickin in de mudchasin and tarin through de bushes dogs a holdin on to him lord i laughed fit to split dat ar time we cotched molly i thought theyd a had her all stripped up afore i could get em off she cars de marks o dat ar spree yet  i reckon she will to her grave said legree but now sambo you look sharp if the niggers got anything of this sort going trip him up  masr let me lone for dat said sambo ill tree de coon ho ho ho  this was spoken as legree was getting on his horse to go to the neighboring town that night as he was returning he thought he would turn his horse and ride round the quarters and see if all was safe  it was a superb moonlight night and the shadows of the graceful china trees lay minutely pencilled on the turf below and there was that transparent stillness in the air which it seems almost unholy to disturb legree was a little distance from the quarters when he heard the voice of some one singing it was not a usual sound there and he paused to listen a musical tenor voice sang       when i can read my title clear      to mansions in the skies      ill bid farewell to every fear      and wipe my weeping eyes       should earth against my soul engage      and hellish darts be hurled      then i can smile at satans rage      and face a frowning world       let cares like a wild deluge come      and storms of sorrow fall      may i but safely reach my home      my god my heaven my all         on my journey home hymn by isaac watts found in many      of the southern country songbooks of the ante bellum period  so ho said legree to himself he thinks so does he how i hate these cursed methodist hymns here you nigger said he coming suddenly out upon tom and raising his ridingwhip how dare you be gettin up this yer row when you ought to be in bed shut yer old black gash and get along in with you  yes masr said tom with ready cheerfulness as he rose to go in  legree was provoked beyond measure by toms evident happiness and riding up to him belabored him over his head and shoulders  there you dog he said see if youll feel so comfortable after that  but the blows fell now only on the outer man and not as before on the heart tom stood perfectly submissive and yet legree could not hide from himself that his power over his bond thrall was somehow gone and as tom disappeared in his cabin and he wheeled his horse suddenly round there passed through his mind one of those vivid flashes that often send the lightning of conscience across the dark and wicked soul he understood full well that it was god who was standing between him and his victim and he blasphemed him that submissive and silent man whom taunts nor threats nor stripes nor cruelties could disturb roused a voice within him such as of old his master roused in the demoniac soul saying what have we to do with thee thou jesus of nazarethart thou come to torment us before the time  toms whole soul overflowed with compassion and sympathy for the poor wretches by whom he was surrounded to him it seemed as if his lifesorrows were now over and as if out of that strange treasury of peace and joy with which he had been endowed from above he longed to pour out something for the relief of their woes it is true opportunities were scanty but on the way to the fields and back again and during the hours of labor chances fell in his way of extending a helpinghand to the weary the disheartened and discouraged the poor worndown brutalized creatures at first could scarce comprehend this but when it was continued week after week and month after month it began to awaken longsilent chords in their benumbed hearts gradually and imperceptibly the strange silent patient man who was ready to bear every ones burden and sought help from nonewho stood aside for all and came last and took least yet was foremost to share his little all with any who neededthe man who in cold nights would give up his tattered blanket to add to the comfort of some woman who shivered with sickness and who filled the baskets of the weaker ones in the field at the terrible risk of coming short in his own measureand who though pursued with unrelenting cruelty by their common tyrant never joined in uttering a word of reviling or cursingthis man at last began to have a strange power over them and when the more pressing season was past and they were allowed again their sundays for their own use many would gather together to hear from him of jesus they would gladly have met to hear and pray and sing in some place together but legree would not permit it and more than once broke up such attempts with oaths and brutal execrationsso that the blessed news had to circulate from individual to individual yet who can speak the simple joy with which some of those poor outcasts to whom life was a joyless journey to a dark unknown heard of a compassionate redeemer and a heavenly home it is the statement of missionaries that of all races of the earth none have received the gospel with such eager docility as the african the principle of reliance and unquestioning faith which is its foundation is more a native element in this race than any other and it has often been found among them that a stray seed of truth borne on some breeze of accident into hearts the most ignorant has sprung up into fruit whose abundance has shamed that of higher and more skilful culture  the poor mulatto woman whose simple faith had been wellnigh crushed and overwhelmed by the avalanche of cruelty and wrong which had fallen upon her felt her soul raised up by the hymns and passages of holy writ which this lowly missionary breathed into her ear in intervals as they were going to and returning from work and even the halfcrazed and wandering mind of cassy was soothed and calmed by his simple and unobtrusive influences  stung to madness and despair by the crushing agonies of a life cassy had often resolved in her soul an hour of retribution when her hand should avenge on her oppressor all the injustice and cruelty to which she had been witness or which she had in her own person suffered  one night after all in toms cabin were sunk in sleep he was suddenly aroused by seeing her face at the hole between the logs that served for a window she made a silent gesture for him to come out  tom came out the door it was between one and two oclock at nightbroad calm still moonlight tom remarked as the light of the moon fell upon cassys large black eyes that there was a wild and peculiar glare in them unlike their wonted fixed despair  come here father tom she said laying her small hand on his wrist and drawing him forward with a force as if the hand were of steel come hereive news for you  what misse cassy said tom anxiously  tom wouldnt you like your liberty  i shall have it misse in gods time said tom ay but you may have it tonight said cassy with a flash of sudden energy come on  tom hesitated  come said she in a whisper fixing her black eyes on him come along hes asleepsound i put enough into his brandy to keep him so i wish id had morei shouldnt have wanted you but come the back door is unlocked theres an axe there i put it therehis room door is open ill show you the way id a done it myself only my arms are so weak come along  not for ten thousand worlds misse said tom firmly stopping and holding her back as she was pressing forward  but think of all these poor creatures said cassy we might set them all free and go somewhere in the swamps and find an island and live by ourselves ive heard of its being done any life is better than this  no said tom firmly no good never comes of wickedness id sooner chop my right hand off  then i shall do it said cassy turning  o misse cassy said tom throwing himself before her for the dear lords sake that died for ye dont sell your precious soul to the devil that way nothing but evil will come of it the lord hasnt called us to wrath we must suffer and wait his time  wait said cassy havent i waitedwaited till my head is dizzy and my heart sick what has he made me suffer what has he made hundreds of poor creatures suffer isnt he wringing the lifeblood out of you im called on they call me his times come and ill have his hearts blood  no no no said tom holding her small hands which were clenched with spasmodic violence no ye poor lost soul that ye mustnt do the dear blessed lord never shed no blood but his own and that he poured out for us when we was enemies lord help us to follow his steps and love our enemies  love said cassy with a fierce glare love such enemies it isnt in flesh and blood  no misse it isnt said tom looking up but he gives it to us and thats the victory when we can love and pray over all and through all the battles past and the victorys comeglory be to god and with streaming eyes and choking voice the black man looked up to heaven  and this oh africa latest called of nationscalled to the crown of thorns the scourge the bloody sweat the cross of agonythis is to be thy victory by this shalt thou reign with christ when his kingdom shall come on earth  the deep fervor of toms feelings the softness of his voice his tears fell like dew on the wild unsettled spirit of the poor woman a softness gathered over the lurid fires of her eye she looked down and tom could feel the relaxing muscles of her hands as she said  didnt i tell you that evil spirits followed me o father tom i cant prayi wish i could i never have prayed since my children were sold what you say must be right i know it must but when i try to pray i can only hate and curse i cant pray  poor soul said tom compassionately satan desires to have ye and sift ye as wheat i pray the lord for ye o misse cassy turn to the dear lord jesus he came to bind up the brokenhearted and comfort all that mourn  cassy stood silent while large heavy tears dropped from her downcast eyes  misse cassy said tom in a hesitating tone after surveying her in silence if ye only could get away from hereif the thing was possibleid vise ye and emmeline to do it that is if ye could go without bloodguiltinessnot otherwise  would you try it with us father tom  no said tom time was when i would but the lords given me a work among these yer poor souls and ill stay with em and bear my cross with em till the end its different with you its a snare to youits moren you can standand youd better go if you can  i know no way but through the grave said cassy theres no beast or bird but can find a home some where even the snakes and the alligators have their places to lie down and be quiet but theres no place for us down in the darkest swamps their dogs will hunt us out and find us everybody and everything is against us even the very beasts side against usand where shall we go  tom stood silent at length he said  him that saved daniel in the den of lionsthat saved the children in the fiery furnacehim that walked on the sea and bade the winds be stillhes alive yet and ive faith to believe he can deliver you try it and ill pray with all my might for you  by what strange law of mind is it that an idea long overlooked and trodden under foot as a useless stone suddenly sparkles out in new light as a discovered diamond  cassy had often revolved for hours all possible or probable schemes of escape and dismissed them all as hopeless and impracticable but at this moment there flashed through her mind a plan so simple and feasible in all its details as to awaken an instant hope  father tom ill try it she said suddenly  amen said tom the lord help ye    chapter xxxix  the stratagem  the way of the wicked is as darkness he knoweth not at what he stumbleth        prov 419  the garret of the house that legree occupied like most other garrets was a great desolate space dusty hung with cobwebs and littered with castoff lumber the opulent family that had inhabited the house in the days of its splendor had imported a great deal of splendid furniture some of which they had taken away with them while some remained standing desolate in mouldering unoccupied rooms or stored away in this place one or two immense packingboxes in which this furniture was brought stood against the sides of the garret there was a small window there which let in through its dingy dusty panes a scanty uncertain light on the tall highbacked chairs and dusty tables that had once seen better days altogether it was a weird and ghostly place but ghostly as it was it wanted not in legends among the superstitious negroes to increase its terrors some few years before a negro woman who had incurred legrees displeasure was confined there for several weeks what passed there we do not say the negroes used to whisper darkly to each other but it was known that the body of the unfortunate creature was one day taken down from there and buried and after that it was said that oaths and cursings and the sound of violent blows used to ring through that old garret and mingled with wailings and groans of despair once when legree chanced to overhear something of this kind he flew into a violent passion and swore that the next one that told stories about that garret should have an opportunity of knowing what was there for he would chain them up there for a week this hint was enough to repress talking though of course it did not disturb the credit of the story in the least  gradually the staircase that led to the garret and even the passageway to the staircase were avoided by every one in the house from every one fearing to speak of it and the legend was gradually falling into desuetude it had suddenly occurred to cassy to make use of the superstitious excitability which was so great in legree for the purpose of her liberation and that of her fellowsufferer  the sleepingroom of cassy was directly under the garret one day without consulting legree she suddenly took it upon her with some considerable ostentation to change all the furniture and appurtenances of the room to one at some considerable distance the underservants who were called on to effect this movement were running and bustling about with great zeal and confusion when legree returned from a ride  hallo you cass said legree whats in the wind now  nothing only i choose to have another room said cassy doggedly  and what for pray said legree  i choose to said cassy  the devil you do and what for  id like to get some sleep now and then  sleep well what hinders your sleeping  i could tell i suppose if you want to hear said cassy dryly  speak out you minx said legree  o nothing i suppose it wouldnt disturb you only groans and people scuffing and rolling round on the garret floor half the night from twelve to morning  people up garret said legree uneasily but forcing a laugh who are they cassy  cassy raised her sharp black eyes and looked in the face of legree with an expression that went through his bones as she said to be sure simon who are they id like to have you tell me you dont know i suppose  with an oath legree struck at her with his ridingwhip but she glided to one side and passed through the door and looking back said if youll sleep in that room youll know all about it perhaps youd better try it and then immediately she shut and locked the door  legree blustered and swore and threatened to break down the door but apparently thought better of it and walked uneasily into the sittingroom cassy perceived that her shaft had struck home and from that hour with the most exquisite address she never ceased to continue the train of influences she had begun  in a knothole of the garret that had opened she had inserted the neck of an old bottle in such a manner that when there was the least wind most doleful and lugubrious wailing sounds proceeded from it which in a high wind increased to a perfect shriek such as to credulous and superstitious ears might easily seem to be that of horror and despair  these sounds were from time to time heard by the servants and revived in full force the memory of the old ghost legend a superstitious creeping horror seemed to fill the house and though no one dared to breathe it to legree he found himself encompassed by it as by an atmosphere  no one is so thoroughly superstitious as the godless man the christian is composed by the belief of a wise allruling father whose presence fills the void unknown with light and order but to the man who has dethroned god the spiritland is indeed in the words of the hebrew poet a land of darkness and the shadow of death without any order where the light is as darkness life and death to him are haunted grounds filled with goblin forms of vague and shadowy dread  legree had had the slumbering moral elements in him roused by his encounters with tomroused only to be resisted by the determinate force of evil but still there was a thrill and commotion of the dark inner world produced by every word or prayer or hymn that reacted in superstitious dread  the influence of cassy over him was of a strange and singular kind he was her owner her tyrant and tormentor she was as he knew wholly and without any possibility of help or redress in his hands and yet so it is that the most brutal man cannot live in constant association with a strong female influence and not be greatly controlled by it when he first bought her she was as she said a woman delicately bred and then he crushed her without scruple beneath the foot of his brutality but as time and debasing influences and despair hardened womanhood within her and waked the fires of fiercer passions she had become in a measure his mistress and he alternately tyrannized over and dreaded her  this influence had become more harassing and decided since partial insanity had given a strange weird unsettled cast to all her words and language  a night or two after this legree was sitting in the old sittingroom by the side of a flickering wood fire that threw uncertain glances round the room it was a stormy windy night such as raises whole squadrons of nondescript noises in rickety old houses windows were rattling shutters flapping and wind carousing rumbling and tumbling down the chimney and every once in a while puffing out smoke and ashes as if a legion of spirits were coming after them legree had been casting up accounts and reading newspapers for some hours while cassy sat in the corner sullenly looking into the fire legree laid down his paper and seeing an old book lying on the table which he had noticed cassy reading the first part of the evening took it up and began to turn it over it was one of those collections of stories of bloody murders ghostly legends and supernatural visitations which coarsely got up and illustrated have a strange fascination for one who once begins to read them  legree poohed and pished but read turning page after page till finally after reading some way he threw down the book with an oath  you dont believe in ghosts do you cass said he taking the tongs and settling the fire i thought youd more sense than to let noises scare you  no matter what i believe said cassy sullenly  fellows used to try to frighten me with their yarns at sea said legree never come it round me that way im too tough for any such trash tell ye  cassy sat looking intensely at him in the shadow of the corner there was that strange light in her eyes that always impressed legree with uneasiness  them noises was nothing but rats and the wind said legree rats will make a devil of a noise i used to hear em sometimes down in the hold of the ship and windlords sake ye can make anything out o wind  cassy knew legree was uneasy under her eyes and therefore she made no answer but sat fixing them on him with that strange unearthly expression as before  come speak out womandont you think so said legree  can rats walk down stairs and come walking through the entry and open a door when youve locked it and set a chair against it said cassy and come walk walk walking right up to your bed and put out their hand so  cassy kept her glittering eyes fixed on legree as she spoke and he stared at her like a man in the nightmare till when she finished by laying her hand icy cold on his he sprung back with an oath  woman what do you mean nobody did  o noof course notdid i say they did said cassy with a smile of chilling derision  butdidhave you really seencome cass what is it nowspeak out  you may sleep there yourself said cassy if you want to know  did it come from the garret cassy  itwhat said cassy  why what you told of  i didnt tell you anything said cassy with dogged sullenness  legree walked up and down the room uneasily  ill have this yer thing examined ill look into it this very night ill take my pistols  do said cassy sleep in that room id like to see you doing it fire your pistolsdo  legree stamped his foot and swore violently  dont swear said cassy nobody knows who may be hearing you hark what was that  what said legree starting  a heavy old dutch clock that stood in the corner of the room began and slowly struck twelve  for some reason or other legree neither spoke nor moved a vague horror fell on him while cassy with a keen sneering glitter in her eyes stood looking at him counting the strokes  twelve oclock well now well see said she turning and opening the door into the passageway and standing as if listening  hark whats that said she raising her finger  its only the wind said legree dont you hear how cursedly it blows  simon come here said cassy in a whisper laying her hand on his and leading him to the foot of the stairs do you know what that is hark  a wild shriek came pealing down the stairway it came from the garret legrees knees knocked together his face grew white with fear  hadnt you better get your pistols said cassy with a sneer that froze legrees blood its time this thing was looked into you know id like to have you go up now theyre at it  i wont go said legree with an oath  why not there ant any such thing as ghosts you know come and cassy flitted up the winding stairway laughing and looking back after him come on  i believe you are the devil said legree come back you hagcome back cass you shant go  but cassy laughed wildly and fled on he heard her open the entry doors that led to the garret a wild gust of wind swept down extinguishing the candle he held in his hand and with it the fearful unearthly screams they seemed to be shrieked in his very ear  legree fled frantically into the parlor whither in a few moments he was followed by cassy pale calm cold as an avenging spirit and with that same fearful light in her eye  i hope you are satisfied said she  blast you cass said legree  what for said cassy i only went up and shut the doors whats the matter with that garret simon do you suppose said she  none of your business said legree  o it ant well said cassy at any rate im glad i dont sleep under it  anticipating the rising of the wind that very evening cassy had been up and opened the garret window of course the moment the doors were opened the wind had drafted down and extinguished the light  this may serve as a specimen of the game that cassy played with legree until he would sooner have put his head into a lions mouth than to have explored that garret meanwhile in the night when everybody else was asleep cassy slowly and carefully accumulated there a stock of provisions sufficient to afford subsistence for some time she transferred article by article a greater part of her own and emmelines wardrobe all things being arranged they only waited a fitting opportunity to put their plan in execution  by cajoling legree and taking advantage of a goodnatured interval cassy had got him to take her with him to the neighboring town which was situated directly on the red river with a memory sharpened to almost preternatural clearness she remarked every turn in the road and formed a mental estimate of the time to be occupied in traversing it  at the time when all was matured for action our readers may perhaps like to look behind the scenes and see the final coup detat  it was now near evening legree had been absent on a ride to a neighboring farm for many days cassy had been unusually gracious and accommodating in her humors and legree and she had been apparently on the best of terms at present we may behold her and emmeline in the room of the latter busy in sorting and arranging two small bundles  there these will be large enough said cassy now put on your bonnet and lets start its just about the right time  why they can see us yet said emmeline  i mean they shall said cassy coolly dont you know that they must have their chase after us at any rate the way of the thing is to be just thiswe will steal out of the back door and run down by the quarters sambo or quimbo will be sure to see us they will give chase and we will get into the swamp then they cant follow us any further till they go up and give the alarm and turn out the dogs and so on and while they are blundering round and tumbling over each other as they always do you and i will slip along to the creek that runs back of the house and wade along in it till we get opposite the back door that will put the dogs all at fault for scent wont lie in the water every one will run out of the house to look after us and then well whip in at the back door and up into the garret where ive got a nice bed made up in one of the great boxes we must stay in that garret a good while for i tell you he will raise heaven and earth after us hell muster some of those old overseers on the other plantations and have a great hunt and theyll go over every inch of ground in that swamp he makes it his boast that nobody ever got away from him so let him hunt at his leisure  cassy how well you have planned it said emmeline who ever would have thought of it but you  there was neither pleasure nor exultation in cassys eyesonly a despairing firmness  come she said reaching her hand to emmeline  the two fugitives glided noiselessly from the house and flitted through the gathering shadows of evening along by the quarters the crescent moon set like a silver signet in the western sky delayed a little the approach of night as cassy expected when quite near the verge of the swamps that encircled the plantation they heard a voice calling to them to stop it was not sambo however but legree who was pursuing them with violent execrations at the sound the feebler spirit of emmeline gave way and laying hold of cassys arm she said o cassy im going to faint  if you do ill kill you said cassy drawing a small glittering stiletto and flashing it before the eyes of the girl  the diversion accomplished the purpose emmeline did not faint and succeeded in plunging with cassy into a part of the labyrinth of swamp so deep and dark that it was perfectly hopeless for legree to think of following them without assistance  well said he chuckling brutally at any rate theyve got themselves into a trap nowthe baggage theyre safe enough they shall sweat for it  hulloa there sambo quimbo all hands called legree coming to the quarters when the men and women were just returning from work theres two runaways in the swamps ill give five dollars to any nigger as catches em turn out the dogs turn out tiger and fury and the rest  the sensation produced by this news was immediate many of the men sprang forward officiously to offer their services either from the hope of the reward or from that cringing subserviency which is one of the most baleful effects of slavery some ran one way and some another some were for getting flambeaux of pineknots some were uncoupling the dogs whose hoarse savage bay added not a little to the animation of the scene  masr shall we shoot em if cant cotch em said sambo to whom his master brought out a rifle  you may fire on cass if you like its time she was gone to the devil where she belongs but the gal not said legree and now boys be spry and smart five dollars for him that gets em and a glass of spirits to every one of you anyhow  the whole band with the glare of blazing torches and whoop and shout and savage yell of man and beast proceeded down to the swamp followed at some distance by every servant in the house the establishment was of a consequence wholly deserted when cassy and emmeline glided into it the back way the whooping and shouts of their pursuers were still filling the air and looking from the sittingroom windows cassy and emmeline could see the troop with their flambeaux just dispersing themselves along the edge of the swamp  see there said emmeline pointing to cassy the hunt is begun look how those lights dance about hark the dogs dont you hear if we were only there our chances wouldnt be worth a picayune o for pitys sake do lets hide ourselves quick  theres no occasion for hurry said cassy coolly they are all out after the huntthats the amusement of the evening well go up stairs by and by meanwhile said she deliberately taking a key from the pocket of a coat that legree had thrown down in his hurry meanwhile i shall take something to pay our passage  she unlocked the desk took from it a roll of bills which she counted over rapidly  o dont lets do that said emmeline  dont said cassy why not would you have us starve in the swamps or have that that will pay our way to the free states money will do anything girl and as she spoke she put the money in her bosom  it would be stealing said emmeline in a distressed whisper  stealing said cassy with a scornful laugh they who steal body and soul neednt talk to us every one of these bills is stolenstolen from poor starving sweating creatures who must go to the devil at last for his profit let him talk about stealing but come we may as well go up garret ive got a stock of candles there and some books to pass away the time you may be pretty sure they wont come there to inquire after us if they do ill play ghost for them  when emmeline reached the garret she found an immense box in which some heavy pieces of furniture had once been brought turned on its side so that the opening faced the wall or rather the eaves cassy lit a small lamp and creeping round under the eaves they established themselves in it it was spread with a couple of small mattresses and some pillows a box near by was plentifully stored with candles provisions and all the clothing necessary to their journey which cassy had arranged into bundles of an astonishingly small compass  there said cassy as she fixed the lamp into a small hook which she had driven into the side of the box for that purpose this is to be our home for the present how do you like it  are you sure they wont come and search the garret  id like to see simon legree doing that said cassy no indeed he will be too glad to keep away as to the servants they would any of them stand and be shot sooner than show their faces here  somewhat reassured emmeline settled herself back on her pillow  what did you mean cassy by saying you would kill me she said simply  i meant to stop your fainting said cassy and i did do it and now i tell you emmeline you must make up your mind not to faint let what will come theres no sort of need of it if i had not stopped you that wretch might have had his hands on you now  emmeline shuddered  the two remained some time in silence cassy busied herself with a french book emmeline overcome with the exhaustion fell into a doze and slept some time she was awakened by loud shouts and outcries the tramp of horses feet and the baying of dogs she started up with a faint shriek  only the hunt coming back said cassy coolly never fear look out of this knothole dont you see em all down there simon has to give up for this night look how muddy his horse is flouncing about in the swamp the dogs too look rather crestfallen ah my good sir youll have to try the race again and againthe game isnt there  o dont speak a word said emmeline what if they should hear you  if they do hear anything it will make them very particular to keep away said cassy no danger we may make any noise we please and it will only add to the effect  at length the stillness of midnight settled down over the house legree cursing his ill luck and vowing dire vengeance on the morrow went to bed    chapter xl  the martyr       deem not the just by heaven forgot      though life its common gifts deny      though with a crushed and bleeding heart      and spurned of man he goes to die      for god hath marked each sorrowing day      and numbered every bitter tear      and heavens long years of bliss shall pay      for all his children suffer here      bryant         this poem does not appear in the collected works of      william cullen bryant nor in the collected poems of his      brother john howard bryant  it was probably copied from a      newspaper or magazine  the longest way must have its closethe gloomiest night will wear on to a morning an eternal inexorable lapse of moments is ever hurrying the day of the evil to an eternal night and the night of the just to an eternal day we have walked with our humble friend thus far in the valley of slavery first through flowery fields of ease and indulgence then through heartbreaking separations from all that man holds dear again we have waited with him in a sunny island where generous hands concealed his chains with flowers and lastly we have followed him when the last ray of earthly hope went out in night and seen how in the blackness of earthly darkness the firmament of the unseen has blazed with stars of new and significant lustre  the morningstar now stands over the tops of the mountains and gales and breezes not of earth show that the gates of day are unclosing  the escape of cassy and emmeline irritated the before surly temper of legree to the last degree and his fury as was to be expected fell upon the defenceless head of tom when he hurriedly announced the tidings among his hands there was a sudden light in toms eye a sudden upraising of his hands that did not escape him he saw that he did not join the muster of the pursuers he thought of forcing him to do it but having had of old experience of his inflexibility when commanded to take part in any deed of inhumanity he would not in his hurry stop to enter into any conflict with him  tom therefore remained behind with a few who had learned of him to pray and offered up prayers for the escape of the fugitives  when legree returned baffled and disappointed all the longworking hatred of his soul towards his slave began to gather in a deadly and desperate form had not this man braved himsteadily powerfully resistlesslyever since he bought him was there not a spirit in him which silent as it was burned on him like the fires of perdition  i hate him said legree that night as he sat up in his bed i hate him and isnt he mine cant i do what i like with him whos to hinder i wonder and legree clenched his fist and shook it as if he had something in his hands that he could rend in pieces  but then tom was a faithful valuable servant and although legree hated him the more for that yet the consideration was still somewhat of a restraint to him  the next morning he determined to say nothing as yet to assemble a party from some neighboring plantations with dogs and guns to surround the swamp and go about the hunt systematically if it succeeded well and good if not he would summon tom before him andhis teeth clenched and his blood boiledthen he would break the fellow down orthere was a dire inward whisper to which his soul assented  ye say that the interest of the master is a sufficient safeguard for the slave in the fury of mans mad will he will wittingly and with open eye sell his own soul to the devil to gain his ends and will he be more careful of his neighbors body  well said cassy the next day from the garret as she reconnoitred through the knothole the hunts going to begin again today  three or four mounted horsemen were curvetting about on the space in front of the house and one or two leashes of strange dogs were struggling with the negroes who held them baying and barking at each other  the men are two of them overseers of plantations in the vicinity and others were some of legrees associates at the tavernbar of a neighboring city who had come for the interest of the sport a more hardfavored set perhaps could not be imagined legree was serving brandy profusely round among them as also among the negroes who had been detailed from the various plantations for this service for it was an object to make every service of this kind among the negroes as much of a holiday as possible  cassy placed her ear at the knothole and as the morning air blew directly towards the house she could overhear a good deal of the conversation a grave sneer overcast the dark severe gravity of her face as she listened and heard them divide out the ground discuss the rival merits of the dogs give orders about firing and the treatment of each in case of capture  cassy drew back and clasping her hands looked upward and said o great almighty god we are all sinners but what have we done more than all the rest of the world that we should be treated so  there was a terrible earnestness in her face and voice as she spoke  if it wasnt for you child she said looking at emmeline id go out to them and id thank any one of them that would shoot me down for what use will freedom be to me can it give me back my children or make me what i used to be  emmeline in her childlike simplicity was half afraid of the dark moods of cassy she looked perplexed but made no answer she only took her hand with a gentle caressing movement  dont said cassy trying to draw it away youll get me to loving you and i never mean to love anything again  poor cassy said emmeline dont feel so if the lord gives us liberty perhaps hell give you back your daughter at any rate ill be like a daughter to you i know ill never see my poor old mother again i shall love you cassy whether you love me or not  the gentle childlike spirit conquered cassy sat down by her put her arm round her neck stroked her soft brown hair and emmeline then wondered at the beauty of her magnificent eyes now soft with tears  o em said cassy ive hungered for my children and thirsted for them and my eyes fail with longing for them here here she said striking her breast its all desolate all empty if god would give me back my children then i could pray  you must trust him cassy said emmeline he is our father  his wrath is upon us said cassy he has turned away in anger  no cassy he will be good to us let us hope in him said emmelinei always have had hope   the hunt was long animated and thorough but unsuccessful and with grave ironic exultation cassy looked down on legree as weary and dispirited he alighted from his horse  now quimbo said legree as he stretched himself down in the sittingroom you jest go and walk that tom up here right away the old cuss is at the bottom of this yer whole matter and ill have it out of his old black hide or ill know the reason why  sambo and quimbo both though hating each other were joined in one mind by a no less cordial hatred of tom legree had told them at first that he had bought him for a general overseer in his absence and this had begun an ill will on their part which had increased in their debased and servile natures as they saw him becoming obnoxious to their masters displeasure quimbo therefore departed with a will to execute his orders  tom heard the message with a forewarning heart for he knew all the plan of the fugitives escape and the place of their present concealmenthe knew the deadly character of the man he had to deal with and his despotic power but he felt strong in god to meet death rather than betray the helpless  he sat his basket down by the row and looking up said into thy hands i commend my spirit thou hast redeemed me oh lord god of truth and then quietly yielded himself to the rough brutal grasp with which quimbo seized him  ay ay said the giant as he dragged him along yell cotch it now ill boun masrs back s up high no sneaking out now tell ye yell get it and no mistake see how yell look now helpin masrs niggers to run away see what yell get  the savage words none of them reached that eara higher voice there was saying fear not them that kill the body and after that have no more that they can do nerve and bone of that poor mans body vibrated to those words as if touched by the finger of god and he felt the strength of a thousand souls in one as he passed along the trees and bushes the huts of his servitude the whole scene of his degradation seemed to whirl by him as the landscape by the rushing ear his soul throbbedhis home was in sightand the hour of release seemed at hand  well tom said legree walking up and seizing him grimly by the collar of his coat and speaking through his teeth in a paroxysm of determined rage do you know ive made up my mind to kill you  its very likely masr said tom calmly  i have said legree with a grim terrible calmness donejustthatthing tom unless youll tell me what you know about these yer gals  tom stood silent  dye hear said legree stamping with a roar like that of an incensed lion speak  i hant got nothing to tell masr said tom with a slow firm deliberate utterance  do you dare to tell me ye old black christian ye dont know said legree  tom was silent  speak thundered legree striking him furiously do you know anything  i know masr but i cant tell anything i can die  legree drew in a long breath and suppressing his rage took tom by the arm and approaching his face almost to his said in a terrible voice hark e tomye think cause ive let you off before i dont mean what i say but this time ive made up my mind and counted the cost youve always stood it out again me now ill conquer ye or kill yeone or t other ill count every drop of blood there is in you and take em one by one till ye give up  tom looked up to his master and answered masr if you was sick or in trouble or dying and i could save ye id give ye my hearts blood and if taking every drop of blood in this poor old body would save your precious soul id give em freely as the lord gave his for me o masr dont bring this great sin on your soul it will hurt you more than t will me do the worst you can my troublesll be over soon but if ye dont repent yours wont never end  like a strange snatch of heavenly music heard in the lull of a tempest this burst of feeling made a moments blank pause legree stood aghast and looked at tom and there was such a silence that the tick of the old clock could be heard measuring with silent touch the last moments of mercy and probation to that hardened heart  it was but a moment there was one hesitating pauseone irresolute relenting thrilland the spirit of evil came back with sevenfold vehemence and legree foaming with rage smote his victim to the ground   scenes of blood and cruelty are shocking to our ear and heart what man has nerve to do man has not nerve to hear what brotherman and brotherchristian must suffer cannot be told us even in our secret chamber it so harrows the soul and yet oh my country these things are done under the shadow of thy laws o christ thy church sees them almost in silence  but of old there was one whose suffering changed an instrument of torture degradation and shame into a symbol of glory honor and immortal life and where his spirit is neither degrading stripes nor blood nor insults can make the christians last struggle less than glorious  was he alone that long night whose brave loving spirit was bearing up in that old shed against buffeting and brutal stripes  nay there stood by him oneseen by him alonelike unto the son of god  the tempter stood by him tooblinded by furious despotic willevery moment pressing him to shun that agony by the betrayal of the innocent but the brave true heart was firm on the eternal rock like his master he knew that if he saved others himself he could not save nor could utmost extremity wring from him words save of prayers and holy trust  hes most gone masr said sambo touched in spite of himself by the patience of his victim  pay away till he gives up give it to himgive it to him shouted legree ill take every drop of blood he has unless he confesses  tom opened his eyes and looked upon his master ye poor miserable critter he said there aint no more ye can do i forgive ye with all my soul and he fainted entirely away  i blieve my soul hes done for finally said legree stepping forward to look at him yes he is well his mouths shut up at lastthats one comfort  yes legree but who shall shut up that voice in thy soul that soul past repentance past prayer past hope in whom the fire that never shall be quenched is already burning  yet tom was not quite gone his wondrous words and pious prayers had struck upon the hearts of the imbruted blacks who had been the instruments of cruelty upon him and the instant legree withdrew they took him down and in their ignorance sought to call him back to lifeas if that were any favor to him  sartin we s been doin a drefful wicked thing said sambo hopes masrll have to count for it and not we  they washed his woundsthey provided a rude bed of some refuse cotton for him to lie down on and one of them stealing up to the house begged a drink of brandy of legree pretending that he was tired and wanted it for himself he brought it back and poured it down toms throat  o tom said quimbo wes been awful wicked to ye  i forgive ye with all my heart said tom faintly  o tom do tell us who is jesus anyhow said sambojesus thats been a standin by you so all this nightwho is he  the word roused the failing fainting spirit he poured forth a few energetic sentences of that wondrous onehis life his death his everlasting presence and power to save  they weptboth the two savage men  why didnt i never hear this before said sambo but i do believei cant help it lord jesus have mercy on us  poor critters said tom id be willing to bar all i have if itll only bring ye to christ o lord give me these two more souls i pray  that prayer was answered    chapter xli  the young master   two days after a young man drove a light wagon up through the avenue of china trees and throwing the reins hastily on the horses neck sprang out and inquired for the owner of the place  it was george shelby and to show how he came to be there we must go back in our story  the letter of miss ophelia to mrs shelby had by some unfortunate accident been detained for a month or two at some remote postoffice before it reached its destination and of course before it was received tom was already lost to view among the distant swamps of the red river  mrs shelby read the intelligence with the deepest concern but any immediate action upon it was an impossibility she was then in attendance on the sickbed of her husband who lay delirious in the crisis of a fever master george shelby who in the interval had changed from a boy to a tall young man was her constant and faithful assistant and her only reliance in superintending his fathers affairs miss ophelia had taken the precaution to send them the name of the lawyer who did business for the st clares and the most that in the emergency could be done was to address a letter of inquiry to him the sudden death of mr shelby a few days after brought of course an absorbing pressure of other interests for a season  mr shelby showed his confidence in his wifes ability by appointing her sole executrix upon his estates and thus immediately a large and complicated amount of business was brought upon her hands  mrs shelby with characteristic energy applied herself to the work of straightening the entangled web of affairs and she and george were for some time occupied with collecting and examining accounts selling property and settling debts for mrs shelby was determined that everything should be brought into tangible and recognizable shape let the consequences to her prove what they might in the mean time they received a letter from the lawyer to whom miss ophelia had referred them saying that he knew nothing of the matter that the man was sold at a public auction and that beyond receiving the money he knew nothing of the affair  neither george nor mrs shelby could be easy at this result and accordingly some six months after the latter having business for his mother down the river resolved to visit new orleans in person and push his inquiries in hopes of discovering toms whereabouts and restoring him  after some months of unsuccessful search by the merest accident george fell in with a man in new orleans who happened to be possessed of the desired information and with his money in his pocket our hero took steamboat for red river resolving to find out and repurchase his old friend  he was soon introduced into the house where he found legree in the sittingroom  legree received the stranger with a kind of surly hospitality  i understand said the young man that you bought in new orleans a boy named tom he used to be on my fathers place and i came to see if i couldnt buy him back  legrees brow grew dark and he broke out passionately yes i did buy such a fellowand a hl of a bargain i had of it too the most rebellious saucy impudent dog set up my niggers to run away got off two gals worth eight hundred or a thousand apiece he owned to that and when i bid him tell me where they was he up and said he knew but he wouldnt tell and stood to it though i gave him the cussedest flogging i ever gave nigger yet i blieve hes trying to die but i dont know as hell make it out  where is he said george impetuously let me see him the cheeks of the young man were crimson and his eyes flashed fire but he prudently said nothing as yet  hes in dat ar shed said a little fellow who stood holding georges horse  legree kicked the boy and swore at him but george without saying another word turned and strode to the spot  tom had been lying two days since the fatal night not suffering for every nerve of suffering was blunted and destroyed he lay for the most part in a quiet stupor for the laws of a powerful and wellknit frame would not at once release the imprisoned spirit by stealth there had been there in the darkness of the night poor desolated creatures who stole from their scanty hours rest that they might repay to him some of those ministrations of love in which he had always been so abundant truly those poor disciples had little to giveonly the cup of cold water but it was given with full hearts  tears had fallen on that honest insensible facetears of late repentance in the poor ignorant heathen whom his dying love and patience had awakened to repentance and bitter prayers breathed over him to a latefound saviour of whom they scarce knew more than the name but whom the yearning ignorant heart of man never implores in vain  cassy who had glided out of her place of concealment and by overhearing learned the sacrifice that had been made for her and emmeline had been there the night before defying the danger of detection and moved by the last few words which the affectionate soul had yet strength to breathe the long winter of despair the ice of years had given way and the dark despairing woman had wept and prayed  when george entered the shed he felt his head giddy and his heart sick  is it possibleis it possible said he kneeling down by him uncle tom my poor poor old friend  something in the voice penetrated to the ear of the dying he moved his head gently smiled and said       jesus can make a dyingbed      feel soft as down pillows are  tears which did honor to his manly heart fell from the young mans eyes as he bent over his poor friend  o dear uncle tom do wakedo speak once more look up heres masr georgeyour own little masr george dont you know me  masr george said tom opening his eyes and speaking in a feeble voice masr george he looked bewildered  slowly the idea seemed to fill his soul and the vacant eye became fixed and brightened the whole face lighted up the hard hands clasped and tears ran down the cheeks  bless the lord it isit isits all i wanted they havent forgot me it warms my soul it does my heart good now i shall die content bless the lord on my soul  you shant die you mustnt die nor think of it ive come to buy you and take you home said george with impetuous vehemence  o masr george yere too late the lords bought me and is going to take me homeand i long to go heaven is better than kintuck  o dont die itll kill meitll break my heart to think what youve sufferedand lying in this old shed here poor poor fellow  dont call me poor fellow said tom solemnly i have been poor fellow but thats all past and gone now im right in the door going into glory o masr george heaven has come ive got the victorythe lord jesus has given it to me glory be to his name  george was awestruck at the force the vehemence the power with which these broken sentences were uttered he sat gazing in silence  tom grasped his hand and continuedye mustnt now tell chloe poor soul how ye found met would be so drefful to her only tell her ye found me going into glory and that i couldnt stay for no one and tell her the lords stood by me everywhere and alays and made everything light and easy and oh the poor chilen and the babymy old hearts been most broke for em time and agin tell em all to follow mefollow me give my love to masr and dear good missis and everybody in the place ye dont know pears like i loves em all i loves every creature everywharits nothing but love o masr george what a thing t is to be a christian  at this moment legree sauntered up to the door of the shed looked in with a dogged air of affected carelessness and turned away  the old satan said george in his indignation its a comfort to think the devil will pay him for this some of these days  o dontoh ye mustnt said tom grasping his hand hes a poor misable critter its awful to think on t oh if he only could repent the lord would forgive him now but im feared he never will  i hope he wont said george i never want to see him in heaven  hush masr georgeit worries me dont feel so he ant done me no real harmonly opened the gate of the kingdom for me thats all  at this moment the sudden flush of strength which the joy of meeting his young master had infused into the dying man gave way a sudden sinking fell upon him he closed his eyes and that mysterious and sublime change passed over his face that told the approach of other worlds  he began to draw his breath with long deep inspirations and his broad chest rose and fell heavily the expression of his face was that of a conqueror  whowhowho shall separate us from the love of christ he said in a voice that contended with mortal weakness and with a smile he fell asleep  george sat fixed with solemn awe it seemed to him that the place was holy and as he closed the lifeless eyes and rose up from the dead only one thought possessed himthat expressed by his simple old friendwhat a thing it is to be a christian  he turned legree was standing sullenly behind him  something in that dying scene had checked the natural fierceness of youthful passion the presence of the man was simply loathsome to george and he felt only an impulse to get away from him with as few words as possible  fixing his keen dark eyes on legree he simply said pointing to the dead you have got all you ever can of him what shall i pay you for the body i will take it away and bury it decently  i dont sell dead niggers said legree doggedly you are welcome to bury him where and when you like  boys said george in an authoritative tone to two or three negroes who were looking at the body help me lift him up and carry him to my wagon and get me a spade  one of them ran for a spade the other two assisted george to carry the body to the wagon  george neither spoke to nor looked at legree who did not countermand his orders but stood whistling with an air of forced unconcern he sulkily followed them to where the wagon stood at the door  george spread his cloak in the wagon and had the body carefully disposed of in itmoving the seat so as to give it room then he turned fixed his eyes on legree and said with forced composure  i have not as yet said to you what i think of this most atrocious affairthis is not the time and place but sir this innocent blood shall have justice i will proclaim this murder i will go to the very first magistrate and expose you  do said legree snapping his fingers scornfully id like to see you doing it where you going to get witnesseshow you going to prove itcome now  george saw at once the force of this defiance there was not a white person on the place and in all southern courts the testimony of colored blood is nothing he felt at that moment as if he could have rent the heavens with his hearts indignant cry for justice but in vain  after all what a fuss for a dead nigger said legree  the word was as a spark to a powder magazine prudence was never a cardinal virtue of the kentucky boy george turned and with one indignant blow knocked legree flat upon his face and as he stood over him blazing with wrath and defiance he would have formed no bad personification of his great namesake triumphing over the dragon  some men however are decidedly bettered by being knocked down if a man lays them fairly flat in the dust they seem immediately to conceive a respect for him and legree was one of this sort as he rose therefore and brushed the dust from his clothes he eyed the slowlyretreating wagon with some evident consideration nor did he open his mouth till it was out of sight  beyond the boundaries of the plantation george had noticed a dry sandy knoll shaded by a few trees there they made the grave  shall we take off the cloak masr said the negroes when the grave was ready  no nobury it with him its all i can give you now poor tom and you shall have it  they laid him in and the men shovelled away silently they banked it up and laid green turf over it  you may go boys said george slipping a quarter into the hand of each they lingered about however  if young masr would please buy us said one  wed serve him so faithful said the other  hard times here masr said the first do masr buy us please  i canti cant said george with difficulty motioning them off its impossible  the poor fellows looked dejected and walked off in silence  witness eternal god said george kneeling on the grave of his poor friend oh witness that from this hour i will do what one man can to drive out this curse of slavery from my land  there is no monument to mark the last restingplace of our friend he needs none his lord knows where he lies and will raise him up immortal to appear with him when he shall appear in his glory  pity him not such a life and death is not for pity not in the riches of omnipotence is the chief glory of god but in selfdenying suffering love and blessed are the men whom he calls to fellowship with him bearing their cross after him with patience of such it is written blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted    chapter xlii  an authentic ghost story   for some remarkable reason ghostly legends were uncommonly rife about this time among the servants on legrees place  it was whisperingly asserted that footsteps in the dead of night had been heard descending the garret stairs and patrolling the house in vain the doors of the upper entry had been locked the ghost either carried a duplicate key in its pocket or availed itself of a ghosts immemorial privilege of coming through the keyhole and promenaded as before with a freedom that was alarming  authorities were somewhat divided as to the outward form of the spirit owing to a custom quite prevalent among negroesand for aught we know among whites tooof invariably shutting the eyes and covering up heads under blankets petticoats or whatever else might come in use for a shelter on these occasions of course as everybody knows when the bodily eyes are thus out of the lists the spiritual eyes are uncommonly vivacious and perspicuous and therefore there were abundance of fulllength portraits of the ghost abundantly sworn and testified to which as if often the case with portraits agreed with each other in no particular except the common family peculiarity of the ghost tribethe wearing of a white sheet the poor souls were not versed in ancient history and did not know that shakspeare had authenticated this costume by telling how       the sheeted dead      did squeak and gibber in the streets of rome         hamlet act i scene 1 lines 115116  and therefore their all hitting upon this is a striking fact in pneumatology which we recommend to the attention of spiritual media generally  be it as it may we have private reasons for knowing that a tall figure in a white sheet did walk at the most approved ghostly hours around the legree premisespass out the doors glide about the housedisappear at intervals and reappearing pass up the silent stairway into that fatal garret and that in the morning the entry doors were all found shut and locked as firm as ever  legree could not help overhearing this whispering and it was all the more exciting to him from the pains that were taken to conceal it from him he drank more brandy than usual held up his head briskly and swore louder than ever in the daytime but he had bad dreams and the visions of his head on his bed were anything but agreeable the night after toms body had been carried away he rode to the next town for a carouse and had a high one got home late and tired locked his door took out the key and went to bed  after all let a man take what pains he may to hush it down a human soul is an awful ghostly unquiet possession for a bad man to have who knows the metes and bounds of it who knows all its awful perhapsesthose shudderings and tremblings which it can no more live down than it can outlive its own eternity what a fool is he who locks his door to keep out spirits who has in his own bosom a spirit he dares not meet alonewhose voice smothered far down and piled over with mountains of earthliness is yet like the forewarning trumpet of doom  but legree locked his door and set a chair against it he set a nightlamp at the head of his bed and put his pistols there he examined the catches and fastenings of the windows and then swore he didnt care for the devil and all his angels and went to sleep  well he slept for he was tiredslept soundly but finally there came over his sleep a shadow a horror an apprehension of something dreadful hanging over him it was his mothers shroud he thought but cassy had it holding it up and showing it to him he heard a confused noise of screams and groanings and with it all he knew he was asleep and he struggled to wake himself he was half awake he was sure something was coming into his room he knew the door was opening but he could not stir hand or foot at last he turned with a start the door was open and he saw a hand putting out his light  it was a cloudy misty moonlight and there he saw itsomething white gliding in he heard the still rustle of its ghostly garments it stood still by his beda cold hand touched his a voice said three times in a low fearful whisper come come come and while he lay sweating with terror he knew not when or how the thing was gone he sprang out of bed and pulled at the door it was shut and locked and the man fell down in a swoon  after this legree became a harder drinker than ever before he no longer drank cautiously prudently but imprudently and recklessly  there were reports around the country soon after that he was sick and dying excess had brought on that frightful disease that seems to throw the lurid shadows of a coming retribution back into the present life none could bear the horrors of that sick room when he raved and screamed and spoke of sights which almost stopped the blood of those who heard him and at his dying bed stood a stern white inexorable figure saying come come come  by a singular coincidence on the very night that this vision appeared to legree the housedoor was found open in the morning and some of the negroes had seen two white figures gliding down the avenue towards the highroad  it was near sunrise when cassy and emmeline paused for a moment in a little knot of trees near the town  cassy was dressed after the manner of the creole spanish ladieswholly in black a small black bonnet on her head covered by a veil thick with embroidery concealed her face it had been agreed that in their escape she was to personate the character of a creole lady and emmeline that of her servant  brought up from early life in connection with the highest society the language movements and air of cassy were all in agreement with this idea and she had still enough remaining with her of a once splendid wardrobe and sets of jewels to enable her to personate the thing to advantage  she stopped in the outskirts of the town where she had noticed trunks for sale and purchased a handsome one this she requested the man to send along with her and accordingly thus escorted by a boy wheeling her trunk and emmeline behind her carrying her carpetbag and sundry bundles she made her appearance at the small tavern like a lady of consideration  the first person that struck her after her arrival was george shelby who was staying there awaiting the next boat  cassy had remarked the young man from her loophole in the garret and seen him bear away the body of tom and observed with secret exultation his rencontre with legree subsequently she had gathered from the conversations she had overheard among the negroes as she glided about in her ghostly disguise after nightfall who he was and in what relation he stood to tom she therefore felt an immediate accession of confidence when she found that he was like herself awaiting the next boat  cassys air and manner address and evident command of money prevented any rising disposition to suspicion in the hotel people never inquire too closely into those who are fair on the main point of paying wella thing which cassy had foreseen when she provided herself with money  in the edge of the evening a boat was heard coming along and george shelby handed cassy aboard with the politeness which comes naturally to every kentuckian and exerted himself to provide her with a good stateroom  cassy kept her room and bed on pretext of illness during the whole time they were on red river and was waited on with obsequious devotion by her attendant  when they arrived at the mississippi river george having learned that the course of the strange lady was upward like his own proposed to take a stateroom for her on the same boat with himselfgoodnaturedly compassionating her feeble health and desirous to do what he could to assist her  behold therefore the whole party safely transferred to the good steamer cincinnati and sweeping up the river under a powerful head of steam  cassys health was much better she sat upon the guards came to the table and was remarked upon in the boat as a lady that must have been very handsome  from the moment that george got the first glimpse of her face he was troubled with one of those fleeting and indefinite likenesses which almost every body can remember and has been at times perplexed with he could not keep himself from looking at her and watching her perpetually at table or sitting at her stateroom door still she would encounter the young mans eyes fixed on her and politely withdrawn when she showed by her countenance that she was sensible to the observation  cassy became uneasy she began to think that he suspected something and finally resolved to throw herself entirely on his generosity and intrusted him with her whole history  george was heartily disposed to sympathize with any one who had escaped from legrees plantationa place that he could not remember or speak of with patienceand with the courageous disregard of consequences which is characteristic of his age and state he assured her that he would do all in his power to protect and bring them through  the next stateroom to cassys was occupied by a french lady named de thoux who was accompanied by a fine little daughter a child of some twelve summers  this lady having gathered from georges conversation that he was from kentucky seemed evidently disposed to cultivate his acquaintance in which design she was seconded by the graces of her little girl who was about as pretty a plaything as ever diverted the weariness of a fortnights trip on a steamboat  georges chair was often placed at her stateroom door and cassy as she sat upon the guards could hear their conversation  madame de thoux was very minute in her inquiries as to kentucky where she said she had resided in a former period of her life george discovered to his surprise that her former residence must have been in his own vicinity and her inquiries showed a knowledge of people and things in his vicinity that was perfectly surprising to him  do you know said madame de thoux to him one day of any man in your neighborhood of the name of harris  there is an old fellow of that name lives not far from my fathers place said george we never have had much intercourse with him though  he is a large slaveowner i believe said madame de thoux with a manner which seemed to betray more interest than she was exactly willing to show  he is said george looking rather surprised at her manner  did you ever know of his havingperhaps you may have heard of his having a mulatto boy named george  o certainlygeorge harrisi know him well he married a servant of my mothers but has escaped now to canada  he has said madame de thoux quickly thank god  george looked a surprised inquiry but said nothing  madame de thoux leaned her head on her hand and burst into tears  he is my brother she said  madame said george with a strong accent of surprise  yes said madame de thoux lifting her head proudly and wiping her tears mr shelby george harris is my brother  i am perfectly astonished said george pushing back his chair a pace or two and looking at madame de thoux  i was sold to the south when he was a boy said she i was bought by a good and generous man he took me with him to the west indies set me free and married me it is but lately that he died and i was going up to kentucky to see if i could find and redeem my brother  i heard him speak of a sister emily that was sold south said george  yes indeed i am the one said madame de thouxtell me what sort of a  a very fine young man said george notwithstanding the curse of slavery that lay on him he sustained a first rate character both for intelligence and principle i know you see he said because he married in our family  what sort of a girl said madame de thoux eagerly  a treasure said george a beautiful intelligent amiable girl very pious my mother had brought her up and trained her as carefully almost as a daughter she could read and write embroider and sew beautifully and was a beautiful singer  was she born in your house said madame de thoux  no father bought her once in one of his trips to new orleans and brought her up as a present to mother she was about eight or nine years old then father would never tell mother what he gave for her but the other day in looking over his old papers we came across the bill of sale he paid an extravagant sum for her to be sure i suppose on account of her extraordinary beauty  george sat with his back to cassy and did not see the absorbed expression of her countenance as he was giving these details  at this point in the story she touched his arm and with a face perfectly white with interest said do you know the names of the people he bought her of  a man of the name of simmons i think was the principal in the transaction at least i think that was the name on the bill of sale  o my god said cassy and fell insensible on the floor of the cabin  george was wide awake now and so was madame de thoux though neither of them could conjecture what was the cause of cassys fainting still they made all the tumult which is proper in such casesgeorge upsetting a washpitcher and breaking two tumblers in the warmth of his humanity and various ladies in the cabin hearing that somebody had fainted crowded the stateroom door and kept out all the air they possibly could so that on the whole everything was done that could be expected  poor cassy when she recovered turned her face to the wall and wept and sobbed like a childperhaps mother you can tell what she was thinking of perhaps you cannotbut she felt as sure in that hour that god had had mercy on her and that she should see her daughteras she did months afterwardswhenbut we anticipate    chapter xliii  results   the rest of our story is soon told george shelby interested as any other young man might be by the romance of the incident no less than by feelings of humanity was at the pains to send to cassy the bill of sale of eliza whose date and name all corresponded with her own knowledge of facts and felt no doubt upon her mind as to the identity of her child it remained now only for her to trace out the path of the fugitives  madame de thoux and she thus drawn together by the singular coincidence of their fortunes proceeded immediately to canada and began a tour of inquiry among the stations where the numerous fugitives from slavery are located at amherstberg they found the missionary with whom george and eliza had taken shelter on their first arrival in canada and through him were enabled to trace the family to montreal  george and eliza had now been five years free george had found constant occupation in the shop of a worthy machinist where he had been earning a competent support for his family which in the mean time had been increased by the addition of another daughter  little harrya fine bright boyhad been put to a good school and was making rapid proficiency in knowledge  the worthy pastor of the station in amherstberg where george had first landed was so much interested in the statements of madame de thoux and cassy that he yielded to the solicitations of the former to accompany them to montreal in their searchshe bearing all the expense of the expedition  the scene now changes to a small neat tenement in the outskirts of montreal the time evening a cheerful fire blazes on the hearth a teatable covered with a snowy cloth stands prepared for the evening meal in one corner of the room was a table covered with a green cloth where was an open writingdesk pens paper and over it a shelf of wellselected books  this was georges study the same zeal for selfimprovement which led him to steal the much coveted arts of reading and writing amid all the toil and discouragements of his early life still led him to devote all his leisure time to selfcultivation  at this present time he is seated at the table making notes from a volume of the family library he has been reading  come george says eliza youve been gone all day do put down that book and lets talk while im getting teado  and little eliza seconds the effort by toddling up to her father and trying to pull the book out of his hand and install herself on his knee as a substitute  o you little witch says george yielding as in such circumstances man always must  thats right says eliza as she begins to cut a loaf of bread a little older she looks her form a little fuller her air more matronly than of yore but evidently contented and happy as woman need be  harry my boy how did you come on in that sum today says george as he laid his hand on his sons head  harry has lost his long curls but he can never lose those eyes and eyelashes and that fine bold brow that flushes with triumph as he answers i did it every bit of it myself father and nobody helped me  thats right says his father depend on yourself my son you have a better chance than ever your poor father had  at this moment there is a rap at the door and eliza goes and opens it the delightedwhy this youcalls up her husband and the good pastor of amherstberg is welcomed there are two more women with him and eliza asks them to sit down  now if the truth must be told the honest pastor had arranged a little programme according to which this affair was to develop itself and on the way up all had very cautiously and prudently exhorted each other not to let things out except according to previous arrangement  what was the good mans consternation therefore just as he had motioned to the ladies to be seated and was taking out his pockethandkerchief to wipe his mouth so as to proceed to his introductory speech in good order when madame de thoux upset the whole plan by throwing her arms around georges neck and letting all out at once by saying o george dont you know me im your sister emily  cassy had seated herself more composedly and would have carried on her part very well had not little eliza suddenly appeared before her in exact shape and form every outline and curl just as her daughter was when she saw her last the little thing peered up in her face and cassy caught her up in her arms pressed her to her bosom saying what at the moment she really believed darling im your mother  in fact it was a troublesome matter to do up exactly in proper order but the good pastor at last succeeded in getting everybody quiet and delivering the speech with which he had intended to open the exercises and in which at last he succeeded so well that his whole audience were sobbing about him in a manner that ought to satisfy any orator ancient or modern  they knelt together and the good man prayedfor there are some feelings so agitated and tumultuous that they can find rest only by being poured into the bosom of almighty loveand then rising up the newfound family embraced each other with a holy trust in him who from such peril and dangers and by such unknown ways had brought them together  the notebook of a missionary among the canadian fugitives contains truth stranger than fiction how can it be otherwise when a system prevails which whirls families and scatters their members as the wind whirls and scatters the leaves of autumn these shores of refuge like the eternal shore often unite again in glad communion hearts that for long years have mourned each other as lost and affecting beyond expression is the earnestness with which every new arrival among them is met if perchance it may bring tidings of mother sister child or wife still lost to view in the shadows of slavery  deeds of heroism are wrought here more than those of romance when defying torture and braving death itself the fugitive voluntarily threads his way back to the terrors and perils of that dark land that he may bring out his sister or mother or wife  one young man of whom a missionary has told us twice recaptured and suffering shameful stripes for his heroism had escaped again and in a letter which we heard read tells his friends that he is going back a third time that he may at last bring away his sister my good sir is this man a hero or a criminal would not you do as much for your sister and can you blame him  but to return to our friends whom we left wiping their eyes and recovering themselves from too great and sudden a joy they are now seated around the social board and are getting decidedly companionable only that cassy who keeps little eliza on her lap occasionally squeezes the little thing in a manner that rather astonishes her and obstinately refuses to have her mouth stuffed with cake to the extent the little one desiresalleging what the child rather wonders at that she has got something better than cake and doesnt want it  and indeed in two or three days such a change has passed over cassy that our readers would scarcely know her the despairing haggard expression of her face had given way to one of gentle trust she seemed to sink at once into the bosom of the family and take the little ones into her heart as something for which it long had waited indeed her love seemed to flow more naturally to the little eliza than to her own daughter for she was the exact image and body of the child whom she had lost the little one was a flowery bond between mother and daughter through whom grew up acquaintanceship and affection elizas steady consistent piety regulated by the constant reading of the sacred word made her a proper guide for the shattered and wearied mind of her mother cassy yielded at once and with her whole soul to every good influence and became a devout and tender christian  after a day or two madame de thoux told her brother more particularly of her affairs the death of her husband had left her an ample fortune which she generously offered to share with the family when she asked george what way she could best apply it for him he answered give me an education emily that has always been my hearts desire then i can do all the rest  on mature deliberation it was decided that the whole family should go for some years to france whither they sailed carrying emmeline with them  the good looks of the latter won the affection of the first mate of the vessel and shortly after entering the port she became his wife  george remained four years at a french university and applying himself with an unintermitted zeal obtained a very thorough education  political troubles in france at last led the family again to seek an asylum in this country  georges feelings and views as an educated man may be best expressed in a letter to one of his friends  i feel somewhat at a loss as to my future course true as you have said to me i might mingle in the circles of the whites in this country my shade of color is so slight and that of my wife and family scarce perceptible well perhaps on sufferance i might but to tell you the truth i have no wish to  my sympathies are not for my fathers race but for my mothers to him i was no more than a fine dog or horse to my poor heartbroken mother i was a child and though i never saw her after the cruel sale that separated us till she died yet i know she always loved me dearly i know it by my own heart when i think of all she suffered of my own early sufferings of the distresses and struggles of my heroic wife of my sister sold in the new orleans slavemarketthough i hope to have no unchristian sentiments yet i may be excused for saying i have no wish to pass for an american or to identify myself with them  it is with the oppressed enslaved african race that i cast in my lot and if i wished anything i would wish myself two shades darker rather than one lighter  the desire and yearning of my soul is for an african nationality i want a people that shall have a tangible separate existence of its own and where am i to look for it not in hayti for in hayti they had nothing to start with a stream cannot rise above its fountain the race that formed the character of the haytiens was a wornout effeminate one and of course the subject race will be centuries in rising to anything  where then shall i look on the shores of africa i see a republica republic formed of picked men who by energy and selfeducating force have in many cases individually raised themselves above a condition of slavery having gone through a preparatory stage of feebleness this republic has at last become an acknowledged nation on the face of the earthacknowledged by both france and england there it is my wish to go and find myself a people  i am aware now that i shall have you all against me but before you strike hear me during my stay in france i have followed up with intense interest the history of my people in america i have noted the struggle between abolitionist and colonizationist and have received some impressions as a distant spectator which could never have occurred to me as a participator  i grant that this liberia may have subserved all sorts of purposes by being played off in the hands of our oppressors against us doubtless the scheme may have been used in unjustifiable ways as a means of retarding our emancipation but the question to me is is there not a god above all mans schemes may he not have overruled their designs and founded for us a nation by them  in these days a nation is born in a day a nation starts now with all the great problems of republican life and civilization wrought out to its handit has not to discover but only to apply let us then all take hold together with all our might and see what we can do with this new enterprise and the whole splendid continent of africa opens before us and our children our nation shall roll the tide of civilization and christianity along its shores and plant there mighty republics that growing with the rapidity of tropical vegetation shall be for all coming ages  do you say that i am deserting my enslaved brethren i think not if i forget them one hour one moment of my life so may god forget me but what can i do for them here can i break their chains no not as an individual but let me go and form part of a nation which shall have a voice in the councils of nations and then we can speak a nation has a right to argue remonstrate implore and present the cause of its racewhich an individual has not  if europe ever becomes a grand council of free nationsas i trust in god it willif there serfdom and all unjust and oppressive social inequalities are done away and if they as france and england have done acknowledge our positionthen in the great congress of nations we will make our appeal and present the cause of our enslaved and suffering race and it cannot be that free enlightened america will not then desire to wipe from her escutcheon that bar sinister which disgraces her among nations and is as truly a curse to her as to the enslaved  but you will tell me our race have equal rights to mingle in the american republic as the irishman the german the swede granted they have we ought to be free to meet and mingleto rise by our individual worth without any consideration of caste or color and they who deny us this right are false to their own professed principles of human equality we ought in particular to be allowed here we have more than the rights of common menwe have the claim of an injured race for reparation but then i do not want it i want a country a nation of my own i think that the african race has peculiarities yet to be unfolded in the light of civilization and christianity which if not the same with those of the anglosaxon may prove to be morally of even a higher type  to the anglosaxon race has been intrusted the destinies of the world during its pioneer period of struggle and conflict to that mission its stern inflexible energetic elements were well adapted but as a christian i look for another era to arise on its borders i trust we stand and the throes that now convulse the nations are to my hope but the birthpangs of an hour of universal peace and brotherhood  i trust that the development of africa is to be essentially a christian one if not a dominant and commanding race they are at least an affectionate magnanimous and forgiving one having been called in the furnace of injustice and oppression they have need to bind closer to their hearts that sublime doctrine of love and forgiveness through which alone they are to conquer which it is to be their mission to spread over the continent of africa  in myself i confess i am feeble for thisfull half the blood in my veins is the hot and hasty saxon but i have an eloquent preacher of the gospel ever by my side in the person of my beautiful wife when i wander her gentler spirit ever restores me and keeps before my eyes the christian calling and mission of our race as a christian patriot as a teacher of christianity i go to my countrymy chosen my glorious africaand to her in my heart i sometimes apply those splendid words of prophecy whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated so that no man went through thee i will make thee an eternal excellence a joy of many generations  you will call me an enthusiast you will tell me that i have not well considered what i am undertaking but i have considered and counted the cost i go to liberia not as an elysium of romance but as to a field of work i expect to work with both handsto work hard to work against all sorts of difficulties and discouragements and to work till i die this is what i go for and in this i am quite sure i shall not be disappointed  whatever you may think of my determination do not divorce me from your confidence and think that in whatever i do i act with a heart wholly given to my people  george harris   george with his wife children sister and mother embarked for africa some few weeks after if we are not mistaken the world will yet hear from him there  of our other characters we have nothing very particular to write except a word relating to miss ophelia and topsy and a farewell chapter which we shall dedicate to george shelby  miss ophelia took topsy home to vermont with her much to the surprise of the grave deliberative body whom a new englander recognizes under the term our folks our folks at first thought it an odd and unnecessary addition to their welltrained domestic establishment but so thoroughly efficient was miss ophelia in her conscientious endeavor to do her duty by her eleve that the child rapidly grew in grace and in favor with the family and neighborhood at the age of womanhood she was by her own request baptized and became a member of the christian church in the place and showed so much intelligence activity and zeal and desire to do good in the world that she was at last recommended and approved as a missionary to one of the stations in africa and we have heard that the same activity and ingenuity which when a child made her so multiform and restless in her developments is now employed in a safer and wholesomer manner in teaching the children of her own country  psit will be a satisfaction to some mother also to state that some inquiries which were set on foot by madame de thoux have resulted recently in the discovery of cassys son being a young man of energy he had escaped some years before his mother and been received and educated by friends of the oppressed in the north he will soon follow his family to africa    chapter xliv  the liberator   george shelby had written to his mother merely a line stating the day that she might expect him home of the death scene of his old friend he had not the heart to write he had tried several times and only succeeded in half choking himself and invariably finished by tearing up the paper wiping his eyes and rushing somewhere to get quiet  there was a pleased bustle all though the shelby mansion that day in expectation of the arrival of young masr george  mrs shelby was seated in her comfortable parlor where a cheerful hickory fire was dispelling the chill of the late autumn evening a suppertable glittering with plate and cut glass was set out on whose arrangements our former friend old chloe was presiding  arrayed in a new calico dress with clean white apron and high wellstarched turban her black polished face glowing with satisfaction she lingered with needless punctiliousness around the arrangements of the table merely as an excuse for talking a little to her mistress  laws now wont it look natural to him she said thari set his plate just whar he likes it round by the fire masr george allers wants de warm seat o go waywhy didnt sally get out de best teapotde little new one masr george got for missis christmas ill have it out and missis has

gin him the mornin he was took off lord bless us how i felt dat ar morning  mrs shelby sighed and felt a heavy weight on her heart at this allusion she had felt uneasy ever since she received her sons letter lest something should prove to be hidden behind the veil of silence which he had drawn  missis has got dem bills said chloe anxiously  yes chloe  cause i wants to show my old man dem very bills de perfectioner gave me and say he chloe i wish youd stay longer thank you masr says i i would only my old mans coming home and mississhe cant do without me no longer theres jist what i telled him berry nice man dat masr jones was  chloe had pertinaciously insisted that the very bills in which her wages had been paid should be preserved to show her husband in memorial of her capability and mrs shelby had readily consented to humor her in the request  he wont know pollymy old man wont laws its five year since they tuck him she was a baby dencouldnt but jist stand remember how tickled he used to be cause she would keep a fallin over when she sot out to walk laws a me  the rattling of wheels now was heard  masr george said aunt chloe starting to the window  mrs shelby ran to the entry door and was folded in the arms of her son aunt chloe stood anxiously straining her eyes out into the darkness  o poor aunt chloe said george stopping compassionately and taking her hard black hand between both his id have given all my fortune to have brought him with me but hes gone to a better country  there was a passionate exclamation from mrs shelby but aunt chloe said nothing  the party entered the supperroom the money of which chloe was so proud was still lying on the table  thar said she gathering it up and holding it with a trembling hand to her mistress dont never want to see nor hear on t again jist as i knew t would besold and murdered on dem ar old plantations  chloe turned and was walking proudly out of the room mrs shelby followed her softly and took one of her hands drew her down into a chair and sat down by her  my poor good chloe said she  chloe leaned her head on her mistress shoulder and sobbed out o missis scuse me my hearts brokedats all  i know it is said mrs shelby as her tears fell fast and i cannot heal it but jesus can he healeth the broken hearted and bindeth up their wounds  there was a silence for some time and all wept together at last george sitting down beside the mourner took her hand and with simple pathos repeated the triumphant scene of her husbands death and his last messages of love  about a month after this one morning all the servants of the shelby estate were convened together in the great hall that ran through the house to hear a few words from their young master  to the surprise of all he appeared among them with a bundle of papers in his hand containing a certificate of freedom to every one on the place which he read successively and presented amid the sobs and tears and shouts of all present  many however pressed around him earnestly begging him not to send them away and with anxious faces tendering back their free papers  we dont want to be no freer than we are wes allers had all we wanted we dont want to leave de ole place and masr and missis and de rest  my good friends said george as soon as he could get a silence therell be no need for you to leave me the place wants as many hands to work it as it did before we need the same about the house that we did before but you are now free men and free women i shall pay you wages for your work such as we shall agree on the advantage is that in case of my getting in debt or dyingthings that might happenyou cannot now be taken up and sold i expect to carry on the estate and to teach you what perhaps it will take you some time to learnhow to use the rights i give you as free men and women i expect you to be good and willing to learn and i trust in god that i shall be faithful and willing to teach and now my friends look up and thank god for the blessing of freedom  an aged partriarchal negro who had grown gray and blind on the estate now rose and lifting his trembling hand said let us give thanks unto the lord as all kneeled by one consent a more touching and hearty te deum never ascended to heaven though borne on the peal of organ bell and cannon than came from that honest old heart  on rising another struck up a methodist hymn of which the burden was       the year of jubilee is come      return ye ransomed sinners home  one thing more said george as he stopped the congratulations of the throng you all remember our good old uncle tom  george here gave a short narration of the scene of his death and of his loving farewell to all on the place and added  it was on his grave my friends that i resolved before god that i would never own another slave while it was possible to free him that nobody through me should ever run the risk of being parted from home and friends and dying on a lonely plantation as he died so when you rejoice in your freedom think that you owe it to that good old soul and pay it back in kindness to his wife and children think of your freedom every time you see uncle toms cabin and let it be a memorial to put you all in mind to follow in his steps and be honest and faithful and christian as he was    chapter xlv  concluding remarks   the writer has often been inquired of by correspondents from different parts of the country whether this narrative is a true one and to these inquiries she will give one general answer  the separate incidents that compose the narrative are to a very great extent authentic occurring many of them either under her own observation or that of her personal friends she or her friends have observed characters the counterpart of almost all that are here introduced and many of the sayings are word for word as heard herself or reported to her  the personal appearance of eliza the character ascribed to her are sketches drawn from life the incorruptible fidelity piety and honesty of uncle tom had more than one development to her personal knowledge some of the most deeply tragic and romantic some of the most terrible incidents have also their parallels in reality the incident of the mothers crossing the ohio river on the ice is a wellknown fact the story of old prue in the second volume was an incident that fell under the personal observation of a brother of the writer then collectingclerk to a large mercantile house in new orleans from the same source was derived the character of the planter legree of him her brother thus wrote speaking of visiting his plantation on a collecting tour he actually made me feel of his fist which was like a blacksmiths hammer or a nodule of iron telling me that it was calloused with knocking down niggers when i left the plantation i drew a long breath and felt as if i had escaped from an ogres den  that the tragical fate of tom also has too many times had its parallel there are living witnesses all over our land to testify let it be remembered that in all southern states it is a principle of jurisprudence that no person of colored lineage can testify in a suit against a white and it will be easy to see that such a case may occur wherever there is a man whose passions outweigh his interests and a slave who has manhood or principle enough to resist his will there is actually nothing to protect the slaves life but the character of the master facts too shocking to be contemplated occasionally force their way to the public ear and the comment that one often hears made on them is more shocking than the thing itself it is said very likely such cases may now and then occur but they are no sample of general practice if the laws of new england were so arranged that a master could now and then torture an apprentice to death would it be received with equal composure would it be said these cases are rare and no samples of general practice this injustice is an inherent one in the slave systemit cannot exist without it  the public and shameless sale of beautiful mulatto and quadroon girls has acquired a notoriety from the incidents following the capture of the pearl we extract the following from the speech of hon horace mann one of the legal counsel for the defendants in that case he says in that company of seventysix persons who attempted in 1848 to escape from the district of columbia in the schooner pearl and whose officers i assisted in defending there were several young and healthy girls who had those peculiar attractions of form and feature which connoisseurs prize so highly elizabeth russel was one of them she immediately fell into the slavetraders fangs and was doomed for the new orleans market the hearts of those that saw her were touched with pity for her fate they offered eighteen hundred dollars to redeem her and some there were who offered to give that would not have much left after the gift but the fiend of a slavetrader was inexorable she was despatched to new orleans but when about half way there god had mercy on her and smote her with death there were two girls named edmundson in the same company when about to be sent to the same market an older sister went to the shambles to plead with the wretch who owned them for the love of god to spare his victims he bantered her telling what fine dresses and fine furniture they would have yes she said that may do very well in this life but what will become of them in the next they too were sent to new orleans but were afterwards redeemed at an enormous ransom and brought back is it not plain from this that the histories of emmeline and cassy may have many counterparts  justice too obliges the author to state that the fairness of mind and generosity attributed to st clare are not without a parallel as the following anecdote will show a few years since a young southern gentleman was in cincinnati with a favorite servant who had been his personal attendant from a boy the young man took advantage of this opportunity to secure his own freedom and fled to the protection of a quaker who was quite noted in affairs of this kind the owner was exceedingly indignant he had always treated the slave with such indulgence and his confidence in his affection was such that he believed he must have been practised upon to induce him to revolt from him he visited the quaker in high anger but being possessed of uncommon candor and fairness was soon quieted by his arguments and representations it was a side of the subject which he never had heardnever had thought on and he immediately told the quaker that if his slave would to his own face say that it was his desire to be free he would liberate him an interview was forthwith procured and nathan was asked by his young master whether he had ever had any reason to complain of his treatment in any respect  no masr said nathan youve always been good to me  well then why do you want to leave me  masr may die and then who get meid rather be a free man  after some deliberation the young master replied nathan in your place i think i should feel very much so myself you are free  he immediately made him out free papers deposited a sum of money in the hands of the quaker to be judiciously used in assisting him to start in life and left a very sensible and kind letter of advice to the young man that letter was for some time in the writers hands  the author hopes she has done justice to that nobility generosity and humanity which in many cases characterize individuals at the south such instances save us from utter despair of our kind but she asks any person who knows the world are such characters common anywhere  for many years of her life the author avoided all reading upon or allusion to the subject of slavery considering it as too painful to be inquired into and one which advancing light and civilization would certainly live down but since the legislative act of 1850 when she heard with perfect surprise and consternation christian and humane people actually recommending the remanding escaped fugitives into slavery as a duty binding on good citizenswhen she heard on all hands from kind compassionate and estimable people in the free states of the north deliberations and discussions as to what christian duty could be on this headshe could only think these men and christians cannot know what slavery is if they did such a question could never be open for discussion and from this arose a desire to exhibit it in a living dramatic reality she has endeavored to show it fairly in its best and its worst phases in its best aspect she has perhaps been successful but oh who shall say what yet remains untold in that valley and shadow of death that lies the other side  to you generous nobleminded men and women of the southyou whose virtue and magnanimity and purity of character are the greater for the severer trial it has encounteredto you is her appeal have you not in your own secret souls in your own private conversings felt that there are woes and evils in this accursed system far beyond what are here shadowed or can be shadowed can it be otherwise is man ever a creature to be trusted with wholly irresponsible power and does not the slave system by denying the slave all legal right of testimony make every individual owner an irresponsible despot can anybody fail to make the inference what the practical result will be if there is as we admit a public sentiment among you men of honor justice and humanity is there not also another kind of public sentiment among the ruffian the brutal and debased and cannot the ruffian the brutal the debased by slave law own just as many slaves as the best and purest are the honorable the just the highminded and compassionate the majority anywhere in this world  the slavetrade is now by american law considered as piracy but a slavetrade as systematic as ever was carried on on the coast of africa is an inevitable attendant and result of american slavery and its heartbreak and its horrors can they be told  the writer has given only a faint shadow a dim picture of the anguish and despair that are at this very moment riving thousands of hearts shattering thousands of families and driving a helpless and sensitive race to frenzy and despair there are those living who know the mothers whom this accursed traffic has driven to the murder of their children and themselves seeking in death a shelter from woes more dreaded than death nothing of tragedy can be written can be spoken can be conceived that equals the frightful reality of scenes daily and hourly acting on our shores beneath the shadow of american law and the shadow of the cross of christ  and now men and women of america is this a thing to be trifled with apologized for and passed over in silence farmers of massachusetts of new hampshire of vermont of connecticut who read this book by the blaze of your winterevening firestronghearted generous sailors and shipowners of maineis this a thing for you to countenance and encourage brave and generous men of new york farmers of rich and joyous ohio and ye of the wide prairie statesanswer is this a thing for you to protect and countenance and you mothers of americayou who have learned by the cradles of your own children to love and feel for all mankindby the sacred love you bear your child by your joy in his beautiful spotless infancy by the motherly pity and tenderness with which you guide his growing years by the anxieties of his education by the prayers you breathe for his souls eternal goodi beseech you pity the mother who has all your affections and not one legal right to protect guide or educate the child of her bosom by the sick hour of your child by those dying eyes which you can never forget by those last cries that wrung your heart when you could neither help nor save by the desolation of that empty cradle that silent nurseryi beseech you pity those mothers that are constantly made childless by the american slavetrade and say mothers of america is this a thing to be defended sympathized with passed over in silence  do you say that the people of the free state have nothing to do with it and can do nothing would to god this were true but it is not true the people of the free states have defended encouraged and participated and are more guilty for it before god than the south in that they have not the apology of education or custom  if the mothers of the free states had all felt as they should in times past the sons of the free states would not have been the holders and proverbially the hardest masters of slaves the sons of the free states would not have connived at the extension of slavery in our national body the sons of the free states would not as they do trade the souls and bodies of men as an equivalent to money in their mercantile dealings there are multitudes of slaves temporarily owned and sold again by merchants in northern cities and shall the whole guilt or obloquy of slavery fall only on the south  northern men northern mothers northern christians have something more to do than denounce their brethren at the south they have to look to the evil among themselves  but what can any individual do of that every individual can judge there is one thing that every individual can dothey can see to it that they feel right an atmosphere of sympathetic influence encircles every human being and the man or woman who feels strongly healthily and justly on the great interests of humanity is a constant benefactor to the human race see then to your sympathies in this matter are they in harmony with the sympathies of christ or are they swayed and perverted by the sophistries of worldly policy  christian men and women of the north still furtheryou have another power you can pray do you believe in prayer or has it become an indistinct apostolic tradition you pray for the heathen abroad pray also for the heathen at home and pray for those distressed christians whose whole chance of religious improvement is an accident of trade and sale from whom any adherence to the morals of christianity is in many cases an impossibility unless they have given them from above the courage and grace of martyrdom  but still more on the shores of our free states are emerging the poor shattered broken remnants of familiesmen and women escaped by miraculous providences from the surges of slaveryfeeble in knowledge and in many cases infirm in moral constitution from a system which confounds and confuses every principle of christianity and morality they come to seek a refuge among you they come to seek education knowledge christianity  what do you owe to these poor unfortunates oh christians does not every american christian owe to the african race some effort at reparation for the wrongs that the american nation has brought upon them shall the doors of churches and schoolhouses be shut upon them shall states arise and shake them out shall the church of christ hear in silence the taunt that is thrown at them and shrink away from the helpless hand that they stretch out and by her silence encourage the cruelty that would chase them from our borders if it must be so it will be a mournful spectacle if it must be so the country will have reason to tremble when it remembers that the fate of nations is in the hands of one who is very pitiful and of tender compassion  do you say we dont want them here let them go to africa  that the providence of god has provided a refuge in africa is indeed a great and noticeable fact but that is no reason why the church of christ should throw off that responsibility to this outcast race which her profession demands of her  to fill up liberia with an ignorant inexperienced halfbarbarized race just escaped from the chains of slavery would be only to prolong for ages the period of struggle and conflict which attends the inception of new enterprises let the church of the north receive these poor sufferers in the spirit of christ receive them to the educating advantages of christian republican society and schools until they have attained to somewhat of a moral and intellectual maturity and then assist them in their passage to those shores where they may put in practice the lessons they have learned in america  there is a body of men at the north comparatively small who have been doing this and as the result this country has already seen examples of men formerly slaves who have rapidly acquired property reputation and education talent has been developed which considering the circumstances is certainly remarkable and for moral traits of honesty kindness tenderness of feelingfor heroic efforts and selfdenials endured for the ransom of brethren and friends yet in slaverythey have been remarkable to a degree that considering the influence under which they were born is surprising  the writer has lived for many years on the frontierline of slave states and has had great opportunities of observation among those who formerly were slaves they have been in her family as servants and in default of any other school to receive them she has in many cases had them instructed in a family school with her own children she has also the testimony of missionaries among the fugitives in canada in coincidence with her own experience and her deductions with regard to the capabilities of the race are encouraging in the highest degree  the first desire of the emancipated slave generally is for education there is nothing that they are not willing to give or do to have their children instructed and so far as the writer has observed herself or taken the testimony of teachers among them they are remarkably intelligent and quick to learn the results of schools founded for them by benevolent individuals in cincinnati fully establish this  the author gives the following statement of facts on the authority of professor c e stowe then of lane seminary ohio with regard to emancipated slaves now resident in cincinnati given to show the capability of the race even without any very particular assistance or encouragement  the initial letters alone are given they are all residents of cincinnati  b furniture maker twenty years in the city worth ten thousand dollars all his own earnings a baptist  c full black stolen from africa sold in new orleans been free fifteen years paid for himself six hundred dollars a farmer owns several farms in indiana presbyterian probably worth fifteen or twenty thousand dollars all earned by himself  k full black dealer in real estate worth thirty thousand dollars about forty years old free six years paid eighteen hundred dollars for his family member of the baptist church received a legacy from his master which he has taken good care of and increased  g full black coal dealer about thirty years old worth eighteen thousand dollars paid for himself twice being once defrauded to the amount of sixteen hundred dollars made all his money by his own effortsmuch of it while a slave hiring his time of his master and doing business for himself a fine gentlemanly fellow  w threefourths black barber and waiter from kentucky nineteen years free paid for self and family over three thousand dollars deacon in the baptist church  g d threefourths black whitewasher from kentucky nine years free paid fifteen hundred dollars for self and family recently died aged sixty worth six thousand dollars  professor stowe says with all these except g i have been for some years personally acquainted and make my statements from my own knowledge  the writer well remembers an aged colored woman who was employed as a washerwoman in her fathers family the daughter of this woman married a slave she was a remarkably active and capable young woman and by her industry and thrift and the most persevering selfdenial raised nine hundred dollars for her husbands freedom which she paid as she raised it into the hands of his master she yet wanted a hundred dollars of the price when he died she never recovered any of the money  these are but few facts among multitudes which might be adduced to show the selfdenial energy patience and honesty which the slave has exhibited in a state of freedom  and let it be remembered that these individuals have thus bravely succeeded in conquering for themselves comparative wealth and social position in the face of every disadvantage and discouragement the colored man by the law of ohio cannot be a voter and till within a few years was even denied the right of testimony in legal suits with the white nor are these instances confined to the state of ohio in all states of the union we see men but yesterday burst from the shackles of slavery who by a selfeducating force which cannot be too much admired have risen to highly respectable stations in society pennington among clergymen douglas and ward among editors are well known instances  if this persecuted race with every discouragement and disadvantage have done thus much how much more they might do if the christian church would act towards them in the spirit of her lord  this is an age of the world when nations are trembling and convulsed a mighty influence is abroad surging and heaving the world as with an earthquake and is america safe every nation that carries in its bosom great and unredressed injustice has in it the elements of this last convulsion  for what is this mighty influence thus rousing in all nations and languages those groanings that cannot be uttered for mans freedom and equality  o church of christ read the signs of the times is not this power the spirit of him whose kingdom is yet to come and whose will to be done on earth as it is in heaven  but who may abide the day of his appearing for that day shall burn as an oven and he shall appear as a swift witness against those that oppress the hireling in his wages the widow and the fatherless and that turn aside the stranger in his right and he shall break in pieces the oppressor  are not these dread words for a nation bearing in her bosom so mighty an injustice christians every time that you pray that the kingdom of christ may come can you forget that prophecy associates in dread fellowship the day of vengeance with the year of his redeemed  a day of grace is yet held out to us both north and south have been guilty before god and the christian church has a heavy account to answer not by combining together to protect injustice and cruelty and making a common capital of sin is this union to be savedbut by repentance justice and mercy for not surer is the eternal law by which the millstone sinks in the ocean than that stronger law by which injustice and cruelty shall bring on nations the wrath of almighty god
