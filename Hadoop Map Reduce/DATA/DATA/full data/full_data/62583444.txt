century   the dawn of darwinism  one day early in the eighteen hundred and sixties i being then a small boy was with my nurse buying something in the shop of a petty newsagent bookseller and stationer in camden street dublin when there entered an elderly man weighty and solemn who advanced to the counter and said pompously have you the works of the celebrated buffoon  my own works were at that time unwritten or it is possible that the shop assistant might have misunderstood me so far as to produce a copy of man and superman as it was she knew quite well what he wanted for this was before the education act of 1870 had produced shop assistants who know how to read and know nothing else the celebrated buffoon was not a humorist but the famous naturalist buffon every literate child at that time knew buffons natural history as well as esops fables and no living child had heard the name that has since obliterated buffons in the popular consciousness the name of darwin  ten years elapsed the celebrated buffoon was forgotten i had doubled my years and my length and i had discarded the religion of my forefathers one day the richest and consequently most dogmatic of my uncles came into a restaurant where i was dining and found himself much against his will in conversation with the most questionable of his nephews by way of making myself agreeable i spoke of modern thought and darwin he said oh thats the fellow who wants to make out that we all have tails like monkeys i tried to explain that what darwin had insisted on in this connection was that some monkeys have no tails but my uncle was as impervious to what darwin really said as any neodarwinian nowadays he died impenitent and did not mention me in his will  twenty years elapsed if my uncle had been alive he would have known all about darwin and known it all wrong in spite of the efforts of grant allen to set him right he would have accepted darwin as the discoverer of evolution of heredity and of modification of species by selection for the predarwinian age had come to be regarded as a dark age in which men still believed that the book of genesis was a standard scientific treatise and that the only additions to it were galileos demonstration of leonardo da vincis simple remark that the earth is a moon of the sun newtons theory of gravitation sir humphry davys invention of the safetylamp the discovery of electricity the application of steam to industrial purposes and the penny post it was just the same in other subjects thus nietzsche by the two or three who had come across his writings was supposed to have been the first man to whom it occurred that mere morality and legality and urbanity lead nowhere as if bunyan had never written badman schopenhauer was credited with inventing the distinction between the covenant of grace and the covenant of works which troubled cromwell on his deathbed people talked as if there had been no dramatic or descriptive music before wagner no impressionist painting before whistler whilst as to myself i was finding that the surest way to produce an effect of daring innovation and originality was to revive the ancient attraction of long rhetorical speeches to stick closely to the methods of moli√®re and to lift characters bodily out of the pages of charles dickens   the advent of the neodarwinians  this particular sort of ignorance does not always or often matter but in darwins case it did matter if darwin had really led the world at one bound from the book of genesis to heredity to modification of species by selection and to evolution he would have been a philosopher and a prophet as well as an eminent professional naturalist with geology as a hobby the delusion that he had actually achieved this feat did no harm at first because if peoples views are sound about evolution or anything else it does not make two straws difference whether they call the revealer of their views tom or dick but later on such apparently negligible errors have awkward consequences darwin was given an imposing reputation as not only an evolutionist but as the evolutionist with the immense majority who never read his books the few who never read any others were led by them to concentrate exclusively on circumstantial selection as the explanation of all the transformations and adaptations which were the evidence for evolution and they presently found themselves so cut off by this specialization from the majority who knew darwin only by his spurious reputation that they were obliged to distinguish themselves not as darwinians but as neodarwinians  before ten more years had elapsed the neodarwinians were practically running current science it was 1906 i was fifty i published my own view of evolution in a play called man and superman and i found that most people were unable to understand how i could be an evolutionist and not a neodarwinian or why i habitually derided neodarwinism as a ghastly idiocy and would fall on its professors slaughterously in public discussions it was in the hope of making me clear the matter up that the fabian society which was then organizing a series of lectures on prophets of the nineteenth century asked me to deliver a lecture on the prophet darwin i did so and scraps of that lecture which was never published variegate these pages   political inadequacy of the human animal  ten more years elapsed neodarwinism in politics had produced a european catastrophe of a magnitude so appalling and a scope so unpredictable that as i write these lines in 1920 it is still far from certain whether our civilization will survive it the circumstances of this catastrophe the boyish cinemafed romanticism which made it possible to impose it on the people as a crusade and especially the ignorance and errors of the victors of western europe when its violent phase had passed and the time for reconstruction arrived confirmed a doubt which had grown steadily in my mind during my forty years public work as a socialist namely whether the human animal as he exists at present is capable of solving the social problems raised by his own aggregation or as he calls it his civilization   cowardice of the irreligious  another observation i had made was that goodnatured unambitious men are cowards when they have no religion they are dominated and exploited not only by greedy and often halfwitted and halfalive weaklings who will do anything for cigars champagne motor cars and the more childish and selfish uses of money but by able and sound administrators who can do nothing else with them than dominate and exploit them government and exploitation become synonymous under such circumstances and the world is finally ruled by the childish the brigands and the blackguards those who refuse to stand in with them are persecuted and occasionally executed when they give any trouble to the exploiters they fall into poverty when they lack lucrative specific talents at the present moment one half of europe having knocked the other half down is trying to kick it to death and may succeed a procedure which is logically sound neodarwinism and the goodnatured majority are looking on in helpless horror or allowing themselves to be persuaded by the newspapers of their exploiters that the kicking is not only a sound commercial investment but an act of divine justice of which they are the ardent instruments  but if man is really incapable of organizing a big civilization and cannot organize even a village or a tribe any too well what is the use of giving him a religion a religion may make him hunger and thirst for righteousness but will it endow him with the practical capacity to satisfy that appetite good intentions do not carry with them a grain of political science which is a very complicated one the most devoted and indefatigable the most able and disinterested students of this science in england as far as i know are my friends sidney and beatrice webb it has taken them forty years of preliminary work in the course of which they have published several treatises comparable to adam smiths wealth of nations to formulate a political constitution adequate to existing needs if this is the measure of what can be done in a lifetime by extraordinary ability keen natural aptitude exceptional opportunities and freedom from the preoccupations of breadwinning what are we to expect from the parliament man to whom political science is as remote and distasteful as the differential calculus and to whom such an elementary but vital point as the law of economic rent is a pons asinorum never to be approached much less crossed or from the common voter who is mostly so hard at work all day earning a living that he cannot keep awake for five minutes over a book   is there any hope in education  the usual answer is that we must educate our masters that is ourselves we must teach citizenship and political science at school but must we there is no must about it the hard fact being that we must not teach political science or citizenship at school the schoolmaster who attempted it would soon find himself penniless in the streets without pupils if not in the dock pleading to a pompously worded indictment for sedition against the exploiters our schools teach the morality of feudalism corrupted by commercialism and hold up the military conqueror the robber baron and the profiteer as models of the illustrious and the successful in vain do the prophets who see through this imposture preach and teach a better gospel the individuals whom they convert are doomed to pass away in a few years and the new generations are dragged back in the schools to the morality of the fifteenth century and think themselves liberal when they are defending the ideas of henry vii and gentlemanly when they are opposing to them the ideas of richard iii thus the educated man is a greater nuisance than the uneducated one indeed it is the inefficiency and sham of the educational side of our schools to which except under compulsion children would not be sent by their parents at all if they did not act as prisons in which the immature are kept from worrying the mature that save us from being dashed on the rocks of false doctrine instead of drifting down the midstream of mere ignorance there is no way out through the schoolmaster   homeopathic education  in truth mankind cannot be saved from without by schoolmasters or any other sort of masters it can only be lamed and enslaved by them it is said that if you wash a cat it will never again wash itself this may or may not be true what is certain is that if you teach a man anything he will never learn it and if you cure him of a disease he will be unable to cure himself the next time it attacks him therefore if you want to see a cat clean you throw a bucket of mud over it when it will immediately take extraordinary pains to lick the mud off and finally be cleaner than it was before in the same way doctors who are uptodate burgelubin per cent of all the registered practitioners and 20 per cent of the unregistered ones when they want to rid you of a disease or a symptom inoculate you with that disease or give you a drug that produces that symptom in order to provoke you to resist it as the mud provokes the cat to wash itself  now an acute person will ask me why if this be so our false education does not provoke our scholars to find out the truth my answer is that it sometimes does voltaire was a pupil of the jesuits samuel butler was the pupil of a hopelessly conventional and erroneous country parson but then voltaire was voltaire and butler was butler that is their minds were so abnormally strong that they could throw off the doses of poison that paralyse ordinary minds when the doctors inoculate you and the homeopathists dose you they give you an infinitesimally attenuated dose if they gave you the virus at full strength it would overcome your resistance and produce its direct effect the doses of false doctrine given at public schools and universities are so big that they overwhelm the resistance that a tiny dose would provoke the normal student is corrupted beyond redemption and will drive the genius who resists out of the country if he can byron and shelley had to fly to italy whilst castlereagh and eldon ruled the roost at home rousseau was hunted from frontier to frontier karl marx starved in exile in a soho lodging ruskins articles were refused by the magazines he was too rich to be otherwise persecuted whilst mindless forgotten nonentities governed the land sent men to the prison or the gallows for blasphemy and sedition meaning the truth about church and state and sedulously stored up the social disease and corruption which explode from time to time in gigantic boils that have to be lanced by a million bayonets this is the result of allopathic education homeopathic education has not yet been officially tried and would obviously be a delicate matter if it were a body of schoolmasters inciting their pupils to infinitesimal peccadilloes with the object of provoking them to exclaim get thee behind me satan or telling them white lies about history for the sake of being contradicted insulted and refuted would certainly do less harm than our present educational allopaths do but then nobody will advocate homeopathic education allopathy has produced the poisonous illusion that it enlightens instead of darkening the suggestion may however explain why whilst most peoples minds succumb to inculcation and environment a few react vigorously honest and decent people coming from thievish slums and sceptics and realists from country parsonages   the diabolical efficiency of technical education  but meanwhileand here comes the horror of itour technical instruction is honest and efficient the public schoolboy who is carefully blinded duped and corrupted as to the nature of a society based on profiteering and is taught to honor parasitic idleness and luxury learns to shoot and ride and keep fit with all the assistance and guidance that can be procured for him by the most anxiously sincere desire that he may do these things well and if possible superlatively well in the army he learns to fly to drop bombs to use machineguns to the utmost of his capacity the discovery of high explosives is rewarded and dignified instruction in the manufacture of the weapons battleships submarines and land batteries by which they are applied destructively is quite genuine the instructors know their business and really mean the learners to succeed the result is that powers of destruction that could hardly without uneasiness be entrusted to infinite wisdom and infinite benevolence are placed in the hands of romantic schoolboy patriots who however generous by nature are by education ignoramuses dupes snobs and sportsmen to whom fighting is a religion and killing an accomplishment whilst political power useless under such circumstances except to militarist imperialists in chronic terror of invasion and subjugation pompous tufthunting fools commercial adventurers to whom the organization by the nation of its own industrial services would mean checkmate financial parasites on the money market and stupid people who cling to the status quo merely because they are used to it is obtained by heredity by simple purchase by keeping newspapers and pretending that they are organs of public opinion by the wiles of seductive women and by prostituting ambitious talent to the service of the profiteers who call the tune because having secured all the spare plunder they alone can afford to pay the piper neither the rulers nor the ruled understand high politics they do not even know that there is such a branch of knowledge as political science but between them they can coerce and enslave with the deadliest efficiency even to the wiping out of civilization because their education as slayers has been honestly and thoroughly carried out essentially the rulers are all defectives and there is nothing worse than government by defectives who wield irresistible powers of physical coercion the commonplace sound people submit and compel the rest to submit because they have been taught to do so as an article of religion and a point of honor those in whom natural enlightenment has reacted against artificial education submit because they are compelled but they would resist and finally resist effectively if they were not cowards and they are cowards because they have neither an officially accredited and established religion nor a generally recognized point of honor and are all at sixes and sevens with their various private speculations sending their children perforce to the schools where they will be corrupted for want of any other schools the rulers are equally intimidated by the immense extension and cheapening of the means of slaughter and destruction the british government is more afraid of ireland now that submarines bombs and poison gas are cheap and easily made than it was of the german empire before the war consequently the old british custom which maintained a balance of power through command of the sea is intensified into a terror that sees security in nothing short of absolute military mastery of the entire globe that is in an impossibility that will yet seem possible in detail to soldiers and to parochial and insular patriotic civilians   flimsiness of civilization  this situation has occurred so often before always with the same result of a collapse of civilization professor flinders petrie has let out the secret of previous collapses that the rich are instinctively crying let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die and the poor how long o lord how long but the pitiless reply still is that god helps those who help themselves this does not mean that if man cannot find the remedy no remedy will be found the power that produced man when the monkey was not up to the mark can produce a higher creature than man if man does not come up to the mark what it means is that if man is to be saved man must save himself there seems no compelling reason why he should be saved he is by no means an ideal creature at his present best many of his ways are so unpleasant that they are unmentionable in polite society and so painful that he is compelled to pretend that pain is often a good nature holds no brief for the human experiment it must stand or fall by its results if man will not serve nature will try another experiment  what hope is there then of human improvement according to the neodarwinists to the mechanists no hope whatever because improvement can come only through some senseless accident which must on the statistical average of accidents be presently wiped out by some other equally senseless accident   creative evolution  but this dismal creed does not discourage those who believe that the impulse that produces evolution is creative they have observed the simple fact that the will to do anything can and does at a certain pitch of intensity set up by conviction of its necessity create and organize new tissue to do it with to them therefore mankind is by no means played out yet if the weight lifter under the trivial stimulus of an athletic competition can put up a muscle it seems reasonable to believe that an equally earnest and convinced philosopher could put up a brain both are directions of vitality to a certain end evolution shews us this direction of vitality doing all sorts of things providing the centipede with a hundred legs and ridding the fish of any legs at all building lungs and arms for the land and gills and fins for the sea enabling the mammal to gestate its young inside its body and the fowl to incubate hers outside it offering us we may say our choice of any sort of bodily contrivance to maintain our activity and increase our resources   voluntary longevity  among other matters apparently changeable at will is the duration of individual life weismann a very clever and suggestive biologist who was unhappily reduced to idiocy by neodarwinism pointed out that death is not an eternal condition of life but an expedient introduced to provide for continual renewal without overcrowding now circumstantial selection does not account for natural death it accounts only for the survival of species in which the individuals have sense enough to decay and die on purpose but the individuals do not seem to have calculated very reasonably nobody can explain why a parrot should live ten times as long as a dog and a turtle be almost immortal in the case of man the operation has overshot its mark men do not live long enough they are for all the purposes of high civilization mere children when they die and our prime ministers though rated as mature divide their time between the golf course and the treasury bench in parliament presumably however the same power that made this mistake can remedy it if on opportunist grounds man now fixes the term of his life at three score and ten years he can equally fix it at three hundred or three thousand or even at the genuine circumstantial selection limit which would be until a soonerorlaterinevitable fatal accident makes an end of the individual all that is necessary to make him extend his present span is that tremendous catastrophes such as the late war shall convince him of the necessity of at least outliving his taste for golf and cigars if the race is to be saved this is not fantastic speculation it is deductive biology if there is such a science as biology here then is a stone that we have left unturned and that may be worth turning to make the suggestion more entertaining than it would be to most people in the form of a biological treatise i have written back to methuselah as a contribution to the modern bible  many people however can read treatises and cannot read bibles darwin could not read shakespear some who can read both like to learn the history of their ideas some are so entangled in the current confusion of creative evolution with circumstantial selection by their historical ignorance that they are puzzled by any distinction between the two for all their sakes i must give here a little history of the conflict between the view of evolution taken by the darwinians though not altogether by darwin himself and called natural selection and that which is emerging under the title of creative evolution as the genuinely scientific religion for which all wise men are now anxiously looking   the early evolutionists  the idea of evolution or transformation as it is now sometimes called was not first conceived by charles darwin nor by alfred russel wallace who observed the operation of circumstantial selection simultaneously with charles the celebrated buffoon was a better evolutionist than either of them and two thousand years before buffon was born the greek philosopher empedocles opined that all forms of life are transformations of four elements fire air earth and water effected by the two innate forces of attraction and repulsion or love and hate as lately as 1860 i myself was taught as a child that everything was made out of these four elements both the empedocleans and the evolutionists were opposed to those who believed in the separate creation of all forms of life as described in the book of genesis this conflict between religion and science as the phrase went then did not perplex my infant mind in the least i knew perfectly well without knowing that i knew it that the validity of a story is not the same as the occurrence of a fact but as i grew up i found that i had to choose between evolution and genesis if you believed that dogs and cats and snakes and birds and beetles and oysters and whales and men and women were all separately designed and made and named in eden garden at the beginning of things and have since survived simply by reproducing their kind then you were not an evolutionist if you believed on the contrary that all the different species are modifications variations and elaborations of one primal stock or even of a few primal stocks then you were an evolutionist but you were not necessarily a darwinian for you might have been a modern evolutionist twenty years before charles darwin was born and a whole lifetime before he published his origin of species for that matter when aristotle grouped animals with backbones as blood relations he began the sort of classification which when extended by darwin to monkeys and men so shocked my uncle  genesis had held the field until the time 17071778 of linnaeus the famous botanist in the meantime the microscope had been invented it revealed a new world of hitherto invisible creatures called infusorians as common water was found to be an infusion of them in the eighteenth century naturalists were very keen on the infusorian amoebas and were much struck by the way in which the members of this old family behaved and developed but it was still possible for linnaeus to begin a treatise by saying there are just so many species as there were forms created in the beginning though there were hundreds of commonplace scotch gardeners pigeon fanciers and stock breeders then living who knew better linnaeus himself knew better before he died in the last edition of his system of nature he began to wonder whether the transmutation of species by variation might not be possible then came the great poet who jumped over the facts to the conclusion goethe said that all the shapes of creation were cousins that there must be some common stock from which all the species had sprung that it was the environment of air that had produced the eagle of water the seal and of earth the mole he could not say how this happened but he divined that it did happen erasmus darwin the grandfather of charles carried the environment theory much further pointing out instance after instance of modifications made in species apparently to adapt it to circumstances and environment for instance that the brilliant colors of the leopard which make it so conspicuous in regents park conceal it in a tropical jungle finally he wrote as his declaration of faith the world has been evolved not created it has arisen little by little from a small beginning and has increased through the activity of the elemental forces embodied in itself and so has rather grown than come into being at an almighty word what a sublime idea of the infinite might of the great architect the cause of all causes the father of all fathers the ens entium for if we would compare the infinite it would surely require a greater infinite to cause the causes of effects than to produce the effects themselves in this published in the year 1794 you have nineteenthcentury evolution precisely defined and erasmus darwin was by no means its only apostle it was in the air then a german biologist named treviranus whose book was published in 1802 wrote in every living being there exists a capacity for endless diversity of form each possesses the power of adapting its organization to the variations of the external world and it is this power called into activity by cosmic changes which has enabled the simple zoophytes of the primitive world to climb to higher and higher stages of organization and has brought endless variety into nature there you have your evolution of man from the amoeba all complete whilst nelson was still alive on the seas and in 1809 before the battle of waterloo a french soldier named lamarck who had beaten his musket into a microscope and turned zoologist declared that species were an illusion produced by the shortness of our individual lives and that they were constantly changing and melting into one another and into new forms as surely as the hand of a clock is continually moving though it moves so slowly that it looks stationary to us we have since come to think that its industry is less continuous that the clock stops for a long time and then is suddenly put on by a mysterious finger but never mind that just at present   the advent of the neolamarckians  i call your special attention to lamarck because later on there were neolamarckians as well as neodarwinians i was a neolamarckian lamarck passed on from the conception of evolution as a general law to charles darwins department of it which was the method of evolution lamarck whilst making many ingenious suggestions as to the reaction of external causes on life and habit such as changes of climate food supply geological upheavals and so forth really held as his fundamental proposition that living organisms changed because they wanted to as he stated it the great factor in evolution is use and disuse if you have no eyes and want to see and keep trying to see you will finally get eyes if like a mole or a subterranean fish you have eyes and dont want to see you will lose your eyes if you like eating the tender tops of trees enough to make you concentrate all your energies on the stretching of your neck you will finally get a long neck like the giraffe this seems absurd to inconsiderate people at the first blush but it is within the personal experience of all of us that it is just by this process that a child tumbling about the floor becomes a boy walking erect and that a man sprawling on the road with a bruised chin or supine on the ice with a bashed occiput becomes a bicyclist and a skater the process is not continuous as it would be if mere practice had anything to do with it for though you may improve at each bicycling lesson during the lesson when you begin your next lesson you do not begin at the point at which you left off you relapse apparently to the beginning finally you succeed quite suddenly and do not relapse again more miraculous still you at once exercise the new power unconsciously although you are adapting your front wheel to your balance so elaborately and actively that the accidental locking of your handle bars for a second will throw you off though five minutes before you could not do it at all yet now you do it as unconsciously as you grow your finger nails you have a new faculty and must have created some new bodily tissue as its organ and you have done it solely by willing for here there can be no question of circumstantial selection or the survival of the fittest the man who is learning how to ride a bicycle has no advantage over the noncyclist in the struggle for existence quite the contrary he has acquired a new habit an automatic unconscious habit solely because he wanted to and kept trying until it was added unto him   how acquirements are inherited  but when your son tries to skate or bicycle in his turn he does not pick up the accomplishment where you left it any more than he is born six feet high with a beard and a tall hat the setback that occurred between your lessons occurs again the race learns exactly as the individual learns your son relapses not to the very beginning but to a point which no mortal method of measurement can distinguish from the beginning now this is odd for certain other habits of yours equally acquired to the evolutionist of course all habits are acquired equally unconscious equally automatic are transmitted without any perceptible relapse for instance the very first act of your son when he enters the world as a separate individual is to yell with indignation that yell which shakespear thought the most tragic and piteous of all sounds in the act of yelling he begins to breathe another habit and not even a necessary one as the object of breathing can be achieved in other ways as by deep sea fishes he circulates his blood by pumping it with his heart he demands a meal and proceeds at once to perform the most elaborate chemical operations on the food he swallows he manufactures teeth discards them and replaces them with fresh ones compared to these habitual feats walking standing upright and bicycling are the merest trifles yet it is only by going through the wanting trying process that he can stand walk or cycle whereas in the other and far more difficult and complex habits he not only does not consciously want nor consciously try but actually consciously objects very strongly take that early habit of cutting the teeth would he do that if he could help it take that later habit of decaying and eliminating himself by deathequally an acquired habit rememberhow he abhors it yet the habit has become so rooted so automatic that he must do it in spite of himself even to his own destruction  we have here a routine which given time enough for it to operate will finally produce the most elaborate forms of organized life on lamarckian lines without the intervention of circumstantial selection at all if you can turn a pedestrian into a cyclist and a cyclist into a pianist or violinist without the intervention of circumstantial selection you can turn an amoeba into a man or a man into a superman without it all of which is rank heresy to the neodarwinian who imagines that if you stop circumstantial selection you not only stop development but inaugurate a rapid and disastrous degeneration  let us fix the lamarckian evolutionary process well in our minds you are alive and you want to be more alive you want an extension of consciousness and of power you want consequently additional organs or additional uses of your existing organs that is additional habits you get them because you want them badly enough to keep trying for them until they come nobody knows how nobody knows why all we know is that the thing actually takes place we relapse miserably from effort to effort until the old organ is modified or the new one created when suddenly the impossible becomes possible and the habit is formed the moment we form it we want to get rid of the consciousness of it so as to economize our consciousness for fresh conquests of life as all consciousness means preoccupation and obstruction if we had to think about breathing or digesting or circulating our blood we should have no attention to spare for anything else as we find to our cost when anything goes wrong with these operations we want to be unconscious of them just as we wanted to acquire them and we finally win what we want but we win unconsciousness of our habits at the cost of losing our control of them and we also build one habit and its corresponding functional modification of our organs on another and so become dependent on our old habits consequently we have to persist in them even when they hurt us we cannot stop breathing to avoid an attack of asthma or to escape drowning we can lose a habit and discard an organ when we no longer need them just as we acquired them but this process is slow and broken by relapses and relics of the organ and the habit long survive its utility and if other and still indispensable habits and modifications have been built on the ones we wish to discard we must provide a new foundation for them before we demolish the old one this is also a slow process and a very curious one   the miracle of condensed recapitulation  the relapses between the efforts to acquire a habit are important because as we have seen they recur not only from effort to effort in the case of the individual but from generation to generation in the case of the race this relapsing from generation to generation is an invariable characteristic of the evolutionary process for instance raphael though descended from eight uninterrupted generations of painters had to learn to paint apparently as if no sanzio had ever handled a brush before but he had also to learn to breathe and digest and circulate his blood although his father and mother were fully grown adults when he was conceived he was not conceived or even born fully grown he had to go back and begin as a speck of protoplasm and to struggle through an embryonic lifetime during part of which he was indistinguishable from an embryonic dog and had neither a skull nor a backbone when he at last acquired these articles he was for some time doubtful whether he was a bird or a fish he had to compress untold centuries of development into nine months before he was human enough to break loose as an independent being and even then he was still so incomplete that his parents might well have exclaimed good heavens have you learnt nothing from our experience that you come into the world in this ridiculously elementary state why cant you talk and walk and paint and behave decently to that question baby raphael had no answer all he could have said was that this is how evolution or transformation happens the time may come when the same force that compressed the development of millions of years into nine months may pack many more millions into even a shorter space so that raphaels may be born painters as they are now born breathers and blood circulators but they will still begin as specks of protoplasm and acquire the faculty of painting in their mothers womb at quite a late stage of their embryonic life they must recapitulate the history of mankind in their own persons however briefly they may condense it  nothing was so astonishing and significant in the discoveries of the embryologists nor anything so absurdly little appreciated as this recapitulation as it is now called this power of hurrying up into months a process which was once so long and tedious that the mere contemplation of it is unendurable by men whose span of life is threescoreandten it widened human possibilities to the extent of enabling us to hope that the most prolonged and difficult operation of our minds may yet become instantaneous or as we call it instinctive it also directed our attention to examples of this packing up of centuries into seconds which were staring us in the face in all directions as i write these lines the newspapers are occupied by the exploits of a child of eight who has just defeated twenty adult chess players in twenty games played simultaneously and has been able afterwards to reconstruct all the twenty games without any apparent effort of memory most people including myself play chess when they play it at all from hand to mouth and can hardly recall the last move but one or foresee the next but two also when i have to make an arithmetical calculation i have to do it step by step with pencil and paper slowly reluctantly and with so little confidence in the result that i dare not act on it without proving the sum by a further calculation involving more ciphering but there are men who can neither read write nor cipher to whom the answer to such sums as i can do is instantly obvious without any conscious calculation at all and the result is infallible yet some of these natural arithmeticians have but a small vocabulary are at a loss when they have to find words for any but the simplest everyday occasions and cannot for the life of them describe mechanical operations which they perform daily in the course of their trade whereas to me the whole vocabulary of english literature from shakespear to the latest edition of the encyclopaedia britannica is so completely and instantaneously at my call that i have never had to consult even a thesaurus except once or twice when for some reason i wanted a third or fourth synonym again though i have tried and failed to draw recognizable portraits of persons i have seen every day for years mr bernard partridge having seen a man once will without more strain than is involved in eating a sandwich draw him to the life the keyboard of a piano is a device i have never been able to master yet mr cyril scott uses it exactly as i use my own fingers and to sir edward elgar an orchestral score is as instantaneously intelligible at sight as a page of shakespear is to me one man cannot after trying for years finger the flute fluently another will take up a flute with a newly invented arrangement of keys on it and play it at once with hardly a mistake we find people to whom writing is so difficult that they prefer to sign their name with a mark and beside them men who master systems of shorthand and improvise new systems of their own as easily as they learnt the alphabet these contrasts are to be seen on all hands and have nothing to do with variations in general intelligence nor even in the specialized intelligence proper to the faculty in question for example no composer or dramatic poet has ever pretended to be able to perform all the parts he writes for the singers actors and players who are his executants one might as well expect napoleon to be a fencer or the astronomer royal to know how many beans make five any better than his bookkeeper even exceptional command of language does not imply the possession of ideas to express mezzofanti the master of fiftyeight languages had less to say in them than shakespear with his little latin and less greek and public life is the paradise of voluble windbags  all these examples which might be multiplied by millions are cases in which a long laborious conscious detailed process of acquirement has been condensed into an instinctive and unconscious inborn one factors which formerly had to be considered one by one in succession are integrated into what seems a single simple factor chains of hardly soluble problems have coalesced in one problem which solves itself the moment it is raised what is more they have been pushed back or forward if you like from postnatal to prenatal ones the child in the womb may take some time over them but it is a miraculously shortened time  the time phenomena involved are curious and suggest that we are either wrong about our history or else that we enormously exaggerate the periods required for the prenatal acquirement of habits in the nineteenth century we talked very glibly about geological periods and flung millions of eons about in the most lordly manner in our reaction against archbishop usshers chronology we had a craze for big figures and positively liked to believe that the progress made by the child in the womb in a month was represented in prehistoric time by ages and ages we insisted that evolution advanced more slowly than any snail ever crawled and that nature does not proceed by leaps and bounds this was all very well as long as we were dealing with such acquired habits as breathing or digestion it was possible to believe that dozens of epochs had gone to the slow building up of these habits but when we have to consider the case of a man born not only as an accomplished metabolist but with such an aptitude for shorthand and keyboard manipulation that he is a stenographer or pianist at least five sixths readymade as soon as he can control his hands intelligently we are forced to suspect either that keyboards and shorthand are older inventions than we suppose or else that acquirements can be assimilated and stored as congenital qualifications in a shorter time than we think so that as between lyell and archbishop ussher the laugh may not be with lyell quite so uproariously as it seemed fifty years ago   heredity an old story  it is evident that the evolutionary process is a hereditary one or to put it less drily that human life is continuous and immortal the evolutionists took heredity for granted so did everybody the human mind has been soaked in heredity as long back as we can trace its thought hereditary peers hereditary monarchs hereditary castes and trades and classes were the best known of social institutions and in some cases of public nuisances pedigree men counted pedigree dogs and pedigree horses among their most cherished possessions far from being unconscious of heredity or sceptical men were insanely credulous about it they not only believed in the transmission of qualities and habits from generation to generation but expected the son to begin mentally where the father left off  this belief in heredity led naturally to the practice of intentional selection good blood and breeding were eagerly sought after in human marriage in dealing with plants and animals selection with a view to the production of new varieties and the improvement and modification of species had been practised ever since men began to cultivate them my predarwinian uncle knew as well as darwin that the racehorse and the drayhorse are not separate creations from the garden of eden but adaptations by deliberate human selection of the medieval warhorse to modern racing and industrial haulage he knew that there are nearly two hundred different sorts of dogs all capable of breeding with one another and of producing cross varieties unknown to adam he knew that the same thing is true of pigeons he knew that gardeners had spent their lives trying to breed black tulips and green carnations and unheardof orchids and had actually produced flowers just as strange to eve his quarrel with the evolutionists was not a quarrel with the evidence for evolution he had accepted enough of it to prove evolution ten times over before he ever heard of it what he repudiated was cousinship with the ape and the implied suspicion of a rudimentary tail because it was offensive to his sense of his own dignity and because he thought that apes were ridiculous and tails diabolical when associated with the erect posture also he believed that evolution was a heresy which involved the destruction of christianity of which as a member of the irish church the pseudoprotestant one he conceived himself a pillar but this was only his ignorance for man may deny his descent from an ape and be eligible as a churchwarden without being any the less a convinced evolutionist   discovery anticipated by divination  what is more the religious folk can claim to be among the pioneers of evolutionism weismann neodarwinist though he was devoted a long passage in his history of evolution to the nature philosophy of lorenz oken published in 1809 oken defined natural science as the science of the everlasting transmutations of the holy ghost in the world his religion had started him on the right track and not only led him to think out a whole scheme of evolution in abstract terms but guided his aim in a significantly good scientific shot which brought him within the scope of weismann he not only defined the original substance from which all forms of life have developed as protoplasm or as he called it primitive slime urschleim but actually declared that this slime took the form of vesicles out of which the universe was built here was the modern cell morphology guessed by a religious thinker long before the microscope and the scalpel forced it on the vision of mere laboratory workers who could not think and had no religion they worked hard to discover the vital secrets of the glands by opening up dogs and cutting out the glands or tying up their ducts or severing their nerves thereby learning negatively that the governors of our vital forces do not hold their incessant conversations through the nerves and positively how miserably a horribly injured dog can die leaving us to infer that we shall probably perish likewise if we grudge our guineas to harley street lorenz oken thought very hard to find out what was happening to the holy ghost and thereby made a contribution of extraordinary importance to our understanding of uninjured creatures the man who was scientific enough to see that the holy ghost is a scientific fact got easily in front of the blockheads who could only sin against it hence my uncle was turning his back on very respectable company when he derided evolution and would probably have recanted and apologized at once had anybody pointed out to him what a solecism he was committing  the metaphysical side of evolution was thus no novelty when darwin arrived had oken never lived there would still have been millions of persons trained from their childhood to believe that we are continually urged upwards by a force called the will of god in 1819 schopenhauer published his treatise on the world as will which is the metaphysical complement to lamarcks natural history as it demonstrates that the driving force behind evolution is a willtolive and to live as christ said long before more abundantly and the earlier philosophers from plato to leibniz had kept the human mind open for the thought of the universe as one idea behind all its physically apprehensible transformations   corrected dates for the discovery of evolution  all this remember is the state of things in the predarwin period which so many of us still think of as a preevolutionary period evolutionism was the rage before queen victoria came to the throne to fix this chronology let me repeat the story told by weismann of the july revolution in paris in 1830 when the french got rid of charles the tenth goethe was then still living and a french friend of his called on him and found him wildly excited what do you think of the great event said goethe the volcano is in eruption and all is in flames there can no longer be discussion with closed doors the frenchman replied that no doubt it was a terrible business but what could they expect with such a ministry and such a king stuff said goethe i am not thinking of these people at all but of the open rupture in the french academy between cuvier and st hilaire it is of the utmost importance to science the rupture goethe meant was about evolution cuvier contending that there were four species and st hilaire that there was only one  from 1830 when darwin was an apparently unpromising lad of twentyone until 1859 when he turned the world upside down by his origin of species there was a slump in evolutionism the first generation of its enthusiasts was ageing and dying out and their successors were being taught from the book of genesis just as edward vi was and edward vii too for that matter nobody who knew the theory was adding anything to it this slump not only heightened the impression of entire novelty when darwin brought the subject to the front again it probably prevented him from realizing how much had been done before even by his own grandfather to whom he was accused of being unjust besides he was not really carrying on the family business he was an entirely original worker and he was on a new tack as we shall see presently and he would not in any case have thought much as a practical naturalist of the more or less mystical intellectual speculations of the deists of 17901830 scientific workers were very tired of deism just then they had given up the riddle of the great first cause as insoluble and were calling themselves accordingly agnostics they had turned from the inscrutable question of why things existed to the spade work of discovering what was really occurring in the world and how it really occurred  with all his attention bent in this new direction darwin soon noticed that a good deal was occurring in an entirely unmystical and even unmeaning way of which the older speculative deistevolutionists had taken little or no account nowadays when we are turning in weary disgust and disillusion from neodarwinism and mechanism to vitalism and creative evolution it is difficult to imagine how this new departure of darwins could possibly have appealed to his contemporaries as exciting agreeable above all as hopeful let me therefore try to bring back something of the atmosphere of that time by describing a scene very characteristic of its superstitions in which i took what was then considered an unspeakably shocking part   defying the lightning a frustrated experiment  one evening in 1878 or thereabouts i being then in my earliest twenties was at a bachelor party of young men of the professional class in the house of a doctor in the kensingtonian quarter of london they fell to talking about religious revivals and an anecdote was related of a man who having incautiously scoffed at the mission of messrs moody and sankey a then famous firm of american evangelists was subsequently carried home on a shutter slain by divine vengeance as a blasphemer a timid minority without quite venturing to question the truth of the incidentfor they naturally did not care to run the risk of going home on shutters themselvesnevertheless shewed a certain disposition to cavil at those who exulted in it and something approaching to an argument began at last it was alleged by the most evangelical of the disputants that charles bradlaugh the most formidable atheist on the secularist platform had taken out his watch publicly and challenged the almighty to strike him dead in five minutes if he really existed and disapproved of atheism the leader of the cavillers with great heat repudiated this as a gross calumny declaring that bradlaugh had repeatedly and indignantly contradicted it and implying that the atheist champion was far too pious a man to commit such a blasphemy this exquisite confusion of ideas roused my sense of comedy it was clear to me that the challenge attributed to charles bradlaugh was a scientific experiment of a quite simple straightforward and proper kind to ascertain whether the expression of atheistic opinions really did involve any personal risk it was certainly the method taught in the bible elijah having confuted the prophets of baal in precisely that way with every circumstance of bitter mockery of their god when he failed to send down fire from heaven accordingly i said that if the question at issue were whether the penalty of questioning the theology of messrs moody and sankey was to be struck dead on the spot by an incensed deity nothing could effect a more convincing settlement of it than the very obvious experiment attributed to mr bradlaugh and that consequently if he had not tried it he ought to have tried it the omission i added was one which could easily be remedied there and then as i happened to share mr bradlaughs views as to the absurdity of the belief in these violent interferences with the order of nature by a shorttempered and thinskinned supernatural deity thereforeand at that point i took out my watch  the effect was electrical neither sceptics nor devotees were prepared to abide the result of the experiment in vain did i urge the pious to trust in the accuracy of their deitys aim with a thunderbolt and the justice of his discrimination between the innocent and the guilty in vain did i appeal to the sceptics to accept the logical outcome of their scepticism it soon appeared that when thunderbolts were in question there were no sceptics our host seeing that his guests would vanish precipitately if the impious challenge were uttered leaving him alone with a solitary infidel under sentence of extermination in five minutes interposed and forbade the experiment pleading at the same time for a change of subject i of course complied but could not refrain from remarking that though the dreadful words had not been uttered yet as the thought had been formulated in my mind it was very doubtful whether the consequences could be averted by sealing my lips however the rest appeared to feel that the game would be played according to the rules and that it mattered very little what i thought so long as i said nothing only the leader of the evangelical party i thought was a little preoccupied until five minutes had elapsed and the weather was still calm   in quest of the first cause  another reminiscence in those days we thought in terms of time and space of cause and effect as we still do but we do not now demand from a religion that it shall explain the universe completely in terms of cause and effect and present the world to us as a manufactured article and as the private property of its manufacturer we did then we were invited to pity the delusion of certain heathens who held that the world is supported by an elephant who is supported by a tortoise mahomet decided that the mountains are great weights to keep the world from being blown away into space but we refuted these orientals by asking triumphantly what the tortoise stands on freethinkers asked which came first the owl or the egg nobody thought of saying that the ultimate problem of existence being clearly insoluble and even unthinkable on causation lines could not be a causation problem to pious people this would have been flat atheism because they assumed that god must be a cause and sometimes called him the great first cause or in still choicer language the primal cause to the rationalists it would have been a renunciation of reason here and there a man would confess that he stood as with a dim lantern in a dense fog and could see but a little way in any direction into infinity but he did not really believe that infinity was infinite or that the eternal was also sempiternal he assumed that all things known and unknown were caused  hence it was that i found myself one day towards the end of the eighteenseventies in a cell in the old brompton oratory arguing with father addis who had been called by one of his flock to attempt my conversion to roman catholicism the universe exists said the father somebody must have made it if that somebody exists said i somebody must have made him i grant that for the sake of argument said the oratorian i grant you a maker of god i grant you a maker of the maker of god i grant you as long a line of makers as you please but an infinity of makers is unthinkable and extravagant it is no harder to believe in number one than in number fifty thousand or fifty million so why not accept number one and stop there since no attempt to get behind him will remove your logical difficulty by your leave said i it is as easy for me to believe that the universe made itself as that a maker of the universe made himself in fact much easier for the universe visibly exists and makes itself as it goes along whereas a maker for it is a hypothesis of course we could get no further on these lines he rose and said that we were like two men working a saw he pushing it forward and i pushing it back and cutting nothing but when we had dropped the subject and were walking through the refectory he returned to it for a moment to say that he should go mad if he lost his belief i glorying in the robust callousness of youth and the comedic spirit felt quite comfortable and said so though i was touched too by his evident sincerity  these two anecdotes are superficially trivial and even comic but there is an abyss of horror beneath them they reveal a condition so utterly irreligious that religion means nothing but belief in a nursery bogey and its inadequacy is demonstrated by a toy logical dilemma neither the bogey nor the dilemma having anything to do with religion or being serious enough to impose on or confuse any properly educated child over the age of six one hardly knows which is the more appalling the abjectness of the credulity or the flippancy of the scepticism the result was inevitable all who were strongminded enough not to be terrified by the bogey were left stranded in empty contemptuous negation and argued when they argued at all as i argued with father addis but their position was not intellectually comfortable a member of parliament expressed their discomfort when objecting to the admission of charles bradlaugh into parliament he said hang it all a man should believe in something or somebody it was easy to throw the bogey into the dustbin but none the less the world our corner of the universe did not look like a pure accident it presented evidences of design in every direction there was mind and purpose behind it as the antibradlaugh member would have put it there must be somebody behind the something no atheist could get over that   paleys watch  paley had put the argument in an apparently unanswerable form if you found a watch full of mechanism exquisitely adapted to produce a series of operations all leading to the fulfilment of one central purpose of measuring for mankind the march of the day and night could you believe that it was not the work of a cunning artificer who had designed and contrived it all to that end and here was a far more wonderful thing than a watch a man with all his organs ingeniously contrived cords and levers girders and kingposts circulating systems of pipes and valves dialysing membranes chemical retorts carburettors ventilators inlets and outlets telephone transmitters in his ears light recorders and lenses in his eye was it conceivable that this was the work of chance that no artificer had wrought here that there was no purpose in this no design no guiding intelligence the thing was incredible in vain did helmholtz declare that the eye has every possible defect that can be found in an optical instrument and even some peculiar to itself and that if an optician tried to sell me an instrument which had all these defects i should think myself quite justified in blaming his carelessness in the strongest terms and sending him back his instrument to discredit the opticians skill was not to get rid of the optician the eye might not be so cleverly made as paley thought but it was made somehow by somebody  and then my argument with father addis began all over again it was easy enough to say that every man makes his own eyes indeed the embryologists had actually caught him doing it but what about the very evident purpose that prompted him to do it why did he want to see if not to extend his consciousness and his knowledge and his power that purpose was at work everywhere and must be something bigger than the individual eyemaking man only the stupidest muckrakers could fail to see this and even to know it as part of their own consciousness yet to admit it seemed to involve letting the bogey come back so inextricably had we managed to mix up belief in the bogeys existence with belief in the existence of design in the universe   the irresistible cry of order order  our scornful young scientific and philosophic lions of today must not blame the church of england for this confusion of thought in 1562 the church in convocation in london for the avoiding of diversities of opinions and for the establishment of consent touching true religion proclaimed in their first utterance and as an article of religion that god is without body parts or passions or as we say an elan vital or life force unfortunately neither parents parsons nor pedagogues could be induced to adopt that article st john might say that god is spirit as pointedly as he pleased our sovereign lady elizabeth might ratify the article again and again serious divines might feel as deeply as they could that a god with body parts and passions could be nothing but an anthropomorphic idol no matter people at large could not conceive a god who was not anthropomorphic they stood by the old testament legends of a god whose parts had been seen by one of the patriarchs and finally set up as against the church a god who far from being without body parts or passions was composed of nothing else and of very evil passions too they imposed this idol in practice on the church itself in spite of the first article and thereby homeopathically produced the atheist whose denial of god was simply a denial of the idol and a demonstration against an unbearable and most unchristian idolatry the idol was as shelley had been expelled from oxford for pointing out an almighty fiend with a petty character and unlimited power spiteful cruel jealous vindictive and physically violent the most villainous schoolmasters the most tyrannical parents fell far short in their attempts to imitate it but it was not its social vices that brought it low what made it scientifically intolerable was that it was ready at a moments notice to upset the whole order of the universe on the most trumpery provocation whether by stopping the sun in the valley of ajalon or sending an atheist home dead on a shutter the shutter was indispensable because it marked the utter unpreparedness of the atheist who unable to save himself by a deathbed repentance was subsequently roasted through all eternity in blazing brimstone it was this disorderliness this refusal to obey its own laws of nature that created a scientific need for its destruction science could stand a cruel and unjust god for nature was full of suffering and injustice but a disorderly god was impossible in the middle ages a compromise had been made by which two different orders of truth religious and scientific had been recognized in order that a schoolman might say that two and two make four without being burnt for heresy but the nineteenth century steeped in a meddling presumptuous readingandwriting socially and politically powerful ignorance inconceivable by thomas aquinas or even roger bacon was incapable of so convenient an arrangement and science was strangled by bigoted ignoramuses claiming infallibility for their interpretation of the bible which was regarded not as a literature nor even as a book but partly as an oracle which answered and settled all questions and partly as a talisman to be carried by soldiers in their breast pockets or placed under the pillows of persons who were afraid of ghosts the tract shops exhibited in their windows bulletdinted testaments mothers gifts to their soldier sons whose lives had been saved by it for the muzzleloaders of those days could not drive a projectile through so many pages   the moment and the man  this superstition of a continual capricious disorder in nature of a lawgiver who was also a lawbreaker made atheists in all directions among clever and lightminded people but atheism did not account for paleys watch atheism accounted for nothing and it was the business of science to account for everything that was plainly accountable science had no use for mere negation what was desired by it above all things just then was a demonstration that the evidences of design could be explained without resort to the hypothesis of a personal designer if only some genius whilst admitting paleys facts could knock the brains out of paley by the discovery of a method whereby watches could happen without watchmakers that genius was assured of such a welcome from the thought of his day as no natural philosopher had ever enjoyed before  the time being thus ripe the genius appeared and his name was charles darwin and now what did darwin really discover  here i am afraid i shall require once more the assistance of the giraffe or as he was called in the days of the celebrated buffoon the camelopard by children cammyleopard i do not remember how this animal imposed himself illustratively on the evolution controversy but there was no getting away from him then and i am oldfashioned enough to be unable to get away from him now how did he come by his long neck lamarck would have said by wanting to get at the tender leaves high up on the tree and trying until he succeeded in wishing the necessary length of neck into existence another answer was also possible namely that some prehistoric stockbreeder wishing to produce a natural curiosity selected the longestnecked animals he could find and bred from them until at last an animal with an abnormally long neck was evolved by intentional selection just as the racehorse or the fantail pigeon has been evolved both these explanations you will observe involve consciousness will design purpose either on the part of the animal itself or on the part of a superior intelligence controlling its destiny darwin pointed outand this and no more was darwins famous discoverythat a third explanation involving neither will nor purpose nor design either in the animal or anyone else was on the cards if your neck is too short to reach your food you die that may be the simple explanation of the fact that all the surviving animals that feed on foliage have necks or trunks long enough to reach it so bang goes your belief that the necks must have been designed to reach the food but lamarck did not believe that the necks were so designed in the beginning he believed that the long necks were evolved by wanting and trying not necessarily said darwin consider the effect on the giraffes of the natural multiplication of their numbers as insisted on by malthus suppose the average height of the foliageeating animals is four feet and that they increase in numbers until a time comes when all the trees are eaten away to within four feet of the ground then the animals who happen to be an inch or two short of the average will die of starvation all the animals who happen to be an inch or so above the average will be better fed and stronger than the others they will secure the strongest and tallest mates and their progeny will survive whilst the average ones and the subaverage ones will die out this process by which the species gains say an inch in reach will repeat itself until the giraffes neck is so long that he can always find food enough within his reach at which point of course the selective process stops and the length of the giraffes neck stops with it otherwise he would grow until he could browse off the trees in the moon and this mark you without the intervention of any stockbreeder human or divine and without will purpose design or even consciousness beyond the blind will to satisfy hunger it is true that this blind will being in effect a will to live gives away the whole case but still as compared to the openeyed intelligent wanting and trying of lamarck the darwinian process may be described as a chapter of accidents as such it seems simple because you do not at first realize all that it involves but when its whole significance dawns on you your heart sinks into a heap of sand within you there is a hideous fatalism about it a ghastly and damnable reduction of beauty and intelligence of strength and purpose of honor and aspiration to such casually picturesque changes as an avalanche may make in a mountain landscape or a railway accident in a human figure to call this natural selection is a blasphemy possible to many for whom nature is nothing but a casual aggregation of inert and dead matter but eternally impossible to the spirits and souls of the righteous if it be no blasphemy but a truth of science then the stars of heaven the showers and dew the winter and summer the fire and heat the mountains and hills may no longer be called to exalt the lord with us by praise their work is to modify all things by blindly starving and murdering everything that is not lucky enough to survive in the universal struggle for hogwash   the brink of the bottomless pit  thus did the neck of the giraffe reach out across the whole heavens and make men believe that what they saw there was a gloaming of the gods for if this sort of selection could turn an antelope into a giraffe it could conceivably turn a pond full of amoebas into the french academy though lamarcks way the way of life will aspiration and achievement remained still possible this newly shewn way of hunger death stupidity delusion chance and bare survival was also possible was indeed most certainly the way in which many apparently intelligently designed transformations had actually come to pass had i not preluded with the apparently idle story of my revival of the controversial methods of elijah i should be asked how it was that the explorer who opened up this gulf of despair far from being stoned or crucified as the destroyer of the honor of the race and the purpose of the world was hailed as deliverer savior prophet redeemer enlightener rescuer hope giver and epoch maker whilst poor lamarck was swept aside as a crude and exploded guesser hardly worthy to be named as his erroneous forerunner in the light of my anecdote the explanation is obvious the first thing the gulf did was to swallow up paley and the disorderly designer and shelleys almighty fiend and all the rest of the pseudoreligious rubbish that had blocked every upward and onward path since the hopes of men had turned to science as their true savior it seemed such a convenient grave that nobody at first noticed that it was nothing less than the bottomless pit now become a very real terror for though darwin left a path round it for his soul his followers presently dug it right across the whole width of the way yet for the moment there was nothing but wild rejoicing a sort of scientific mafficking we had been so oppressed by the notion that everything that happened in the world was the arbitrary personal act of an arbitrary personal god of dangerously jealous and cruel personal character so that even the relief of the pains of childbed and the operating table by chloroform was objected to as an interference with his arrangements which he would probably resent that we just jumped at darwin when napoleon was asked what would happen when he died he said that europe would express its intense relief with a great ouf well when darwin killed the god who objected to chloroform everybody who had ever thought about it said ouf paley was buried fathoms deep with his watch now fully accounted for without any divine artificer at all we were so glad to be rid of both that we never gave a thought to the consequences when a prisoner sees the door of his dungeon open he dashes for it without stopping to think where he shall get his dinner outside the moment we found that we could do without shelleys almighty fiend intellectually he went into the gulf that seemed only a dustbin with a suddenness that made our own lives one of the most astonishing periods in history if i had told that uncle of mine that within thirty years from the date of our conversation i should be exposing myself to suspicions of the grossest superstition by questioning the sufficiency of darwin maintaining the reality of the holy ghost declaring that the phenomenon of the word becoming flesh was occurring daily he would have regarded me as the most extravagant madman our family had ever produced yet it was so in 1906 i might have vituperated jehovah more heartily than ever shelley did without eliciting a protest in any circle of thinkers or shocking any public audience accustomed to modern discussion but when i described darwin as an intelligent and industrious pigeon fancier that blasphemous levity as it seemed was received with horror and indignation the tide has now turned and every puny whipster may say what he likes about darwin but anyone who wants to know what it was to be a lamarckian during the last quarter of the nineteenth century has only to read mr festing joness memoir of samuel butler to learn how completely even a man of genius could isolate himself by antagonizing darwin on the one hand and the church on the other   why darwin converted the crowd  i am well aware that in describing the effect of darwins discovery on naturalists and on persons capable of serious reflection on the nature and attributes of god i am leaving the vast mass of the british public out of account i have pointed out elsewhere that the british nation does not consist of atheists and plymouth brothers and i am not now going to pretend that it ever consisted of darwinians and lamarckians the average citizen is irreligious and unscientific you talk to him about cricket and golf market prices and party politics not about evolution and relativity transubstantiation and predestination nothing will knock into his head the fateful distinction between evolution as promulgated by erasmus darwin and circumstantial socalled natural selection as revealed by his grandson yet the doctrine of charles reached him though the doctrine of erasmus had passed over his head why did not erasmus darwin popularize the word evolution as effectively as charles  the reason was i think that circumstantial selection is easier to understand more visible and concrete than lamarckian evolution evolution as a philosophy and physiology of the will is a mystical process which can be apprehended only by a trained apt and comprehensive thinker though the phenomena of use and disuse of wanting and trying of the manufacture of weight lifters and wrestlers from men of ordinary strength are familiar enough as facts they are extremely puzzling as subjects of thought and lead you into metaphysics the moment you try to account for them but pigeon fanciers dog fanciers gardeners stock breeders or stud grooms can understand circumstantial selection because it is their business to produce transformation by imposing on flowers and animals a selection from without all that darwin had to say to them was that the mere chapter of accidents is always doing on a huge scale what they themselves are doing on a very small scale there is hardly a laborer attached to an english country house who has not taken a litter of kittens or puppies to the bucket and drowned all of them except the one he thinks the most promising such a man has nothing to learn about the survival of the fittest except that it acts in more ways than he has yet noticed for he knows quite well as you will find if you are not too proud to talk to him that this sort of selection occurs naturally in darwins sense too that for instance a hard winter will kill off a weakly child as the bucket kills off a weakly puppy then there is the farm laborer shakespears touchstone a courtbred fool was shocked to find in the shepherd a natural philosopher and opined that he would be damned for the part he took in the sexual selection of sheep as to the production of new species by the selection of variations that is no news to your gardener now if you are familiar with these three processes the survival of the fittest sexual selection and variation leading to new kinds there is nothing to puzzle you in darwinism  that was the secret of darwins popularity he never puzzled anybody if very few of us have read the origin of species from end to end it is not because it overtaxes our mind but because we take in the whole case and are prepared to accept it long before we have come to the end of the innumerable instances and illustrations of which the book mainly consists darwin becomes tedious in the manner of a man who insists on continuing to prove his innocence after he has been acquitted you assure him that there is not a stain on his character and beg him to leave the court but he will not be content with enough evidence he will have you listen to all the evidence that exists in the world darwins industry was enormous his patience his perseverance his conscientiousness reached the human limit but he never got deeper beneath or higher above his facts than an ordinary man could follow him he was not conscious of having raised a stupendous issue because though it arose instantly it was not his business he was conscious of having discovered a process of transformation and modification which accounted for a great deal of natural history but he did not put it forward as accounting for the whole of natural history he included it under the heading of evolution though it was only pseudoevolution at best but he revealed it as a method of evolution not as the method of evolution he did not pretend that it excluded other methods or that it was the chief method though he demonstrated that many transformations which had been taken as functional adaptations the current phrase for lamarckian evolution either certainly were or conceivably might be due to circumstantial selection he was careful not to claim that he had superseded lamarck or disproved functional adaptation in short he was not a darwinian but an honest naturalist working away at his job with so little preoccupation with theological speculation that he never quarrelled with the theistic unitarianism into which he was born and remained to the end the engagingly simple and socially easygoing soul he had been in his boyhood when his elders doubted whether he would ever be of much use in the world   how we rushed down a steep place  not so the rest of us intellectuals we all began going to the devil with the utmost cheerfulness everyone who had a mind to change changed it only samuel butler on whom darwin had acted homeopathically reacted against him furiously ran up the lamarckian flag to the topgallant peak declared with penetrating accuracy that darwin had banished mind from the universe and even attacked darwins personal character unable to bear the fact that the author of so abhorrent a doctrine was an amiable and upright man nobody would listen to him he was so completely submerged by the flowing tide of darwinism that when darwin wanted to clear up the misunderstanding on which butler was basing his personal attacks darwins friends very foolishly and snobbishly persuaded him that butler was too illconditioned and negligible to be answered that they could not recognize in butler a man of genius mattered little what did matter was that they could not understand the provocation under which he was raging they actually regarded the banishment of mind from the universe as a glorious enlightenment and emancipation for which he was ignorantly ungrateful even now when butlers eminence is unchallenged and his biographer mr festing jones is enjoying a vogue like that of boswell or lockhart his memoirs shew him rather as a shocking example of the bad controversial manners of our country parsonages than as a prophet who tried to head us back when we were gaily dancing to our damnation across the rainbow bridge which darwinism had thrown over the gulf which separates life and hope from death and despair we were intellectually intoxicated with the idea that the world could make itself without design purpose skill or intelligence in short without life we completely overlooked the difference between the modification of species by adaptation to their environment and the appearance of new species we just threw in the word variations or the word sports fancy a man of science talking of an unknown factor as a sport instead of as x and left them to accumulate and account for the difference between a cockatoo and a hippopotamus such phrases set us free to revel in demonstrating to the vitalists and bible worshippers that if we once admit the existence of any kind of force however unintelligent and stretch out the past to unlimited time for such force to operate accidentally in that force may conceivably by the action of circumstantial selection produce a world in which every function has an organ perfectly adapted to perform it and therefore presents every appearance of having been designed like paleys watch by a conscious and intelligent artificer for the purpose we took a perverse pleasure in arguing without the least suspicion that we were reducing ourselves to absurdity that all the books in the british museum library might have been written word for word as they stand on the shelves if no human being had ever been conscious just as the trees stand in the forest doing wonderful things without consciousness  and the darwinians went far beyond denying consciousness to trees weismann insisted that the chick breaks out of its eggshell automatically that the butterfly springing into the air to avoid the pounce of the lizard does not wish to avoid death knows nothing about death what has happened being simply that a flight instinct evolved by circumstantial selection reacts promptly to a visual impression produced by the lizards movement his proof is that the butterfly immediately settles again on the flower and repeats the performance every time the lizard springs thus shewing that it learns nothing from experience andweismann concludesis not conscious of what it does  it should hardly have escaped so curious an observer that when the cat jumps up on the dinner table and you put it down it instantly jumps up again and finally establishes its right to a place on the cloth by convincing you that if you put it down a hundred times it will jump up a hundred and one times so that if you desire its company at dinner you can have it only on its own terms if weismann really thought that cats act thus without any consciousness or any purpose immediate or ulterior he must have known very little about cats but a thoroughgoing weismannite if any such still survive from those mad days would contend that i am not at present necessarily conscious of what i am doing that my writing of these lines and your reading of them are effects of circumstantial selection that i heed know no more about darwinism than a butterfly knows of a lizards appetite and that the proof that i actually am doing it unconsciously is that as i have spent forty years in writing in this fashion without as far as i can see producing any visible effect on public opinion i must be incapable of learning from experience and am therefore a mere automaton and the weismannite demonstration of this would of course be an equally unconscious effect of circumstantial selection   darwinism not finally refutable  do not too hastily say that this is inconceivable to circumstantial selection all mechanical and chemical reactions are possible provided you accept the geologists estimates of the great age of the earth and therefore allow time enough for the circumstances to operate it is true that mere survival of the fittest in the struggle for existence plus sexual selection fail as hopelessly to account for darwins own life work as for my conquest of the bicycle but who can prove that there are not other soulless factors unnoticed or undiscovered which only require imagination enough to fit them to the evolution of an automatic jesus or shakespear when a man tells you that you are a product of circumstantial selection solely you cannot finally disprove it you can only tell him out of the depths of your inner conviction that he is a fool and a liar but as this though british is uncivil it is wiser to offer him the counterassurance that you are the product of lamarckian evolution formerly called functional adaptation and now creative evolution and challenge him to disprove that which he can no more do than you can disprove circumstantial selection both forces being conceivably able to produce anything if you only give them rope enough you may also defy him to act for a single hour on the assumption that he may safely cross oxford street in a state of unconsciousness trusting to his dodging reflexes to react automatically and promptly enough to the visual impression produced by a motor bus and the audible impression produced by its hooter but if you allow yourself to defy him to explain any particular action of yours by circumstantial selection he should always be able to find some explanation that will fit the case if only he is ingenious enough and goes far enough to find it darwin found several such explanations in his controversies anybody who really wants to believe that the universe has been produced by circumstantial selection cooperating with a force as inhuman as we conceive magnetism to be can find a logical excuse for his belief if he tries hard enough    three blind mice  the stultification and damnation which ensued are illustrated by a comparison of the ease and certainty with which butlers mind moved to humane and inspiring conclusions with the grotesque stupidities and cruelties of the idle and silly controversy which arose among the darwinians as to whether acquired habits can be transmitted from parents to offspring consider for example how weismann set to work on that subject an evolutionist with a live mind would first have dropped the popular expression acquired habits because to an evolutionist there are no other habits and can be no others a man being only an amoeba with acquirements he would then have considered carefully the process by which he himself had acquired his habits he would have assumed that the habits with which he was born must have been acquired by a similar process he would have known what a habit is that is an action voluntarily attempted until it has become more or less automatic and involuntary and it would never have occurred to him that injuries or accidents coming from external sources against the will of the victim could possibly establish a habit that for instance a family could acquire a habit of being killed in railway accidents  and yet weismann began to investigate the point by behaving like the butchers wife in the old catch he got a colony of mice and cut off their tails then he waited to see whether their children would be born without tails they were not as butler could have told him beforehand he then cut off the childrens tails and waited to see whether the grandchildren would be born with at least rather short tails they were not as i could have told him beforehand so with the patience and industry on which men of science pride themselves he cut off the grandchildrens tails too and waited full of hope for the birth of curtailed greatgrandchildren but their tails were quite up to the mark as any fool could have told him beforehand weismann then gravely drew the inference that acquired habits cannot be transmitted and yet weismann was not a born imbecile he was an exceptionally clever and studious man not without roots of imagination and philosophy in him which darwinism killed as weeds  how was it that he did not see that he was not experimenting with habits or characteristics at all how had he overlooked the glaring fact that his experiment had been tried for many generations in china on the feet of chinese women without producing the smallest tendency on their part to be born with abnormally small feet he must have known about the bound feet even if he knew nothing of the mutilations the clipped ears and docked tails practised by dog fanciers and horse breeders on many generations of the unfortunate animals they deal in such amazing blindness and stupidity on the part of a man who was naturally neither blind nor stupid is a telling illustration of what darwin unintentionally did to the minds of his disciples by turning their attention so exclusively towards the part played in evolution by accident and violence operating with entire callousness to suffering and sentiment  a vital conception of evolution would have taught weismann that biological problems are not to be solved by assaults on mice the scientific form of his experiment would have been something like this first he should have procured a colony of mice highly susceptible to hypnotic suggestion he should then have hypnotized them into an urgent conviction that the fate of the musque world depended on the disappearance of its tail just as some ancient and forgotten experimenter seems to have convinced the cats of the isle of man having thus made the mice desire to lose their tails with a lifeordeath intensity he would very soon have seen a few mice born with little or no tail these would be recognized by the other mice as superior beings and privileged in the division of food and in sexual selection ultimately the tailed mice would be put to death as monsters by their fellows and the miracle of the tailless mouse completely achieved  the objection to this experiment is not that it seems too funny to be taken seriously and is not cruel enough to overawe the mob but simply that it is impossible because the human experimenter cannot get at the mouses mind and that is what is wrong with all the barren cruelties of the laboratories darwins followers did not think of this their only idea of investigation was to imitate nature by perpetrating violent and senseless cruelties and watch the effect of them with a paralyzing fatalism which forbade the smallest effort to use their minds instead of their knives and eyes and established an abominable tradition that the man who hesitates to be as cruel as circumstantial selection itself is a traitor to science for weismanns experiment upon the mice was a mere joke compared to the atrocities committed by other darwinians in their attempts to prove that mutilations could not be transmitted no doubt the worst of these experiments were not really experiments at all but cruelties committed by cruel men who were attracted to the laboratory by the fact that it was a secret refuge left by law and public superstition for the amateur of passionate torture but there is no reason to suspect weismann of sadism cutting off the tails of several generations of mice is not voluptuous enough to tempt a scientific nero it was a mere piece of oneeyedness and it was darwin who put out weismanns humane and sensible eye he blinded many another eye and paralyzed many another will also ever since he set up circumstantial selection as the creator and ruler of the universe the scientific world has been the very citadel of stupidity and cruelty fearful as the tribal god of the hebrews was nobody ever shuddered as they passed even his meanest and narrowest little bethel or his proudest warconsecrating cathedral as we shudder now when we pass a physiological laboratory if we dreaded and mistrusted the priest we could at least keep him out of the house but what of the modern darwinist surgeon whom we dread and mistrust ten times more but into whose hands we must all give ourselves from time to time miserably as religion had been debased it did at least still proclaim that our relation to one another was that of a fellowship in which we were all equal and members one of another before the judgmentseat of our common father darwinism proclaimed that our true relation is that of competitors and combatants in a struggle for mere survival and that every act of pity or loyalty to the old fellowship is a vain and mischievous attempt to lessen the severity of the struggle and preserve inferior varieties from the efforts of nature to weed them out even in socialist societies which existed solely to substitute the law of fellowship for the law of competition and the method of providence and wisdom for the method of rushing violently down a steep place into the sea i found myself regarded as a blasphemer and an ignorant sentimentalist because whenever the neodarwinian doctrine was preached there i made no attempt to conceal my intellectual contempt for its blind coarseness and shallow logic or my natural abhorrence of its sickening inhumanity   the greatest of these is selfcontrol  as there is no place in darwinism for free will or any other sort of will the neodarwinists held that there is no such thing as selfcontrol yet selfcontrol is just the one quality of survival value which circumstantial selection must invariably and inevitably develop in the long run uncontrolled qualities may be selected for survival and development for certain periods and under certain circumstances for instance since it is the ungovernable gluttons who strive the hardest to get food and drink their efforts would develop their strength and cunning in a period of such scarcity that the utmost they could do would not enable them to overeat themselves but a change of circumstances involving a plentiful supply of food would destroy them we see this very thing happening often enough in the case of the healthy and vigorous poor man who becomes a millionaire by one of the accidents of our competitive commerce and immediately proceeds to dig his grave with his teeth but the selfcontrolled man survives all such changes of circumstance because he adapts himself to them and eats neither as much as he can hold nor as little as he can scrape along on but as much as is good for him what is selfcontrol it is nothing but a highly developed vital sense dominating and regulating the mere appetites to overlook the very existence of this supreme sense to miss the obvious inference that it is the quality that distinguishes the fittest to survive to omit in short the highest moral claim of evolutionary selection all this which the neodarwinians did in the name of natural selection shewed the most pitiable want of mastery of their own subject the dullest lack of observation of the forces upon which natural selection works   a sample of lamarckoshavian invective  the vitalist philosophers made no such mistakes nietzsche for example thinking out the great central truth of the will to power instead of cutting off mousetails had no difficulty in concluding that the final objective of this will was power over self and that the seekers after power over others and material possessions were on a false scent  the stultification naturally became much worse as the first darwinians died out the prestige of these pioneers who had the older evolutionary culture to build on and were in fact no more darwinian in the modern sense than darwin himself ceased to dazzle us when huxley and tyndall and spencer and darwin passed away and we were left with the smaller people who began with darwin and took in nothing else accordingly i find that in the year 1906 i indulged my temper by hurling invectives at the neodarwinians in the following terms  i really do not wish to be abusive but when i think of these poor little dullards with their precarious hold of just that corner of evolution that a blackbeetle can understandwith their retinue of twopennyhalfpenny torquemadas wallowing in the infamies of the vivisectors laboratory and solemnly offering us as epochmaking discoveries their demonstrations that dogs get weaker and die if you give them no food that intense pain makes mice sweat and that if you cut off a dogs leg the threelegged dog will have a fourlegged puppy i ask myself what spell has fallen on intelligent and humane men that they allow themselves to be imposed on by this rabble of dolts blackguards impostors quacks liars and worst of all credulous conscientious fools better a thousand times moses and spurgeon a then famous preacher back again after all you cannot understand moses without imagination nor spurgeon without metaphysics but you can be a thoroughgoing neodarwinian without imagination metaphysics poetry conscience or decency for natural selection has no moral significance it deals with that part of evolution which has no purpose no intelligence and might more appropriately be called accidental selection or better still unnatural selection since nothing is more unnatural than an accident if it could be proved that the whole universe had been produced by such selection only fools and rascals could bear to live   the humanitarians and the problem of evil  yet the humanitarians were as delighted as anybody with darwinism at first they had been perplexed by the problem of evil and the cruelty of nature they were shelleyists but not atheists those who believed in god were at a terrible disadvantage with the atheist they could not deny the existence of natural facts so cruel that to attribute them to the will of god is to make god a demon belief in god was impossible to any thoughtful person without belief in the devil as well the painted devil with his horns his barbed tail and his abode of burning brimstone was an incredible bogey but the evil attributed to him was real enough and the atheists argued that the author of evil if he exists must be strong enough to overcome god else god is morally responsible for everything he permits the devil to do neither conclusion delivered us from the horror of attributing the cruelty of nature to the workings of an evil will or could reconcile it with our impulses towards justice mercy and a higher life  a complete deliverance was offered by the discovery of circumstantial selection that is to say of a method by which horrors having every appearance of being elaborately planned by some intelligent contriver are only accidents without any moral significance at all suppose a watcher from the stars saw a frightful accident produced by two crowded trains at full speed crashing into one another how could he conceive that a catastrophe brought about by such elaborate machinery such ingenious preparation such skilled direction such vigilant industry was quite unintentional would he not conclude that the signalmen were devils  well circumstantial selection is largely a theory of collisions that is a theory of the innocence of much apparently designed devilry in this way darwin brought intense relief as well as an enlarged knowledge of facts to the humanitarians he destroyed the omnipotence of god for them but he also exonerated god from a hideous charge of cruelty granted that the comfort was shallow and that deeper reflection was bound to shew that worse than all conceivable devildeities is a blind deaf dumb heartless senseless mob of forces that strike as a tree does when it is blown down by the wind or as the tree itself is struck by lightning that did not occur to the humanitarians at the moment people do not reflect deeply when they are in the first happiness of escape from an intolerably oppressive situation like bunyans pilgrim they could not see the wicket gate nor the slough of despond nor the castle of giant despair but they saw the shining light at the end of the path and so started gaily towards it as evolutionists  and they were right for the problem of evil yields very easily to creative evolution if the driving power behind evolution is omnipotent only in the sense that there seems no limit to its final achievement and if it must meanwhile struggle with matter and circumstance by the method of trial and error then the world must be full of its unsuccessful experiments christ may meet a tiger or a high priest arminarm with a roman governor and be the unfittest to survive under the circumstances mozart may have a genius that prevails against emperors and archbishops and a lung that succumbs to some obscure and noxious property of foul air if all our calamities are either accidents or sincerely repented mistakes there is no malice in the cruelty of nature and no problem of evil in the victorian sense at all the theology of the women who told us that they became atheists when they sat by the cradles of their children and saw them strangled by the hand of god is succeeded by the theology of blanco posnet with his it was early days when he made the croup i guess it was the best he could think of then but when it turned out wrong on his hands he made you and me to fight the croup for him   how one touch of darwin makes the whole world kin  another humanitarian interest in darwinism was that darwin popularized evolution generally as well as making his own special contribution to it now the general conception of evolution provides the humanitarian with a scientific basis because it establishes the fundamental equality of all living things it makes the killing of an animal murder in exactly the same sense as the killing of a man is murder it is sometimes necessary to kill men as it is always necessary to kill tigers but the old theoretic distinction between the two acts has been obliterated by evolution when i was a child and was told that our dog and our parrot with whom i was on intimate terms were not creatures like myself but were brutal whilst i was reasonable i not only did not believe it but quite consciously and intellectually formed the opinion that the distinction was false so that afterwards when darwins views were first unfolded to me i promptly said that i had found out all that for myself before i was ten years old and i am far from sure that my youthful arrogance was not justified for this sense of the kinship of all forms of life is all that is needed to make evolution not only a conceivable theory but an inspiring one st anthony was ripe for the evolution theory when he preached to the fishes and st francis when he called the birds his little brothers our vanity and our snobbish conception of godhead as being like earthly kingship a supreme class distinction instead of the rock on which equality is built had led us to insist on god offering us special terms by placing us apart from and above all the rest of his creatures evolution took that conceit out of us and now though we may kill a flea without the smallest remorse we at all events know that we are killing our cousin no doubt it shocks the flea when the creature that an almighty celestial flea created expressly for the food of fleas destroys the jumping lord of creation with his sharp and enormous thumbnail but no flea will ever be so foolish as to preach that in slaying fleas man is applying a method of natural selection which will finally evolve a flea so swift that no man can catch him and so hardy of constitution that insect powder will have no more effect on him than strychnine on an elephant   why darwin pleased the socialists  the humanitarians were not alone among the agitators in their welcome to darwin he had the luck to please everybody who had an axe to grind the militarists were as enthusiastic as the humanitarians the socialists as the capitalists the socialists were specially encouraged by darwins insistence on the influence of environment perhaps the strongest moral bulwark of capitalism is the belief in the efficacy of individual righteousness robert owen made desperate efforts to convince england that her criminals her drunkards her ignorant and stupid masses were the victims of circumstance that if we would only establish his new moral world we should find that the masses born into an educated and moralized community would be themselves educated and moralized the stock reply to this is to be found in lewess life of goethe lewes scorned the notion that circumstances govern character he pointed to the variety of character in the governing rich class to prove the contrary similarity of circumstance can hardly be carried to a more desolating dead level than in the case of the individuals who are born and bred in english country houses and sent first to eton or harrow and then to oxford or cambridge to have their minds and habits formed such a routine would destroy individuality if anything could yet individuals come out from it as different as pitt from fox as lord russell from lord gurzon as mr winston churchill from lord robert cecil this acceptance of the congenital character of the individual as the determining factor in his destiny had been reinforced by the lamarckian view of evolution if the giraffe can develop his neck by wanting and trying a man can develop his character in the same way the old saying where there is a will there is a way condenses lamarcks theory of functional adaptation into a proverb this felt bracingly moral to strong minds and reassuringly pious to feeble ones there was no more effective retort to the socialist than to tell him to reform himself before he pretends to reform society if you were rich how pleasant it was to feel that you owed your riches to the superiority of your own character the industrial revolution had turned numbers of greedy dullards into monstrously rich men nothing could be more humiliating and threatening to them than the view that the falling of a shower of gold into their pockets was as pure an accident as the falling of a shower of hail on their umbrellas and happened alike to the just and unjust nothing could be more flattering and fortifying to them than the assumption that they were rich because they were virtuous  now darwinism made a clean sweep of all such selfrighteousness it more than justified robert owen by discovering in the environment of an organism an influence on it more potent than owen had ever claimed it implied that street arabs are produced by slums and not by original sin that prostitutes are produced by starvation wages and not by feminine concupiscence it threw the authority of science on the side of the socialist who said that he who would reform himself must first reform society it suggested that if we want healthy and wealthy citizens we must have healthy and wealthy towns and that these can exist only in healthy and wealthy countries it could be led to the conclusion that the type of character which remains indifferent to the welfare of its neighbors as long as its own personal appetite is satisfied is the disastrous type and the type which is deeply concerned about its environment the only possible type for a permanently prosperous community it shewed that the surprising changes which robert owen had produced in factory children by a change in their circumstances which does not seem any too generous to us nowadays were as nothing to the changeschanges not only of habits but of species not only of species but of orderswhich might conceivably be the work of environment acting on individuals without any character or intellectual consciousness whatever no wonder the socialists received darwin with open arms   darwin and karl marx  besides the socialists had an evolutionary prophet of their own who had discredited manchester as darwin discredited the garden of eden karl marx had proclaimed in his communist manifesto of 1848 now enjoying scriptural authority in russia that civilization is an organism evolving irresistibly by circumstantial selection and he published the first volume of his das kapital in 1867 the revolt against anthropomorphic idolatry which was as we have seen the secret of darwins success had been accompanied by a revolt against the conventional respectability which covered not only the brigandage and piracy of the feudal barons but the hypocrisy inhumanity snobbery and greed of the bourgeoisie who were utterly corrupted by an essentially diabolical identification of success in life with big profits the moment marx shewed that the relation of the bourgeoisie to society was grossly immoral and disastrous and that the whited wall of starched shirt fronts concealed and defended the most infamous of all tyrannies and the basest of all robberies he became an inspired prophet in the mind of every generous soul whom his book reached he had said and proved what they wanted to have proved and they would hear nothing against him now marx was by no means infallible his economics half borrowed and half homemade by a literary amateur were not when strictly followed up even favorable to socialism his theory of civilisation had been promulgated already in buckles history of civilization a book as epochmaking in the minds of its readers as das kapital there was nothing about socialism in the widely read first volume of das kapital every reference it made to workers and capitalists shewed that marx had never breathed industrial air and had dug his case out of bluebooks in the british museum compared to darwin he seemed to have no power of observation there was not a fact in das kapital that had not been taken out of a book nor a discussion that had not been opened by somebody elses pamphlet no matter he exposed the bourgeoisie and made an end of its moral prestige that was enough like darwin he had for the moment the world will by the ear marx had too what darwin had not implacability and a fine jewish literary gift with terrible powers of hatred invective irony and all the bitter qualities bred first in the oppression of a rather pampered young genius marx was the spoilt child of a welltodo family by a social system utterly uncongenial to him and later on by exile and poverty thus marx and darwin between them toppled over two closely related idols and became the prophets of two new creeds   why darwin pleased the profiteers also  but how at this rate did darwin succeed with the capitalists too it is not easy to make the best of both worlds when one of the worlds is preaching a class war and the other vigorously practising it the explanation is that darwinism was so closely related to capitalism that marx regarded it as an economic product rather than as a biological theory darwin got his main postulate the pressure of population on the available means of subsistence from the treatise of malthus on population just as he got his other postulate of a practically unlimited time for that pressure to operate from the geologist lyell who made an end of archbishop usshers biblical estimate of the age of the earth as 4004 bc plus ad the treatises of the ricardian economists on the law of diminishing return which was only the manchester schools version of the giraffe and the trees were all very fiercely discussed when darwin was a young man in fact the discovery in the eighteenth century by the french physiocrats of the economic effects of commercial selection in soils and sites and by malthus of a competition for subsistence which he attributed to pressure of population on available subsistence had already brought political science into that unbreathable atmosphere of fatalism which is the characteristic blight of darwinism long before darwin published a line the ricardomalthusian economists were preaching the fatalistic wages fund doctrine and assuring the workers that trade unionism is a vain defiance of the inexorable laws of political economy just as the neodarwinians were presently assuring us that temperance legislation is a vain defiance of natural selection and that the true way to deal with drunkenness is to flood the country with cheap gin and let the fittest survive cobdenism is after all nothing but the abandonment of trade to circumstantial selection  it is hardly possible to exaggerate the importance of this preparation for darwinism by a vast political and clerical propaganda of its moral atmosphere never in history as far as we know had there been such a determined richly subsidized politically organized attempt to persuade the human race that all progress all prosperity all salvation individual and social depend on an unrestrained conflict for food and money on the suppression and elimination of the weak by the strong on free trade free contract free competition natural liberty laisserfaire in short on doing the other fellow down with impunity all interference by a guiding government all organization except police organization to protect legalized fraud against fisticuffs all attempt to introduce human purpose and design and forethought into the industrial welter being contrary to the laws of political economy even the proletariat sympathized though to them capitalist liberty meant only wage slavery without the legal safeguards of chattel slavery people were tired of governments and kings and priests and providences and wanted to find out how nature would arrange matters if she were let alone and they found it out to their cost in the days when lancashire used up nine generations of wage slaves in one generation of their masters but their masters becoming richer and richer were very well satisfied and bastiat proved convincingly that nature had arranged economic harmonies which would settle social questions far better than theocracies or aristocracies or mobocracies the real deus ex machina being unrestrained plutocracy   the poetry and purity of materialism  thus the stars in their courses fought for darwin every faction drew a moral from him every catholic hater of faction founded a hope on him every blackguard felt justified by him and every saint felt encouraged by him the notion that any harm could come of so splendid an enlightenment seemed as silly as the notion that the atheists would steal all our spoons the physicists went further than the darwinians tyndall declared that he saw in matter the promise and potency of all forms of life and with his irish graphic lucidity made a picture of a world of magnetic atoms each atom with a positive and a negative pole arranging itself by attraction and repulsion in orderly crystalline structure such a picture is dangerously fascinating to thinkers oppressed by the bloody disorders of the living world craving for purer subjects of thought they find in the contemplation of crystals and magnets a happiness more dramatic and less childish than the happiness found by the mathematicians in abstract numbers because they see in the crystals beauty and movement without the corrupting appetites of fleshly vitality in such materialism as that of lucretius and tyndall there is a nobility which produces poetry john davidson found his highest inspiration in it even its pessimism as it faces the cooling of the sun and the return of the icecaps does not degrade the pessimist for example the quincy adamses with their insistence on modern democratic degradation as an inevitable result of solar shrinkage are not dehumanized as the vivisectionists are perhaps nobody is at heart fool enough to believe that life is at the mercy of temperature dante was not troubled by the objection that brunetto could not have lived in the fire nor ugolino in the ice  but the physicists found their intellectual vision of the world incommunicable to those who were not born with it it came to the public simply as materialism and materialism lost its peculiar purity and dignity when it entered into the darwinian reaction against bible fetichism between the two of them religion was knocked to pieces and where there had been a god a cause a faith that the universe was ordered however inexplicable by us its order might be and therefore a sense of moral responsibility as part of that order there was now an utter void chaos had come again the first effect was exhilarating we had the runaway childs sense of freedom before it gets hungry and lonely and frightened in this phase we did not desire our god back again we printed the verses in which william blake the most religious of our great poets called the anthropomorphic idol old nobodaddy and gibed at him in terms which the printer had to leave us to guess from his blank spaces we had heard the parson droning that god is not mocked and it was great fun to mock him to our hearts content and not be a penny the worse it did not occur to us that old nobodaddy instead of being a ridiculous fiction might be only an impostor and that the exposure of this koepenik captain of the heavens far from proving that there was no real captain rather proved the contrary that in short nobodaddy could not have impersonated anybody if there had not been somebodaddy to impersonate we did not see the significance of the fact that on the last occasion on which god had been expelled with a pitchfork men so different as voltaire and robespierre had said the one that if god did not exist it would be necessary to invent him and the other that after an honest attempt to dispense with a supreme being in practical politics some such hypothesis had been found quite indispensable and could not be replaced by a mere goddess of reason if these two opinions were quoted at all they were quoted as jokes at the expense of nobodaddy we were quite sure for the moment that whatever lingering superstition might have daunted these men of the eighteenth century we darwinians could do without god and had made a good riddance of him   the viceroys of the king of kings  now in politics it is much easier to do without god than to do without his viceroys and vicars and lieutenants and we begin to miss the lieutenants long before we begin to miss their principal roman catholics do what their confessors advise without troubling god and royalists are content to worship the king and ask the policeman but gods trustiest lieutenants often lack official credentials they may be professed atheists who are also men of honor and high public spirit the old belief that it matters dreadfully to god whether a man thinks himself an atheist or not and that the extent to which it matters can be stated with exactness as one single damn was an error for the divinity is in the honor and public spirit not in the mouthed credo or non credo the consequences of this error became grave when the fitness of a man for public trust was tested not by his honor and public spirit but by asking him whether he believed in nobodaddy or not if he said yes he was held fit to be a prime minister though as our ablest churchman has said the real implication was that he was either a fool a bigot or a liar darwin destroyed this test but when it was only thoughtlessly dropped there was no test at all and the door to public trust was open to the man who had no sense of god because he had no sense of anything beyond his own business interests and personal appetites and ambitions as a result the people who did not feel in the least inconvenienced by being no longer governed by nobodaddy soon found themselves very acutely inconvenienced by being governed by fools and commercial adventurers they had forgotten not only god but goldsmith who had warned them that honor sinks where commerce long prevails  the lieutenants of god are not always persons some of them are legal and parliamentary fictions one of them is public opinion the predarwinian statesmen and publicists were not restrained directly by god but they restrained themselves by setting up an image of a public opinion which would not tolerate any attempt to tamper with british liberties their favorite way of putting it was that any government which proposed such and such an infringement of such and such a british liberty would be hurled from office in a week this was not true there was no such public opinion no limit to what the british people would put up with in the abstract and no hardship short of immediate and sudden starvation that it would not and did not put up with in the concrete but this very helplessness of the people had forced their rulers to pretend that they were not helpless and that the certainty of a sturdy and unconquerable popular resistance forbade any trifling with magna carta or the petition of rights or the authority of parliament now the reality behind this fiction was the divine sense that liberty is a need vital to human growth accordingly though it was difficult enough to effect a political reform yet once parliament had passed it its wildest opponent had no hope that the government would cancel it or shelve it or be bought off from executing it from walpole to campbellbannerman there was no prime minister to whom such renagueing or trafficking would ever have occurred though there were plenty who employed corruption unsparingly to procure the votes of members of parliament for their policy   political opportunism in excelsis  the moment nobodaddy was slain by darwin public opinion as divine deputy lost its sanctity politicians no longer told themselves that the british public would never suffer this or that they allowed themselves to know that for their own personal purposes which are limited to their ten or twenty years on the front benches in parliament the british public can be humbugged and coerced into believing and suffering everything that it pays to impose on them and that any false excuse for an unpopular step will serve if it can be kept in countenance for a fortnight that is until the terms of the excuse are forgotten the people untaught or mistaught are so ignorant and incapable politically that this in itself would not greatly matter for a statesman who told them the truth would not be understood and would in effect mislead them more completely than if he dealt with them according to their blindness instead of to his own wisdom but though there is no difference in this respect between the best demagogue and the worst both of them having to present their cases equally in terms of melodrama there is all the difference in the world between the statesman who is humbugging the people into allowing him to do the will of god in whatever disguise it may come to him and one who is humbugging them into furthering his personal ambition and the commercial interests of the plutocrats who own the newspapers and support him on reciprocal terms and there is almost as great a difference between the statesman who does this naively and automatically or even does it telling himself that he is ambitious and selfish and unscrupulous and the one who does it on principle believing that if everyone takes the line of least material resistance the result will be the survival of the fittest in a perfectly harmonious universe once produce an atmosphere of fatalism on principle and it matters little what the opinions or superstitions of the individual statesmen concerned may be a kaiser who is a devout reader of sermons a prime minister who is an emotional singer of hymns and a general who is a bigoted roman catholic may be the executants of the policy but the policy itself will be one of unprincipled opportunism and all the governments will be like the tramp who walks always with the wind and ends as a pauper or the stone that rolls down the hill and ends as an avalanche their way is the way to destruction   the betrayal of western civilization  within sixty years from the publication of darwins origin of species political opportunism had brought parliaments into contempt created a popular demand for direct action by the organized industries syndicalism and wrecked the centre of europe in a paroxysm of that chronic terror of one another that cowardice of the irreligious which masked in the bravado of militarist patriotism had ridden the powers like a nightmare since the francoprussian war of 187071 the sturdy old cosmopolitan liberalism vanished almost unnoticed at the present moment all the new ordinances for the government of our grown colonies contain as a matter of course prohibitions of all criticism spoken or written of their ruling officials which would have scandalized george iii and elicited liberal pamphlets from catherine ii statesmen are afraid of the suburbs of the newspapers of the profiteers of the diplomatists of the militarists of the country houses of the trade unions of everything ephemeral on earth except the revolutions they are provoking and they would be afraid of these if they were not too ignorant of society and history to appreciate the risk and to know that a revolution always seems hopeless and impossible the day before it breaks out and indeed never does break out until it seems hopeless and impossible for rulers who think it possible take care to insure the risk by ruling reasonably this brings about a condition fatal to all political stability namely that you never know where to have the politicians if the fear of god was in them it might be possible to come to some general understanding as to what god disapproves of and europe might pull together on that basis but the present panic in which prime ministers drift from election to election either fighting or running away from everybody who shakes a fist at them makes a european civilization impossible such peace and prosperity as we enjoyed before the war depended on the loyalty of the western states to their own civilization that loyalty could find practical expression only in an alliance of the highly civilized western powers against the primitive tyrannies of the east britain germany france and the united states of america could have imposed peace on the world and nursed modern civilization in russia turkey and the balkans every meaner consideration should have given way to this need for the solidarity of the higher civilization what actually happened was that france and england through their clerks the diplomatists made an alliance with russia to defend themselves against germany germany made an alliance with turkey to defend herself against the three and the two unnatural and suicidal combinations fell on one another in a war that came nearer to being a war of extermination than any wars since those of timur the tartar whilst the united states held aloof as long as they could and the other states either did the same or joined in the fray through compulsion bribery or their judgment as to which side their bread was buttered and at the present moment though the main fighting has ceased through the surrender of germany on terms which the victors have never dreamt of observing the extermination by blockade and famine which was what forced germany to surrender still continues although it is certain that if the vanquished starve the victors will starve too and europe will liquidate its affairs by going not into bankruptcy but into chaos  now all this it will be noticed was fundamentally nothing but an idiotic attempt on the part of each belligerent state to secure for itself the advantage of the survival of the fittest through circumstantial selection if the western powers had selected their allies in the lamarckian manner intelligently purposely and vitally ad majorem dei gloriam as what nietzsche called good europeans there would have been a league of nations and no war but because the selection relied on was purely circumstantial opportunist selection so that the alliances were mere marriages of convenience they have turned out not merely as badly as might have been expected but far worse than the blackest pessimist had ever imagined possible    circumstantial selection in finance  how it will all end we do not yet know when wolves combine to kill a horse the death of the horse only sets them fighting one another for the choicest morsels men are no better than wolves if they have no better principles accordingly we find that the armistice and the treaty have not extricated us from the war a handful of serbian regicides flung us into it as a sporting navvy throws a bull pup at a cat but the supreme council with all its victorious legions and all its prestige cannot get us out of it though we are heartily sick and tired of the whole business and know now very well that it should never have been allowed to happen but we are helpless before a slate scrawled with figures of national debts as there is no money to pay them because it was all spent on the war wars have to be paid for on the nail the sensible thing to do is to wipe the slate and let the wrangling states distribute what they can spare on the sound communist principle of from each according to his ability to each according to his need but no we have no principles left not even commercial ones for what sane commercialist would decree that france must not pay for her failure to defend her own soil that germany must pay for her success in carrying the war into the enemys country and that as germany has not the money to pay and under our commercial system can make it only by becoming once more a commercial competitor of england and france which neither of them will allow she must borrow the money from england or america or even from france an arrangement by which the victorious creditors will pay one another and wait to get their money back until germany is either strong enough to refuse to pay or ruined beyond the possibility of paying meanwhile russia reduced to a scrap of fish and a pint of cabbage soup a day has fallen into the hands of rulers who perceive that materialist communism is at all events more effective than materialist nihilism and are attempting to move in an intelligent and ordered manner practising a very strenuous intentional selection of workers as fitter to survive than idlers whilst the western powers are drifting and colliding and running on the rocks in the hope that if they continue to do their worst they will get naturally selected for survival without the trouble of thinking about it   the homeopathic reaction against darwinism  when like the russians our nihilists have it urgently borne in on them by the brute force of rising wages that never overtake rising prices that they are being naturally selected for destruction they will perhaps remember that dont care came to a bad end and begin to look round for a religion and the whole purpose of this book is to shew them where to look for throughout all the godless welter of the infidel halfcentury darwinism has been acting not only directly but homeopathically its poison rallying our vital forces not only to resist it and cast it out but to achieve a new reformation and put a credible and healthy religion in its place samuel butler was the pioneer of the reaction as far as the casting out was concerned but the issue was confused by the physiologists who were divided on the question into mechanists and vitalists the mechanists said that life is nothing but physical and chemical action that they have demonstrated this in many cases of socalled vital phenomena and that there is no reason to doubt that with improved methods they will presently be able to demonstrate it in all of them the vitalists said that a dead body and a live one are physically and chemically identical and that the difference can be accounted for only by the existence of a vital force this seems simple but the antimechanists objected to be called vitalists obviously the right name for them on two contradictory grounds first that vitality is scientifically inadmissible because it cannot be isolated and experimented with in the laboratory second that force being by definition anything that can alter the speed or direction of matter in motion briefly that can overcome inertia is essentially a mechanistic conception here we had the new vitalist only half extricated from the old mechanist objecting to be called either and unable to give a clear lead in the new direction and there was a deeper antagonism the old vitalists in postulating a vital force were setting up a comparatively mechanical conception as against the divine idea of the life breathed into the clay nostrils of adam whereby he became a living soul the new vitalists filled by their laboratory researches with a sense of the miraculousness of life that went far beyond the comparatively uninformed imaginations of the authors of the book of genesis regarded the old vitalists as mechanists who had tried to fill up the gulf between life and death with an empty phrase denoting an imaginary physical force  these professional faction fights are ephemeral and need not trouble us here the old vitalist who was essentially a materialist has evolved into the new vitalist who is as every genuine scientist must be finally a metaphysician and as the new vitalist turns from the disputes of his youth to the future of his science he will cease to boggle at the name vitalist or at the inevitable ancient popular and quite correct use of the term force to denote metaphysical as well as physical overcomers of inertia  since the discovery of evolution as the method of the life force the religion of metaphysical vitalism has been gaining the definiteness and concreteness needed to make it assimilable by the educated critical man but it has always been with us the popular religions disgraced by their opportunist cardinals and bishops have been kept in credit by canonized saints whose secret was their conception of themselves as the instruments and vehicles of divine power and aspiration a conception which at moments becomes an actual experience of ecstatic possession by that power and above and below all have been millions of humble and obscure persons sometimes totally illiterate sometimes unconscious of having any religion at all sometimes believing in their simplicity that the gods and temples and priests of their district stood for their instinctive righteousness who have kept sweet the tradition that good people follow a light that shines within and above and ahead of them that bad people care only for themselves and that the good are saved and blessed and the bad damned and miserable protestantism was a movement towards the pursuit of a light called an inner light because every man must see it with his own eyes and not take any priests word for it or any churchs account of it in short there is no question of a new religion but rather of redistilling the eternal spirit of religion and thus extricating it from the sludgy residue of temporalities and legends that are making belief impossible though they are the stockintrade of all the churches and all the schools   religion and romance  it is the adulteration of religion by the romance of miracles and paradises and torture chambers that makes it reel at the impact of every advance in science instead of being clarified by it if you take an english village lad and teach him that religion means believing that the stories of noahs ark and the garden of eden are literally true on the authority of god himself and if that boy becomes an artisan and goes into the town among the sceptical city proletariat then when the jibes of his mates set him thinking and he sees that these stories cannot be literally true and learns that no candid prelate now pretends to believe them he does not make any fine distinctions he declares at once that religion is a fraud and parsons and teachers hypocrites and liars he becomes indifferent to religion if he has little conscience and indignantly hostile to it if he has a good deal  the same revolt against wantonly false teaching is happening daily in the professional classes whose recreation is reading and whose intellectual sport is controversy they banish the bible from their houses and sometimes put into the hands of their unfortunate children ethical and rationalist tracts of the deadliest dullness compelling these wretched infants to sit out the discourses of secularist lecturers i have delivered some of them myself who bore them at a length now forbidden by custom in the established pulpit our minds have reacted so violently towards provable logical theorems and demonstrable mechanical or chemical facts that we have become incapable of metaphysical truth and try to cast out incredible and silly lies by credible and clever ones calling in satan to cast out satan and getting more into his clutches than ever in the process thus the world is kept sane less by the saints than by the vast mass of the indifferent who neither act nor react in the matter butlers preaching of the gospel of laodicea was a piece of common sense founded on his observation of this  but indifference will not guide nations through civilization to the establishment of the perfect city of god an indifferent statesman is a contradiction in terms and a statesman who is indifferent on principle a laisserfaire or muddlethrough doctrinaire plays the deuce with us in the long run our statesmen must get a religion by hook or crook and as we are committed to adult suffrage it must be a religion capable of vulgarization the thought first put into words by the mills when they said there is no god but this is a family secret and long held unspoken by aristocratic statesmen and diplomatists will not serve now for the revival of civilization after the war cannot be effected by artificial breathing the driving force of an undeluded popular consent is indispensable and will be impossible until the statesman can appeal to the vital instincts of the people in terms of a common religion the success of the hang the kaiser cry at the last general election shews us very terrifyingly how a common irreligion can be used by myopic demagogy and common irreligion will destroy civilization unless it is countered by common religion   the danger of reaction  and here arises the danger that when we realize this we shall do just what we did half a century ago and what pliable did in the pilgrims progress when christian landed him in the slough of despond that is run back in terror to our old superstitions we jumped out of the fryingpan into the fire and we are just as likely to jump back again now that we feel hotter than ever history records very little in the way of mental activity on the part of the mass of mankind except a series of stampedes from affirmative errors into negative ones and back again it must therefore be said very precisely and clearly that the bankruptcy of darwinism does not mean that nobodaddy was somebodaddy with body parts and passions after all that the world was made in the year 4004 bc that damnation means a eternity of blazing brimstone that the immaculate conception means that sex is sinful and that christ was parthenogenetically brought forth by a virgin descended in like manner from a line of virgins right back to eve that the trinity is an anthropomorphic monster with three heads which are yet only one head that in rome the bread and wine on the altar become flesh and blood and in england in a still more mystical manner they do and they do not that the bible is an infallible scientific manual an accurate historical chronicle and a complete guide to conduct that we may lie and cheat and murder and then wash ourselves innocent in the blood of the lamb on sunday at the cost of a credo and a penny in the plate and so on and so forth civilization cannot be saved by people not only crude enough to believe these things but irreligious enough to believe that such belief constitutes a religion the education of children cannot safely be left in their hands if dwindling sects like the church of england the church of rome the greek church and the rest persist in trying to cramp the human mind within the limits of these grotesque perversions of natural truths and poetic metaphors then they must be ruthlessly banished from the schools until they either perish in general contempt or discover the soul that is hidden in every dogma the real class war will be a war of intellectual classes and its conquest will be the souls of the children   a touchstone for dogma  the test of a dogma is its universality as long as the church of england preaches a single doctrine that the brahman the buddhist the mussulman the parsee and all the other sectarians who are british subjects cannot accept it has no legitimate place in the counsels of the british commonwealth and will remain what it is at present a corrupter of youth a danger to the state and an obstruction to the fellowship of the holy ghost this has never been more strongly felt than at present after a war in which the church failed grossly in the courage of its profession and sold its lilies for the laurels of the soldiers of the victoria cross all the cocks in christendom have been crowing shame on it ever since and it will not be spared for the sake of the two or three faithful who were found even among the bishops let the church take it on authority even my authority as a professional legend maker if it cannot see the truth by its own light no dogma can be a legend a legend can pass an ethnical frontier as a legend but not as a truth whilst the only frontier to the currency of a sound dogma as such is the frontier of capacity for understanding it  this does not mean that we should throw away legend and parable and drama they are the natural vehicles of dogma but woe to the churches and rulers who substitute the legend for the dogma the parable for the history the drama for the religion better by far declare the throne of god empty than set a liar and a fool on it what are called wars of religion are always wars to destroy religion by affirming the historical truth or material substantiality of some legend and killing those who refuse to accept it as historical or substantial but who has ever refused to accept a good legend with delight as a legend the legends the parables the dramas are among the choicest treasures of mankind no one is ever tired of stories of miracles in vain did mahomet repudiate the miracles ascribed to him in vain did christ furiously scold those who asked him to give them an exhibition as a conjurer in vain did the saints declare that god chose them not for their powers but for their weaknesses that the humble might be exalted and the proud rebuked people will have their miracles their stories their heroes and heroines and saints and martyrs and divinities to exercise their gifts of affection admiration wonder and worship and their judases and devils to enable them to be angry and yet feel that they do well to be angry every one of these legends is the common heritage of the human race and there is only one inexorable condition attached to their healthy enjoyment which is that no one shall believe them literally the reading of stories and delighting in them made don quixote a gentleman the believing them literally made him a madman who slew lambs instead of feeding them in england today good books of eastern religious legends are read eagerly and protestants and atheists read roman catholic legends of the saints with pleasure but such fare is shirked by indians and roman catholics freethinkers read the bible indeed they seem to be its only readers now except the reluctant parsons at the church lecterns who communicate their discomfort to the congregation by gargling the words in their throats in an unnatural manner that is as repulsive as it is unintelligible and this is because the imposition of the legends as literal truths at once changes them from parables into falsehoods the feeling against the bible has become so strong at last that educated people not only refuse to outrage their intellectual consciences by reading the legend of noahs ark with its funny beginning about the animals and its exquisite end about the birds they will not read even the chronicles of king david which may very well be true and are certainly more candid than the official biographies of our contemporary monarchs   what to do with the legends  what we should do then is to pool our legends and make a delightful stock of religious folklore on an honest basis for all mankind with our minds freed from pretence and falsehood we could enter into the heritage of all the faiths china would share her sages with spain and spain her saints with china the ulster man who now gives his son an unmerciful thrashing if the boy is so tactless as to ask how the evening and the morning could be the first day before the sun was created or to betray an innocent calflove for the virgin mary would buy him a bookful of legends of the creation and of mothers of god from all parts of the world and be very glad to find his laddie as interested in such things as in marbles or police and robbers that would be better than beating all good feeling towards religion out of the child and blackening his mind by teaching him that the worshippers of the holy virgins whether of the parthenon or st peters are firedoomed heathens and idolaters all the sweetness of religion is conveyed to the world by the hands of storytellers and imagemakers without their fictions the truths of religion would for the multitude be neither intelligible nor even apprehensible and the prophets would prophesy and the teachers teach in vain and nothing stands between the people and the fictions except the silly falsehood that the fictions are literal truths and that there is nothing in religion but fiction   a lesson from science to the churches  let the churches ask themselves why there is no revolt against the dogmas of mathematics though there is one against the dogmas of religion it is not that the mathematical dogmas are more comprehensible the law of inverse squares is as incomprehensible to the common man as the athanasian creed it is not that science is free from legends witchcraft miracles biographic boostings of quacks as heroes and saints and of barren scoundrels as explorers and discoverers on the contrary the iconography and hagiology of scientism are as copious as they are mostly squalid but no student of science has yet been taught that specific gravity consists in the belief that archimedes jumped out of his bath and ran naked through the streets of syracuse shouting eureka eureka or that the law of inverse squares must be discarded if anyone can prove that newton was never in an orchard in his life when some unusually conscientious or enterprising bacteriologist reads the pamphlets of jenner and discovers that they might have been written by an ignorant but curious and observant nurserymaid and could not possibly have been written by any person with a scientifically trained mind he does not feel that the whole edifice of science has collapsed and crumbled and that there is no such thing as smallpox it may come to that yet for hygiene as it forces its way into our schools is being taught as falsely as religion is taught there but in mathematics and physics the faith is still kept pure and you may take the law and leave the legends without suspicion of heresy accordingly the tower of the mathematician stands unshaken whilst the temple of the priest rocks to its foundation   the religious art of the twentieth century  creative evolution is already a religion and is indeed now unmistakeably the religion of the twentieth century newly arisen from the ashes of pseudochristianity of mere scepticism and of the soulless affirmations and blind negations of the mechanists and neodarwinians but it cannot become a popular religion until it has its legends its parables its miracles and when i say popular i do not mean apprehensible by villagers only i mean apprehensible by cabinet ministers as well it is unreasonable to look to the professional politician and administrator for light and leading in religion he is neither a philosopher nor a prophet if he were he would be philosophizing and prophesying and not neglecting both for the drudgery of practical government socrates and coleridge did not remain soldiers nor could john stuart mill remain the representative of westminster in the house of commons even when he was willing the westminster electors admired mill for telling them that much of the difficulty of dealing with them arose from their being inveterate liars but they would not vote a second time for the man who was not afraid to break the crust of mendacity on which they were all dancing for it seemed to them that there was a volcanic abyss beneath not having his philosophic conviction that the truth is the solidest standing ground in the end your front bench man will always be an exploiter of the popular religion or irreligion not being an expert he must take it as he finds it and before he can take it he must have been told stories about it in his childhood and had before him all his life an elaborate iconography of it produced by writers painters sculptors temple architects and artists of all the higher sorts even if as sometimes happens he is a bit of an amateur in metaphysics as well as a professional politician he must still govern according to the popular iconography and not according to his own personal interpretations if these happen to be heterodox  it will be seen then that the revival of religion on a scientific basis does not mean the death of art but a glorious rebirth of it indeed art has never been great when it was not providing an iconography for a live religion and it has never been quite contemptible except when imitating the iconography after the religion had become a superstition italian painting from giotto to carpaccio is all religious painting and it moves us deeply and has real greatness compare with it the attempts of our painters a century ago to achieve the effects of the old masters by imitation when they should have been illustrating a faith of their own contemplate if you can bear it the dull daubs of hilton and haydon who knew so much more about drawing and scumbling and glazing and perspective and anatomy and marvellous foreshortening than giotto the latchet of whose shoe they were nevertheless not worthy to unloose compare mozarts magic flute beethovens ninth symphony wagners ring all of them reachingsforward to the new vitalist art with the dreary pseudosacred oratorios and cantatas which were produced for no better reason than that handel had formerly made splendid thunder in that way and with the stale confectionery mostly too wouldbe pious to be even cheerfully toothsome of spohr and mendelssohn stainer and parry which spread indigestion at our musical festivals until i publicly told parry the bludgeoning truth about his job and woke him to conviction of sin compare flaxman and thorwaldsen and gibson with phidias and praxiteles stevens with michael angelo bouguereaus virgin with cimabues or the best operatic christs of scheffer and m√ºller with the worst christs that the worst painters could paint before the end of the fifteenth century and you must feel that until we have a great religious movement we cannot hope for a great artistic one the disillusioned raphael could paint a mother and child but not a queen of heaven as much less skilful men had done in the days of his greatgrandfather yet he could reach forward to the twentieth century and paint a transfiguration of the son of man as they could not also please note he could decorate a house of pleasure for a cardinal very beautifully with voluptuous pictures of cupid and psyche for this simple sort of vitalism is always with us and like portrait painting keeps the artist supplied with subjectmatter in the intervals between the ages of faith so that your sceptical rembrandts and velasquezs are at least not compelled to paint shop fronts for want of anything else to paint in which they can really believe   the artistprophets  and there are always certain rare but intensely interesting anticipations michael angelo could not very well believe in julius ii or leo x or in much that they believed in but he could paint the superman three hundred years before nietzsche wrote also sprach zarathustra and strauss set it to music michael angelo won the primacy among all modern painters and sculptors solely by his power of shewing us superhuman persons on the strength of his decoration and color alone he would hardly have survived his own death twenty years and even his design would have had only an academic interest but as a painter of prophets and sibyls he is greatest among the very greatest in his craft because we aspire to a world of prophets and sibyls beethoven never heard of radioactivity nor of electrons dancing in vortices of inconceivable energy but pray can anyone explain the last movement of his hammerklavier sonata opus 106 otherwise than as a musical picture of these whirling electrons his contemporaries said he was mad partly perhaps because the movement was so hard to play but we who can make a pianola play it to us over and over until it is as familiar as pop goes the weasel know that it is sane and methodical as such it must represent something and as all beethovens serious compositions represent some process within himself some nerve storm or soul storm and the storm here is clearly one of physical movement i should much like to know what other storm than the atomic storm could have driven him to this oddest of all those many expressions of cyclonic energy which have given him the same distinction among musicians that michael angelo has among draughtsmen  in beethovens day the business of art was held to be the sublime and beautiful in our day it has fallen to be the imitative and voluptuous in both periods the word passionate has been freely employed but in the eighteenth century passion meant irresistible impulse of the loftiest kind for example a passion for astronomy or for truth for us it has come to mean concupiscence and nothing else one might say to the art of europe what antony said to the corpse of caesar are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils shrunk to this little measure but in fact it is the mind of europe that has shrunk being as we have seen wholly preoccupied with a busy springcleaning to get rid of its superstitions before readjusting itself to the new conception of evolution   evolution in the theatre  on the stage and here i come at last to my own particular function in the matter comedy as a destructive derisory critical negative art kept the theatre open when sublime tragedy perished from moli√®re to oscar wilde we had a line of comedic playwrights who if they had nothing fundamentally positive to say were at least in revolt against falsehood and imposture and were not only as they claimed chastening morals by ridicule but in johnsons phrase clearing our minds of cant and thereby shewing an uneasiness in the presence of error which is the surest symptom of intellectual vitality meanwhile the name of tragedy was assumed by plays in which everyone was killed in the last act just as in spite of moli√®re plays in which everyone was married in the last act called themselves comedies now neither tragedies nor comedies can be produced according to a prescription which gives only the last moments of the last act shakespear did not make hamlet out of its final butchery nor twelfth night out of its final matrimony and he could not become the conscious iconographer of a religion because he had no conscious religion he had therefore to exercise his extraordinary natural gifts in the very entertaining art of mimicry giving us the famous delineation of character which makes his plays like the novels of scott dumas and dickens so delightful also he developed that curious and questionable art of building us a refuge from despair by disguising the cruelties of nature as jokes but with all his gifts the fact remains that he never found the inspiration to write an original play he furbished up old plays and adapted popular stories and chapters of history from holinsheds chronicle and plutarchs biographies to the stage all this he did or did not for there are minus quantities in the algebra of art with a recklessness which shewed that his trade lay far from his conscience it is true that he never takes his characters from the borrowed story because it was less trouble and more fun to him to create them afresh but none the less he heaps the murders and villainies of the borrowed story on his own essentially gentle creations without scruple no matter how incongruous they may be and all the time his vital need for a philosophy drives him to seek one by the quaint professional method of introducing philosophers as characters into his plays and even of making his heroes philosophers but when they come on the stage they have no philosophy to expound they are only pessimists and railers and their occasional wouldbe philosophic speeches such as the seven ages of man and the soliloquy on suicide shew how deeply in the dark shakespear was as to what philosophy means he forced himself in among the greatest of playwrights without having once entered that region in which michael angelo beethoven goethe and the antique athenian stage poets are great he would really not be great at all if it were not that he had religion enough to be aware that his religionless condition was one of despair his towering king lear would be only a melodrama were it not for its express admission that if there is nothing more to be said of the universe than hamlet has to say then as flies to wanton boys are we to the gods they kill us for their sport  ever since shakespear playwrights have been struggling with the same lack of religion and many of them were forced to become mere panders and sensationmongers because though they had higher ambitions they could find no better subjectmatter from congreve to sheridan they were so sterile in spite of their wit that they did not achieve between them the output of moli√®res single lifetime and they were all not without reason ashamed of their profession and preferred to be regarded as mere men of fashion with a rakish hobby goldsmiths was the only saved soul in that pandemonium  the leaders among my own contemporaries now veterans snatched at minor social problems rather than write entirely without any wider purpose than to win money and fame one of them expressed to me his envy of the ancient greek playwrights because the athenians asked them not for some new and original disguise of the halfdozen threadbare plots of the modern theatre but for the deepest lesson they could draw from the familiar and sacred legends of their country let us all he said write an electra an antigone an agamemnon and shew what we can do with it but he did not write any of them because these legends are no longer religious aphrodite and artemis and poseidon are deader than their statues another with a commanding position and every trick of british farce and parisian drama at his fingers ends finally could not write without a sermon to preach and yet could not find texts more fundamental than the hypocrisies of sham puritanism or the matrimonial speculation which makes our young actresses as careful of their reputations as of their complexions a third too tenderhearted to break our spirits with the realities of a bitter experience coaxed a wistful pathos and a dainty fun out of the fairy cloudland that lay between him and the empty heavens the giants of the theatre of our time ibsen and strindberg had no greater comfort for the world than we indeed much less for they refused us even the shakespeariandickensian consolation of laughter at mischief accurately called comic relief our emancipated young successors scorn us very properly but they will be able to do no better whilst the drama remains preevolutionist let them consider the great exception of goethe he no richer than shakespear ibsen or strindberg in specific talent as a playwright is in the empyrean whilst they are gnashing their teeth in impotent fury in the mud or at best finding an acid enjoyment in the irony of their predicament goethe is olympian the other giants are infernal in everything but their veracity and their repudiation of the irreligion of their time that is they are bitter and hopeless it is not a question of mere dates goethe was an evolutionist in 1830 many playwrights even young ones are still untouched by creative evolution in 1920 ibsen was darwinized to the extent of exploiting heredity on the stage much as the ancient athenian playwrights exploited the eumenides but there is no trace in his plays of any faith in or knowledge of creative evolution as a modern scientific fact true the poetic aspiration is plain enough in his emperor or galilean but it is one of ibsens distinctions that nothing was valid for him but science and he left that vision of the future which his roman seer calls the third empire behind him as a utopian dream when he settled down to his serious grapple with realities in those plays of modern life with which he overcame europe and broke the dusty windows of every dryrotten theatre in it from moscow to manchester   my own part in the matter  in my own activities as a playwright i found this state of things intolerable the fashionable theatre prescribed one serious subject clandestine adultery the dullest of all subjects for a serious author whatever it may be for audiences who read the police intelligence and skip the reviews and leading articles i tried slumlandlordism doctrinaire free love pseudoibsenism prostitution militarism marriage history current politics natural christianity national and individual character paradoxes of conventional society husband hunting questions of conscience professional delusions and impostures all worked into a series of comedies of manners in the classic fashion which was then very much out of fashion the mechanical tricks of parisian construction being de rigueur in the theatre but this though it occupied me and established me professionally did not constitute me an iconographer of the religion of my time and thus fulfil my natural function as an artist i was quite conscious of this for i had always known that civilization needs a religion as a matter of life or death and as the conception of creative evolution developed i saw that we were at last within reach of a faith which complied with the first condition of all the religions that have ever taken hold of humanity namely that it must be first and fundamentally a science of metabiology this was a crucial point with me for i had seen bible fetichism after standing up to all the rationalistic batteries of hume voltaire and the rest collapse before the onslaught of much less gifted evolutionists solely because they discredited it as a biological document so that from that moment it lost its hold and left literate christendom faithless my own irish eighteenthcenturyism made it impossible for me to believe anything until i could conceive it as a scientific hypothesis even though the abominations quackeries impostures venalities credulities and delusions of the camp followers of science and the brazen lies and priestly pretensions of the pseudoscientific curemongers all sedulously inculcated by modern secondary education were so monstrous that i was sometimes forced to make a verbal distinction between science and knowledge lest i should mislead my readers but i never forgot that without knowledge even wisdom is more dangerous than mere opportunist ignorance and that somebody must take the garden of eden in hand and weed it properly  accordingly in 1901 i took the legend of don juan in its mozartian form and made it a dramatic parable of creative evolution but being then at the height of my invention and comedic talent i decorated it too brilliantly and lavishly i surrounded it with a comedy of which it formed only one act and that act was so completely episodical it was a dream which did not affect the action of the piece that the comedy could be detached and played by itself indeed it could hardly be played at full length owing to the enormous length of the entire work though that feat has been performed a few times in scotland by mr esme percy who led one of the forlorn hopes of the advanced drama at that time also i supplied the published work with an imposing framework consisting of a preface an appendix called the revolutionists handbook and a final display of aphoristic fireworks the effect was so vertiginous apparently that nobody noticed the new religion in the centre of the intellectual whirlpool now i protest i did not cut these cerebral capers in mere inconsiderate exuberance i did it because the worst convention of the criticism of the theatre current at that time was that intellectual seriousness is out of place on the stage that the theatre is a place of shallow amusement that people go there to be soothed after the enormous intellectual strain of a day in the city in short that a playwright is a person whose business it is to make unwholesome confectionery out of cheap emotions my answer to this was to put all my intellectual goods in the shop window under the sign of man and superman that part of my design succeeded by good luck and acting the comedy triumphed on the stage and the book was a good deal discussed since then the sweetshop view of the theatre has been out of countenance and its critical exponents have been driven to take an intellectual pose which though often more trying than their old intellectually nihilistic vulgarity at least concedes the dignity of the theatre not to mention the usefulness of those who live by criticizing it and the younger playwrights are not only taking their art seriously but being taken seriously themselves the critic who ought to be a newsboy is now comparatively rare  i now find myself inspired to make a second legend of creative evolution without distractions and embellishments my sands are running out the exuberance of 1901 has aged into the garrulity of 1930 and the war has been a stern intimation that the matter is not one to be trifled with i abandon the legend of don juan with its erotic associations and go back to the legend of the garden of eden i exploit the eternal interest of the philosophers stone which enables men to live for ever i am not i hope under more illusion than is humanly inevitable as to the crudity of this my beginning of a bible for creative evolution i am doing the best i can at my age my powers are waning but so much the better for those who found me unbearably brilliant when i was in my prime it is my hope that a hundred apter and more elegant parables by younger hands will soon leave mine as far behind as the religious pictures of the fifteenth century left behind the first attempts of the early christians at iconography in that hope i withdraw and ring up the curtain    back to methuselah  part i  in the beginning  act i   the garden of eden afternoon an immense serpent is sleeping with her head buried in a thick bed of johnswort and her body coiled in apparently endless rings through the branches of a tree which is already well grown for the days of creation have been longer than our reckoning she is not yet visible to anyone unaware of her presence as her colors of green and brown make a perfect camouflage near her head a low rock shows above the johnswort  the rock and tree are on the border of a glade in which lies a dead fawn all awry its neck being broken adam crouching with one hand on the rock is staring in consternation at the dead body he has not noticed the serpent on his left hand he turns his face to his right and calls excitedly  adam eve eve  eves voice what is it adam  adam come here quick something has happened  eve running in what where adam points to the fawn oh she goes to it and he is emboldened to go with her what is the matter with its eyes  adam it is not only its eyes look he kicks it  eve oh dont why doesnt it wake  adam i dont know it is not asleep  eve not asleep  adam try  eve trying to shake it and roll it over it is stiff and cold  adam nothing will wake it  eve it has a queer smell pah she dusts her hands and draws away from it did you find it like that  adam no it was playing about and it tripped and went head over heels it never stirred again its neck is wrong he stoops to lift the neck and shew her  eve dont touch it come away from it  they both retreat and contemplate it from a few steps distance with growing repulsion  eve adam  adam yes  eve suppose you were to trip and fall would you go like that  adam ugh he shudders and sits down on the rock  eve throwing herself on the ground beside him and grasping his knee you must be careful promise me you will be careful  adam what is the good of being careful we have to live here for ever think of what for ever means sooner or later i shall trip and fall it may be tomorrow it may be after as many days as there are leaves in the garden and grains of sand by the river no matter some day i shall forget and stumble  eve i too  adam horrified oh no no i should be alone alone for ever you must never put yourself in danger of stumbling you must not move about you must sit still i will take care of you and bring you what you want  eve turning away from him with a shrug and hugging her ankles i should soon get tired of that besides if it happened to you i should be alone i could not sit still then and at last it would happen to me too  adam and then  eve then we should be no more there would be only the things on all fours and the birds and the snakes  adam that must not be  eve yes that must not be but it might be  adam no i tell you it must not be i know that it must not be  eve we both know it how do we know it  adam there is a voice in the garden that tells me things  eve the garden is full of voices sometimes they put all sorts of thoughts into my head  adam to me there is only one voice it is very low but it is so near that it is like a whisper from within myself there is no mistaking it for any voice of the birds or beasts or for your voice  eve it is strange that i should hear voices from all sides and you only one from within but i have some thoughts that come from within me and not from the voices the thought that we must not cease to be comes from within  adam despairingly but we shall cease to be we shall fall like the fawn and be broken rising and moving about in his agitation i cannot bear this knowledge i will not have it it must not be i tell you yet i do not know how to prevent it  eve that is just what i feel but it is very strange that you should say so there is no pleasing you you change your mind so often  adam scolding her why do you say that how have i changed my mind  eve you say we must not cease to exist but you used to complain of having to exist always and for ever you sometimes sit for hours brooding and silent hating me in your heart when i ask you what i have done to you you say you are not thinking of me but of the horror of having to be here for ever but i know very well that what you mean is the horror of having to be here with me for ever  adam oh that is what you think is it well you are wrong he sits down again sulkily it is the horror of having to be with myself for ever i like you but i do not like myself i want to be different to be better to begin again and again to shed myself as a snake sheds its skin i am tired of myself and yet i must endure myself not for a day or for many days but for ever that is a dreadful thought that is what makes me sit brooding and silent and hateful do you never think of that  eve no i do not think about myself what is the use i am what i am nothing can alter that i think about you  adam you should not you are always spying on me i can never be alone you always want to know what i have been doing it is a burden you should try to have an existence of your own instead of occupying yourself with my existence  eve i have to think about you you are lazy you are dirty you neglect yourself you are always dreaming you would eat bad food and become disgusting if i did not watch you and occupy myself with you and now some day in spite of all my care you will fall on your head and become dead  adam dead what word is that  eve pointing to the fawn like that i call it dead  adam rising and approaching it slowly there is something uncanny about it  eve joining him oh it is changing into little white worms  adam throw it into the river it is unbearable  eve i dare not touch it  adam then i must though i loathe it it is poisoning the air he gathers its hooves in his hand and carries it away in the direction from which eve came holding it as far from him as possible  eve looks after them for a moment then with a shiver of disgust sits down on the rock brooding the body of the serpent becomes visible glowing with wonderful new colors she rears her head slowly from the bed of johnswort and speaks into eves ear in a strange seductively musical whisper  the serpent eve  eve startled who is that  the serpent it is i i have come to shew you my beautiful new hood see she spreads a magnificent amethystine hood  eve admiring it oh but who taught you to speak  the serpent you and adam i have crept through the grass and hidden and listened to you  eve that was wonderfully clever of you  the serpent i am the most subtle of all the creatures of the field  eve your hood is most lovely she strokes it and pets the serpent pretty thing do you love your godmother eve  the serpent i adore her she licks eves neck with her double tongue  eve petting her eves wonderful darling snake eve will never be lonely now that her snake can talk to her  the snake i can talk of many things i am very wise it was i who whispered the word to you that you did not know dead death die  eve shuddering why do you remind me of it i forgot it when i saw your beautiful hood you must not remind me of unhappy things  the serpent death is not an unhappy thing when you have learnt how to conquer it  eve how can i conquer it  the serpent by another thing called birth  eve what trying to pronounce it bbirth  the serpent yes birth  eve what is birth  the serpent the serpent never dies some day you shall see me come out of this beautiful skin a new snake with a new and lovelier skin that is birth  eve i have seen that it is wonderful  the serpent if i can do that what can i not do i tell you i am very subtle when you and adam talk i hear you say why always why you see things and you say why but i dream things that never were and i say why not i made the word dead to describe my old skin that i cast when i am renewed i call that renewal being born  eve born is a beautiful word  the serpent why not be born again and again as i am new and beautiful every time  eve i it does not happen that is why  the serpent that is how but it is not why why not  eve but i should not like it it would be nice to be new again but my old skin would lie on the ground looking just like me and adam would see it shrivel up and  the serpent no he need not there is a second birth  eve a second birth  the serpent listen i will tell you a great secret i am very subtle and i have thought and thought and thought and i am very wilful and must have what i want and i have willed and willed and willed and i have eaten strange things stones and apples that you are afraid to eat  eve you dared  the serpent i dared everything and at last i found a way of gathering together a part of the life in my body  eve what is the life  the serpent that which makes the difference between the dead fawn and the live one  eve what a beautiful word and what a wonderful thing life is the loveliest of all the new words  the serpent yes it was by meditating on life that i gained the power to do miracles  eve miracles another new word  the serpent a miracle is an impossible thing that is nevertheless possible something that never could happen and yet does happen  eve tell me some miracle that you have done  the serpent i gathered a part of the life in my body and shut it into a tiny white case made of the stones i had eaten  eve and what good was that  the serpent i shewed the little case to the sun and left it in its warmth and it burst and a little snake came out and it became bigger and bigger from day to day until it was as big as i that was the second birth  eve oh that is too wonderful it stirs inside me it hurts  the serpent it nearly tore me asunder yet i am alive and can burst my skin and renew myself as before soon there will be as many snakes in eden as there are scales on my body then death will not matter this snake and that snake will die but the snakes will live  eve but the rest of us will die sooner or later like the fawn and then there will be nothing but snakes snakes snakes everywhere  the serpent that must not be i worship you eve i must have something to worship something quite different to myself like you there must be something greater than the snake  eve yes it must not be adam must not perish you are very subtle tell me what to do  the serpent think will eat the dust lick the white stone bite the apple you dread the sun will give life  eve i do not trust the sun i will give life myself i will tear another adam from my body if i tear my body to pieces in the act  the serpent do dare it everything is possible everything listen i am old i am the old serpent older than adam older than eve i remember lilith who came before adam and eve i was her darling as i am yours she was alone there was no man with her she saw death as you saw it when the fawn fell and she knew then that she must find out how to renew herself and cast the skin like me she had a mighty will she strove and strove and willed and willed for more moons than there are leaves on all the trees of the garden her pangs were terrible her groans drove sleep from eden she said it must never be again that the burden of renewing life was past bearing that it was too much for one and when she cast the skin lo there was not one new lilith but two one like herself the other like adam you were the one adam was the other  eve but why did she divide into two and make us different  the serpent i tell you the labor is too much for one two must share it  eve do you mean that adam must share it with me he will not he cannot bear pain nor take trouble with his body  the serpent he need not there will be no pain for him he will implore you to let him do his share he will be in your power through his desire  eve then i will do it but how how did lilith work this miracle  the serpent she imagined it  eve what is imagined  the serpent she told it to me as a marvellous story of something that never happened to a lilith that never was she did not know then that imagination is the beginning of creation you imagine what you desire you will what you imagine and at last you create what you will  eve how can i create out of nothing  the serpent everything must have been created out of nothing look at that thick roll of hard flesh on your strong arm that was not always there you could not climb a tree when i first saw you but you willed and tried and willed and tried and your will created out of nothing the roll on your arm until you had your desire and could draw yourself up with one hand and seat yourself on the bough that was above your head  eve that was practice  the serpent things wear out by practice they do not grow by it your hair streams in the wind as if it were trying to stretch itself further and further but it does not grow longer for all its practice in streaming because you have not willed it so when lilith told me what she had imagined in our silent language for there were no words then i bade her desire it and will it and then to our great wonder the thing she had desired and willed created itself in her under the urging of her will then i too willed to renew myself as two instead of one and after many days the miracle happened and i burst from my skin another snake interlaced with me and now there are two imaginations two desires two wills to create with  eve to desire to imagine to will to create that is too long a story find me one word for it all you who are so clever at words  the serpent in one word to conceive that is the word that means both the beginning in imagination and the end in creation  eve find me a word for the story lilith imagined and told you in your silent language the story that was too wonderful to be true and yet came true  the serpent a poem  eve find me another word for what lilith was to me  the serpent she was your mother  eve and adams mother  the serpent yes  eve about to rise i will go and tell adam to conceive  the serpent laughs  eve jarred and startled what a hateful noise what is the matter with you no one has ever uttered such a sound before  the serpent adam cannot conceive  eve why  the serpent lilith did not imagine him so he can imagine he can will he can desire he can gather his life together for a great spring towards creation he can create all things except one and that one is his own kind  eve why did lilith keep this from him  the serpent because if he could do that he could do without eve  eve that is true it is i who must conceive  the serpent yes by that he is tied to you  eve and i to him  the serpent yes until you create another adam  eve i had not thought of that you are very subtle but if i create another eve he may turn to her and do without me i will not create any eves only adams  the serpent they cannot renew themselves without eves sooner or later you will die like the fawn and the new adams will be unable to create without new eves you can imagine such an end but you cannot desire it therefore cannot will it therefore cannot create adams only  eve if i am to die like the fawn why should not the rest die too what do i care  the serpent life must not cease that comes before everything it is silly to say you do not care you do care it is that care that will prompt your imagination inflame your desires make your will irresistible and create out of nothing  eve thoughtfully there can be no such thing as nothing the garden is full not empty  the serpent i had not thought of that that is a great thought yes there is no such thing as nothing only things we cannot see the chameleon eats the air  eve i have another thought i must tell it to adam calling adam adam cooee  adams voice cooee  eve this will please him and cure his fits of melancholy  the serpent do not tell him yet i have not told you the great secret  eve what more is there to tell it is i who have to do the miracle  the serpent no he too must desire and will but he must give his desire and his will to you  eve how  the serpent that is the great secret hush he is coming  adam returning is there another voice in the garden besides our voices and the voice i heard a new voice  eve rising and running to him only think adam our snake has learnt to speak by listening to us  adam delighted is it so he goes past her to the stone and fondles the serpent  the serpent responding affectionately it is so dear adam  eve but i have more wonderful news than that adam we need not live for ever  adam dropping the snakes head in his excitement what eve do not play with me about this if only there may be an end some day and yet no end if only i can be relieved of the horror of having to endure myself for ever if only the care of this terrible garden may pass on to some other gardener if only the sentinel set by the voice can be relieved if only the rest and sleep that enable me to bear it from day to day could grow after many days into an eternal rest an eternal sleep then i could face my days however long they may last only there must be some end some end i am not strong enough to bear eternity  the serpent you need not live to see another summer and yet there shall be no end  adam that cannot be  the serpent it can be  eve it shall be  the serpent it is kill me and you will find another snake in the garden tomorrow you will find more snakes than there are fingers on your hands  eve i will make other adams other eves  adam i tell you you must not make up stories about this it cannot happen  the serpent i can remember when you were yourself a thing that could not happen yet you are  adam struck that must be true he sits down on the stone  the serpent i will tell eve the secret and she will tell it to you  adam the secret he turns quickly towards the serpent and in doing so puts his foot on something sharp oh  eve what is it  adam rubbing his foot a thistle and there next to it a briar and nettles too i am tired of pulling these things up to keep the garden pleasant for us for ever  the serpent they do not grow very fast they will not overrun the whole garden for a long time not until you have laid down your burden and gone to sleep for ever why should you trouble yourself let the new adams clear a place for themselves  adam that is very true you must tell us your secret you see eve what a splendid thing it is not to have to live for ever  eve throwing herself down discontentedly and plucking at the grass that is so like a man the moment you find we need not last for ever you talk as if we were going to end today you must clear away some of those horrid things or we shall be scratched and stung whenever we forget to look where we are stepping  adam oh yes some of them of course but only some i will clear them away tomorrow  the serpent laughs  adam that is a funny noise to make i like it  eve i do not why do you make it again  the serpent adam has invented something new he has invented tomorrow you will invent things every day now that the burden of immortality is lifted from you  eve immortality what is that  the serpent my new word for having to live for ever  eve the serpent has made a beautiful word for being living  adam make me a beautiful word for doing things tomorrow for that surely is a great and blessed invention  the serpent procrastination  eve that is a sweet word i wish i had a serpents tongue  the serpent that may come too everything is possible  adam springing up in sudden terror oh  eve what is the matter now  adam my rest my escape from life  the serpent death that is the word  adam there is a terrible danger in this procrastination  eve what danger  adam if i put off death until tomorrow i shall never die there is no such day as tomorrow and never can be  the serpent i am very subtle but man is deeper in his thought than i am the woman knows that there is no such thing as nothing the man knows that there is no such day as tomorrow i do well to worship them  adam if i am to overtake death i must appoint a real day not a tomorrow when shall i die  eve you may die when i have made another adam not before but then as soon as you like she rises and passing behind him strolls off carelessly to the tree and leans against it stroking a ring of the snake  adam there need be no hurry even then  eve i see you will put it off until tomorrow  adam and you will you die the moment you have made a new eve  eve why should i are you eager to be rid of me only just now you wanted me to sit still and never move lest i should stumble and die like the fawn now you no longer care  adam it does not matter so much now  eve angrily to the snake this death that you have brought into the garden is an evil thing he wants me to die  the serpent to adam do you want her to die  adam no it is i who am to die eve must not die before me i should be lonely  eve you could get one of the new eves  adam that is true but they might not be quite the same they could not i feel sure of that they would not have the same memories they would bei want a word for them  the serpent strangers  adam yes that is a good hard word strangers  eve when there are new adams and new eves we shall live in a garden of strangers we shall need each other she comes quickly behind him and turns up his face to her do not forget that adam never forget it  adam why should i forget it it is i who have thought of it  eve i too have thought of something the fawn stumbled and fell and died but you could come softly up behind me and she suddenly pounces on his shoulders and throws him forward on his face throw me down so that i should die i should not dare to sleep if there were no reason why you should not make me die  adam scrambling up in horror make you die what a frightful thought  the serpent kill kill kill kill that is the word  eve the new adams and eves might kill us i shall not make them she sits on the rock and pulls him down beside her clasping him to her with her right arm  the serpent you must for if you do not there will be an end  adam no they will not kill us they will feel as i do there is something against it the voice in the garden will tell them that they must not kill as it tells me  the serpent the voice in the garden is your own voice  adam it is and it is not it is something greater than me i am only a part of it  eve the voice does not tell me not to kill you yet i do not want you to die before me no voice is needed to make me feel that  adam throwing his arm round her shoulder with an expression of anguish oh no that is plain without any voice there is something that holds us together something that has no word  the serpent love love love  adam that is too short a word for so long a thing  the serpent laughs  eve turning impatiently to the snake that heartbiting sound again do not do it why do you do it  the serpent love may be too long a word for so short a thing soon but when it is short it will be very sweet  adam ruminating you puzzle me my old trouble was heavy but it was simple these wonders that you promise to do may tangle up my being before they bring me the gift of death i was troubled with the burden of eternal being but i was not confused in my mind if i did not know that i loved eve at least i did not know that she might cease to love me and come to love some other adam and desire my death can you find a name for that knowledge  the serpent jealousy jealousy jealousy  adam a hideous word  eve shaking him adam you must not brood you think too much  adam angrily how can i help brooding when the future has become uncertain anything is better than uncertainty life has become uncertain love is uncertain have you a word for this new misery  the serpent fear fear fear  adam have you a remedy for it  the serpent yes hope hope hope  adam what is hope  the serpent as long as you do not know the future you do not know that it will not be happier than the past that is hope  adam it does not console me fear is stronger in me than hope i must have certainty he rises threateningly give it to me or i will kill you when next i catch you asleep  eve throwing her arms round the serpent my beautiful snake oh no how can you even think such a horror  adam fear will drive me to anything the serpent gave me fear let it now give me certainty or go in fear of me  the serpent bind the future by your will make a vow  adam what is a vow  the serpent choose a day for your death and resolve to die on that day then death is no longer uncertain but certain let eve vow to love you until your death then love will be no longer uncertain  adam yes that is splendid that will bind the future  eve displeased turning away from the serpent but it will destroy hope  adam angrily be silent woman hope is wicked happiness is wicked certainty is blessed  the serpent what is wicked you have invented a word  adam whatever i fear to do is wicked listen to me eve and you snake listen too that your memory may hold my vow i will live a thousand sets of the four seasons  the serpent years years  adam i will live a thousand years and then i will endure no more i will die and take my rest and i will love eve all that time and no other woman  eve and if adam keeps his vow i will love no other man until he dies  the serpent you have both invented marriage and what he will be to you and not to any other woman is husband and what you will be to him and not to any other man is wife  adam instinctively moving his hand towards her husband and wife  eve slipping her hand into his wife and husband  the serpent laughs  eve snatching herself loose from adam do not make that odious noise i tell you  adam do not listen to her the noise is good it lightens my heart you are a jolly snake but you have not made a vow yet what vow do you make  the serpent i make no vows i take my chance  adam chance what does that mean  the serpent it means that i fear certainty as you fear uncertainty it means that nothing is certain but uncertainty if i bind the future i bind my will if i bind my will i strangle creation  eve creation must not be strangled i tell you i will create though i tear myself to pieces in the act  adam be silent both of you i will bind the future i will be delivered from fear to eve we have made our vows and if you must create you shall create within the bounds of those vows you shall not listen to that snake any more come he seizes her by the hair to drag her away  eve let me go you fool it has not yet told me the secret  adam releasing her that is true what is a fool  eve i do not know the word came to me it is what you are when you forget and brood and are filled with fear let us listen to the snake  adam no i am afraid of it i feel as if the ground were giving way under my feet when it speaks do you stay and listen to it  the serpent laughs  adam brightening that noise takes away fear funny the snake and the woman are going to whisper secrets he chuckles and goes away slowly laughing his first laugh  eve now the secret the secret she sits on the rock and throws her arms round the serpent who begins whispering to her  eves face lights up with intense interest which increases until an expression of overwhelming repugnance takes its place she buries her face in her hands    act ii   a few centuries later morning an oasis in mesopotamia close at hand the end of a log house abuts on a kitchen garden adam is digging in the middle of the garden on his right eve sits on a stool in the shadow of a tree by the doorway spinning flax her wheel which she turns by hand is a large disc of heavy wood practically a flywheel at the opposite side of the garden is a thorn brake with a passage through it barred by a hurdle  the two are scantily and carelessly dressed in rough linen and leaves they have lost their youth and grace and adam has an unkempt beard and jaggedly cut hair but they are strong and in the prime of life adam looks worried like a farmer eve better humored having given up worrying sits and spins and thinks  a mans voice hallo mother  eve looking across the garden towards the hurdle here is cain  adam uttering a grunt of disgust he goes on digging without raising his head  cain kicks the hurdle out of his way and strides into the garden in pose voice and dress he is insistently warlike he is equipped with huge spear and broad brassbound leather shield his casque is a tigers head with bulls horns he wears a scarlet cloak with gold brooch over a lions skin with the claws dangling his feet are in sandals with brass ornaments his shins are in brass greaves and his bristling military moustache glistens with oil to his parents he has the selfassertive notquiteatease manner of a revolted son who knows that he is not forgiven nor approved of  cain to adam still digging always dig dig dig sticking in the old furrow no progress no advanced ideas no adventures what should i be if i had stuck to the digging you taught me  adam what are you now with your shield and spear and your brothers blood crying from the ground against you  cain i am the first murderer you are only the first man anybody could be the first man it is as easy as to be the first cabbage to be the first murderer one must be a man of spirit  adam begone leave us in peace the world is wide enough to keep us apart  eve why do you want to drive him away he is mine i made him out of my own body i want to see my work sometimes  adam you made abel also he killed abel can you bear to look at him after that  cain whose fault was it that i killed abel who invented killing did i no he invented it himself i followed your teaching i dug and dug and dug i cleared away the thistles and briars i ate the fruits of the earth i lived in the sweat of my brow as you do i was a fool but abel was a discoverer a man of ideas of spirit a true progressive he was the discoverer of blood he was the inventor of killing he found out that the fire of the sun could be brought down by a dewdrop he invented the altar to keep the fire alive he changed the beasts he killed into meat by the fire on the altar he kept himself alive by eating meat his meal cost him a days glorious healthgiving sport and an hours amusing play with the fire you learnt nothing from him you drudged and drudged and drudged and dug and dug and dug and made me do the same i envied his happiness his freedom i despised myself for not doing as he did instead of what you did he became so happy that he shared his meal with the voice that had whispered all his inventions to him he said that the voice was the voice of the fire that cooked his food and that the fire that could cook could also eat it was true i saw the fire consume the food on his altar then i too made an altar and offered my food on it my grains my roots my fruit useless nothing happened he laughed at me and then came my great idea why not kill him as he killed the beasts i struck and he died just as they did then i gave up your old silly drudging ways and lived as he had lived by the chase by the killing and by the fire am i not better than you stronger happier freer  adam you are not stronger you are shorter in the wind you cannot endure you have made the beasts afraid of us and the snake has invented poison to protect herself against you i fear you myself if you take a step towards your mother with that spear of yours i will strike you with my spade as you struck abel  eve he will not strike me he loves me  adam he loved his brother but he killed him  cain i do not want to kill women i do not want to kill my mother and for her sake i will not kill you though i could send this spear through you without coming within reach of your spade but for her i could not resist the sport of trying to kill you in spite of my fear that you would kill me i have striven with a boar and with a lion as to which of us should kill the other i have striven with a man spear to spear and shield to shield it is terrible but there is no joy like it i call it fighting he who has never fought has never lived that is what has brought me to my mother today  adam what have you to do with one another now she is the creator you the destroyer  cain how can i destroy unless she creates i want her to create more and more men aye and more and more women that they may in turn create more men i have imagined a glorious poem of many men of more men than there are leaves on a thousand trees i will divide them into two great hosts one of them i will lead and the other will be led by the man i fear most and desire to fight and kill most and each host shall try to kill the other host think of that all those multitudes of men fighting fighting killing killing the four rivers running with blood the shouts of triumph the howls of rage the curses of despair the shrieks of torment that will be life indeed life lived to the very marrow burning overwhelming life every man who has not seen it heard it felt it risked it will feel a humbled fool in the presence of the man who has  eve and i i am to be a mere convenience to make men for you to kill  adam or to kill you you fool  cain mother the making of men is your right your risk your agony your glory your triumph you make my father here your mere convenience as you call it for that he has to dig for you sweat for you plod for you like the ox who helps him to tear up the ground or the ass who carries his burdens for him no woman shall make me live my fathers life i will hunt i will fight and strive to the very bursting of my sinews when i have slain the boar at the risk of my life i will throw it to my woman to cook and give her a morsel of it for her pains she shall have no other food and that will make her my slave and the man that slays me shall have her for his booty man shall be the master of woman not her baby and her drudge  adam throws down his spade and stands looking darkly at eve  eve are you tempted adam does this seem a better thing to you than love between us  cain what does he know of love only when he has fought when he has faced terror and death when he has striven to the spending of the last rally of his strength can he know what it is to rest in love in the arms of a woman ask that woman whom you made who is also my wife whether she would have me as i was in the days when i followed the ways of adam and was a digger and a drudge  eve angrily throwing down her distaff what you dare come here boasting about that goodfornothing lua the worst of daughters and the worst of wives you her master you are more her slave than adams ox or your own sheepdog forsooth when you have slain the boar at the risk of your life you will throw her a morsel of it for her pains ha poor wretch do you think i do not know her and know you better than that do you risk your life when you trap the ermine and the sable and the blue fox to hang on her lazy shoulders and make her look more like an animal than a woman when you have to snare the little tender birds because it is too much trouble for her to chew honest food how much of a great warrior do you feel then you slay the tiger at the risk of your life but who gets the striped skin you have run that risk for she takes it to lie on and flings you the carrion flesh you cannot eat you fight because you think that your fighting makes her admire and desire you fool she makes you fight because you bring her the ornaments and the treasures of those you have slain and because she is courted and propitiated with power and gold by the people who fear you you say that i make a mere convenience of adam i who spin and keep the house and bear and rear children and am a woman and not a pet animal to please men and prey on them what are you you poor slave of a painted face and a bundle of skunks fur you were a manchild when i bore you lua was a womanchild when i bore her what have you made of yourselves  cain letting his spear fall into the crook of his shield arm and twirling his moustache there is something higher than man there is hero and superman  eve superman you are no superman you are antiman you are to other men what the stoat is to the rabbit and she is to you what the leech is to the stoat you despise your father but when he dies the world will be the richer because he lived when you die men will say he was a great warrior but it would have been better for the world if he had never been born and of lua they will say nothing but when they think of her they will spit  cain she is a better sort of woman to live with than you if lua nagged at me as you are nagging and as you nag at adam i would beat her black and blue from head to foot i have done it too slave as you say i am  eve yes because she looked at another man and then you grovelled at her feet and cried and begged her to forgive you and were ten times more her slave than ever and she when she had finished screaming and the pain went off a little she forgave you did she not  cain she loved me more than ever that is the true nature of woman  eve now pitying him maternally love you call that love you call that the nature of woman my boy this is neither man nor woman nor love nor life you have no real strength in your bones nor sap in your flesh  cain ha he seizes his spear and swings it muscularly  eve yes you have to twirl a stick to feel your strength you cannot taste life without making it bitter and boiling hot you cannot love lua until her face is painted nor feel the natural warmth of her flesh until you have stuck a squirrels fur on it you can feel nothing but a torment and believe nothing but a lie you will not raise your head to look at all the miracles of life that surround you but you will run ten miles to see a fight or a death  adam enough said let the boy alone  cain boy ha ha  eve to adam you think perhaps that his way of life may be better than yours after all you are still tempted well will you pamper me as he pampers his woman will you kill tigers and bears until i have a heap of their skins to lounge on shall i paint my face and let my arms waste into pretty softness and eat partridges and doves and the flesh of kids whose milk you will steal for me  adam you are hard enough to bear with as you are stay as you are and i will stay as i am  cain you neither of you know anything about life you are simple country folk you are the nurses and valets of the oxen and dogs and asses you have tamed to work for you i can raise you out of that i have a plan why not tame men and women to work for us why not bring them up from childhood never to know any other lot so that they may believe that we are gods and that they are here only to make life glorious for us  adam impressed that is a great thought certainly  eve contemptuously great thought  adam well as the serpent used to say why not  eve because i would not have such wretches in my house because i hate creatures with two heads or with withered limbs or that are distorted and perverted and unnatural i have told cain already that he is not a man and that lua is not a woman they are monsters and now you want to make still more unnatural monsters so that you may be utterly lazy and worthless and that your tamed human animals may find work a blasting curse a fine dream truly to cain your father is a fool skin deep but you are a fool to your very marrow and your baggage of a wife is worse  adam why am i a fool how am i a greater fool than you  eve you said there would be no killing because the voice would tell our children that they must not kill why did it not tell cain that  cain it did but i am not a child to be afraid of a voice the voice thought i was nothing but my brothers keeper it found that i was myself and that it was for abel to be himself also and look to himself he was not my keeper any more than i was his why did he not kill me there was no more to prevent him than there was to prevent me it was man to man and i won i was the first conqueror  adam what did the voice say to you when you thought all that  cain why it gave me right it said that my deed was as a mark on me a burntin mark such as abel put on his sheep that no man should slay me and here i stand unslain whilst the cowards who have never slain the men who are content to be their brothers keepers instead of their masters are despised and rejected and slain like rabbits he who bears the brand of cain shall rule the earth when he falls he shall be avenged sevenfold the voice has said it so beware how you plot against me you and all the rest  adam cease your boasting and bullying and tell the truth does not the voice tell you that as no man dare slay you for murdering your brother you ought to slay yourself  cain no  adam then there is no such thing as divine justice unless you are lying  cain i am not lying i dare all truths there is divine justice for the voice tells me that i must offer myself to every man to be killed if he can kill me without danger i cannot be great that is how i pay for abels blood danger and fear follow my steps everywhere without them courage would have no sense and it is courage courage courage that raises the blood of life to crimson splendor  adam picking up his spade and preparing to dig again take yourself off then this splendid life of yours does not last for a thousand years and i must last for a thousand years when you fighters do not get killed in fighting one another or fighting the beasts you die from mere evil in yourselves your flesh ceases to grow like mans flesh it grows like a fungus on a tree instead of breathing you sneeze or cough up your insides and wither and perish your bowels become rotten your hair falls from you your teeth blacken and drop out and you die before your time not because you will but because you must i will dig and live  cain and pray what use is this thousand years of life to you you old vegetable do you dig any better because you have been digging for hundreds of years i have not lived as long as you but i know all there is to be known of the craft of digging by quitting it i have set myself free to learn nobler crafts of which you know nothing i know the craft of fighting and of hunting in a word the craft of killing what certainty have you of your thousand years i could kill both of you and you could no more defend yourselves than a couple of sheep i spare you but others may kill you why not live bravely and die early and make room for others why ii that know many more crafts than either of you am tired of myself when i am not fighting or hunting sooner than face a thousand years of it i should kill myself as the voice sometimes tempts me to do already  adam liar you denied just now that it called on you to pay for abels life with your own  cain the voice does not speak to me as it does to you i am a man you are only a grownup child one does not speak to a child as to a man and a man does not listen and tremble in silence he replies he makes the voice respect him in the end he dictates what the voice shall say  adam may your tongue be accurst for such blasphemy  eve keep a guard on your own tongue and do not curse my son it was lilith who did wrong when she shared the labor of creation so unequally between man and wife if you cain had had the trouble of making abel or had had to make another man to replace him when he was gone you would not have killed him you would have risked your own life to save his that is why all this empty talk of yours which tempted adam just now when he threw down his spade and listened to you for a while went by me like foul wind that has passed over a dead body that is why there is enmity between woman the creator and man the destroyer i know you i am your mother you are idle you are selfish it is long and hard and painful to create life it is short and easy to steal the life others have made when you dug you made the earth live and bring forth as i live and bring forth it was for that that lilith set you free from the travail of women not for theft and murder  cain the devil thank her for it i can make better use of my time than to play the husband to the clay beneath my feet  adam devil what new word is that  cain hearken to me old fool i have never in my soul listened willingly when you have told me of the voice that whispers to you there must be two voices one that gulls and despises you and another that trusts and respects me i call yours the devil mine i call the voice of god  adam mine is the voice of life yours the voice of death  cain be it so for it whispers to me that death is not really death that it is the gate of another life a life infinitely splendid and intense a life of the soul alone a life without clods or spades hunger or fatigue  eve selfish and idle cain i know  cain selfish yes a life in which no man is his brothers keeper because his brother can keep himself but am i idle in rejecting your drudgery have i not embraced evils and agonies of which you know nothing the arrow is lighter in the hand than the spade but the energy that drives it through the breast of a fighter is as fire to water compared with the strength that drives the spade into the harmless dirty clay my strength is as the strength of ten because my heart is pure  adam what is that word what is pure  cain turned from the clay turned upward to the sun to the clear clean heavens  adam the heavens are empty child the earth is fruitful the earth feeds us it gives us the strength by which we made you and all mankind cut off from the clay which you despise you would perish miserably  cain i revolt against the clay i revolt against the food you say it gives us strength does it not also turn into filth and smite us with diseases i revolt against these births that you and mother are so proud of they drag us down to the level of the beasts if that is to be the last thing as it has been the first let mankind perish if i am to eat like a bear if lua is to bring forth cubs like a bear then i had rather be a bear than a man for the bear is not ashamed he knows no better if you are content like the bear i am not stay with the woman who gives you children i will go to the woman who gives me dreams grope in the ground for your food i will bring it from the skies with my arrows or strike it down as it roams the earth in the pride of its life if i must have food or die i will at least have it at as far a remove from the earth as i can the ox shall make it something nobler than grass before it comes to me and as the man is nobler than the ox i shall some day let my enemy eat the ox and then i will slay and eat him  adam monster you hear this eve  eve so that is what comes of turning your face to the clean clear heavens maneating childeating for that is what it would come to just as it came to lambs and kids when abel began with sheep and goats you are a poor silly creature after all do you think i never have these thoughts i who have the labor of the childbearing i who have the drudgery of preparing the food i thought for a moment that perhaps this strong brave son of mine who could imagine something better and could desire what he imagined might also be able to will what he desired until he created it and all that comes of it is that he wants to be a bear and eat children even a bear would not eat a man if it could get honey instead  cain i do not want to be a bear i do not want to eat children i do not know what i want except that i want to be something higher and nobler than this stupid old digger whom lilith made to help you to bring me into the world and whom you despise now that he has served your turn  adam in sullen rage i have half a mind to shew you that my spade can split your undutiful head open in spite of your spear  cain undutiful ha ha flourishing his spear try it old everybodys father try a taste of fighting  eve peace peace you two fools sit down and be quiet and listen to me adam with a weary shrug throws down his spade cain with a laughing one throws down his shield and spear both sit on the ground i hardly know which of you satisfies me least you with your dirty digging or he with his dirty killing i cannot think it was for either of these cheap ways of life that lilith set you free to adam you dig roots and coax grains out of the earth why do you not draw down a divine sustenance from the skies he steals and kills for his food and makes up idle poems of life after death and dresses up his terrorridden life with fine words and his diseaseridden body with fine clothes so that men may glorify and honor him instead of cursing him as murderer and thief all you men except only adam are my sons or my sons sons or my sons sons sons you all come to see me you all shew off before me all your little wisdoms and accomplishments are trotted out before mother eve the diggers come the fighters and killers come they are both very dull for they either complain to me of the last harvest or boast to me of the last fight and one harvest is just like another and the last fight only a repetition of the first oh i have heard it all a thousand times they tell me too of their lastborn the clever thing the darling child said yesterday and how much more wonderful or witty or quaint it is than any child that ever was born before and i have to pretend to be surprised delighted interested though the last child is like the first and has said and done nothing that did not delight adam and me when you and abel said it for you were the first children in the world and filled us with such wonder and delight as no couple can ever again feel while the world lasts when i can bear no more i go to our old garden that is now a mass of nettles and thistles in the hope of finding the serpent to talk to but you have made the serpent our enemy she has left the garden or is dead i never see her now so i have to come back and listen to adam saying the same thing for the tenthousandth time or to receive a visit from the last greatgreatgrandson who has grown up and wants to impress me with his importance oh it is dreary dreary and there is yet nearly seven hundred years of it to endure  cain poor mother you see life is too long one tires of everything there is nothing new under the sun  adam to eve grumpily why do you live on if you can find nothing better to do than complain  eve because there is still hope  cain of what  eve of the coming true of your dreams and mine of newly created things of better things my sons and my sons sons are not all diggers and fighters some of them will neither dig nor fight they are more useless than either of you they are weaklings and cowards they are vain yet they are dirty and will not take the trouble to cut their hair they borrow and never pay but one gives them what they want because they tell beautiful lies in beautiful words they can remember their dreams they can dream without sleeping they have not will enough to create instead of dreaming but the serpent said that every dream could be willed into creation by those strong enough to believe in it there are others who cut reeds of different lengths and blow through them making lovely patterns of sound in the air and some of them can weave the patterns together sounding three reeds at the same time and raising my soul to things for which i have no words and others make little mammoths out of clay or make faces appear on flat stones and ask me to create women for them with such faces i have watched those faces and willed and then i have made a womanchild that has grown up quite like them and others think of numbers without having to count on their fingers and watch the sky at night and give names to the stars and can foretell when the sun will be covered with a black saucepan lid and there is tubal who made this wheel for me which has saved me so much labor and there is enoch who walks on the hills and hears the voice continually and has given up his will to do the will of the voice and has some of the voices greatness when they come there is always some new wonder or some new hope something to live for they never want to die because they are always learning and always creating either things or wisdom or at least dreaming of them and then you cain come to me with your stupid fighting and destroying and your foolish boasting and you want me to tell you that it is all splendid and that you are heroic and that nothing but death or the dread of death makes life worth living away with you naughty child and do you adam go on with your work and not waste your time listening to him  cain i am not perhaps very clever but  eve interrupting him perhaps not but do not begin to boast of that it is no credit to you  cain for all that mother i have an instinct which tells me that death plays its part in life tell me this who invented death  adam springs to his feet eve drops her distaff both shew the greatest consternation  cain what is the matter with you both  adam boy you have asked us a terrible question  eve you invented murder let that be enough for you  cain murder is not death you know what i mean those whom i slay would die if i spared them if i am not slain yet i shall die who put this upon me i say who invented death  adam be reasonable boy could you bear to live for ever you think you could because you know that you will never have to make your thought good but i have known what it is to sit and brood under the terror of eternity of immortality think of it man to have no escape to be adam adam adam through more days than there are grains of sand by the two rivers and then be as far from the end as ever i who have so much in me that i hate and long to cast off be thankful to your parents who enabled you to hand on your burden to new and better men and won for you an eternal rest for it was we who invented death  cain rising you did well i too do not want to live for ever but if you invented death why do you blame me who am a minister of death  adam i do not blame you go in peace leave me to my digging and your mother to her spinning  cain well i will leave you to it though i have shewn you a better way he picks up his shield and spear i will go back to my brave warrior friends and their splendid women he strides to the thorn brake when adam delved and eve span where was then the gentleman he goes away roaring with laughter which ceases as he cries from the distance goodbye mother  adam grumbling he might have put the hurdle back lazy hound he replaces the hurdle across the passage  eve through him and his like death is gaining on life already most of our grandchildren die before they have sense enough to know how to live  adam no matter he spits on his hands and takes up the spade again life is still long enough to learn to dig short as they are making it  eve musing yes to dig and to fight but is it long enough for the other things the great things will they live long enough to eat manna  adam what is manna  eve food drawn down from heaven made out of the air not dug dirtily from the earth will they learn all the ways of all the stars in their little time it took enoch two hundred years to learn to interpret the will of the voice when he was a mere child of eighty his babyish attempts to understand the voice were more dangerous than the wrath of cain if they shorten their lives they will dig and fight and kill and die and their baby enochs will tell them that it is the will of the voice that they should dig and fight and kill and die for ever  adam if they are lazy and have a will towards death i cannot help it i will live my thousand years if they will not let them die and be damned  eve damned what is that  adam the state of them that love death more than life go on with your spinning and do not sit there idle while i am straining my muscles for you  eve slowly taking up her distaff if you were not a fool you would find something better for both of us to live by than this spinning and digging  adam go on with your work i tell you or you shall go without bread  eve man need not always live by bread alone there is something else we do not yet know what it is but some day we shall find out and then we will live on that alone and there shall be no more digging nor spinning nor fighting nor killing  she spins resignedly he digs impatiently     part ii  the gospel of the brothers barnabas   in the first years after the war an impressivelooking gentleman of 50 is seated writing in a wellfurnished spacious study he is dressed in black his coat is a frockcoat his tie is white and his waistcoat though it is not quite a clergymans waistcoat and his collar though it buttons in front instead of behind combine with the prosperity indicated by his surroundings and his air of personal distinction to suggest the clerical dignitary still he is clearly neither dean nor bishop he is rather too starkly intellectual for a popular free church enthusiast and he is not careworn enough to be a great headmaster  the study windows which have broad comfortable window seats overlook hampstead heath towards london consequently it being a fine afternoon in spring the room is sunny as you face these windows you have on your right the fireplace with a few logs smouldering in it and a couple of comfortable library chairs on the hearthrug beyond it and beside it the door before you the writingtable at which the clerical gentleman sits a little to your left facing the door with his right profile presented to you on your left a settee and on your right a couple of chippendale chairs there is also an upholstered square stool in the middle of the room against the writingtable the walls are covered with bookshelves above and lockers beneath  the door opens and another gentleman shorter than the clerical one within a year or two of the same age dressed in a wellworn tweed lounge suit with a short beard and much less style in his bearing and carriage looks in  the clerical gentleman familiar and by no means cordial hallo i didnt expect you until the five oclock train  the tweeded gentleman coming in very slowly i have something on my mind i thought id come early  the clerical gentleman throwing down his pen what is on your mind  the tweeded gentleman sitting down on the stool heavily preoccupied with his thought i have made up my mind at last about the time i make it three hundred years  the clerical gentleman sitting up energetically now that is extraordinary most extraordinary the very last words i wrote when you interrupted me were at least three centuries he snatches up his manuscript and points to it here it is reading the term of human life must be extended to at least three centuries  the tweeded gentleman how did you arrive at it  a parlor maid opens the door ushering in a young clergyman  the parlor maid mr haslam she withdraws  the visitor is so very unwelcome that his host forgets to rise and the two brothers stare at the intruder quite unable to conceal their dismay haslam who has nothing clerical about him except his collar and wears a snuffcolored suit smiles with a frank schoolboyishness that makes it impossible to be unkind to him and explodes into obviously unpremeditated speech  haslam im afraid im an awful nuisance im the rector and i suppose one ought to call on people  the tweeded gentleman in ghostly tones were not church people you know  haslam oh i dont mind that if you dont the church people here are mostly as dull as ditchwater i have heard such a lot about you and there are so jolly few people to talk to i thought you perhaps wouldnt mind do you mind for of course ill go like a shot if im in the way  the clerical gentleman rising disarmed sit down mrer  haslam haslam  the clerical gentleman mr haslam  the tweeded gentleman rising and offering him the stool sit down he retreats towards the chippendale chairs  haslam sitting down on the stool thanks awfully  the clerical gentleman resuming his seat this is my brother conrad professor of biology at jarrowfields university dr conrad barnabas my name is franklyn franklyn barnabas i was in the church myself for some years  haslam sympathizing yes one cant help it if theres a living in the family or ones governor knows a patron one gets shoved into the church by ones parents  conrad sitting down on the furthest chippendale with a snort of amusement mp  franklyn one gets shoved out of it sometimes by ones conscience  haslam oh yes but where is a chap like me to go im afraid im not intellectual enough to split straws when theres a job in front of me and nothing better for me to do i daresay the church was a bit thick for you but its good enough for me it will last my time anyhow he laughs goodhumoredly  franklyn with renewed energy there again you see con it will last his time life is too short for men to take it seriously  haslam thats a way of looking at it certainly  franklyn i was not shoved into the church mr haslam i felt it to be my vocation to walk with god like enoch after twenty years of it i realized that i was walking with my own ignorance and selfconceit and that i was not within a hundred and fifty years of the experience and wisdom i was pretending to  haslam now i come to think of it old methuselah must have had to think twice before he took on anything for life if i thought i was going to live nine hundred and sixty years i dont think i should stay in the church  franklyn if men lived even a third of that time the church would be very different from the thing it is  conrad if i could count on nine hundred and sixty years i could make myself a real biologist instead of what i am now a child trying to walk are you sure you might not become a good clergyman if you had a few centuries to do it in  haslam oh theres nothing much the matter with me its quite easy to be a decent parson its the church that chokes me off i couldnt stick it for nine hundred years i should chuck it you know sometimes when the bishop who is the most priceless of fossils lets off something more than usually outofdate the bird starts in my garden  franklyn the bird  haslam oh yes theres a bird there that keeps on singing stick it or chuck it stick it or chuck itjust like thatfor an hour on end in the spring i wish my father had found some other shop for me  the parlor maid comes back  the parlor maid any letters for the post sir  franklyn these he proffers a basket of letters she comes to the table and takes them  haslam to the maid have you told mr barnabas yet  the parlor maid flinching a little no sir  franklyn told me what  haslam she is going to leave you  franklyn indeed im sorry is it our fault mr haslam  haslam not a bit she is jolly well off here  the parlor maid reddening i have never denied it sir i couldnt ask for a better place but i have only one life to live and i maynt get a second chance excuse me sir but the letters must go to catch the post she goes out with the letters  the two brothers look inquiringly at haslam  haslam silly girl going to marry a village woodman and live in a hovel with him and a lot of kids tumbling over one another just because the fellow has poeticlooking eyes and a moustache  conrad demurring she said it was because she had only one life  haslam same thing poor girl the fellow persuaded her to chuck it and when she marries him shell have to stick it rotten state of things i call it  conrad you see she hasnt time to find out what life really means she has to die before she knows  haslam agreeably thats it  franklyn she hasnt time to form a wellinstructed conscience  haslam still more cheerfully quite  franklyn it goes deeper she hasnt time to form a genuine conscience at all some romantic points of honor and a few conventions a world without conscience that is the horror of our condition  haslam beaming simply fatuous rising well i suppose id better be going its most awfully good of you to put up with my calling  conrad in his former low ghostly tone you neednt go you know if you are really interested  haslam fed up well im afraid i ought toi really must get backi have something to do in the  franklyn smiling benignly and rising to proffer his hand goodbye  conrad gruffly giving him up as a bad job goodbye  haslam goodbye sorryer  as the rector moves to shake hands with franklyn feeling that he is making a frightful mess of his departure a vigorous sunburnt young lady with hazel hair cut to the level of her neck like an italian youth in a gozzoli picture comes in impetuously she seems to have nothing on but her short skirt her blouse her stockings and a pair of norwegian shoes in short she is a simplelifer  the simplelifer swooping on conrad and kissing him hallo nunk youre before your time  conrad behave yourself theres a visitor  she turns quickly and sees the rector she instinctively switches at her gozzoli fringe with her fingers but gives it up as hopeless  franklyn mr haslam our new rector to haslam my daughter cynthia  conrad usually called savvy short for savage  savvy i usually call mr haslam bill short for william she strolls to the hearthrug and surveys them calmly from that commanding position  franklyn you know him  savvy rather sit down bill  franklyn mr haslam is going savvy he has an engagement  savvy i know im the engagement  conrad in that case would you mind taking him into the garden while i talk to your father  savvy to haslam tennis  haslam rather  savvy come on she dances out he runs boyishly after her  franklyn leaving his table and beginning to walk up and down the room discontentedly savvys manners jar on me they would have horrified her grandmother  conrad obstinately they are happier manners than mothers manners  franklyn yes they are franker wholesomer better in a hundred ways and yet i squirm at them i cannot get it out of my head that mother was a wellmannered woman and that savvy has no manners at all  conrad there wasnt any pleasure in mothers fine manners that makes a biological difference  franklyn but there was beauty in mothers manners grace in them style in them above all decision in them savvy is such a cub  conrad so she ought to be at her age  franklyn there it comes again her age her age  conrad you want her to be fully grown at eighteen you want to force her into a stuckup artificial premature selfpossession before she has any self to possess you just let her alone she is right enough for her years  franklyn i have let her alone and look at the result like all the other young people who have been let alone she becomes a socialist that is she becomes hopelessly demoralized  conrad well arnt you a socialist  franklyn yes but that is not the same thing you and i were brought up in the old bourgeois morality we were taught bourgeois manners and bourgeois points of honor bourgeois manners may be snobbish manners there may be no pleasure in them as you say but they are better than no manners many bourgeois points of honor may be false but at least they exist the women know what to expect and what is expected of them savvy doesnt she is a bolshevist and nothing else she has to improvise her manners and her conduct as she goes along its often charming no doubt but sometimes she puts her foot in it frightfully and then i feel that she is blaming me for not teaching her better  conrad well you have something better to teach her now at all events  franklyn yes but it is too late she doesnt trust me now she doesnt talk about such things to me she doesnt read anything i write she never comes to hear me lecture i am out of it as far as savvy is concerned he resumes his seat at the writingtable  conrad i must have a talk to her  franklyn perhaps she will listen to you you are not her father  conrad i sent her my last book i can break the ice by asking her what she made of it  franklyn when she heard you were coming she asked me whether all the leaves were cut in case it fell into your hands she hasnt read a word of it  conrad rising indignantly what  franklyn inexorably not a word of it  conrad beaten well i suppose its only natural biology is a dry subject for a girl and i am a pretty dry old codger  he sits down again resignedly  franklyn brother if that is so if biology as you have worked at it and religion as i have worked at it are dry subjects like the old stuff they taught under these names and we two are dry old codgers like the old preachers and professors then the gospel of the brothers barnabas is a delusion unless this withered thing religion and this dry thing science have come alive in our hands alive and intensely interesting we may just as well go out and dig the garden until it is time to dig our graves the parlor maid returns franklyn is impatient at the interruption well what is it now  the parlor maid mr joyce burge on the telephone sir he wants to speak to you  franklyn astonished mr joyce burge  the parlor maid yes sir  franklyn to conrad what on earth does this mean i havnt heard from him nor exchanged a word with him for years i resigned the chairmanship of the liberal association and shook the dust of party politics from my feet before he was prime minister in the coalition of course he dropped me like a hot potato  conrad well now that the coalition has chucked him out and he is only one of the halfdozen leaders of the opposition perhaps he wants to pick you up again  the parlor maid warningly he is holding the line sir  franklyn yes all right he hurries out  the parlor maid goes to the hearthrug to make up the fire conrad rises and strolls to the middle of the room where he stops and looks quizzically down at her  conrad so you have only one life to live eh  the parlor maid dropping on her knees in consternation i meant no offence sir  conrad you didnt give any but you know you could live a devil of a long life if you really wanted to  the parlor maid sitting down on her heels oh dont say that sir its so unsettling  conrad why have you been thinking about it  the parlor maid it would never have come into my head if you hadnt put it there sir me and cook had a look at your book  conrad what      you and cook    had a look    at my book   and my niece wouldnt open it the prophet is without honor in his own family well what do you think of living for several hundred years are you going to have a try for it  the parlor maid well of course youre not in earnest sir but it does set one thinking especially when one is going to be married  conrad what has that to do with it he may live as long as you you know  the parlor maid thats just it sir you see he must take me for better for worse til death do us part do you think he would be so ready to do that sir if he thought it might be for several hundred years  conrad thats true and what about yourself  the parlor maid oh i tell you straight out sir id never promise to live with the same man as long as that i wouldnt put up with my own children as long as that why cook figured it out sir that when you were only 200 you might marry your own greatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgrandson and not even know who he was  conrad well why not for all you know the man you are going to marry may be your greatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgrandmothers greatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgrandson  the parlor maid but do you think it would ever be thought respectable sir  conrad my good girl all biological necessities have to be made respectable whether we like it or not so you neednt worry yourself about that  franklyn returns and crosses the room to his chair but does not sit down the parlor maid goes out  conrad well what does joyce burge want  franklyn oh a silly misunderstanding i have promised to address a meeting in middlesborough and some fool has put it into the papers that i am coming to middlesborough without any explanation of course now that we are on the eve of a general election political people think i am coming there to contest the parliamentary seat burge knows that i have a following and thinks i could get into the house of commons and head a group there so he insists on coming to see me he is staying with some people at dollis hill and can be here in five or ten minutes he says  conrad but didnt you tell him that its a false alarm  franklyn of course i did but he wont believe me  conrad called you a liar in fact  franklyn no i wish he had any sort of plain speaking is better than the nauseous sham good fellowship our democratic public men get up for shop use he pretends to believe me and assures me his visit is quite disinterested but why should he come if he has no axe to grind these chaps never believe anything they say themselves and naturally they cannot believe anything anyone else says  conrad rising well i shall clear out it was hard enough to stand the party politicians before the war but now that they have managed to half kill europe between them i cant be civil to them and i dont see why i should be  franklyn wait a bit we have to find out how the world will take our new gospel conrad sits down again party politicians are still unfortunately an important part of the world suppose we try it on joyce burge  conrad how can you you can tell things only to people who can listen joyce burge has talked so much that he has lost the power of listening he doesnt listen even in the house of commons  savvy rushes in breathless followed by haslam who remains timidly just inside the door  savvy running to franklyn i say who do you think has just driven up in a big car  franklyn mr joyce burge perhaps  savvy disappointed oh they know bill why didnt you tell us he was coming i have nothing on  haslam id better go hadnt i  conrad you just wait here both of you when you start yawning joyce burge will take the hint perhaps  savvy to franklyn may we  franklyn yes if you promise to behave yourself  savvy making a wry face that will be a treat wont it  the parlor maid entering and announcing mr joyce burge  haslam hastily moves to the fireplace and the parlor maid goes out and shuts the door when the visitor has passed in  franklyn hurrying past savvy to his guest with the false cordiality he has just been denouncing oh here you are delighted to see you he shakes burges hand and introduces savvy my daughter  savvy not daring to approach very kind of you to come  joyce burge stands fast and says nothing but he screws up his cheeks into a smile at each introduction and makes his eyes shine in a very winning manner he is a wellfed man turned fifty with broad forehead and grey hair which his neck being short falls almost to his collar  franklyn mr haslam our rector  burge conveys an impression of shining like a church window and haslam seizes the nearest library chair on the hearth and swings it round for burge between the stool and conrad he then retires to the window seat at the other side of the room and is joined by savvy they sit there side by side hunched up with their elbows on their knees and their chins on their hands providing burge with a sort of strangers gallery during the ensuing sitting  franklyn i forget whether you know my brother conrad he is a biologist  burge suddenly bursting into energetic action and shaking hands heartily with conrad by reputation only but very well of course how i wish i could have devoted myself to biology i have always been interested in rocks and strata and volcanoes and so forth they throw such a light on the age of the earth with conviction there is nothing like biology the cloudcapped towers the solemn binnacles the gorgeous temples the great globe itself yea all that it inherit shall dissolve and like this influential pageant faded leave not a rack behind thats biology you know good sound biology he sits down so do the others franklyn on the stool and conrad on his chippendale well my dear barnabas what do you think of the situation dont you think the time has come for us to make a move  franklyn the time has always come to make a move  burge how true but what is the move to be you are a man of enormous influence we know that weve always known it we have to consult you whether we like it or not we  franklyn interrupting firmly i never meddle in party politics now  savvy its no use saying you have no influence daddy heaps of people swear by you  burge shining at her of course they do come let me prove to you what we think of you shall we find you a firstrate constituency to contest at the next election one that wont cost you a penny a metropolitan seat what do you say to the strand  franklyn my dear burge i am not a child why do you go on wasting your party funds on the strand you know you cannot win it  burge we cannot win it but you  franklyn oh please  savvy the strands no use mr burge i once canvassed for a socialist there cheese it  burge cheese it  haslam spluttering with suppressed laughter priceless  savvy well i suppose i shouldnt say cheese it to a right honorable but the strand you know do come off it  franklyn you must excuse my daughters shocking manners burge but i agree with her that popular democratic statesmen soon come to believe that everyone they speak to is an ignorant dupe and a born fool into the bargain  burge laughing genially you old aristocrat you but believe me the instinct of the people is sound  conrad cutting in sharply then why are you in the opposition instead of in the government  burge shewing signs of temper under this heckling i deny that i am in the opposition morally the government does not represent the country i was chucked out of the coalition by a tory conspiracy the people want me back i dont want to go back  franklyn gently remonstrant my dear burge of course you do  burge turning on him not a bit of it i want to cultivate my garden i am not interested in politics i am interested in roses i havnt a scrap of ambition i went into politics because my wife shoved me into them bless her but i want to serve my country what else am i for i want to save my country from the tories they dont represent the people the man they have made prime minister has never represented the people and you know it lord dunreen is the bitterest old tory left alive what has he to offer to the people  franklyn cutting in before burge can proceedas he evidently intendsto answer his own question i will tell you he has ascertainable beliefs and principles to offer the people know where they are with lord dunreen they know what he thinks right and what he thinks wrong with your followers they never know where they are with you they never know where they are  burge amazed with me  franklyn well where are you what are you  burge barnabas you must be mad you ask me what i am  franklyn i do  burge i am if i mistake not joyce burge pretty well known throughout europe and indeed throughout the world as the man whounworthily perhaps but not quite unsuccessfullyheld the helm when the ship of state weathered the mightiest hurricane that has ever burst with earthshaking violence on the land of our fathers  franklyn i know that i know who you are and the earthshaking part of it to me is that though you were placed in that enormously responsible position neither i nor anyone else knows what your beliefs are or even whether you have either beliefs or principles what we did know was that your government was formed largely of men who regarded you as a robber of henroosts and whom you regarded as enemies of the people  burge adroitly as he thinks i agree with you i agree with you absolutely i dont believe in coalition governments  franklyn precisely yet you formed two  burge why because we were at war that is what you fellows never would realize the hun was at the gate our country our lives the honor of our wives and mothers and daughters the tender flesh of our innocent babes were at stake was that a time to argue about principles  franklyn i should say it was the time of all others to confirm the resolution of our own men and gain the confidence and support of public opinion throughout the world by a declaration of principle do you think the hun would ever have come to the gate if he had known that it would be shut in his face on principle did he not hold his own against you until america boldly affirmed the democratic principle and came to our rescue why did you let america snatch that honor from england  burge barnabas america was carried away by words and had to eat them at the peace conference beware of eloquence it is the bane of popular speakers like you      franklyn exclaimingwell    savvy alli like that    haslam togetherpriceless   burge continuing remorselessly come down to facts it wasnt principle that won the war it was the british fleet and the blockade america found the talk i found the shells you cannot win wars by principles but you can win elections by them there i am with you you want the next election to be fought on principles that is what it comes to doesnt it  franklyn i dont want it to be fought at all an election is a moral horror as bad as a battle except for the blood a mud bath for every soul concerned in it you know very well that it will not be fought on principle  burge on the contrary it will be fought on nothing else i believe a program is a mistake i agree with you that principle is what we want  franklyn principle without program eh  burge exactly there it is in three words  franklyn why not in one word platitudes that is what principle without program means  burge puzzled but patient trying to get at franklyns drift in order to ascertain his price i have not made myself clear listen i am agreeing with you i am on your side i am accepting your proposal there isnt going to be any more coalition this time there wont be a tory in the cabinet every candidate will have to pledge himself to free trade slightly modified by consideration for our overseas dominions to disestablishment to reform of the house of lords to a revised scheme of taxation of land values and to doing something or other to keep the irish quiet does that satisfy you  franklyn it does not even interest me suppose your friends do commit themselves to all this what does it prove about them except that they are hopelessly out of date even in party politics that they have learnt nothing and forgotten nothing since 1885 what is it to me that they hate the church and hate the landed gentry that they are jealous of the nobility and have shipping shares instead of manufacturing businesses in the midlands i can find you hundreds of the most sordid rascals or the most densely stupid reactionaries with all these qualifications  burge personal abuse proves nothing do you suppose the tories are all angels because they are all members of the church of england  franklyn no but they stand together as members of the church of england whereas your people in attacking the church are all over the shop the supporters of the church are of one mind about religion its enemies are of a dozen minds the churchmen are a phalanx your people are a mob in which atheists are jostled by plymouth brethren and positivists by pillars of fire you have with you all the crudest unbelievers and all the crudest fanatics  burge we stand as cromwell did for liberty of conscience if that is what you mean  franklyn how can you talk such rubbish over the graves of your conscientious objectors all law limits liberty of conscience if a mans conscience allows him to steal your watch or to shirk military service how much liberty do you allow it liberty of conscience is not my point  burge testily i wish you would come to your point half the time you are saying that you must have principles and when i offer you principles you say they wont work  franklyn you have not offered me any principles your party shibboleths are not principles if you get into power again you will find yourself at the head of a rabble of socialists and antisocialists of jingo imperialists and little englanders of castiron materialists and ecstatic quakers of christian scientists and compulsory inoculationists of syndicalists and bureaucrats in short of men differing fiercely and irreconcilably on every principle that goes to the root of human society and destiny and the impossibility of keeping such a team together will force you to sell the pass again to the solid conservative opposition  burge rising in wrath sell the pass again you accuse me of having sold the pass  franklyn when the terrible impact of real warfare swept your parliamentary sham warfare into the dustbin you had to go behind the backs of your followers and make a secret agreement with the leaders of the opposition to keep you in power on condition that you dropped all legislation of which they did not approve and you could not even hold them to their bargain for they presently betrayed the secret and forced the coalition on you  burge i solemnly declare that this is a false and monstrous accusation  franklyn do you deny that the thing occurred were the uncontradicted reports false were the published letters forgeries  burge certainly not but i did not do it i was not prime minister then it was that old dotard that playedout old humbug lubin he was prime minister then not i  franklyn do you mean to say you did not know  burge sitting down again with a shrug oh i had to be told but what could i do if we had refused we might have had to go out of office  franklyn precisely  burge well could we desert the country at such a crisis the hun was at the gate everyone has to make sacrifices for the sake of the country at such moments we had to rise above party and i am proud to say we never gave party a second thought we stuck to  conrad office  surge turning on him yes sir to office that is to responsibility to danger to heartsickening toil to abuse and misunderstanding to a martyrdom that made us envy the very soldiers in the trenches if you had had to live for months on aspirin and bromide of potassium to get a wink of sleep you wouldnt talk about office as if it were a catch  franklyn still you admit that under our parliamentary system lubin could not have helped himself  burge on that subject my lips are closed nothing will induce me to say one word against the old man i never have and i never will lubin is old he has never been a real statesman he is as lazy as a cat on a hearthrug you cant get him to attend to anything he is good for nothing but getting up and making speeches with a peroration that goes down with the back benches but i say nothing against him i gather that you do not think much of me as a statesman but at all events i can get things done i can hustle even you will admit that but lubin oh my stars lubin if you only knew  the parlor maid opens the door and announces a visitor  the parlor maid mr lubin  surge bounding from his chair lubin is this a conspiracy  they all rise in amazement staring at the door lubin enters a man at the end of his sixties a yorkshireman with the last traces of scandinavian flax still in his white hair undistinguished in stature unassuming in his manner and taking his simple dignity for granted but wonderfully comfortable and quite selfassured in contrast to the intellectual restlessness of franklyn and the mesmeric selfassertiveness of burge his presence suddenly brings out the fact that they are unhappy men ill at ease square pegs in round holes whilst he flourishes like a primrose  the parlor maid withdraws  lubin coming to franklyn how do you do mr barnabas he speaks very comfortably and kindly much as if he were the host and franklyn an embarrassed but welcome guest i had the pleasure of meeting you once at the mansion house i think it was to celebrate the conclusion of the hundred years peace with america  franklyn shaking hands it was long before that a meeting about venezuela when we were on the point of going to war with america  lubin not at all put out yes you are quite right i knew it was something about america he pats franklyns hand and how have you been all this time well eh  franklyn smiling to soften the sarcasm a few vicissitudes of health naturally in so long a time  lubin just so just so looking round at savvy the young lady is  franklyn my daughter savvy  savvy comes from the window between her father and lubin  lubin taking her hand affectionately in both his and why has she never come to see us  burge i dont know whether you have noticed lubin that i am present  savvy takes advantage of this diversion to slip away to the settee where she is stealthily joined by haslam who sits down on her left  lubin seating himself in burges chair with ineffable comfortableness my dear burge if you imagine that it is possible to be within ten miles of your energetic presence without being acutely aware of it you do yourself the greatest injustice how are you and how are your good newspaper friends burge makes an explosive movement but lubin goes on calmly and sweetly and what are you doing here with my old friend barnabas if i may ask  burge sitting down in conrads chair leaving him standing uneasily in the corner well just what you are doing if you want to know i am trying to enlist mr barnabass valuable support for my party  lubin your party eh the newspaper party  burge the liberal party the party of which i have the honor to be leader  lubin have you now thats very interesting for i thought i was the leader of the liberal party however it is very kind of you to take it off my hands if the party will let you  burge do you suggest that i have not the support and confidence of the party  lubin i dont suggest anything my dear burge mr barnabas will tell you that we all think very highly of you the country owes you a great deal during the war you did very creditably over the munitions and if you were not quite so successful with the peace nobody doubted that you meant well  burge very kind of you lubin let me remark that you cannot lead a progressive party without getting a move on  lubin you mean you cannot i did it for ten years without the least difficulty and very comfortable prosperous pleasant years they were  burge yes but what did they end in  lubin in you burge you dont complain of that do you  burge fiercely in plague pestilence and famine battle murder and sudden death  lubin with an appreciative chuckle the nonconformist can quote the prayerbook for his own purposes i see how you enjoyed yourself over that business burge do you remember the knockout blow  burge it came off dont forget that do you remember fighting to the last drop of your blood  lubin unruffled to franklyn by the way i remember your brother conrada wonderful brain and a dear good fellowexplaining to me that i couldnt fight to the last drop of my blood because i should be dead long before i came to it most interesting and quite true he was introduced to me at a meeting where the suffragettes kept disturbing me they had to be carried out kicking and making a horrid disturbance  conrad no it was later at a meeting to support the franchise bill which gave them the vote  lubin discovering conrads presence for the first time youre right it was i knew it had something to do with women my memory never deceives me thank you will you introduce me to this gentleman barnabas  conrad not at all affably i am the conrad in question he sits down in dudgeon on the vacant chippendale  lubin are you looking at him pleasantly yes of course you are i never forget a face but with an arch turn of his eyes to savvy your pretty niece engaged all my powers of vision  burge i wish youd be serious lubin god knows we have passed through times terrible enough to make any man serious  lubin i do not think i need to be reminded of that in peace time i used to keep myself fresh for my work by banishing all worldly considerations from my mind on sundays but war has no respect for the sabbath and there have been sundays within the last few years on which i have had to play as many as sixtysix games of bridge to keep my mind off the news from the front  burge scandalized sixtysix games of bridge on sunday  lubin you probably sang sixtysix hymns but as i cannot boast either your admirable voice or your spiritual fervor i had to fall back on bridge  franklyn if i may go back to the subject of your visit it seems to me that you may both be completely superseded by the labor party  burge but i am in the truest sense myself a labor leader ihe stops as lubin has risen with a halfsuppressed yawn and is already talking calmly but without a pretence of interest  lubin the labor party oh no mr barnabas no no no no no he moves in savvys direction there will be no trouble about that of course we must give them a few seats more i quite admit than we should have dreamt of leaving to them before the war butby this time he has reached the sofa where savvy and haslam are seated he sits down between them takes her hand and drops the subject of labor well my dear young lady what is the latest news whats going on have you seen shoddys new play tell me all about it and all about the latest books and all about everything  savvy you have not met mr haslam our rector  lubin who has quite overlooked haslam never heard of him is he any good  franklyn i was introducing him this is mr haslam  haslam how dye do  lubin i beg your pardon mr haslam delighted to meet you to savvy well now how many books have you written  savvy rather overwhelmed but attracted none i dont write  lubin you dont say so well what do you do music skirtdancing  savvy i dont do anything  lubin thank god you and i were born for one another who is your favorite poet sally  savvy savvy  lubin savvy i never heard of him tell me all about him keep me up to date  savvy its not a poet i am savvy not sally  lubin savvy thats a funny name and very pretty savvy it sounds chinese what does it mean  conrad short for savage  lubin patting her hand la belle sauvage  haslam rising and surrendering savvy to lubin by crossing to the fireplace i suppose the church is out of it as far as progressive politics are concerned  burge nonsense that notion about the church being unprogressive is one of those shibboleths that our party must drop the church is all right essentially get rid of the establishment get rid of the bishops get rid of the candlesticks get rid of the 39 articles and the church of england is just as good as any other church and i dont care who hears me say so  lubin it doesnt matter a bit who hears you say so my dear burge to savvy who did you say your favorite poet was  savvy i dont make pets of poets whos yours  lubin horace  savvy horace who  lubin quintus horatius flaccus the noblest roman of them all my dear  savvy oh if he is dead that explains it i have a theory that all the dead people we feel especially interested in must have been ourselves you must be horaces reincarnation  lubin delighted that is the very most charming and penetrating and intelligent thing that has ever been said to me barnabas will you exchange daughters with me i can give you your choice of two  franklyn man proposes savvy disposes  lubin what does savvy say  burge lubin i came here to talk politics  lubin yes you have only one subject burge i came here to talk to savvy take burge into the next room barnabas and let him rip  burge halfangry halfindulgent no but really lubin we are at a crisis  lubin my dear burge life is a disease and the only difference between one man and another is the stage of the disease at which he lives you are always at the crisis i am always in the convalescent stage i enjoy convalescence it is the part that makes the illness worth while  savvy halfrising perhaps id better run away i am distracting you  lubin making her sit down again not at all my dear you are only distracting burge jolly good thing for him to be distracted by a pretty girl just what he needs  burge i sometimes envy you lubin the great movement of mankind the giant sweep of the ages passes you by and leaves you standing  lubin it leaves me sitting and quite comfortable thank you go on sweeping when you are tired of it come back and you will find england where it was and me in my accustomed place with miss savvy telling me all sorts of interesting things  savvy who has been growing more and more restless dont let him shut you up mr burge you know mr lubin i am frightfully interested in the labor movement and in theosophy and in reconstruction after the war and all sorts of things i daresay the flappers in your smart set are tremendously flattered when you sit beside them and are nice to them as you are being nice to me but i am not smart and i am no use as a flapper i am dowdy and serious i want you to be serious if you refuse i shall go and sit beside mr burge and ask him to hold my hand  lubin he wouldnt know how to do it my dear burge has a reputation as a profligate  burge starting lubin this is monstrous i  lubin continuingbut he is really a model of domesticity his name is coupled with all the most celebrated beauties but for him there is only one woman and that is not you my dear but his very charming wife  burge you are destroying my character in the act of pretending to save it have the goodness to confine yourself to your own character and your own wife both of them need all your attention  lubin i have the privilege of my age and of my transparent innocence i have not to struggle with your volcanic energy  burge with an immense sense of power no by george  franklyn i think i shall speak both for my brother and myself and possibly also for my daughter if i say that since the object of your visit and mr joyce burges is to some extent political we should hear with great interest something about your political aims mr lubin  lubin assenting with complete good humor and becoming attentive clear and businesslike in his tone by all means mr barnabas what we have to consider first i take it is what prospect there is of our finding you beside us in the house after the next election  franklyn when i speak of politics mr lubin i am not thinking of elections or available seats or party funds or the registers or even i am sorry to have to add of parliament as it exists at present i had much rather you talked about bridge than about electioneering it is the more interesting game of the two  burge he wants to discuss principles lubin  lubin very cool and clear i understand mr barnabas quite well but elections are unsettled things principles are settled things  conrad impatiently great heavens  lubin interrupting him with quiet authority one moment dr barnabas the main principles on which modern civilized society is founded are pretty well understood among educated people that is what our dangerously halfeducated masses and their pet demagoguesif burge will excuse that expression  burge dont mind me go on i shall have something to say presently  lubinthat is what our dangerously halfeducated people do not realize take all this fuss about the labor party with its imaginary new principles and new politics the labor members will find that the immutable laws of political economy take no more notice of their ambitions and aspirations than the law of gravitation i speak if i may say so with knowledge for i have made a special study of the labor question  franklyn with interest and some surprise indeed  lubin yes it occurred quite at the beginning of my career i was asked to deliver an address to the students at the working mens college and i was strongly advised to comply as gladstone and morley and others were doing that sort of thing at the moment it was rather a troublesome job because i had not gone into political economy at the time as you know at the university i was a classical scholar and my profession was the law but i looked up the textbooks and got up the case most carefully i found that the correct view is that all this trade unionism and socialism and so forth is founded on the ignorant delusion that wages and the production and distribution of wealth can be controlled by legislation or by any human action whatever they obey fixed scientific laws which have been ascertained and settled finally by the highest economic authorities naturally i do not at this distance of time remember the exact process of reasoning but i can get up the case again at any time in a couple of days and you may rely on me absolutely should the occasion arise to deal with all these ignorant and unpractical people in a conclusive and convincing way except of course as far as it may be advisable to indulge and flatter them a little so as to let them down without creating ill feeling in the workingclass electorate in short i can get that lecture up again almost at a moments notice  savvy but mr lubin i have had a university education too and all this about wages and distribution being fixed by immutable laws of political economy is obsolete rot  franklyn shocked oh my dear that is not polite  lubin no no no dont scold her she mustnt be scolded to savvy i understand you are a disciple of karl marx  savvy no no karl marxs economics are all rot  lubin at last a little taken aback dear me  savvy you must excuse me mr lubin but its like hearing a man talk about the garden of eden  conrad why shouldnt he talk about the garden of eden it was a first attempt at biology anyhow  lubin recovering his selfpossession i am sound on the garden of eden i have heard of darwin  savvy but darwin is all rot  lubin what already  savvy its no good your smiling at me like a cheshire cat mr lubin and i am not going to sit here mumchance like an oldfashioned goody goody wife while you men monopolize the conversation and pay out the very ghastliest exploded drivel as the latest thing in politics i am not giving you my own ideas mr lubin but just the regular orthodox science of today only the most awful old fossils think that socialism is bad economics and that darwin invented evolution ask papa ask uncle ask the first person you meet in the street she rises and crosses to haslam give me a cigaret bill will you  haslam priceless he complies  franklyn savvy has not lived long enough to have any manners mr lubin but that is where you stand with the younger generation dont smoke dear  savvy with a shrug of rather mutinous resignation throws the cigaret into the fire haslam on the point of lighting one for himself changes his mind  lubin shrewd and serious mr barnabas i confess i am surprised and i will not pretend that i am convinced but i am open to conviction i may be wrong  burge in a burst of irony oh no impossible impossible  lubin yes mr barnabas though i do not possess burges genius for being always wrong i have been in that position once or twice i could not conceal from you even if i wished to that my time has been so completely filled by my professional work as a lawyer and later on by my duties as leader of the house of commons in the days when prime ministers were also leaders  burge stung not to mention bridge and smart society  lubinnot to mention the continual and trying effort to make burge behave himself that i have not been able to keep my academic reading up to date i have kept my classics brushed up out of sheer love for them but my economics and my science such as they were may possibly be a little rusty yet i think i may say that if you and your brother will be so good as to put me on the track of the necessary documents i will undertake to put the case to the house or to the country to your entire satisfaction you see as long as you can shew these troublesome halfeducated people who want to turn the world upside down that they are talking nonsense it really does not matter very much whether you do it in terms of what miss barnabas calls obsolete rot or in terms of what her granddaughter will probably call unmitigated tosh i have no objection whatever to denounce karl marx anything i can say against darwin will please a large body of sincerely pious voters if it will be easier to carry on the business of the country on the understanding that the present state of things is to be called socialism i have no objection in the world to call it socialism there is the precedent of the emperor constantine who saved the society of his own day by agreeing to call his imperialism christianity mind i must not go ahead of the electorate you must not call a voter a socialist until  franklyn until he is a socialist agreed  lubin oh not at all you need not wait for that you must not call him a socialist until he wishes to be called a socialist that is all surely you would not say that i must not address my constituents as gentlemen until they are gentlemen i address them as gentlemen because they wish to be so addressed he rises from the sofa and goes to franklyn placing a reassuring hand on his shoulder do not be afraid of socialism mr barnabas you need not tremble for your property or your position or your dignity england will remain what england is no matter what new political names may come into vogue i do not intend to resist the transition to socialism you may depend on me to guide it to lead it to give suitable expression to its aspirations and to steer it clear of utopian absurdities i can honestly ask for your support on the most advanced socialist grounds no less than on the soundest liberal ones  burge in short lubin youre incorrigible you dont believe anything is going to change the millions are still to toilthe peoplemy peoplefor i am a man of the people  lubin interrupting him contemptuously dont be ridiculous burge you are a country solicitor further removed from the people more foreign to them more jealous of letting them up to your level than any duke or any archbishop  burge hotly i deny it you think i have never been poor you think i have never cleaned my own boots you think my fingers have never come out through the soles when i was cleaning them you think  lubin i think you fall into the very common mistake of supposing that it is poverty that makes the proletarian and money that makes the gentleman you are quite wrong you never belonged to the people you belonged to the impecunious impecuniosity and broken boots are the lot of the unsuccessful middle class and the commonplaces of the early struggles of the professional and younger son class i defy you to find a farm laborer in england with broken boots call a mechanic one of the poor and hell punch your head when you talk to your constituents about the toiling millions they dont consider that you are referring to them they are all third cousins of somebody with a title or a park i am a yorkshireman my friend i know england and you dont if you did you would know  surge what do you know that i dont know  lubin i know that we are taking up too much of mr barnabass time franklyn rises may i take it my dear barnabas that i may count on your support if we succeed in forcing an election before the new register is in full working order  surge rising also may the party count on your support i say nothing about myself can the party depend on you is there any question of yours that i have left unanswered   conrad we havnt asked you any you know  burge may i take that as a mark of confidence  conrad if i were a laborer in your constituency i should ask you a biological question  lubin no you wouldnt my dear doctor laborers never ask questions  burge ask it now i have never flinched from being heckled out with it is it about the land  conrad no  surge is it about the church  conrad no  burge is it about the house of lords  conrad no  burge is it about proportional representation  conrad no  surge is it about free trade  conrad no  surge is it about the priest in the school  conrad no  burge is it about ireland  conrad no  burge is it about germany  conrad no  burge well is it about republicanism come i wont flinch is it about the monarchy  conrad no  surge well what the devil is it about then  conrad you understand that i am asking the question in the character of a laborer who earned thirteen shillings a week before the war and earns thirty now when he can get it  burge yes i understand that i am ready for you out with it  conrad and whom you propose to represent n parliament  surge yes yes yes come on  conrad the question is this would you allow your son to marry my daughter or your daughter to marry my son  burge taken aback oh come thats not a political question  conrad then as a biologist i dont take the slightest interest in your politics and i shall not walk across the street to vote for you or anyone else at the election good evening  lubin serve you right burge dr barnabas you have my assurance that my daughter shall marry the man of her choice whether he be lord or laborer may i count on your support  surge hurling the epithet at him humbug  savvy stop they all stop short in the movement of leavetaking to look at her daddy are you going to let them off like this how are they to know anything if nobody ever tells them if you dont i will  conrad you cant you didnt read my book and you know nothing about it you just hold your tongue  savvy i just wont nunk i shall have a vote when i am thirty and i ought to have it now why are these two ridiculous people to be allowed to come in and walk over us as if the world existed only to play their silly parliamentary game  franklyn severely savvy you really must not be uncivil to our guests  savvy im sorry but mr lubin didnt stand on much ceremony with me did he and mr burge hasnt addressed a single word to me im not going to stand it you and nunk have a much better program than either of them its the only one we are going to vote for and they ought to be told about it for the credit of the family and the good of their own souls you just tip them a chapter from the gospel of the brothers barnabas daddy  lubin and burge turn inquiringly to franklyn suspecting a move to form a new party  franklyn it is quite true mr lubin that i and my brother have a little program of our own which  conrad interrupting its not a little program its an almighty big one its not our own its the program of the whole of civilization  burge then why split the party before you have put it to us for gods sake let us have no more splits i am here to learn i am here to gather your opinions and represent them i invite you to put your views before me i offer myself to be heckled you have asked me only an absurd nonpolitical question  franklyn candidly i fear our program will be thrown away on you it would not interest you  burge with challenging audacity try lubin can go if he likes but i am still open to new ideas if only i can find them  franklyn to lubin are you prepared to listen mr lubin or shall i thank you for your very kind and welcome visit and say good evening  lubin sitting down resignedly on the settee but involuntarily making a movement which looks like the stifling of a yawn with pleasure mr barnabas of course you know that before i can adopt any new plank in the party platform it will have to reach me through the national liberal federation which you can approach through your local liberal and radical association  franklyn i could recall to you several instances of the addition to your party program of measures of which no local branch of your federation had ever dreamt but i understand that you are not really interested i will spare you and drop the subject  lubin waking up a little you quite misunderstand me please do not take it in that way i only  burge talking him down never mind the federation i will answer for the federation go on barnabas go on never mind lubin he sits down in the chair from which lubin first displaced him  franklyn our program is only that the term of human life shall be extended to three hundred years  lubin softly eh  burge explosively what  savvy our election cry is back to methuselah  haslam priceless  lubin and surge look at one another  conrad no we are not mad  savvy theyre not joking either they mean it  lubin cautiously assuming that in some sense which i am for the moment unable to fathom you are in earnest mr barnabas may i ask what this has to do with politics  franklyn the connection is very evident you are now mr lubin within immediate reach of your seventieth year mr joyce surge is your junior by about eleven years you will go down to posterity as one of a european group of immature statesmen and monarchs who doing the very best for your respective countries of which you were capable succeeded in allbutwrecking the civilization of europe and did in effect wipe out of existence many millions of its inhabitants  burge less than a million  franklyn that was our loss alone  burge oh if you count foreigners  has lam god counts foreigners you know  savvy with intense satisfaction well said bill  franklyn i am not blaming you your task was beyond human capacity what with our huge armaments our terrible engines of destruction our systems of coercion manned by an irresistible police you were called on to control powers so gigantic that one shudders at the thought of their being entrusted even to an infinitely experienced and benevolent god much less to mortal men whose whole life does not last a hundred years  burge we won the war dont forget that  franklyn no the soldiers and sailors won it and left you to finish it and you were so utterly incompetent that the multitudes of children slain by hunger in the first years of peace made us all wish we were at war again  conrad its no use arguing about it it is now absolutely certain that the political and social problems raised by our civilization cannot be solved by mere human mushrooms who decay and die when they are just beginning to have a glimmer of the wisdom and knowledge needed for their own government  lubin quite an interesting idea doctor extravagant fantastic but quite interesting when i was young i used to feel my human limitations very acutely  burge god knows i have often felt that i could not go on if it had not been for the sense that i was only an instrument in the hands of a power above us  conrad im glad you both agree with us and with one another  lubin i have not gone so far as that i think after all we have had many very able political leaders even within your recollection and mine  franklyn have you read the recent biographiesdilkes for instancewhich revealed the truth about them  lubin i did not discover any new truth revealed in these books mr barnabas  franklyn what not the truth that england was governed all that time by a little woman who knew her own mind  savvy hear hear  lubin that often happens which woman do you mean  franklyn queen victoria to whom your prime ministers stood in the relation of naughty children whose heads she knocked together when their tempers and quarrels became intolerable within thirteen years of her death europe became a hell  surge quite true that was because she was piously brought up and regarded herself as an instrument if a statesman remembers that he is only an instrument and feels quite sure that he is rightly interpreting the divine purpose he will come out all right you know  franklyn the kaiser felt like that did he come out all right  surge well let us be fair even to the kaiser let us be fair  franklyn were you fair to him when you won an election on the program of hanging him  surge stuff i am the last man alive to hang anybody but the people wouldnt listen to reason besides i knew the dutch wouldnt give him up  savvy oh dont start arguing about poor old bill stick to our point let these two gentlemen settle the question for themselves mr burge do you think mr lubin is fit to govern england  surge no frankly i dont  lubin remonstrant really  conrad why  burge because he has no conscience thats why  lubin shocked and amazed oh  franklyn mr lubin do you consider joyce burge qualified to govern england  lubin with dignified emotion wounded but without bitterness excuse me mr barnabas but before i answer that question i want to say this burge we have had differences of opinion and your newspaper friends have said hard things of me but we worked together for years and i hope i have done nothing to justify you in the amazing accusation you have just brought against me do you realize that you said that i have no conscience  burge lubin i am very accessible to an appeal to my emotions and you are very cunning in making such appeals i will meet you to this extent i dont mean that you are a bad man i dont mean that i dislike you in spite of your continual attempts to discourage and depress me but you have a mind like a lookingglass you are very clear and smooth and lucid as to what is standing in front of you but you have no foresight and no hindsight you have no vision and no memory you have no continuity and a man without continuity can have neither conscience nor honor from one day to another the result is that you have always been a damned bad minister and you have sometimes been a damned bad friend now you can answer barnabass question and take it out of me to your hearts content he asked you was i fit to govern england  lubin recovering himself after what has just passed i sincerely wish i could honestly say yes burge but it seems to me that you have condemned yourself out of your own mouth you represent something which has had far too much influence and popularity in this country since joseph chamberlain set the fashion and that is mere energy without intellect and without knowledge your mind is not a trained mind it has not been stored with the best information nor cultivated by intercourse with educated minds at any of our great seats of learning as i happen to have enjoyed that advantage it follows that you do not understand my mind candidly i think that disqualifies you the peace found out your weaknesses  burge oh what did it find out in you  lubin you and your newspaper confederates took the peace out of my hands the peace did not find me out because it did not find me in  franklyn come confess both of you you were only flies on the wheel the war went englands way but the peace went its own way and not englands way nor any of the ways you had so glibly appointed for it your peace treaty was a scrap of paper before the ink dried on it the statesmen of europe were incapable of governing europe what they needed was a couple of hundred years training and experience what they had actually had was a few years at the bar or in a countinghouse or on the grouse moors and golf courses and now we are waiting with monster cannons trained on every city and seaport and huge aeroplanes ready to spring into the air and drop bombs every one of which will obliterate a whole street and poison gases that will strike multitudes dead with a breath until one of you gentlemen rises in his helplessness to tell us who are as helpless as himself that we are at war again  conrad aha what consolation will it be for us then that you two are able to tell off one anothers defects so cleverly in your afternoon chat  burge angrily if you come to that what consolation will it be that you two can sit there and tell both of us off you who have had no responsibility you who havnt lifted a finger as far as i know to help us through this awful crisis which has left me ten years older than my proper age can you tell me a single thing you did to help us during the whole infernal business  conrad were not blaming you you hadnt lived long enough no more had we cant you see that threescoreandten though it may be long enough for a very crude sort of village life isnt long enough for a complicated civilization like ours flinders petrie has counted nine attempts at civilization made by people exactly like us and every one of them failed just as ours is failing they failed because the citizens and statesmen died of old age or overeating before they had grown out of schoolboy games and savage sports and cigars and champagne the signs of the end are always the same democracy socialism and votes for women we shall go to smash within the lifetime of men now living unless we recognize that we must live longer  lubin i am glad you agree with me that socialism and votes for women are signs of decay  franklyn not at all they are only the difficulties that overtax your capacity if you cannot organize socialism you cannot organize civilized life and you will relapse into barbarism accordingly  savvy hear hear  surge a useful point we cannot put back the clock  haslam i can ive often done it  lubin tut tut my dear burge what are you dreaming of mr barnabas i am a very patient man but will you tell me what earthly use or interest there is in a conclusion that cannot be realized i grant you that if we could live three hundred years we should all be perhaps wiser certainly older you will grant me in return i hope that if the sky fell we should all catch larks  franklyn your turn now conrad go ahead  conrad i dont think its any good i dont think they want to live longer than usual  lubin although i am a mere child of 69 i am old enough to have lost the habit of crying for the moon  burge have you discovered the elixir of life or have you not if not i agree with lubin that you are wasting our time  conrad is your time of any value  surge unable to believe his ears my time of any value what do you mean  lubin smiling comfortably from your high scientific point of view i daresay none whatever professor in any case i think a little perfectly idle discussion would do burge good after all we might as well hear about the elixir of life as read novels or whatever burge does when he is not playing golf on walton heath what is your elixir dr barnabas lemons sour milk or what is the latest  surge we were just beginning to talk seriously and now you snatch at the chance of talking rot he rises good evening he turns to the door  conrad rudely die as soon as you like good evening  burge hesitating look here i took sour milk twice a day until metchnikoff died he thought it would keep him alive for ever and he died of it  conrad you might as well have taken sour beer  burge you believe in lemons  conrad i wouldnt eat a lemon for ten pounds  burge sitting down again what do you recommend  conrad rising with a gesture of despair whats the use of going on frank because i am a doctor and because they think i have a bottle to give them that will make them live for ever they are listening to me for the first time with their mouths open and their eyes shut thats their notion of science  savvy steady nunk hold the fort  conrad growls and sits down  lubin you volunteered the consultation doctor i may tell you that far from sharing the credulity as to science which is now the fashion i am prepared to demonstrate that during the last fifty years though the church has often been wrong and even the liberal party has not been infallible the men of science have always been wrong  conrad yes the fellows you call men of science the people who make money by it and their medical hangerson but has anybody been right  lubin the poets and story tellers especially the classical poets and story tellers have been in the main right i will ask you not to repeat this as my opinion outside for the vote of the medical profession and its worshippers is not to be trifled with  franklyn you are quite right the poem is our real clue to biological science the most scientific document we possess at present is as your grandmother would have told you quite truly the story of the garden of eden  burge pricking up his ears whats that if you can establish that barnabas i am prepared to hear you out with my very best attention i am listening go on  franklyn well you remember dont you that in the garden of eden adam and eve were not created mortal and that natural death as we call it was not a part of life but a later and quite separate invention  surge now you mention it thats true death came afterwards  lubin what about accidental death that was always possible  franklyn precisely adam and eve were hung up between two frightful possibilities one was the extinction of mankind by their accidental death the other was the prospect of living for ever they could bear neither they decided that they would just take a short turn of a thousand years and meanwhile hand on their work to a new pair consequently they had to invent natural birth and natural death which are after all only modes of perpetuating life without putting on any single creature the terrible burden of immortality  lubin i see the old must make room for the new  surge death is nothing but making room thats all there is in it or ever has been in it  franklyn yes but the old must not desert their posts until the new are ripe for them they desert them now two hundred years too soon  savvy i believe the old people are the new people reincarnated nunk i suspect i am eve i am very fond of apples and they always disagree with me  conrad you are eve in a sense the eternal life persists only it wears out its bodies and minds and gets new ones like new clothes you are only a new hat and frock on eve  franklyn yes bodies and minds ever better and better fitted to carry out its eternal pursuit  lubin with quiet scepticism what pursuit may one ask mr barnabas  franklyn the pursuit of omnipotence and omniscience greater power and greater knowledge these are what we are all pursuing even at the risk of our lives and the sacrifice of our pleasures evolution is that pursuit and nothing else it is the path to godhead a man differs from a microbe only in being further on the path  lubin and how soon do you expect this modest end to be reached  franklyn never thank god as there is no limit to power and knowledge there can be no end the power and the glory world without end have those words meant nothing to you  burge pulling out an old envelope i should like to make a note of that he does so  conrad there will always be something to live for  surge pocketing his envelope and becoming more and more businesslike right i have got that now what about sin what about the fall how do you work them in  conrad i dont work in the fall the fall is outside science but i daresay frank can work it in for you  surge to franklyn i wish you would you know its important very important  franklyn well consider it this way it is clear that when adam and eve were immortal it was necessary that they should make the earth an extremely comfortable place to live in  burge true if you take a house on a ninetynine years lease you spend a good deal of money on it if you take it for three months you generally have a bill for dilapidations to pay at the end of them  franklyn just so consequently when adam had the garden of eden on a lease for ever he took care to make it what the house agents call a highly desirable country residence but the moment he invented death and became a tenant for life only the place was no longer worth the trouble it was then that he let the thistles grow life was so short that it was no longer worth his while to do anything thoroughly well  burge do you think that is enough to constitute what an average elector would consider a fall is it tragic enough  franklyn that is only the first step of the fall adam did not fall down that step only he fell down a whole flight for instance before he invented birth he dared not have lost his temper for if he had killed eve he would have been lonely and barren to all eternity but when he invented birth and anyone who was killed could be replaced he could afford to let himself go he undoubtedly invented wifebeating and that was another step down one of his sons invented meateating the other was horrified at the innovation with the ferocity which is still characteristic of bulls and other vegetarians he slew his beefsteakeating brother and thus invented murder that was a very steep step it was so exciting that all the others began to kill one another for sport and thus invented war the steepest step of all they even took to killing animals as a means of killing time and then of course ate them to save the long and difficult labor of agriculture i ask you to contemplate our fathers as they came crashing down all the steps of this jacobs ladder that reached from paradise to a hell on earth in which they had multiplied the chances of death from violence accident and disease until they could hardly count on three score and ten years of life much less the thousand that adam had been ready to face with that picture before you will you now ask me where was the fall you might as well stand at the foot of snowdon and ask me where is the mountain the very children see it so plainly that they compress its history into a two line epic       old daddy long legs wouldnt say his prayers     take him by the hind legs and throw him downstairs   lubin still immovably sceptical and what does science say to this fairy tale doctor barnabas surely science knows nothing of genesis or of adam and eve  conrad then it isnt science thats all science has to account for everything and everything includes the bible  franklyn the book of genesis is a part of nature like any other part of nature the fact that the tale of the garden of eden has survived and held the imagination of men spellbound for centuries whilst hundreds of much more plausible and amusing stories have gone out of fashion and perished like last years popular song is a scientific fact and science is bound to explain it you tell me that science knows nothing of it then science is more ignorant than the children at any village school  conrad of course if you think it more scientific to say that what we are discussing is not adam and eve and eden but the phylogeny of the blastoderm  savvy you neednt swear nunk  conrad shut up you i am not swearing to lubin if you want the professional humbug of rewriting the bible in words of four syllables and pretending its something new i can humbug you to your hearts content i can call genesis phylogenesis let the creator say if you like i will establish an antipathetic symbiosis between thee and the female and between thy blastoderm and her blastoderm nobody will understand you and savvy will think you are swearing the meaning is the same  haslam priceless but its quite simple the one version is poetry the other is science  franklyn the one is classroom jargon the other is inspired human language  lubin calmly reminiscent one of the few modern authors into whom i have occasionally glanced is rousseau who was a sort of deist like burge  burge interrupting him forcibly lubin has this stupendously important communication which professor barnabas has just made to us a communication for which i shall be indebted to him all my life long has this i say no deeper effect on you than to set you pulling my leg by trying to make out that i am an infidel  lubin its very interesting and amusing burge and i think i see a case in it i think i could undertake to argue it in an ecclesiastical court but important is hardly a word i should attach to it  burge good god here is this professor a man utterly removed from the turmoil of our political life devoted to pure learning in its most abstract phases and i solemnly declare he is the greatest politician the most inspired party leader in the kingdom i take off my hat to him i joyce burge give him best and you sit there purring like an angora cat and can see nothing in it  conrad opening his eyes widely hallo what have i done to deserve this tribute  surge done you have put the liberal party into power for the next thirty years doctor thats what youve done  conrad god forbid  burge its all up with the church now thanks to you we go to the country with one cry and one only back to the bible think of the effect on the nonconformist vote you gather that in with one hand and you gather in the modern scientific sceptical professional vote with the other the village atheist and the first cornet in the local salvation army band meet on the village green and shake hands you take your school children your bible class under the cowpertemple clause into the museum you shew the kids the piltdown skull and you say thats adam thats eves husband you take the spectacled science student from the laboratory in owens college and when he asks you for a truly scientific history of evolution you put into his hand the pilgrims progress yousavvy and haslam explode into shrieks of merriment what are you two laughing at  savvy oh go on mr burge dont stop  haslam priceless  franklyn would thirty years of office for the liberal party seem so important to you mr burge if you had another two and a half centuries to live  burge decisively no you will have to drop that part of it the constituencies wont swallow it  lubin seriously i am not so sure of that burge i am not sure that it may not prove the only point they will swallow  burge it will be no use to us even if they do its not a party point its as good for the other side as for us  lubin not necessarily if we get in first with it it will be associated in the public mind with our party suppose i put it forward as a plank in our program that we advocate the extension of human life to three hundred years dunreen as leader of the opposite party will be bound to oppose me to denounce me as a visionary and so forth by doing so he will place himself in the position of wanting to rob the people of two hundred and thirty years of their natural life the unionists will become the party of premature death and we shall become the longevity party  burge shaken you really think the electorate would swallow it  lubin my dear burge is there anything the electorate will not swallow if it is judiciously put to them but we must make sure of our ground we must have the support of the men of science is there serious agreement among them doctor as to the possibility of such an evolution as you have described  conrad yes ever since the reaction against darwin set in at the beginning of the present century all scientific opinion worth counting has been converging rapidly upon creative evolution  franklyn poetry has been converging on it philosophy has been converging on it religion has been converging on it it is going to be the religion of the twentieth century a religion that has its intellectual roots in philosophy and science just as medieval christianity had its intellectual roots in aristotle  lubin but surely any change would be so extremely gradual that  conrad dont deceive yourself its only the politicians who improve the world so gradually that nobody can see the improvement the notion that nature does not proceed by jumps is only one of the budget of plausible lies that we call classical education nature always proceeds by jumps she may spend twenty thousand years making up her mind to jump but when she makes it up at last the jump is big enough to take us into a new age  lubin impressed fancy my being leader of the party for the next three hundred years  burge what  lubin perhaps hard on some of the younger men i think in fairness i shall have to step aside to make room after another century or so that is if mimi can be persuaded to give up downing street  burge this is too much your colossal conceit blinds you to the most obvious necessity of the political situation  lubin you mean my retirement i really cannot see that it is a necessity i could not see it when i was almost an old manor at least an elderly one now that it appears that i am a young man the case for it breaks down completely to conrad may i ask are there any alternative theories is there a scientific opposition  conrad well some authorities hold that the human race is a failure and that a new form of life better adapted to high civilization will supersede us as we have superseded the ape and the elephant  burge the superman eh  conrad no some being quite different from us  lubin is that altogether desirable  franklyn i fear so however that may be we may be quite sure of one thing we shall not be let alone the force behind evolution call it what you will is determined to solve the problem of civilization and if it cannot do it through us it will produce some more capable agents man is not gods last word god can still create if you cannot do his work he will produce some being who can  burge with zealous reverence what do we know about him barnabas what does anyone know about him  conrad we know this about him with absolute certainty the power my brother calls god proceeds by the method of trial and error and if we turn out to be one of the errors we shall go the way of the mastodon and the megatherium and all the other scrapped experiments  lubin rising and beginning to walk up and down the room with his considering cap on i admit that i am impressed gentlemen i will go so far as to say that your theory is likely to prove more interesting than ever welsh disestablishment was but as a practical politicianhm eh burge  conrad we are not practical politicians we are out to get something done practical politicians are people who have mastered the art of using parliament to prevent anything being done  franklyn when we get matured statesmen and citizens  lubin stopping short citizens oh are the citizens to live three hundred years as well as the statesmen  conrad of course  lubin i confess that had not occurred to me he sits down abruptly evidently very unfavorably affected by this new light  savvy and haslam look at one another with unspeakable feelings  burge do you think it would be wise to go quite so far at first surely it would be more prudent to begin with the best men  franklyn you need not be anxious about that it will begin with the best men  lubin i am glad to hear you say so you see we must put this into a practical parliamentary shape  burge we shall have to draft a bill that is the long and the short of it until you have your bill drafted you dont know what you are really doing that is my experience  lubin quite so my idea is that whilst we should interest the electorate in this as a sort of religious aspiration and personal hope using it at the same time to remove their prejudices against those of us who are getting on in years it would be in the last degree upsetting and even dangerous to enable everyone to live longer than usual take the mere question of the manufacture of the specific whatever it may be there are forty millions of people in the country let me assume for the sake of illustration that each person would have to consume say five ounces a day of the elixir that would belet me seefive times three hundred and sixtyfive isumtwentyfivethirtytwoeighteeneighteen hundred and twentyfive ounces a year just two ounces over the hundredweight  burge two million tons a year in round numbers of stuff that everyone would clamor for that men would trample down women and children in the streets to get at you couldnt produce it there would be blue murder its out of the question we must keep the actual secret to ourselves  conrad staring at them the actual secret what on earth is the man talking about  burge the stuff the powder the bottle the tabloid whatever it is you said it wasnt lemons  conrad my good sir i have no powder no bottle no tabloid i am not a quack i am a biologist this is a thing thats going to happen  lubin completely let down going to happen oh is that all he looks at his watch  burge going to happen what do you mean do you mean that you cant make it happen  conrad no more than i could have made you happen  franklyn we can put it into mens heads that there is nothing to prevent its happening but their own will to die before their work is done and their own ignorance of the splendid work there is for them to do  conrad spread that knowledge and that conviction and as surely as the sun will rise tomorrow the thing will happen  franklyn we dont know where or when or to whom it will happen it may happen first to someone in this room  haslam it wont happen to me thats jolly sure  conrad it might happen to anyone it might happen to the parlor maid how do we know  savvy the parlor maid oh thats nonsense nunk  lubin once more quite comfortable i think miss savvy has delivered the final verdict  burge do you mean to say that you have nothing more practical to offer than the mere wish to live longer why if people could live by merely wishing to we should all be living for ever already everybody would like to live for ever why dont they  conrad pshaw everybody would like to have a million of money why havnt they because the men who would like to be millionaires wont save sixpence even with the chance of starvation staring them in the face the men who want to live for ever wont cut off a glass of beer or a pipe of tobacco though they believe the teetotallers and nonsmokers live longer that sort of liking is not willing see what they do when they know they must  franklyn do not mistake mere idle fancies for the tremendous miracleworking force of will nerved to creation by a conviction of necessity i tell you men capable of such willing and realizing its necessity will do it reluctantly under inner compulsion as all great efforts are made they will hide what they are doing from themselves they will take care not to know what they are doing they will live three hundred years not because they would like to but because the soul deep down in them will know that they must if the world is to be saved  lubin turning to franklyn and patting him almost paternally well my dear barnabas for the last thirty years the post has brought me at least once a week a plan from some crank or other for the establishment of the millennium i think you are the maddest of all the cranks but you are much the most interesting i am conscious of a very curious mixture of relief and disappointment in finding that your plan is all moonshine and that you have nothing practical to offer us but what a pity it is such a fascinating idea i think you are too hard on us practical men but there are men in every government even on the front bench who deserve all you say and now before dropping the subject may i put just one question to you an idle question since nothing can come of it but still  franklyn ask your question  lubin why do you fix three hundred years as the exact figure  franklyn because we must fix some figure less would not be enough and more would be more than we dare as yet face  lubin pooh i am quite prepared to face three thousand not to say three million  conrad yes because you dont believe you will be called on to make good your word  franklyn gently also perhaps because you have never been troubled much by vision of the future  burge with intense conviction the future does not exist for henry hopkins lubin  lubin if by the future you mean the millennial delusions which you use as a bunch of carrots to lure the uneducated british donkey to the polling booth to vote for you it certainly does not  surge i can see the future not only because if i may say so in all humility i have been gifted with a certain power of spiritual vision but because i have practised as a solicitor a solicitor has to advise families he has to think of the future and know the past his office is the real modern confessional among other things he has to make peoples wills for them he has to shew them how to provide for their daughters after their deaths has it occurred to you lubin that if you live three hundred years your daughters will have to wait a devilish long time for their money  franklyn the money may not wait for them few investments flourish for three hundred years  savvy and what about before your death suppose they didnt get married imagine a girl living at home with her mother and on her father for three hundred years theyd murder her if she didnt murder them first  lubin by the way barnabas is your daughter to keep her good looks all the time  franklyn will it matter can you conceive the most hardened flirt going on flirting for three centuries at the end of half the time we shall hardly notice whether it is a woman or a man we are speaking to  lubin not quite relishing this ascetic prospect hm he rises ah well you must come and tell my wife and my young people all about it and you will bring your daughter with you of course he shakes hands with savvy goodbye he shakes hands with franklyn goodbye doctor he shakes hands with conrad come on burge you must really tell me what line you are going to take about the church at the election  burge havnt you heard havnt you taken in the revelation that has been vouchsafed to us the line i am going to take is back to methuselah  lubin decisively dont be ridiculous burge you dont suppose do you that our friends here are in earnest or that our very pleasant conversation has had anything to do with practical politics they have just been pulling our legs very wittily come along he goes out franklyn politely going with him but shaking his head in mute protest  burge shaking conrads hand its beyond the old man doctor no spiritual side to him only a sort of classical side that goes down with his own set besides hes done gone past burnt out burst up thinks he is our leader and is only our rag and bottle department but you may depend on me i will work this stunt of yours in i see its value he begins moving towards the door with conrad of course i cant put it exactly in your way but you are quite right about our needing something fresh and i believe an election can be fought on the death rate and on adam and eve as scientific facts it will take the opposition right out of its depth and if we win there will be an om for somebody when the first honors list comes round by this time he has talked himself out of the room and out of earshot conrad accompanying him  savvy and haslam left alone seize each other in an ecstasy of amusement and jazz to the settee where they sit down again side by side  haslam caressing her darling what a priceless humbug old lubin is  savvy oh sweet old thing i love him burge is a flaming fraud if you like  haslam did you notice one thing it struck me as rather curious  savvy what  haslam lubin and your father have both survived the war but their sons were killed in it  savvy sobered yes jims death killed mother  haslam and they never said a word about it  savvy well why should they the subject didnt come up i forgot about it too and i was very fond of jim  haslam i didnt forget it because im of military age and if i hadnt been a parson id have had to go out and be killed too to me the awful thing about their political incompetence was that they had to kill their own sons it was the war casualty lists and the starvation afterwards that finished me up with politics and the church and everything else except you  savvy oh i was just as bad as any of them i sold flags in the streets in my best clothes andhsh she jumps up and pretends to be looking for a book on the shelves behind the settee  franklyn and conrad return looking weary and glum  conrad well thats how the gospel of the brothers barnabas is going to be received he drops into burges chair  franklyn going back to his seat at the table its no use were you convinced mr haslam  haslam about our being able to live three hundred years frankly no  conrad to savvy nor you i suppose  savvy oh i dont know i thought i was for a moment i can believe in a sort of way that people might live for three hundred years but when you came down to tin tacks and said that the parlor maid might then i saw how absurd it was  franklyn just so we had better hold our tongues about it con we should only be laughed at and lose the little credit we earned on false pretences in the days of our ignorance  conrad i daresay but creative evolution doesnt stop while people are laughing laughing may even lubricate its job  savvy what does that mean  conrad it means that the first man to live three hundred years maynt have the slightest notion that he is going to do it and may be the loudest laugher of the lot  savvy or the first woman  conrad assenting or the first woman  haslam well it wont be one of us anyhow  franklyn how do you know  this is unanswerable none of them have anything more to say     part iii  the thing happens   a summer afternoon in the year 2170 ad the official parlor of the president of the british islands a board table long enough for three chairs at each side besides the presidential chair at the head and an ordinary chair at the foot occupies the breadth of the room on the table opposite every chair a small switchboard with a dial there is no fireplace the end wall is a silvery screen nearly as large as a pair of folding doors the door is on your left as you face the screen and there is a row of thick pegs padded and covered with velvet beside it  a stoutish middleaged man goodlooking and breezily genial dressed in a silk smock stockings handsomely ornamented sandals and a gold fillet round his brows comes in he is like joyce burge yet also like lubin as if nature had made a composite photograph of the two men he takes off the fillet and hangs it on a peg then sits down in the presidential chair at the head of the table which is at the end farthest from the door he puts a peg into his switchboard turns the pointer on the dial puts another peg in and presses a button immediately the silvery screen vanishes and in its place appears in reverse from right to left another office similarly furnished with a thin unamiable man similarly dressed but in duller colors turning over some documents at the table his gold fillet is hanging up on a similar peg beside the door he is rather like conrad barnabas but younger and much more commonplace  burgelubin hallo barnabas  barnabas without looking round what number  burgelubin five double x three two gamma burgelubin  barnabas puts a plug in number five turns his pointer to double x and another plug in 32 presses a button and looks round at burgelubin who is now visible to him as well as audible  barnabas curtly oh that you president  burgelubin yes they told me you wanted me to ring you up anything wrong  barnabas harsh and querulous i wish to make a protest  burgelubin goodhumored and mocking what another protest whats wrong now  barnabas if you only knew all the protests i havnt made you would be surprised at my patience it is you who are always treating me with the grossest want of consideration  burgelubin what have i done now  barnabas you have put me down to go to the record office today to receive that american fellow and do the honors of a ridiculous cinema show that is not the business of the accountant general it is the business of the president it is an outrageous waste of my time and an unjustifiable shirking of your duty at my expense i refuse to go you must go  burgelubin my dear boy nothing would give me greater pleasure than to take the job off your hands  barnabas then do it thats all i want he is about to switch off  burgelubin dont switch off listen this american has invented a method of breathing under water  barnabas what do i care i dont want to breathe under water  burgelubin you may my dear barnabas at any time you know you never look where you are going when you are immersed in your calculations some day you will walk into the serpentine this mans invention may save your life  barnabas angrily will you tell me what that has to do with your putting your ceremonial duties on to my shoulders i will not be trifled he vanishes and is replaced by the blank screen  burgelubin indignantly holding down his button dont cut us off please we have not finished i am the president speaking to the accountant general what are you dreaming of  a womans voice sorry the screen shews barnabas as before  burgelubin since you take it that way i will go in your place its a pity because you see this american thinks you are the greatest living authority on the duration of human life and  barnabas interrupting the american thinks what do you mean i am the greatest living authority on the duration of human life who dares dispute it  burgelubin nobody dear lad nobody dont fly out at me it is evident that you have not read the americans book  barnabas dont tell me that you have or that you have read any book except a novel for the last twenty years for i wont believe you  burgelubin quite right dear old fellow i havnt read it but i have read what the times literary supplement says about it  barnabas i dont care two straws what it says about it does it say anything about me  burgelubin yes  barnabas oh does it what  burgelubin it points out that an extraordinary number of firstrate persons like you and me have died by drowning during the last two centuries and that when this invention of breathing under water takes effect your estimate of the average duration of human life will be upset  barnabas alarmed upset my estimate gracious heavens does the fool realize what that means do you realize what that means  burgelubin i suppose it means that we shall have to amend the act  barnabas amend my act monstrous  burgelubin but we must we cant ask people to go on working until they are fortythree unless our figures are unchallengeable you know what a row there was over those last three years and how nearly the toooldatforty people won  barnabas they would have made the british islands bankrupt if theyd won but you dont care for that you care for nothing but being popular  burgelubin oh well i shouldnt worry if i were you for most people complain that there is not enough work for them and would be only too glad to stick on instead of retiring at fortythree if only they were asked as a favor instead of having to  barnabas thank you i need no consolation he rises determinedly and puts on his fillet  burgelubin are you off where are you going to  barnabas to that cinema tomfoolery of course i shall put this american impostor in his place he goes out  burgelubin calling after him god bless you dear old chap with a chuckle he switches off and the screen becomes blank he presses a button and holds it down while he calls hallo  a womans voice hallo  burgelubin formally the president respectfully solicits the privilege of an interview with the chief secretary and holds himself entirely at his honors august disposal  a chinese voice he is coming  burgelubin oh that you confucius so good of you come along he releases the button  a man in a yellow gown presenting the general appearance of a chinese sage enters  burgelubin jocularly well illustrious sageonions how are your poor sore feet  confucius gravely i thank you for your kind inquiries i am well  burgelubin thats right sit down and make yourself comfortable any business for me today  confucius sitting down on the first chair round the corner of the table to the presidents right none  burgelubin have you heard the result of the byeelection  confucius a walkover only one candidate  burgelubin any good  confucius he was released from the county lunatic asylum a fortnight ago not mad enough for the lethal chamber not sane enough for any place but the division lobby a very popular speaker  burgelubin i wish the people would take a serious interest in politics  confucius i do not agree the englishman is not fitted by nature to understand politics ever since the public services have been manned by chinese the country has been well and honestly governed what more is needed  burgelubin what i cant make out is that china is one of the worst governed countries on earth  confucius no it was badly governed twenty years ago but since we forbade any chinaman to take part in our public services and imported natives of scotland for that purpose we have done well your information here is always twenty years out of date  burgelubin people dont seem to be able to govern themselves i cant understand it why should it be so  confucius justice is impartiality only strangers are impartial  burgelubin it ends in the public services being so good that the government has nothing to do but think  confucius were it otherwise the government would have too much to do to think  burgelubin is that any excuse for the english people electing a parliament of lunatics  confucius the english people always did elect parliaments of lunatics what does it matter if your permanent officials are honest and competent  burgelubin you do not know the history of this country what would my ancestors have said to the menagerie of degenerates that is still called the house of commons confucius you will not believe me and i do not blame you for it but england once saved the liberties of the world by inventing parliamentary government which was her peculiar and supreme glory  confucius i know the history of your country perfectly well it proves the exact contrary  burgelubin how do you make that out  confucius the only power your parliament ever had was the power of withholding supplies from the king  burgelubin precisely that great englishman simon de montfort  confucius he was not an englishman he was a frenchman he imported parliaments from france  burgelubin surprised you dont say so  confucius the king and his loyal subjects killed simon for forcing his french parliament on them the first thing british parliaments always did was to grant supplies to the king for life with enthusiastic expressions of loyalty lest they should have any real power and be expected to do something  burgelubin look here confucius you know more history than i do of course but democracy  confucius an institution peculiar to china and it was never really a success there  burgelubin but the habeas corpus act  confucius the english always suspended it when it threatened to be of the slightest use  burgelubin well trial by jury you cant deny that we established that  confucius all cases that were dangerous to the governing classes were tried in the star chamber or by court martial except when the prisoner was not tried at all but executed after calling him names enough to make him unpopular  burgelubin oh bother you may be right in these little details but in the large we have managed to hold our own as a great race well people who could do nothing couldnt have done that you know  confucius i did not say you could do nothing you could fight you could eat you could drink until the twentieth century you could produce children you could play games you could work when you were forced to but you could not govern yourselves  burgelubin then how did we get our reputation as the pioneers of liberty  confucius by your steadfast refusal to be governed at all a horse that kicks everyone who tries to harness and guide him may be a pioneer of liberty but he is not a pioneer of government in china he would be shot  burgelubin stuff do you imply that the administration of which i am president is no government  confucius i do i am the government  burgelubin you you you fat yellow lump of conceit  confucius only an englishman could be so ignorant of the nature of government as to suppose that a capable statesman cannot be fat yellow and conceited many englishmen are slim rednosed and modest put them in my place and within a year you will be back in the anarchy and chaos of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries  burgelubin oh if you go back to the dark ages i have nothing more to say but we did not perish we extricated ourselves from that chaos we are now the best governed country in the world how did we manage that if we are such fools as you pretend  confucius you did not do it until the slaughter and ruin produced by your anarchy forced you at last to recognize two inexorable facts first that government is absolutely necessary to civilization and that you could not maintain civilization by merely doing down your neighbor as you called it and cutting off the head of your king whenever he happened to be a logical scot and tried to take his position seriously second that government is an art of which you are congenitally incapable accordingly you imported educated negresses and chinese to govern you since then you have done very well  burgelubin so have you you old humbug all the same i dont know how you stand the work you do you seem to me positively to like public business why wont you let me take you down to the coast some weekend and teach you marine golf  confucius it does not interest me i am not a barbarian  burgelubin you mean that i am  confucius that is evident  burgelubin how  confucius people like you they like cheerful goodnatured barbarians they have elected you president five times in succession they will elect you five times more i like you you are better company than a dog or a horse because you can speak  burgelubin am i a barbarian because you like me  confucius surely nobody likes me i am held in awe capable persons are never liked i am not likeable but i am indispensable  burgelubin oh cheer up old man theres nothing so disagreeable about you as all that i dont dislike you and if you think im afraid of you you jolly well dont know burgelubin thats all  confucius you are brave yes it is a form of stupidity  burgelubin you may not be brave one doesnt expect it from a chink but you have the devils own cheek  confucius i have the assured certainty of the man who sees and knows your genial bluster your cheery selfconfidence are pleasant like the open air but they are blind they are vain i seem to see a great dog wag his tail and bark joyously but if he leaves my heel he is lost  burgelubin thank you for a handsome compliment i have a big dog and he is the best fellow i know if you knew how much uglier you are than a chow you wouldnt start those comparisons though rising well if you have nothing for me to do i am going to leave your heel for the rest of the day and enjoy myself what would you recommend me to do with myself  confucius give yourself up to contemplation and great thoughts will come to you  burgelubin will they if you think i am going to sit here on a fine day like this with my legs crossed waiting for great thoughts you exaggerate my taste for them i prefer marine golf stopping short oh by the way i forgot something i have a word or two to say to the minister of health he goes back to his chair  confucius her number is  burgelubin i know it  confucius rising i cannot understand her attraction for you for me a woman who is not yellow does not exist save as an official he goes out  burgelubin operates his switchboard as before the screen vanishes and a dainty room with a bed a wardrobe and a dressingtable with a mirror and a switch on it appears seated at it a handsome negress is trying on a brilliant head scarf her dressinggown is thrown back from her shoulders to her chair she is in corset knickers and silk stockings  burgelubin horrified i beg your pardon a thousand timesthe startled negress snatches the peg out of her switchboard and vanishes  the negresss voice who is it  burgelubin me the president burgelubin i had no idea your bedroom switch was in i beg your pardon  the negress reappears she has pulled the dressinggown perfunctorily over her shoulders and continues her experiments with the scarf not at all put out and rather amused by surges prudery  the negress stupid of me i was talking to another lady this morning and i left the peg in  burgelubin but i am so sorry  the negress sunnily still busy with the scarf why it was my fault  burgelubin embarrassed wellerbut i suppose you were used to it in africa  the negress your delicacy is very touching mr president it would be funny if it were not so unpleasant because like all white delicacy it is in the wrong place how do you think this suits my complexion  burgelubin how can any really vivid color go wrong with a black satin skin it is our womens wretched pale faces that have to be matched and lighted yours is always right  the negress yes it is a pity your white beauties have all the same ashy faces the same colorless drab the same age but look at their beautiful noses and little lips they are physically insipid they have no beauty you cannot love them but how elegant  burgelubin cant you find an official pretext for coming to see me isnt it ridiculous that we have never met its so tantalizing to see you and talk to you and to know all the time that you are two hundred miles away and that i cant touch you  the negress i cannot live on the east coast it is hard enough to keep my blood warm here besides my friend it would not be safe these distant flirtations are very charming and they teach selfcontrol  burgelubin damn selfcontrol i want to hold you in my armstothe negress snatches out the peg from the switchboard and vanishes she is still heard laughing black devil he snatches out his peg furiously her laugh is no longer heard oh these sex episodes why can i not resist them disgraceful  confucius returns  confucius i forgot there is something for you to do this morning you have to go to the record office to receive the american barbarian  burgelubin confucius once for all i object to this chinese habit of describing white men as barbarians  confucius standing formally at the end of the table with his hands palm to palm i make a mental note that you do not wish the americans to be described as barbarians  burgelubin not at all the americans are barbarians but we are not i suppose the particular barbarian you are speaking of is the american who has invented a means of breathing under water  confucius he says he has invented such a method for some reason which is not intelligible in china englishmen always believe any statement made by an american inventor especially one who has never invented anything therefore you believe this person and have given him a public reception today the record office is entertaining him with a display of the cinematographic records of all the eminent englishmen who have lost their lives by drowning since the cinema was invented why not go to see it if you are at a loss for something to do  burgelubin what earthly interest is there in looking at a moving picture of a lot of people merely because they were drowned if they had had any sense they would not have been drowned probably  confucius that is not so it has never been noticed before but the record office has just made two remarkable discoveries about the public men and women who have displayed extraordinary ability during the past century one is that they retained unusual youthfulness up to an advanced age the other is that they all met their death by drowning  burgelubin yes i know can you explain it  confucius it cannot be explained it is not reasonable therefore i do not believe it  the accountant general rushes in looking ghastly he staggers to the middle of the table  burgelubin whats the matter are you ill  barnabas choking no ihe collapses into the middle chair i must speak to you in private  confucius calmly withdraws  burgelubin what on earth is it have some oxygen  barnabas i have had some go to the record office you will see men fainting there again and again and being revived with oxygen as i have been they have seen with their own eyes as i have  burgelubin seen what  barnabas seen the archbishop of york  burgelubin well why shouldnt they see the archbishop of york what are they fainting for has he been murdered  barnabas no he has been drowned  burgelubin good god where when how poor fellow  barnabas poor fellow poor thief poor swindler poor robber of his countrys exchequer poor fellow indeed wait til i catch him  burgelubin how can you catch him when he is dead youre mad  barnabas dead who said he was dead  burgelubin you did drowned  barnabas exasperated will you listen to me was old archbishop haslam the present mans last predecessor but four drowned or not  burgelubin i dont know look him up in the encyclopedia britannica  barnabas yah was archbishop stickit who wrote stickit on the psalms drowned or not  burgelubin yes mercifully he deserved it  barnabas was president dickenson drowned was general bullyboy drowned  burgelubin who is denying it  barnabas well wave had moving pictures of all four put on the screen today for this american and they and the archbishop are the same man now tell me i am mad  burgelubin i do tell you you are mad stark raving mad  barnabas am i to believe my own eyes or am i not  burgelubin you can do as you please all i can tell you is that i dont believe your eyes if they cant see any difference between a live archbishop and two dead ones the apparatus rings he holds the button down yes  the womans voice the archbishop of york to see the president  barnabas hoarse with rage have him in ill talk to the scoundrel  burgelubin releasing the button not while you are in this state  barnabas reaching furiously for his button and holding it down send the archbishop in at once  burgelubin if you lose your temper barnabas remember that we shall be two to one  the archbishop enters he has a white band round his throat set in a black stock he wears a sort of kilt of black ribbons and soft black boots that button high up on his calves his costume does not differ otherwise from that of the president and the accountant general but its color scheme is black and white he is older than the reverend bill haslam was when he wooed miss savvy barnabas but he is recognizably the same man he does not look a day over fifty and is very well preserved even at that but his boyishness of manner is quite gone he now has complete authority and selfpossession in fact the president is a little afraid of him and it seems quite natural and inevitable that he should speak fast  the archbishop good day mr president  burgelubin good day mr archbishop be seated  the archbishop sitting down between them good day mr accountant general  barnabas malevolently good day to you i have a question to put to you if you dont mind  the archbishop looking curiously at him jarred by his uncivil tone certainly what is it  barnabas what is your definition of a thief  the archbishop rather an oldfashioned word is it not  barnabas it survives officially in my department  the archbishop our departments are full of survivals look at my tie my apron my boots they are all mere survivals yet it seems that without them i cannot be a proper archbishop  barnabas indeed well in my department the word thief survives because in the community the thing thief survives and a very despicable and dishonorable thing he is too  the archbishop coolly i daresay  barnabas in my department sir a thief is a person who lives longer than the statutory expectation of life entitles him to and goes on drawing public money when if he were an honest man he would be dead  the archbishop then let me say sir that your department does not understand its own business if you have miscalculated the duration of human life that is not the fault of the persons whose longevity you have miscalculated and if they continue to work and produce they pay their way even if they live two or three centuries  barnabas i know nothing about their working and producing that is not the business of my department i am concerned with their expectation of life and i say that no man has any right to go on living and drawing money when he ought to be dead  the archbishop you do not comprehend the relation between income and production  barnabas i understand my own department  the archbishop that is not enough your department is part of a synthesis which embraces all the departments  burgelubin synthesis this is an intellectual difficulty this is a job for confucius i heard him use that very word the other day and i wondered what the devil he meant switching on hallo put me through to the chief secretary  confuciuss voice you are speaking to him  burgelubin an intellectual difficulty old man something we dont understand come and help us out  the archbishop may i ask how the question has arisen  barnabas ah you begin to smell a rat do you you thought yourself pretty safe you  burgelubin steady barnabas dont be in a hurry  confucius enters  the archbishop rising good morning mr chief secretary  burgelubin rising in instinctive imitation of the archbishop honor us by taking a seat o sage  confucius ceremony is needless he bows to the company and takes the chair at the foot of the table  the president and the archbishop resume their seats  burgelubin we wish to put a case to you confucius suppose a man instead of conforming to the official estimate of his expectation of life were to live for more than two centuries and a half would the accountant general be justified in calling him a thief  confucius no he would be justified in calling him a liar  the archbishop i think not mr chief secretary what do you suppose my age is  confucius fifty  burgelubin you dont look it fortyfive and young for your age  the archbishop my age is two hundred and eightythree  barnabas morosely triumphant hmp mad am i  burgelubin youre both mad excuse me archbishop but this is getting a bitwell  the archbishop to confucius mr chief secretary will you to oblige me assume that i have lived nearly three centuries as a hypothesis  burgelubin what is a hypothesis  confucius it does not matter i understand to the archbishop am i to assume that you have lived in your ancestors or by metempsychosis  burgelubin metempsygood lord what a brain confucius what a brain  the archbishop nothing of that kind assume in the ordinary sense that i was born in the year 1887 and that i have worked continuously in one profession or another since the year 1910 am i a thief  confucius i do not know was that one of your professions  the archbishop no i have been nothing worse than an archbishop a president and a general  barnabas has he or has he not robbed the exchequer by drawing five or six incomes when he was only entitled to one answer me that  confucius certainly not the hypothesis is that he has worked continuously since 1910 we are now in the year 2170 what is the official lifetime  barnabas seventyeight of course its an average and we dont mind a man here and there going on to ninety or even as a curiosity becoming a centenarian but i say that a man who goes beyond that is a swindler  confucius seventyeight into two hundred and eightythree goes more than three and a half times your department owes the archbishop two and a half educations and three and a half retiring pensions  barnabas stuff how can that be  confucius at what age do your people begin to work for the community  burgelubin three they do certain things every day when they are three just to break them in you know but they become selfsupporting or nearly so at thirteen  confucius and at what age do they retire  barnabas fortythree  confucius that is they do thirty years work and they receive maintenance and education without working for thirteen years of childhood and thirtyfive years of superannuation fortyeight years in all for each thirty years work the archbishop has given you 260 years work and has received only one education and no superannuation you therefore owe him over 300 years of leisure and nearly eight educations you are thus heavily in his debt in other words he has effected an enormous national economy by living so long and you by living only seventyeight years are profiting at his expense he is the benefactor you are the thief half rising may i now withdraw and return to my serious business as my own span is comparatively short  burgelubin dont be in a hurry old chap confucius sits down again this hypothecary or whatever you call it is put up seriously i dont believe it but if the archbishop and the accountant general are going to insist that its true we shall have either to lock them up or to see the thing through  barnabas its no use trying these chinese subtleties on me im a plain man and though i dont understand metaphysics and dont believe in them i understand figures and if the archbishop is only entitled to seventyeight years and he takes 283 i say he takes more than he is entitled to get over that if you can  the archbishop i have not taken 283 years i have taken 23 and given 260  confucius do your accounts shew a deficiency or a surplus  barnabas a surplus thats what i cant make out thats the artfulness of these people  burgelubin that settles it whats the use of arguing the chink says you are wrong and theres an end of it  barnabas i say nothing against the chinks arguments but what about my facts  confucius if your facts include a case of a man living 283 years i advise you to take a few weeks at the seaside  barnabas let there be an end of this hinting that i am out of my mind come and look at the cinema record i tell you this man is archbishop haslam archbishop stickit president dickenson general bullyboy and himself into the bargain all five of them  the archbishop i do not deny it i never have denied it nobody has ever asked me  burgelubin but damn it mani beg your pardon archbishop but really really  the archbishop dont mention it what were you going to say  burgelubin well you were drowned four times over you are not a cat you know  the archbishop that is very easy to understand consider my situation when i first made the amazing discovery that i was destined to live three hundred years i  confucius interrupting him pardon me such a discovery was impossible you have not made it yet you may live a million years if you have already lived two hundred there is no question of three hundred years you have made a slip at the very beginning of your fairy tale mr archbishop  burgelubin good confucius to the archbishop he has you there i dont see how you can get over that  the archbishop yes it is quite a good point but if the accountant general will go to the british museum library and search the catalogue he will find under his own name a curious and now forgotten book dated 1924 entitled the gospel of the brothers barnabas that gospel was that men must live three hundred years if civilization is to be saved it shewed that this extension of individual human life was possible and how it was likely to come about i married the daughter of one of the brothers  barnabas do you mean to say you claim to be a connection of mine  the archbishop i claim nothing as i have by this time perhaps three or four million cousins of one degree or another i have ceased to call on the family  burgelubin gracious heavens four million relatives is that calculation correct confucius  confucius in china it might be forty millions if there were no checks on population  burgelubin this is a staggerer it brings home to onebut recovering it isnt true you know let us keep sane  confucius to the archbishop you wish us to understand that the illustrious ancestors of the accountant general communicated to you a secret by which you could attain the age of three hundred years  the archbishop no nothing of the kind they simply believed that mankind could live any length of time it knew to be absolutely necessary to save civilization from extinction i did not share their belief at least i was not conscious of sharing it i thought i was only amused by it to me my fatherinlaw and his brother were a pair of clever cranks who had talked one another into a fixed idea which had become a monomania with them it was not until i got into serious difficulties with the pension authorities after turning seventy that i began to suspect the truth  confucius the truth  the archbishop yes mr chief secretary the truth like all revolutionary truths it began as a joke as i shewed no signs of ageing after fortyfive my wife used to make fun of me by saying that i was certainly going to live three hundred years she was sixtyeight when she died and the last thing she said to me as i sat by her bedside holding her hand was bill you really dont look fifty i wonder she broke off and fell asleep wondering and never awoke then i began to wonder too that is the explanation of the three hundred years mr secretary  confucius it is very ingenious mr archbishop and very well told  burgelubin of course you understand that i dont for a moment suggest the very faintest doubt of your absolute veracity archbishop you know that dont you  the archbishop quite mr president only you dont believe me that is all i do not expect you to in your place i should not believe you had better have a look at the films pointing to the accountant general he believes  burgelubin but the drowning what about the drowning a man might get drowned once or even twice if he was exceptionally careless but he couldnt be drowned four times he would run away from water like a mad dog  the archbishop perhaps mr chief secretary can guess the explanation of that  confucius to keep your secret you had to die  burgelubin but dash it all man he isnt dead  confucius it is socially impossible not to do what everybody else does one must die at the usual time  barnabas of course a simple point of honour  confucius not at all a simple necessity  burgelubin well im hanged if i see it i should jolly well live for ever if i could  the archbishop it is not so easy as you think you mr chief secretary have grasped the difficulties of the position let me remind you mr president that i was over eighty before the 1969 act for the redistribution of income entitled me to a handsome retiring pension owing to my youthful appearance i was prosecuted for attempting to obtain public money on false pretences when i claimed it i could prove nothing for the register of my birth had been blown to pieces by a bomb dropped on a village church years before in the first of the big modern wars i was ordered back to work as a man of forty and had to work for fifteen years more the retiring age being then fiftyfive  burgelubin as late as fiftyfive how did people stand it  the archbishop they made difficulties about letting me go even then i still looked so young for some years i was in continual trouble the industrial police rounded me up again and again refusing to believe that i was over age they began to call me the wandering jew you see how impossible my position was i foresaw that in twenty years more my official record would prove me to be seventyfive my appearance would make it impossible to believe that i was more than fortyfive and my real age would be one hundred and seventeen what was i to do bleach my hair hobble about on two sticks mimic the voice of a centenarian better have killed myself  barnabas you ought to have killed yourself as an honest man you were entitled to no more than an honest mans expectation of life  the archbishop i did kill myself it was quite easy i left a suit of clothes by the seashore during the bathing season with documents in the pockets to identify me i then turned up in a strange place pretending that i had lost my memory and did not know my name or my age or anything about myself under treatment i recovered my health but not my memory i have had several careers since i began this routine of life and death i have been an archbishop three times when i persuaded the authorities to knock down all our towns and rebuild them from the foundations or move them i went into the artillery and became a general i have been president  burgelubin dickenson  the archbishop yes  burgelubin but they found dickensons body its ashes are buried in st pauls  the archbishop they almost always found the body during the bathing season there are plenty of bodies i have been cremated again and again at first i used to attend my own funeral in disguise because i had read about a man doing that in an old romance by an author named bennett from whom i remember borrowing five pounds in 1912 but i got tired of that i would not cross the street now to read my latest epitaph  the chief secretary and the president look very glum their incredulity is vanquished at last  burgelubin look here do you chaps realize how awful this is here we are sitting calmly in the presence of a man whose death is overdue by two centuries he may crumble into dust before our eyes at any moment  barnabas not he hell go on drawing his pension until the end of the world  the archbishop not quite that my expectation of life is only three hundred years  barnabas you will last out my time anyhow thats enough for me  the archbishop coolly how do you know  barnabas taken aback how do i know  the archbishop yes how do you know i did not begin even to suspect until i was nearly seventy i was only vain of my youthful appearance i was not quite serious about it until i was ninety even now i am not sure from one moment to another though i have given you my reason for thinking that i have quite unintentionally committed myself to a lifetime of three hundred years  burgelubin but how do you do it is it lemons is it soya beans is it  the archbishop i do not do it it happens it may happen to anyone it may happen to you  burgelubin the full significance of this for himself dawning on him then we three may be in the same boat with you for all we know  the archbishop you may therefore i advise you to be very careful how you take any step that will make my position uncomfortable  burgelubin well im dashed one of my secretaries was remarking only this morning how well and young i am looking barnabas i have an absolute conviction that i am one of thetheshall i say one of the victimsof this strange destiny  the archbishop your greatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgrandfather formed the same conviction when he was between sixty and seventy i knew him  burgelubin depressed ah but he died  the archbishop no  burgelubin hopefully do you mean to say he is still alive  the archbishop no he was shot under the influence of his belief that he was going to live three hundred years he became a changed man he began to tell people the truth and they disliked it so much that they took advantage of certain clauses of an act of parliament he had himself passed during the four years war and had purposely forgotten to repeal afterwards they took him to the tower of london and shot him  the apparatus rings  confucius answering yes he listens  a womans voice the domestic minister has called  burgelubin not quite catching the answer who does she say has called  confucius the domestic minister  barnabas oh dash it that awful woman  burgelubin she certainly is a bit of a terror i dont exactly know why for she is not at all badlooking  barnabas out of patience for heavens sake dont be frivolous  the archbishop he cannot help it mr accountant general three of his sixteen greatgreatgreatgrandfathers married lubins  burgelubin tut tut i am not frivolling i did not ask the lady here which of you did  confucius it is her official duty to report personally to the president once a quarter  burgelubin oh that then i suppose its my official duty to receive her theyd better send her in you dont mind do you she will bring us back to real life i dont know how you fellows feel but im just going dotty  confucius into the telephone the president will receive the domestic minister at once  they watch the door in silence for the entrance of the domestic minister  burgelubin suddenly to the archbishop i suppose you have been married over and over again  the archbishop once you do not make vows until death when death is three hundred years off  they relapse into uneasy silence the domestic minister enters she is a handsome woman apparently in the prime of life with elegant tense well heldup figure and the walk of a goddess her expression and deportment are grave swift decisive awful unanswerable she wears a dianesque tunic instead of a blouse and a silver coronet instead of a gold fillet her dress otherwise is not markedly different from that of the men who rise as she enters and incline their heads with instinctive awe she comes to the vacant chair between barnabas and confucius  burgelubin resolutely genial and gallant delighted to see you mrs lutestring  confucius we are honored by your celestial presence  barnabas good day madam  the archbishop i have not had the pleasure of meeting you before i am the archbishop of york  mrs lutestring surely we have met mr archbishop i remember your face weshe checks herself suddenly ah no i remember now it was someone else she sits down they all sit down  the archbishop also puzzled are you sure you are mistaken i also have some association with your face mrs lutestring something like a door opening continually and revealing you and a smile of welcome when you recognized me did you ever open a door for me i wonder  mrs lutestring i often opened a door for the person you have just reminded me of but he has been dead many years the rest except the archbishop look at one another quickly  confucius may i ask how many years  mrs lutestring struck by his tone looks at him for a moment with some displeasure then replies it does not matter a long time  burgelubin you mustnt rush to conclusions about the archbishop mrs lutestring he is an older bird than you think older than you at all events  mrs lutestring with a melancholy smile i think not mr president but the subject is a delicate one i had rather not pursue it  confucius there is a question which has not been asked  mrs lutestring very decisively if it is a question about my age mr chief secretary it had better not be asked all that concerns you about my personal affairs can be found in the books of the accountant general  confucius the question i was thinking of will not be addressed to you but let me say that your sensitiveness on the point is very strange coming from a woman so superior to all common weaknesses as we know you to be  mrs lutestring i may have reasons which have nothing to do with common weaknesses mr chief secretary i hope you will respect them  confucius after bowing to her in assent i will now put my question have you mr archbishop any ground for assuming as you seem to do that what has happened to you has not happened to other people as well  burgelubin yes by george i never thought of that  the archbishop i have never met any case but my own  confucius how do you know  the archbishop well no one has ever told me that they were in this extraordinary position  confucius that proves nothing did you ever tell anybody that you were in it you never told us why did you never tell us  the archbishop i am surprised at the question coming from so astute a mind as yours mr secretary when you reach the age i reached before i discovered what was happening to me i was old enough to know and fear the ferocious hatred with which human animals like all other animals turn upon any unhappy individual who has the misfortune to be unlike themselves in every respect to be unnatural as they call it you will still find among the tales of that twentiethcentury classic wells a story of a race of men who grew twice as big as their fellows and another story of a man who fell into the hands of a race of blind men the big people had to fight the little people for their lives and the man with eyes would have had his eyes put out by the blind had he not fled to the desert where he perished miserably wellss teaching on that and other matters was not lost on me by the way he lent me five pounds once which i never repaid and it still troubles my conscience  confucius and were you the only reader of wells if there were others like you had they not the same reason for keeping the secret  the archbishop that is true but i should know you shortlived people are so childish if i met a man of my own age i should recognize him at once i have never done so  mrs lutestring would you recognize a woman of your age do you think  the archbishop ihe stops and turns upon her with a searching look startled by the suggestion and the suspicion it rouses  mrs lutestring what is your age mr archbishop  burgelubin two hundred and eightythree he says that is his little joke do you know mrs lutestring he had almost talked us into believing him when you came in and cleared the air with your robust common sense  mrs lutestring do you really feel that mr president i hear the note of breezy assertion in your voice i miss the note of conviction  burgelubin jumping up look here let us stop talking damned nonsense i dont wish to be disagreeable but its getting on my nerves the best joke wont bear being pushed beyond a certain point that point has been reached iim rather busy this morning we all have our hands pretty full confucius here will tell you that i have a heavy day before me  barnabas have you anything more important than this thing if its true  burgelubin oh if if if its true but it isnt true  barnabas have you anything at all to do  burgelubin anything to do have you forgotten barnabas that i happen to be president and that the weight of the entire public business of this country is on my shoulders  barnabas has he anything to do confucius  confucius he has to be president  barnabas that means that he has nothing to do  burgelubin sulkily very well barnabas go on making a fool of yourself he sits down go on  barnabas i am not going to leave this room until we get to the bottom of this swindle  mrs lutestring turning with deadly gravity on the accountant general this what did you say  confucius these expressions cannot be sustained you obscure the discussion in using them  barnabas glad to escape from her gaze by addressing confucius well this unnatural horror will that satisfy you  confucius that is in order but we do not commit ourselves to the implications of the word horror  the archbishop by the word horror the accountant general means only something unusual  confucius i notice that the honorable domestic minister on learning the advanced age of the venerable prelate shews no sign of surprise or incredulity  burgelubin she doesnt take it seriously who would eh mrs lutestring  mrs lutestring i take it very seriously indeed mr president i see now that i was not mistaken at first i have met the archbishop before  the archbishop i felt sure of it this vision of a door opening to me and a womans face welcoming me must be a reminiscence of something that really happened though i see it now as an angel opening the gate of heaven  mrs lutestring or a parlor maid opening the door of the house of the young woman you were in love with  the archbishop making a wry face is that the reality how these things grow in our imagination but may i say mrs lutestring that the transfiguration of a parlor maid to an angel is not more amazing than her transfiguration to the very dignified and able domestic minister i am addressing i recognize the angel in you frankly i do not recognize the parlor maid  burgelubin whats a parlor maid  mrs lutestring an extinct species a woman in a black dress and white apron who opened the house door when people knocked or rang and was either your tyrant or your slave i was a parlor maid in the house of one of the accountant generals remote ancestors to confucius you asked me my age mr chief secretary i am two hundred and seventyfour  burgelubin gallantly you dont look it you really dont look it  mrs lutestring turning her face gravely towards him look again mr president  burgelubin looking at her bravely until the smile fades from his face and he suddenly covers his eyes with his hands yes you do look it i am convinced its true now call up the lunatic asylum confucius and tell them to send an ambulance for me  mrs lutestring to the archbishop why have you given away your secret our secret  the archbishop they found it out the cinema records betrayed me but i never dreamt that there were others did you  mrs lutestring i knew one other she was a cook she grew tired and killed herself  the archbishop dear me however her death simplifies the situation as i have been able to convince these gentlemen that the matter had better go no further  mrs lutestring what when the president knows it will be all over the place before the end of the week  burgelubin injured really mrs lutestring you speak as if i were a notoriously indiscreet person barnabas have i such a reputation  barnabas resignedly it cant be helped its constitutional  confucius it is utterly unconstitutional but as you say it cannot be helped  burgelubin solemnly i deny that a secret of state has ever passed my lipsexcept perhaps to the minister of health who is discretion personified people think because she is a negress  mrs lutestring it does not matter much now once it would have mattered a great deal but my children are all dead  the archbishop yes the children must have been a terrible difficulty fortunately for me i had none  mrs lutestring there was one daughter who was the child of my very heart some years after my first drowning i learnt that she had lost her sight i went to her she was an old woman of ninetysix blind she asked me to sit and talk with her because my voice was like the voice of her dead mother  burgelubin the complications must be frightful really i hardly know whether i do want to live much longer than other people  mrs lutestring you can always kill yourself as cook did but that was influenza long life is complicated and even terrible but it is glorious all the same i would no more change places with an ordinary woman than with a mayfly that lives only an hour  the archbishop what set you thinking of it first  mrs lutestring conrad barnabass book your wife told me it was more wonderful than napoleons book of fate and old moores almanac which cook and i used to read i was very ignorant it did not seem so impossible to me as to an educated woman yet i forgot all about it and married and drudged as a poor mans wife and brought up children and looked twenty years older than i really was until one day long after my husband died and my children were out in the world working for themselves i noticed that i looked twenty years younger than i really was the truth came to me in a flash  burgelubin an amazing moment your feelings must have been beyond description what was your first thought  mrs lutestring pure terror i saw that the little money i had laid up would not last and that i must go out and work again they had things called old age pensions then miserable pittances for wornout old laborers to die on i thought i should be found out if i went on drawing it too long the horror of facing another lifetime of drudgery of missing my hardearned rest and losing my poor little savings drove everything else out of my mind you people nowadays can have no conception of the dread of poverty that hung over us then or of the utter tiredness of forty years unending overwork and striving to make a shilling do the work of a pound  the archbishop i wonder you did not kill yourself i often wonder why the poor in those evil old times did not kill themselves they did not even kill other people  mrs lutestring you never kill yourself because you always may as well wait until tomorrow and you have not energy or conviction enough to kill the others besides how can you blame them when you would do as they do if you were in their place  burgelubin devilish poor consolation that  mrs lutestring there were other consolations in those days for people like me we drank preparations of alcohol to relieve the strain of living and give us an artificial happiness  burgelubin all together alcohol confucius making  pfff  barnabas wry faces  disgusting  mrs lutestring a little alcohol would improve your temper and manners and make you much easier to live with mr accountant general  burgelubin laughing by george i believe you try it barnabas  confucius no try tea it is the more civilized poison of the two  mrs lutestring you mr president were born intoxicated with your own wellfed natural exuberance you cannot imagine what alcohol was to an underfed poor woman i had carefully arranged my little savings so that i could get drunk as we called it once a week and my only pleasure was looking forward to that poor little debauch that is what saved me from suicide i could not bear to miss my next carouse but when i stopped working and lived on my pension the fatigue of my lifes drudgery began to wear off because you see i was not really old i recuperated i looked younger and younger and at last i was rested enough to have courage and strength to begin life again besides political changes were making it easier life was a little better worth living for the ninetenths of the people who used to be mere drudges after that i never turned back or faltered my only regret now is that i shall die when i am three hundred or thereabouts there was only one thing that made life hard and that is gone now  confucius may we ask what that was  mrs lutestring perhaps you will be offended if i tell you  burgelubin offended my dear lady do you suppose after such a stupendous revelation that anything short of a blow from a sledgehammer could produce the smallest impression on any of us  mrs lutestring well you see it has been so hard on me never to meet a grownup person you are all such children and i never was very fond of children except that one girl who woke up the mother passion in me i have been very lonely sometimes  burgelubin again gallant but surely mrs lutestring that has been your own fault if i may say so a lady of your attractions need never have been lonely  mrs lutestring why  burgelubin why well well er well er er well he gives it up  the archbishop he means that you might have married curious how little they understand our position  mrs lutestring i did marry i married again on my hundred and first birthday but of course i had to marry an elderly man a man over sixty he was a great painter on his deathbed he said to me it has taken me fifty years to learn my trade and to paint all the foolish pictures a man must paint and get rid of before he comes through them to the great things he ought to paint and now that my foot is at last on the threshold of the temple i find that it is also the threshold of my tomb that man would have been the greatest painter of all time if he could have lived as long as i i saw him die of old age whilst he was still as he said himself a gentleman amateur like all modern painters  burgelubin but why had you to marry an elderly man why not marry a young one or shall i say a middleaged one if my own affections were not already engaged and if to tell the truth i were not a little afraid of youfor you are a very superior woman as we all acknowledgei should esteem myself happy inerer  mrs lutestring mr president have you ever tried to take advantage of the innocence of a little child for the gratification of your senses  burgelubin good heavens madam what do you take me for what right have you to ask me such a question  mrs lutestring i am at present in my two hundred and seventyfifth year you suggest that i should take advantage of the innocence of a child of thirty and marry it  the archbishop can you shortlived people not understand that as the confusion and immaturity and primitive animalism in which we live for the first hundred years of our life is worse in this matter of sex than in any other you are intolerable to us in that relation  burgelubin do you mean to say mrs lutestring that you regard me as a child  mrs lutestring do you expect me to regard you as a completed soul oh you may well be afraid of me there are moments when your levity your ingratitude your shallow jollity make my gorge rise so against you that if i could not remind myself that you are a child i should be tempted to doubt your right to live at all  confucius do you grudge us the few years we have you who have three hundred  burgelubin you accuse me of levity must i remind you madam that i am the president and that you are only the head of a department  barnabas ingratitude too you draw a pension for three hundred years when we owe you only seventyeight and you call us ungrateful  mrs lutestring i do when i think of the blessings that have been showered on you and contrast them with the poverty the humiliations the anxieties the heartbreak the insolence and tyranny that were the daily lot of mankind when i was learning to suffer instead of learning to live when i see how lightly you take it all how you quarrel over the crumpled leaves in your beds of roses how you are so dainty about your work that unless it is made either interesting or delightful to you you leave it to negresses and chinamen i ask myself whether even three hundred years of thought and experience can save you from being superseded by the power that created you and put you on your trial  burgelubin my dear lady our chinese and colored friends are perfectly happy they are twenty times better off here than they would be in china or liberia they do their work admirably and in doing it they set us free for higher employments  the archbishop who has caught the infection of her indignation what higher employments are you capable of you that are superannuated at seventy and dead at eighty  mrs lutestring you are not really doing higher work you are supposed to make the decisions and give the orders but the negresses and the chinese make up your minds for you and tell you what orders to give just as my brother who was a sergeant in the guards used to prompt his officers in the old days when i want to get anything done at the health ministry i do not come to you i go to the black lady who has been the real president during your present term of office or to confucius who goes on for ever while presidents come and presidents go  burgelubin this is outrageous this is treason to the white race and let me tell you madam that i have never in my life met the minister of health and that i protest against the vulgar color prejudice which disparages her great ability and her eminent services to the state my relations with her are purely telephonic gramophonic photophonic and may i add platonic  the archbishop there is no reason why you should be ashamed of them in any case mr president but let us look at the position impersonally can you deny that what is happening is that the english people have become a joint stock company admitting asiatics and africans as shareholders  barnabas nothing like it i know all about the old joint stock companies the shareholders did no work  the archbishop that is true but we like them get our dividends whether we work or not we work partly because we know there would be no dividends if we did not and partly because if we refuse we are regarded as mentally deficient and put into a lethal chamber but what do we work at before the few changes we were forced to make by the revolutions that followed the four years war our governing classes had been so rich as it was called that they had become the most intellectually lazy and fatheaded people on the face of the earth there is a good deal of that fat still clinging to us  burgelubin as president i must not listen to unpatriotic criticisms of our national character mr archbishop  the archbishop as archbishop mr president it is my official duty to criticize the national character unsparingly at the canonization of saint henrik ibsen you yourself unveiled the monument to him which bears on its pedestal the noble inscription i came not to call sinners but the righteous to repentance the proof of what i say is that our routine work and what may be called our ornamental and figurehead work is being more and more sought after by the english whilst the thinking organizing calculating directing work is done by yellow brains brown brains and black brains just as it was done in my early days by jewish brains scottish brains italian brains german brains the only white men who still do serious work are those who like the accountant general have no capacity for enjoyment and no social gifts to make them welcome outside their offices  barnabas confound your impudence i had gifts enough to find you out anyhow  the archbishop disregarding this outburst if you were to kill me as i stand here you would have to appoint an indian to succeed me i take precedence today not as an englishman but as a man with more than a century and a half of fully adult experience we are letting all the power slip into the hands of the colored people in another hundred years we shall be simply their household pets  burgelubin reacting buoyantly not the least danger of it i grant you we leave the most troublesome part of the labor of the nation to them and a good job too why should we drudge at it but think of the activities of our leisure is there a jollier place on earth to live in than england out of office hours and to whom do we owe that to ourselves not to the niggers the nigger and the chink are all right from tuesday to friday but from friday to tuesday they are simply nowhere and the real life of england is from friday to tuesday  the archbishop that is terribly true in devising brainless amusements in pursuing them with enormous vigor and taking them with eager seriousness our english people are the wonder of the world they always were and it is just as well for otherwise their sensuality would become morbid and destroy them what appals me is that their amusements should amuse them they are the amusements of boys and girls they are pardonable up to the age of fifty or sixty after that they are ridiculous i tell you what is wrong with us is that we are a nonadult race and the irish and the scots and the niggers and chinks as you call them though their lifetime is as short as ours or shorter yet do somehow contrive to grow up a little before they die we die in boyhood the maturity that should make us the greatest of all the nations lies beyond the grave for us either we shall go under as greybeards with golf clubs in our hands or we must will to live longer  mrs lutestring yes that is it i could not have expressed it in words but you have expressed it for me i felt even when i was an ignorant domestic slave that we had the possibility of becoming a great nation within us but our faults and follies drove me to cynical hopelessness we all ended then like that it is the highest creatures who take the longest to mature and are the most helpless during their immaturity i know now that it took me a whole century to grow up i began my serious life when i was a hundred and twenty asiatics cannot control me i am not a child in their hands as you are mr president neither i am sure is the archbishop they respect me you are not grown up enough even for that though you were kind enough to say that i frighten you  burgelubin honestly you do and will you think me very rude if i say that if i must choose between a white woman old enough to be my greatgrandmother and a black woman of my own age i shall probably find the black woman more sympathetic  mrs lutestring and more attractive in color perhaps  burgelubin yes since you ask me morewell not more attractive i do not deny that you have an excellent appearancebut i will say richer more venetian tropical the shadowed livery of the burnished sun  mrs lutestring our women and their favorite story writers begin already to talk about men with golden complexions  confucius expanding into a smile all across both face and body aaaaah  burgelubin well what of it madam have you read a very interesting book by the librarian of the biological society suggesting that the future of the world lies with the mulatto  mrs lutestring rising mr archbishop if the white race is to be saved our destiny is apparent  the archbishop yes our duty is pretty clear  mrs lutestring have you time to come home with me and discuss the matter  the archbishop rising with pleasure  barnabas rising also and rushing past mrs lutestring to the door where he turns to bar her way no you dont burge you understand dont you  burgelubin no what is it  barnabas these two are going to marry  burgelubin why shouldnt they if they want to  barnabas they dont want to they will do it in cold blood because their children will live three hundred years it mustnt be allowed  confucius you cannot prevent it there is no law that gives you power to interfere with them  barnabas if they force me to it i will obtain legislation against marriages above the age of seventyeight  the archbishop there is not time for that before we are married mr accountant general be good enough to get out of the ladys way  barnabas there is time to send the lady to the lethal chamber before anything comes of your marriage dont forget that  mrs lutestring what nonsense mr accountant general good afternoon mr president good afternoon mr chief secretary they rise and acknowledge her salutation with bows she walks straight at the accountant general who instinctively shrinks out of her way as she leaves the room  the archbishop i am surprised at you mr barnabas your tone was like an echo from the dark ages he follows the domestic minister  confucius shaking his head and clucking with his tongue in deprecation of this painful episode moves to the chair just vacated by the archbishop and stands behind it with folded palms looking at the president the accountant general shakes his fist after the departed visitors and bursts into savage abuse of them  barnabas thieves cursed thieves vampires what are you going to do burge  burgelubin do  barnabas yes do there must be dozens of these people in existence are you going to let them do what the two who have just left us mean to do and crowd us off the face of the earth  burgelubin sitting down oh come barnabas what harm are they doing arnt you interested in them dont you like them  barnabas like them i hate them they are monsters unnatural monsters they are poison to me  burgelubin what possible objection can there be to their living as long as they can it does not shorten our lives does it  barnabas if i have to die when i am seventyeight i dont see why another man should be privileged to live to be two hundred and seventyeight it does shorten my life relatively it makes us ridiculous if they grew to be twelve feet high they would make us all dwarfs they talked to us as if we were children there is no love lost between us their hatred of us came out soon enough you heard what the woman said and how the archbishop backed her up  burgelubin but what can we do to them  barnabas kill them  burgelubin nonsense  barnabas lock them up sterilize them somehow anyhow  burgelubin but what reason could we give  barnabas what reason can you give for killing a snake nature tells you to do it  burgelubin my dear barnabas you are out of your mind  barnabas havnt you said that once too often already this morning  burgelubin i dont believe you will carry a single soul with you  barnabas i understand i know you you think you are one of them  confucius mr accountant general you may be one of them  barnabas how dare you accuse me of such a thing i am an honest man not a monster i won my place in public life by demonstrating that the true expectation of human life is seventyeight point six and i will resist any attempt to alter or upset it to the last drop of my blood if need be  burgelubin oh tut tut come come pull yourself together how can you a descendant of the great conrad barnabas the man who is still remembered by his masterly biography of a black beetle be so absurd  barnabas you had better go and write the autobiography of a jackass i am going to raise the country against this horror and against you if you shew the slightest sign of weakness about it  confucius very impressively you will regret it if you do  barnabas what is to make me regret it  confucius every mortal man and woman in the community will begin to count on living for three centuries things will happen which you do not foresee terrible things the family will dissolve parents and children will be no longer the old and the young brothers and sisters will meet as strangers after a hundred years separation the ties of blood will lose their innocence the imaginations of men let loose over the possibilities of three centuries of life will drive them mad and wreck human society this discovery must be kept a dead secret he sits down  barnabas and if i refuse to keep the secret  confucius i shall have you safe in a lunatic asylum the day after you blab  barnabas you forget that i can produce the archbishop to prove my statement  confucius so can i which of us do you think he will support when i explain to him that your object in revealing his age is to get him killed  barnabas desperate burge are you going to back up this yellow abomination against me are we public men and members of the government or are we damned blackguards  confucius unmoved have you ever known a public man who was not what vituperative people called a damned blackguard when some inconsiderate person wanted to tell the public more than was good for it  barnabas hold your tongue you insolent heathen burge i spoke to you  burgelubin well you know my dear barnabas confucius is a very longheaded chap i see his point  barnabas do you then let me tell you that except officially i will never speak to you again do you hear  burgelubin cheerfully you will you will  barnabas and dont you ever dare speak to me again do you hear he turns to the door  burgelubin i will i will goodbye barnabas god bless you  barnabas may you live forever and be the laughingstock of the whole world he dashes out in a fury  burgelubin laughing indulgently he will keep the secret all right i know barnabas you neednt worry  confucius troubled and grave there are no secrets except the secrets that keep themselves consider there are those films at the record office we have no power to prevent the master of the records from publishing this discovery made in his department we cannot silence the americanwho can silence an americannor the people who were there today to receive him fortunately a film can prove nothing but a resemblance  burgelubin thats very true after all the whole thing is confounded nonsense isnt it  confucius raising his head to look at him you have decided not to believe it now that you realize its inconveniences that is the english method it may not work in this case  burgelubin english be hanged its common sense you know those two people got us hypnotized not a doubt of it they must have been kidding us they were werent they  confucius you looked into that womans face and you believed  burgelubin just so thats where she had me i shouldnt have believed her a bit if shed turned her back to me  confucius shakes his head slowly and repeatedly  burgelubin you really think he hesitates  confucius the archbishop has always been a puzzle to me ever since i learnt to distinguish between one english face and another i have noticed what the woman pointed out that the english face is not an adult face just as the english mind is not an adult mind  burgelubin stow it john chinaman if ever there was a race divinely appointed to take charge of the nonadult races and guide them and train them and keep them out of mischief until they grow up to be capable of adopting our institutions that race is the english race it is the only race in the world that has that characteristic now  confucius that is the fancy of a child nursing a doll but it is ten times more childish of you to dispute the highest compliment ever paid you  burgelubin you call it a compliment to class us as grownup children  confucius not grownup children children at fifty sixty seventy your maturity is so late that you never attain to it you have to be governed by races which are mature at forty that means that you are potentially the most highly developed race on earth and would be actually the greatest if you could live long enough to attain to maturity  burgelubin grasping the idea at last by george confucius youre right i never thought of that that explains everything we are just a lot of schoolboys theres no denying it talk to an englishman about anything serious and he listens to you curiously for a moment just as he listens to a chap playing classical music then he goes back to his marine golf or motoring or flying or women just like a bit of stretched elastic when you let it go soaring to the height of his theme oh youre quite right we are only in our infancy i ought to be in a perambulator with a nurse shoving me along its true its absolutely true but some day well grow up and then by jingo well shew em  confucius the archbishop is an adult when i was a child i was dominated and intimidated by people whom i now know to have been weaker and sillier than i because there was some mysterious quality in their mere age that overawed me i confess that though i have kept up appearances i have always been afraid of the archbishop  burgelubin between ourselves confucius so have i  confucius it is this that convinced me it was this in the womans face that convinced you their new departure in the history of the race is no fraud it does not even surprise me  burgelubin oh come not surprise you its your pose never to be surprised at anything but if you are not surprised at this you are not human  confucius i am staggered just as a man may be staggered by an explosion for which he has himself laid the charge and lighted the fuse but i am not surprised because as a philosopher and a student of evolutionary biology i have come to regard some such development as this as inevitable if i had not thus prepared myself to be credulous no mere evidence of films and welltold tales would have persuaded me to believe as it is i do believe  burgelubin well that being settled what the devil is to happen next whats the next move for us  confucius we do not make the next move the next move will be made by the archbishop and the woman  burgelubin their marriage  confucius more than that they have made the momentous discovery that they are not alone in the world  burgelubin you think there are others  confucius there must be many others each of them believes that he or she is the only one to whom the miracle has happened but the archbishop knows better now he will advertise in terms which only the longlived people will understand he will bring them together and organize them they will hasten from all parts of the earth they will become a great power  burgelubin a little alarmed i say will they i suppose they will i wonder is barnabas right after all ought we to allow it  confucius nothing that we can do will stop it we cannot in our souls really want to stop it the vital force that has produced this change would paralyse our opposition to it if we were mad enough to oppose but we will not oppose you and i may be of the elect too  burgelubin yes thats what gets us every time what the deuce ought we to do something must be done about it you know  confucius let us sit still and meditate in silence on the vistas before us  burgelubin by george i believe youre right let us  they sit meditating the chinaman naturally the president with visible effort and intensity he is positively glaring into the future when the voice of the negress is heard  the negress mr president  burgelubin joyfully yes taking up a peg are you at home  the negress no omega zero x squared  the president rapidly puts the peg in the switchboard works the dial and presses the button the screen becomes transparent and the negress brilliantly dressed appears on what looks like the bridge of a steam yacht in glorious sea weather the installation with which she is communicating is beside the binnacle  confucius looking round and recoiling with a shriek of disgust ach avaunt avaunt he rushes from the room  burgelubin what part of the coast is that  the negress fishguard bay why not run over and join me for the afternoon i am disposed to be approachable at last  burgelubin but fishguard two hundred and seventy miles  the negress there is a lightning express on the irish air service at halfpast sixteen they will drop you by a parachute in the bay the dip will do you good i will pick you up and dry you and give you a firstrate time  burgelubin delightful but a little risky isnt it  the negress risky i thought you were afraid of nothing  burgelubin i am not exactly afraid but  the negress offended but you think it is not good enough very well she raises her hand to take the peg out of her switchboard  burgelubin imploringly no stop let me explain hold the line just one moment oh please  the negress waiting with her hand poised over the peg well  burgelubin the fact is i have been behaving very recklessly for some time past under the impression that my life would be so short that it was not worth bothering about but i have just learnt that i may livewell much longer than i expected i am sure your good sense will tell you that this alters the case i  the negress with suppressed rage oh quite pray dont risk your precious life on my account sorry for troubling you goodbye she snatches out her peg and vanishes  burgelubin urgently no please hold on i can convince youa loud buzzuzzuzz engaged who is she calling up now represses the button and calls the chief secretary say i want to see him again just for a moment  confuciuss voice is the woman gone  burgelubin yes yes its all right just a moment ifconfucius returns confucius i have some important business at fishguard the irish air service can drop me in the bay by parachute i suppose its quite safe isnt it  confucius nothing is quite safe the air service is as safe as any other travelling service the parachute is safe but the water is not safe  burgelubin why they will give me an unsinkable tunic wont they  confucius you will not sink but the sea is very cold you may get rheumatism for life  burgelubin for life that settles it i wont risk it  confucius good you have at last become prudent you are no longer what you call a sportsman you are a sensible coward almost a grownup man i congratulate you  burgelubin resolutely coward or no coward i will not face an eternity of rheumatism for any woman that ever was born he rises and goes to the rack for his fillet i have changed my mind i am going home he cocks the fillet rakishly good evening  confucius so early if the minister of health rings you up what shall i tell her  burgelubin tell her to go to the devil he goes out  confucius shaking his head shocked at the presidents impoliteness no no no no no no oh these english these crude young civilizations their manners hogs hogs     part iv  tragedy of an elderly gentleman   act i   burrin pier on the south shore of galway bay in ireland a region of stonecapped hills and granite fields it is a fine summer day in the year 3000 ad on an ancient stone stump about three feet thick and three feet high used for securing ships by ropes to the shore and called a bollard or holdfast an elderly gentleman sits facing the land with his head bowed and his face in his hands sobbing his sunburnt skin contrasts with his white whiskers and eyebrows he wears a black frockcoat a white waistcoat lavender trousers a brilliant silk cravat with a jewelled pin stuck in it a tall hat of grey felt and patent leather boots with white spats his starched linen cuffs protrude from his coat sleeves and his collar also of starched white linen is gladstonian on his right three or four full sacks lying side by side on the flags suggest that the pier unlike many remote irish piers is occasionally useful as well as romantic on his left behind him a flight of stone steps descends out of sight to the sea level  a woman in a silk tunic and sandals wearing little else except a cap with the number 2 on it in gold comes up the steps from the sea and stares in astonishment at the sobbing man her age cannot be guessed her face is firm and chiselled like a young face but her expression is unyouthful in its severity and determination  the woman what is the matter  the elderly gentleman looks up hastily pulls himself together takes out a silk handkerchief and dries his tears lightly with a brave attempt to smile through them and tries to rise gallantly but sinks back  the woman do you need assistance  the elderly gentleman no thank you very much no nothing the heat he punctuates with sniffs and dabs with his handkerchief at his eyes and nose hay fever  the woman you are a foreigner are you not  the elderly gentleman no you must not regard me as a foreigner i am a briton  the woman you come from some part of the british commonwealth  the elderly gentleman amiably pompous from its capital madam  the woman from baghdad  the elderly gentleman yes you may not be aware madam that these islands were once the centre of the british commonwealth during a period now known as the exile they were its headquarters a thousand years ago few people know this interesting circumstance now but i assure you it is true i have come here on a pious pilgrimage to one of the numerous lands of my fathers we are of the same stock you and i blood is thicker than water we are cousins  the woman i do not understand you say you have come here on a pious pilgrimage is that some new means of transport  the elderly gentleman again shewing signs of distress i find it very difficult to make myself understood here i was not referring to a machine but to aaa sentimental journey  the woman i am afraid i am as much in the dark as before you said also that blood is thicker than water no doubt it is but what of it  the elderly gentleman its meaning is obvious  the woman perfectly but i assure you i am quite aware that blood is thicker than water  the elderly gentleman sniffing almost in tears again we will leave it at that madam  the woman going nearer to him and scrutinizing him with some concern i am afraid you are not well were you not warned that it is dangerous for shortlived people to come to this country there is a deadly disease called discouragement against which shortlived people have to take very strict precautions intercourse with us puts too great a strain on them  the elderly gentleman pulling himself together huffily it has no effect on me madam i fear my conversation does not interest you if not the remedy is in your own hands  the woman looking at her hands and then looking inquiringly at him where  the elderly gentleman breaking down oh this is dreadful no understanding no intelligence no sympathyhis sobs choke him  the woman you see you are ill  the elderly gentleman nerved by indignation i am not ill i have never had a days illness in my life  the woman may i advise you  the elderly gentleman i have no need of a lady doctor thank you madam  the woman shaking her head i am afraid i do not understand i said nothing about a butterfly  the elderly gentleman well i said nothing about a butterfly  the woman you spoke of a lady doctor the word is known here only as the name of a butterfly  the elderly gentleman insanely i give up i can bear this no longer it is easier to go out of my mind at once he rises and dances about singing       id be a butterfly born in a bower     making apple dumplings without any flour   the woman smiling gravely it must be at least a hundred and fifty years since i last laughed but if you do that any more i shall certainly break out like a primary of sixty your dress is so extraordinarily ridiculous  the elderly gentleman halting abruptly in his antics my dress ridiculous i may not be dressed like a foreign office clerk but my clothes are perfectly in fashion in my native metropolis where yourspardon my saying sowould be considered extremely unusual and hardly decent  the woman decent there is no such word in our language what does it mean  the elderly gentleman it would not be decent for me to explain decency cannot be discussed without indecency  the woman i cannot understand you at all i fear you have not been observing the rules laid down for shortlived visitors  the elderly gentleman surely madam they do not apply to persons of my age and standing i am not a child nor an agricultural laborer  the woman severely they apply to you very strictly you are expected to confine yourself to the society of children under sixty you are absolutely forbidden to approach fully adult natives under any circumstances you cannot converse with persons of my age for long without bringing on a dangerous attack of discouragement do you realize that you are already shewing grave symptoms of that very distressing and usually fatal complaint  the elderly gentleman certainly not madam i am fortunately in no danger of contracting it i am quite accustomed to converse intimately and at the greatest length with the most distinguished persons if you cannot discriminate between hay fever and imbecility i can only say that your advanced years carry with them the inevitable penalty of dotage  the woman i am one of the guardians of this district and i am responsible for your welfare  the elderly gentleman the guardians do you take me for a pauper  the woman i do not know what a pauper is you must tell me who you are if it is possible for you to express yourself intelligibly  the elderly gentleman snorts indignantly  the woman continuingand why you are wandering here alone without a nurse  the elderly gentleman outraged nurse  the woman shortlived visitors are not allowed to go about here without nurses do you not know that rules are meant to be kept  the elderly gentleman by the lower classes no doubt but to persons in my position there are certain courtesies which are never denied by wellbred people and  the woman there are only two human classes here the shortlived and the normal the rules apply to the shortlived and are for their own protection now tell me at once who you are  the elderly gentleman impressively madam i am a retired gentleman formerly chairman of the allbritish synthetic egg and vegetable cheese trust in baghdad and now president of the british historical and archaeological society and a vicepresident of the travellers club  the woman all that does not matter  the elderly gentleman again snorting hm indeed  the woman have you been sent here to make your mind flexible  the elderly gentleman what an extraordinary question pray do you find my mind noticeably stiff  the woman perhaps you do not know that you are on the west coast of ireland and that it is the practice among natives of the eastern island to spend some years here to acquire mental flexibility the climate has that effect  the elderly gentleman haughtily i was born not in the eastern island but thank god in dear old british baghdad and i am not in need of a mental health resort  the woman then why are you here  the elderly gentleman am i trespassing i was not aware of it  the woman trespassing i do not understand the word  the elderly gentleman is this land private property if so i make no claim i proffer a shilling in satisfaction of damage if any and am ready to withdraw if you will be good enough to shew me the nearest way he offers her a shilling  the woman taking it and examining it without much interest i do not understand a single word of what you have just said  the elderly gentleman i am speaking the plainest english are you the landlord  the woman shaking her head there is a tradition in this part of the country of an animal with a name like that it used to be hunted and shot in the barbarous ages it is quite extinct now  the elderly gentleman breaking down again it is a dreadful thing to be in a country where nobody understands civilized institutions he collapses on the bollard struggling with his rising sobs excuse me hay fever  the woman taking a tuningfork from her girdle and holding it to her ear then speaking into space on one note like a chorister intoning a psalm burrin pier galway please send someone to take charge of a discouraged shortliver who has escaped from his nurse male harmless babbles unintelligibly with moments of sense distressed hysterical foreign dress very funny has curious fringe of white seaweed under his chin  the gentleman this is a gross impertinence an insult  the woman replacing her tuningfork and addressing the elderly gentleman these words mean nothing to me in what capacity are you here how did you obtain permission to visit us  the elderly gentleman importantly our prime minister mr badger bluebin has come to consult the oracle he is my soninlaw we are accompanied by his wife and daughter my daughter and granddaughter i may mention that general aufsteig who is one of our party is really the emperor of turania travelling incognito i understand he has a question to put to the oracle informally i have come solely to visit the country  the woman why should you come to a place where you have no business  the elderly gentleman great heavens madam can anything be more natural i shall be the only member of the travellers club who has set foot on these shores think of that my position will be unique  the woman is that an advantage we have a person here who has lost both legs in an accident his position is unique but he would much rather be like everyone else  the elderly gentleman this is maddening there is no analogy whatever between the two cases  the woman they are both unique  the elderly gentleman conversation in this place seems to consist of ridiculous quibbles i am heartily tired of them  the woman i conclude that your travellers club is an assembly of persons who wish to be able to say that they have been in some place where nobody else has been  the elderly gentleman of course if you wish to sneer at us  the woman what is sneer  the elderly gentleman with a wild sob i shall drown myself  he makes desperately for the edge of the pier but is confronted by a man with the number one on his cap who comes up the steps and intercepts him he is dressed like the woman but a slight moustache proclaims his sex  the man to the elderly gentleman ah here you are i shall really have to put a collar and lead on you if you persist in giving me the slip like this  the woman are you this strangers nurse  the man yes i am very tired of him if i take my eyes off him for a moment he runs away and talks to everybody  the woman after taking out her tuningfork and sounding it intones as before burrin pier wash out she puts up the fork and addresses the man i sent a call for someone to take care of him i have been trying to talk to him but i can understand very little of what he says you must take better care of him he is badly discouraged already if i can be of any further use fusima gort will find me she goes away  the elderly gentleman any further use she has been of no use to me she spoke to me without any introduction like any improper female and she has made off with my shilling  the man please speak slowly i cannot follow what is a shilling what is an introduction improper female doesnt make sense  the elderly gentleman nothing seems to make sense here all i can tell you is that she was the most impenetrably stupid woman i have ever met in the whole course of my life  the man that cannot be she cannot appear stupid to you she is a secondary and getting on for a tertiary at that  the elderly gentleman what is a tertiary everybody here keeps talking to me about primaries and secondaries and tertiaries as if people were geological strata  the man the primaries are in their first century the secondaries are in their second century i am still classed as a primary he points to his number but i may almost call myself a secondary as i shall be ninetyfive next january the tertiaries are in their third century did you not see the number two on her badge she is an advanced secondary  the elderly gentleman that accounts for it she is in her second childhood  the man her second childhood she is in her fifth childhood  the elderly gentleman again resorting to the bollard oh i cannot bear these unnatural arrangements  the man impatient and helpless you shouldnt have come among us this is no place for you  the elderly gentleman nerved by indignation may i ask why i am a vicepresident of the travellers club i have been everywhere i hold the record in the club for civilized countries  the man what is a civilized country  the elderly gentleman it iswell it is a civilized country desperately i dont know iiii shall go mad if you keep on asking me to tell you things that everybody knows countries where you can travel comfortably where there are good hotels excuse me but though you say you are ninetyfour you are worse company than a child of five with your eternal questions why not call me daddy at once  the man i did not know your name was daddy  the elderly gentleman my name is joseph popham bolge bluebin barlow om  the man that is five mens names daddy is shorter and om will not do here it is our name for certain wild creatures descendants of the aboriginal inhabitants of this coast they used to be called the omulligans we will stick to daddy  the elderly gentleman people will think i am your father  the man shocked shsh people here never allude to such relationships it is not quite delicate is it what does it matter whether you are my father or not  the elderly gentleman my worthy nonagenarian friend your faculties are totally decayed could you not find me a guide of my own age  the man a young person  the elderly gentleman certainly not i cannot go about with a young person  the man why  the elderly gentleman why why why have you no moral sense  the man i shall have to give you up i cannot understand you  the elderly gentleman but you meant a young woman didnt you  the man i meant simply somebody of your own age what difference does it make whether the person is a man or a woman  the elderly gentleman i could not have believed in the existence of such scandalous insensibility to the elementary decencies of human intercourse  the man what are decencies  the elderly gentleman shrieking everyone asks me that  the man taking out a tuningfork and using it as the woman did zozim on burrin pier to zoo ennistymon i have found the discouraged shortliver he has been talking to a secondary and is much worse i am too old he is asking for someone of his own age or younger come if you can he puts up his fork and turns to the elderly gentleman zoo is a girl of fifty and rather childish at that so perhaps she may make you happy  the elderly gentleman make me happy a bluestocking of fifty thank you  the man bluestocking the effort to make out your meaning is fatiguing besides you are talking too much to me i am old enough to discourage you let us be silent until zoo comes he turns his back on the elderly gentleman and sits down on the edge of the pier with his legs dangling over the water  the elderly gentleman certainly i have no wish to force my conversation on any man who does not desire it perhaps you would like to take a nap if so pray do not stand on ceremony  the man what is a nap  the elderly gentleman exasperated going to him and speaking with great precision and distinctness a nap my friend is a brief period of sleep which overtakes superannuated persons when they endeavor to entertain unwelcome visitors or to listen to scientific lectures sleep sleep bawling into his ear sleep  the man i tell you i am nearly a secondary i never sleep  the elderly gentleman awestruck good heavens  a young woman with the number one on her cap arrives by land she looks no older than savvy barnabas whom she somewhat resembles looked a thousand years before younger if anything  the young woman is this the patient  the man scrambling up this is zoo to zoo call him daddy  the elderly gentleman vehemently no  the man ignoring the interruption bless you for taking him off my hands i have had as much of him as i can bear he goes down the steps and disappears  the elderly gentleman ironically taking off his hat and making a sweeping bow from the edge of the pier in the direction of the atlantic ocean good afternoon sir and thank you very much for your extraordinary politeness your exquisite consideration for my feelings your courtly manners thank you from the bottom of my heart clapping his hat on again pig ass  zoo laughs very heartily at him  the elderly gentleman turning sharply on her good afternoon madam i am sorry to have had to put your friend in his place but i find that here as elsewhere it is necessary to assert myself if i am to be treated with proper consideration i had hoped that my position as a guest would protect me from insult  zoo putting my friend in his place that is some poetic expression is it not what does it mean  the elderly gentleman pray is there no one in these islands who understands plain english  zoo well nobody except the oracles they have to make a special historical study of what we call the dead thought  the elderly gentleman dead thought i have heard of the dead languages but never of the dead thought  zoo well thoughts die sooner than languages i understand your language but i do not always understand your thought the oracles will understand you perfectly have you had your consultation yet  the elderly gentleman i did not come to consult the oracle madam i am here simply as a gentleman travelling for pleasure in the company of my daughter who is the wife of the british prime minister and of general aufsteig who i may tell you in confidence is really the emperor of turania the greatest military genius of the age  zoo why should you travel for pleasure can you not enjoy yourself at home  the elderly gentleman i wish to see the world  zoo it is too big you can see a bit of it anywhere  the elderly gentleman out of patience damn it madam you dont want to spend your life looking at the same bit of it checking himself i beg your pardon for swearing in your presence  zoo oh that is swearing is it i have read about that it sounds quite pretty dammitmaddam dammitmaddam dammitmaddam dammitmaddam say it as often as you please i like it  the elderly gentleman expanding with intense relief bless you for those profane but familiar words thank you thank you for the first time since i landed in this terrible country i begin to feel at home the strain which was driving me mad relaxes i feel almost as if i were at the club excuse my taking the only available seat i am not so young as i was he sits on the bollard promise me that you will not hand me over to one of these dreadful tertiaries or secondaries or whatever you call them  zoo never fear they had no business to give you in charge to zozim you see he is just on the verge of becoming a secondary and these adolescents will give themselves the airs of tertiaries you naturally feel more at home with a flapper like me she makes herself comfortable on the sacks  the elderly gentleman flapper what does that mean  zoo it is an archaic word which we still use to describe a female who is no longer a girl and is not yet quite adult  the elderly gentleman a very agreeable age to associate with i find i am recovering rapidly i have a sense of blossoming like a flower may i ask your name  zoo zoo  the elderly gentleman miss zoo  zoo not miss zoo zoo  the elderly gentleman precisely erzoo what  zoo no not zoo what zoo nothing but zoo  the elderly gentleman puzzled mrs zoo perhaps  zoo no zoo cant you catch it zoo  the elderly gentleman of course believe me i did not really think you were married you are obviously too young but here it is so hard to feel sureer  zoo hopelessly puzzled what  the elderly gentleman marriage makes a difference you know one can say things to a married lady that would perhaps be in questionable taste to anyone without that experience  zoo you are getting out of my depth i dont understand a word you are saying married and questionable taste convey nothing to me stop though is married an old form of the word mothered  the elderly gentleman very likely let us drop the subject pardon me for embarrassing you i should not have mentioned it  zoo what does embarrassing mean  the elderly gentleman well really i should have thought that so natural and common a condition would be understood as long as human nature lasted to embarrass is to bring a blush to the cheek  zoo what is a blush  the elderly gentleman amazed dont you blush  zoo never heard of it we have a word flush meaning a rush of blood to the skin i have noticed it in my babies but not after the age of two  the elderly gentleman your babies i fear i am treading on very delicate ground but your appearance is extremely youthful and if i may ask how many  zoo only four as yet it is a long business with us i specialize in babies my first was such a success that they made me go on i  the elderly gentleman reeling on the bollard oh dear  zoo whats the matter anything wrong  the elderly gentleman in heavens name madam how old are you  zoo fiftysix  the elderly gentleman my knees are trembling i fear i am really ill not so young as i was  zoo i noticed that you are not strong on your legs yet you have many of the ways and weaknesses of a baby no doubt that is why i feel called on to mother you you certainly are a very silly little daddy  the elderly gentleman stimulated by indignation my name i repeat is joseph popham bolge bluebin barlow om  zoo what a ridiculously long name i cant call you all that what did your mother call you  the elderly gentleman you recall the bitterest struggles of my childhood i was sensitive on the point children suffer greatly from absurd nicknames my mother thoughtlessly called me iddy toodles i was called iddy until i went to school when i made my first stand for childrens rights by insisting on being called at least joe at fifteen i refused to answer to anything shorter than joseph at eighteen i discovered that the name joseph was supposed to indicate an unmanly prudery because of some old story about a joseph who rejected the advances of his employers wife very properly in my opinion i then became popham to my family and intimate friends and mister barlow to the rest of the world my mother slipped back into iddy when her faculties began to fail her poor woman but i could not resent that at her age  zoo do you mean to say that your mother bothered about you after you were ten  the elderly gentleman naturally madam she was my mother what would you have had her do  zoo go on to the next of course after eight or nine children become quite uninteresting except to themselves i shouldnt know my two eldest if i met them  the elderly gentleman again drooping i am dying let me die i wish to die  zoo going to him quickly and supporting him hold up sit up straight whats the matter  the elderly gentleman faintly my spine i think shock concussion  zoo maternally pow wow wow what is there to shock you shaking him playfully there sit up and be good  the elderly gentleman still feebly thank you i am better now  zoo resuming her seat on the sacks but what was all the rest of that long name for there was a lot more of it blops booby or something  the elderly gentleman impressively bolge bluebin madam a historical name let me inform you that i can trace my family back for more than a thousand years from the eastern empire to its ancient seat in these islands to a time when two of my ancestors joyce bolge and hengist horsa bluebin wrestled with one another for the prime ministership of the british empire and occupied that position successively with a glory of which we can in these degenerate days form but a faint conception when i think of these mighty men lions in war sages in peace not babblers and charlatans like the pigmies who now occupy their places in baghdad but strong silent men ruling an empire on which the sun never set my eyes fill with tears my heart bursts with emotion i feel that to have lived but to the dawn of manhood in their day and then died for them would have been a nobler and happier lot than the ignominious ease of my present longevity  zoo longevity she laughs  the elderly gentleman yes madam relative longevity as it is i have to be content and proud to know that i am descended from both those heroes  zoo you must be descended from every briton who was alive in their time dont you know that  the elderly gentleman do not quibble madam i bear their names bolge and bluebin and i hope i have inherited something of their majestic spirit well they were born in these islands i repeat these islands were then incredible as it now seems the centre of the british empire when that centre shifted to baghdad and the englishman at last returned to the true cradle of his race in mesopotamia the western islands were cast off as they had been before by the roman empire but it was to the british race and in these islands that the greatest miracle in history occurred  zoo miracle  the elderly gentleman yes the first man to live three hundred years was an englishman the first that is since the contemporaries of methuselah  zoo oh that  the elderly gentleman yes that as you call it so flippantly are you aware madam that at that immortal moment the english race had lost intellectual credit to such an extent that they habitually spoke of one another as fatheads yet england is now a sacred grove to which statesmen from all over the earth come to consult english sages who speak with the experience of two and a half centuries of life the land that once exported cotton shirts and hardware now exports nothing but wisdom you see before you madam a man utterly weary of the weekend riverside hotels of the euphrates the minstrels and pierrots on the sands of the persian gulf the toboggans and funiculars of the hindoo koosh can you wonder that i turn with a hungry heart to the mystery and beauty of these haunted islands thronged with spectres from a magic past made holy by the footsteps of the wise men of the west consider this island on which we stand the last foothold of man on this side of the atlantic this ireland described by the earliest bards as an emerald gem set in a silver sea can i a scion of the illustrious british race ever forget that when the empire transferred its seat to the east and said to the turbulent irish race which it had oppressed but never conquered at last we leave you to yourselves and much good may it do you the irish as one man uttered the historic shout no well be damned if you do and emigrated to the countries where there was still a nationalist question to india persia and corea to morocco tunis and tripoli in these countries they were ever foremost in the struggle for national independence and the world rang continually with the story of their sufferings and wrongs and what poem can do justice to the end when it came at last hardly two hundred years had elapsed when the claims of nationality were so universally conceded that there was no longer a single country on the face of the earth with a national grievance or a national movement think of the position of the irish who had lost all their political faculties by disuse except that of nationalist agitation and who owed their position as the most interesting race on earth solely to their sufferings the very countries they had helped to set free boycotted them as intolerable bores the communities which had once idolized them as the incarnation of all that is adorable in the warm heart and witty brain fled from them as from a pestilence to regain their lost prestige the irish claimed the city of jerusalem on the ground that they were the lost tribes of israel but on their approach the jews abandoned the city and redistributed themselves throughout europe it was then that these devoted irishmen not one of whom had ever seen ireland were counselled by an english archbishop the father of the oracles to go back to their own country this had never once occurred to them because there was nothing to prevent them and nobody to forbid them they jumped at the suggestion they landed here here in galway bay on this very ground when they reached the shore the older men and women flung themselves down and passionately kissed the soil of ireland calling on the young to embrace the earth that had borne their ancestors but the young looked gloomily on and said there is no earth only stone you will see by looking round you why they said that the fields here are of stone the hills are capped with granite they all left for england next day and no irishman ever again confessed to being irish even to his own children so that when that generation passed away the irish race vanished from human knowledge and the dispersed jews did the same lest they should be sent back to palestine since then the world bereft of its jews and its irish has been a tame dull place is there no pathos for you in this story can you not understand now why i am come to visit the scene of this tragic effacement of a race of heroes and poets  zoo we still tell our little children stories like that to help them to understand but such things do not happen really that scene of the irish landing here and kissing the ground might have happened to a hundred people it couldnt have happened to a hundred thousand you know that as well as i do and what a ridiculous thing to call people irish because they live in ireland you might as well call them airish because they live in air they must be just the same as other people why do you shortlivers persist in making up silly stories about the world and trying to act as if they were true contact with truth hurts and frightens you you escape from it into an imaginary vacuum in which you can indulge your desires and hopes and loves and hates without any obstruction from the solid facts of life you love to throw dust in your own eyes  the elderly gentleman it is my turn now madam to inform you that i do not understand a single word you are saying i should have thought that the use of a vacuum for removing dust was a mark of civilization rather than of savagery  zoo giving him up as hopeless oh daddy daddy i can hardly believe that you are human you are so stupid it was well said of your people in the olden days dust thou art and to dust thou shalt return  the elderly gentleman nobly my body is dust madam not my soul what does it matter what my body is made of the dust of the ground the particles of the air or even the slime of the ditch the important thing is that when my creator took it whatever it was he breathed into its nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul yes madam a living soul i am not the dust of the ground i am a living soul that is an exalting a magnificent thought it is also a great scientific fact i am not interested in the chemicals and the microbes i leave them to the chumps and noodles to the blockheads and the muckrakers who are incapable of their own glorious destiny and unconscious of their own divinity they tell me there are leucocytes in my blood and sodium and carbon in my flesh i thank them for the information and tell them that there are blackbeetles in my kitchen washing soda in my laundry and coal in my cellar i do not deny their existence but i keep them in their proper place which is not if i may be allowed to use an antiquated form of expression the temple of the holy ghost no doubt you think me behind the times but i rejoice in my enlightenment and i recoil from your ignorance your blindness your imbecility humanly i pity you intellectually i despise you  zoo bravo daddy you have the root of the matter in you you will not die of discouragement after all  the elderly gentleman i have not the smallest intention of doing so madam i am no longer young and i have moments of weakness but when i approach this subject the divine spark in me kindles and glows the corruptible becomes incorruptible and the mortal bolge bluebin barlow puts on immortality on this ground i am your equal even if you survive me by ten thousand years  zoo yes but what do we know about this breath of life that puffs you up so exaltedly just nothing so let us shake hands as cultivated agnostics and change the subject  the elderly gentleman cultivated fiddlesticks madam you cannot change this subject until the heavens and the earth pass away i am not an agnostic i am a gentleman when i believe a thing i say i believe it when i dont believe it i say i dont believe it i do not shirk my responsibilities by pretending that i know nothing and therefore can believe nothing we cannot disclaim knowledge and shirk responsibility we must proceed on assumptions of some sort or we cannot form a human society  zoo the assumptions must be scientific daddy we must live by science in the long run  the elderly gentleman i have the utmost respect madam for the magnificent discoveries which we owe to science but any fool can make a discovery every baby has to discover more in the first years of its life than roger bacon ever discovered in his laboratory when i was seven years old i discovered the sting of the wasp but i do not ask you to worship me on that account i assure you madam the merest mediocrities can discover the most surprising facts about the physical universe as soon as they are civilized enough to have time to study these things and to invent instruments and apparatus for research but what is the consequence their discoveries discredit the simple stories of our religion at first we had no idea of astronomical space we believed the sky to be only the ceiling of a room as large as the earth with another room on top of it death was to us a going upstairs into that room or if we did not obey the priests going downstairs into the coal cellar we founded our religion our morality our laws our lessons our poems our prayers on that simple belief well the moment men became astronomers and made telescopes their belief perished when they could no longer believe in the sky they found that they could no longer believe in their deity because they had always thought of him as living in the sky when the priests themselves ceased to believe in their deity and began to believe in astronomy they changed their name and their dress and called themselves doctors and men of science they set up a new religion in which there was no deity but only wonders and miracles with scientific instruments and apparatus as the wonder workers instead of worshipping the greatness and wisdom of the deity men gaped foolishly at the million billion miles of space and worshipped the astronomer as infallible and omniscient they built temples for his telescopes then they looked into their own bodies with microscopes and found there not the soul they had formerly believed in but millions of microorganisms so they gaped at these as foolishly as at the millions of miles and built microscope temples in which horrible sacrifices were offered they even gave their own bodies to be sacrificed by the microscope man who was worshipped like the astronomer as infallible and omniscient thus our discoveries instead of increasing our wisdom only destroyed the little childish wisdom we had all i can grant you is that they increased our knowledge  zoo nonsense consciousness of a fact is not knowledge of it if it were the fish would know more of the sea than the geographers and the naturalists  the elderly gentleman that is an extremely acute remark madam the dullest fish could not possibly know less of the majesty of the ocean than many geographers and naturalists of my acquaintance  zoo just so and the greatest fool on earth by merely looking at a mariners compass may become conscious of the fact that the needle turns always to the pole is he any the less a fool with that consciousness than he was without it  the elderly gentleman only a more conceited one madam no doubt still i do not quite see how you can be aware of the existence of a thing without knowing it  zoo well you can see a man without knowing him can you not  the elderly gentleman illuminated oh how true of course of course there is a member of the travellers club who has questioned the veracity of an experience of mine at the south pole i see that man almost every day when i am at home but i refuse to know him  zoo if you could see him much more distinctly through a magnifying glass or examine a drop of his blood through a microscope or dissect out all his organs and analyze them chemically would you know him then  the elderly gentleman certainly not any such investigation could only increase the disgust with which he inspires me and make me more determined than ever not to know him on any terms  zoo yet you would be much more conscious of him would you not  the elderly gentleman i should not allow that to commit me to any familiarity with the fellow i have been twice at the summer sports at the south pole and this man pretended he had been to the north pole which can hardly be said to exist as it is in the middle of the sea he declared he had hung his hat on it  zoo laughing he knew that travellers are amusing only when they are telling lies perhaps if you looked at that man through a microscope you would find some good in him  the elderly gentleman i do not want to find any good in him besides madam what you have just said encourages me to utter an opinion of mine which is so advanced so intellectually daring that i have never ventured to confess to it before lest i should be imprisoned for blasphemy or even burnt alive  zoo indeed what opinion is that  the elderly gentleman after looking cautiously round i do not approve of microscopes i never have  zoo you call that advanced oh daddy that is pure obscurantism  the elderly gentleman call it so if you will madam but i maintain that it is dangerous to shew too much to people who do not know what they are looking at i think that a man who is sane as long as he looks at the world through his own eyes is very likely to become a dangerous madman if he takes to looking at the world through telescopes and microscopes even when he is telling fairy stories about giants and dwarfs the giants had better not be too big nor the dwarfs too small and too malicious before the microscope came our fairy stories only made the childrens flesh creep pleasantly and did not frighten grownup persons at all but the microscope men terrified themselves and everyone else out of their wits with the invisible monsters they saw poor harmless little things that die at the touch of a ray of sunshine and are themselves the victims of all the diseases they are supposed to produce whatever the scientific people may say imagination without microscopes was kindly and often courageous because it worked on things of which it had some real knowledge but imagination with microscopes working on a terrifying spectacle of millions of grotesque creatures of whose nature it had no knowledge became a cruel terrorstricken persecuting delirium are you aware madam that a general massacre of men of science took place in the twentyfirst century of the pseudochristian era when all their laboratories were demolished and all their apparatus destroyed  zoo yes the shortlived are as savage in their advances as in their relapses but when science crept back it had been taught its place the mere collectors of anatomical or chemical facts were not supposed to know more about science than the collector of used postage stamps about international trade or literature the scientific terrorist who was afraid to use a spoon or a tumbler until he had dipt it in some poisonous acid to kill the microbes was no longer given titles pensions and monstrous powers over the bodies of other people he was sent to an asylum and treated there until his recovery but all that is an old story the extension of life to three hundred years has provided the human race with capable leaders and made short work of such childish stuff  the elderly gentleman pettishly you seem to credit every advance in civilization to your inordinately long lives do you not know that this question was familiar to men who died before they had reached my own age  zoo oh yes one or two of them hinted at it in a feeble way an ancient writer whose name has come down to us in several forms such as shakespear shelley sheridan and shoddy has a remarkable passage about your dispositions being horridly shaken by thoughts beyond the reaches of your souls that does not come to much does it  the elderly gentleman at all events madam i may remind you if you come to capping ages that whatever your secondaries and tertiaries may be you are younger than i am  zoo yes daddy but it is not the number of years we have behind us but the number we have before us that makes us careful and responsible and determined to find out the truth about everything what does it matter to you whether anything is true or not your flesh is as grass you come up like a flower and wither in your second childhood a lie will last your time it will not last mine if i knew i had to die in twenty years it would not be worth my while to educate myself i should not bother about anything but having a little pleasure while i lasted  the elderly gentleman young woman you are mistaken shortlived as we are wethe best of us i meanregard civilization and learning art and science as an everburning torch which passes from the hand of one generation to the hand of the next each generation kindling it to a brighter prouder flame thus each lifetime however short contributes a brick to a vast and growing edifice a page to a sacred volume a chapter to a bible a bible to a literature we may be insects but like the coral insect we build islands which become continents like the bee we store sustenance for future communities the individual perishes but the race is immortal the acorn of today is the oak of the next millennium i throw my stone on the cairn and die but later comers add another stone and yet another and lo a mountain i  zoo interrupts him by laughing heartily at him  the elderly gentleman with offended dignity may i ask what i have said that calls for this merriment  zoo oh daddy daddy daddy you are a funny little man with your torches and your flames and your bricks and edifices and pages and volumes and chapters and coral insects and bees and acorns and stones and mountains  the elderly gentleman metaphors madam metaphors merely  zoo images images images i was talking about men not about images  the elderly gentleman i was illustratingnot i hope quite infelicitouslythe great march of progress i was shewing you how shortlived as we orientals are mankind gains in stature from generation to generation from epoch to epoch from barbarism to civilization from civilization to perfection  zoo i see the father grows to be six feet high and hands on his six feet to his son who adds another six feet and becomes twelve feet high and hands his twelve feet on to his son who is fullgrown at eighteen feet and so on in a thousand years you would all be three or four miles high at that rate your ancestors bilge and bluebeard whom you call giants must have been about quarter of an inch high  the elderly gentleman i am not here to bandy quibbles and paradoxes with a girl who blunders over the greatest names in history i am in earnest i am treating a solemn theme seriously i never said that the son of a man six feet high would be twelve feet high  zoo you didnt mean that  the elderly gentleman most certainly not  zoo then you didnt mean anything now listen to me you little ephemeral thing i knew quite well what you meant by your torch handed on from generation to generation but every time that torch is handed on it dies down to the tiniest spark and the man who gets it can rekindle it only by his own light you are no taller than bilge or bluebeard and you are no wiser their wisdom such as it was perished with them so did their strength if their strength ever existed outside your imagination i do not know how old you are you look about five hundred  the elderly gentleman five hundred really madam  zoo continuing but i know of course that you are an ordinary shortliver well your wisdom is only such wisdom as a man can have before he has had experience enough to distinguish his wisdom from his folly his destiny from his delusions his  the elderly gentleman in short such wisdom as your own  zoo no no no no how often must i tell you that we are made wise not by the recollections of our past but by the responsibilities of our future i shall be more reckless when i am a tertiary than i am today if you cannot understand that at least you must admit that i have learnt from tertiaries i have seen their work and lived under their institutions like all young things i rebelled against them and in their hunger for new lights and new ideas they listened to me and encouraged me to rebel but my ways did not work and theirs did and they were able to tell me why they have no power over me except that power they refuse all other power and the consequence is that there are no limits to their power except the limits they set themselves you are a child governed by children who make so many mistakes and are so naughty that you are in continual rebellion against them and as they can never convince you that they are right they can govern you only by beating you imprisoning you torturing you killing you if you disobey them without being strong enough to kill or torture them  the elderly gentleman that may be an unfortunate fact i condemn it and deplore it but our minds are greater than the facts we know better the greatest ancient teachers followed by the galaxy of christs who arose in the twentieth century not to mention such comparatively modern spiritual leaders as blitherinjam tosh and spiffkins all taught that punishment and revenge coercion and militarism are mistakes and that the golden rule  zoo interrupting yes yes yes daddy we longlived people know that quite well but did any of their disciples ever succeed in governing you for a single day on their christlike principles it is not enough to know what is good you must be able to do it they couldnt do it because they did not live long enough to find out how to do it or to outlive the childish passions that prevented them from really wanting to do it you know very well that they could only keep ordersuch as it wasby the very coercion and militarism they were denouncing and deploring they had actually to kill one another for preaching their own gospel or be killed themselves  the elderly gentleman the blood of the martyrs madam is the seed of the church  zoo more images daddy the blood of the shortlived falls on stony ground  the elderly gentleman rising very testy you are simply mad on the subject of longevity i wish you would change it it is rather personal and in bad taste human nature is human nature longlived or shortlived and always will be  zoo then you give up the idea of progress you cry off the torch and the brick and the acorn and all the rest of it  the elderly gentleman i do nothing of the sort i stand for progress and for freedom broadening down from precedent to precedent  zoo you are certainly a true briton  the elderly gentleman i am proud of it but in your mouth i feel that the compliment hides some insult so i do not thank you for it  zoo all i meant was that though britons sometimes say quite clever things and deep things as well as silly and shallow things they always forget them ten minutes after they have uttered them  the elderly gentleman leave it at that madam leave it at that he sits down again even a pope is not expected to be continually pontificating our flashes of inspiration shew that our hearts are in the right place  zoo of course you cannot keep your heart in any place but the right place  the elderly gentleman tcha  zoo but you can keep your hands in the wrong place in your neighbors pockets for example so you see it is your hands that really matter  the elderly gentleman exhausted well a woman must have the last word i will not dispute it with you  zoo good now let us go back to the really interesting subject of our discussion you remember the slavery of the shortlived to images and metaphors  the elderly gentleman aghast do you mean to say madam that after having talked my head off and reduced me to despair and silence by your intolerable loquacity you actually propose to begin all over again i shall leave you at once  zoo you must not i am your nurse and you must stay with me  the elderly gentleman i absolutely decline to do anything of the sort he rises and walks away with marked dignity  zoo using her tuningfork zoo on burrin pier to oracle police at ennistymon have you got me what i am picking you up now but you are flat to my pitch just a shade sharper thats better still a little more got you right isolate burrin pier quick  the elderly gentleman is heard to yell oh  zoo still intoning thanks oh nothing serious i am nursing a shortliver and the silly creature has run away he has discouraged himself very badly by gadding about and talking to secondaries and i must keep him strictly to heel  the elderly gentleman returns indignant  zoo here he is you can release the pier thanks goodbye she puts up her tuningfork  the elderly gentleman this is outrageous when i tried to step off the pier on to the road i received a shock followed by an attack of pins and needles which ceased only when i stepped back on to the stones  zoo yes there is an electric hedge there it is a very old and very crude method of keeping animals from straying  the elderly gentleman we are perfectly familiar with it in baghdad madam but i little thought i should live to have it ignominiously applied to myself you have actually kiplingized me  zoo kiplingized what is that  the elderly gentleman about a thousand years ago there were two authors named kipling one was an eastern and a writer of merit the other being a western was of course only an amusing barbarian he is said to have invented the electric hedge i consider that in using it on me you have taken a very great liberty  zoo what is a liberty  the elderly gentleman exasperated i shall not explain madam i believe you know as well as i do he sits down on the bollard in dudgeon  zoo no even you can tell me things i do not know havnt you noticed that all the time you have been here we have been asking you questions  the elderly gentleman noticed it it has almost driven me mad do you see my white hair it was hardly grey when i landed there were patches of its original auburn still distinctly discernible  zoo that is one of the symptoms of discouragement but have you noticed something much more important to yourself that is that you have never asked us any questions although we know so much more than you do  the elderly gentleman i am not a child madam i believe i have had occasion to say that before and i am an experienced traveller i know that what the traveller observes must really exist or he could not observe it but what the natives tell him is invariably pure fiction  zoo not here daddy with us life is too long for telling lies they all get found out youd better ask me questions while you have the chance  the elderly gentleman if i have occasion to consult the oracle i shall address myself to a proper one to a tertiary not to a primary flapper playing at being an oracle if you are a nurserymaid attend to your duties and do not presume to ape your elders  zoo rising ominously and reddening you silly  the elderly gentleman thundering silence do you hear hold your tongue  zoo something very disagreeable is happening to me i feel hot all over i have a horrible impulse to injure you what have you done to me  the elderly gentleman triumphant aha i have made you blush now you know what blushing means blushing with shame  zoo whatever you are doing it is something so utterly evil that if you do not stop i will kill you  the elderly gentleman apprehending his danger doubtless you think it safe to threaten an old man  zoo fiercely old you are a child an evil child we kill evil children here we do it even against our own wills by instinct take care  the elderly gentleman rising with crestfallen courtesy i did not mean to hurt your feelings iswallowing the apology with an effort i beg your pardon he takes off his hat and bows  zoo what does that mean  the elderly gentleman i withdraw what i said  zoo how can you withdraw what you said  the elderly gentleman i can say no more than that i am sorry  zoo you have reason to be that hideous sensation you gave me is subsiding but you have had a very narrow escape do not attempt to kill me again for at the first sign in your voice or face i shall strike you dead  the elderly gentleman i attempt to kill you what a monstrous accusation  zoo frowns  the elderly gentleman prudently correcting himself i mean misunderstanding i never dreamt of such a thing surely you cannot believe that i am a murderer  zoo i know you are a murderer it is not merely that you threw words at me as if they were stones meaning to hurt me it was the instinct to kill that you roused in me i did not know it was in my nature never before has it wakened and sprung out at me warning me to kill or be killed i must now reconsider my whole political position i am no longer a conservative  the elderly gentleman dropping his hat gracious heavens you have lost your senses i am at the mercy of a madwoman i might have known it from the beginning i can bear no more of this offering his chest for the sacrifice kill me at once and much good may my death do you  zoo it would be useless unless all the other shortlivers were killed at the same time besides it is a measure which should be taken politically and constitutionally not privately however i am prepared to discuss it with you  zoo what good have our counsels ever done you you come to us for advice when you know you are in difficulties but you never know you are in difficulties until twenty years after you have made the mistakes that led to them and then it is too late you cannot understand our advice you often do more mischief by trying to act on it than if you had been left to your own childish devices if you were not childish you would not come to us at all you would learn from experience that your consultations of the oracle are never of any real help to you you draw wonderful imaginary pictures of us and write fictitious tales and poems about our beneficent operations in the past our wisdom our justice our mercy stories in which we often appear as sentimental dupes of your prayers and sacrifices but you do it only to conceal from yourselves the truth that you are incapable of being helped by us your prime minister pretends that he has come to be guided by the oracle but we are not deceived we know quite well that he has come here so that when he goes back he may have the authority and dignity of one who has visited the holy islands and spoken face to face with the ineffable ones he will pretend that all the measures he wishes to take for his own purposes have been enjoined on him by the oracle  the elderly gentleman but you forget that the answers of the oracle cannot be kept secret or misrepresented they are written and promulgated the leader of the opposition can obtain copies all the nations know them secret diplomacy has been totally abolished  zoo yes you publish documents but they are garbled or forged and even if you published our real answers it would make no difference because the shortlived cannot interpret the plainest writings your scriptures command you in the plainest terms to do exactly the contrary of everything your own laws and chosen rulers command and execute you cannot defy nature it is a law of nature that there is a fixed relation between conduct and length of life  the elderly gentleman no no no i had much rather discuss your intention of withdrawing from the conservative party how the conservatives have tolerated your opinions so far is more than i can imagine i can only conjecture that you have contributed very liberally to the party funds he picks up his hat and sits down again  zoo do not babble so senselessly our chief political controversy is the most momentous in the world for you and your like  the elderly gentleman interested indeed pray may i ask what it is i am a keen politician and may perhaps be of some use he puts on his hat cocking it slightly  zoo we have two great parties the conservative party and the colonization party the colonizers are of opinion that we should increase our numbers and colonize the conservatives hold that we should stay as we are confined to these islands a race apart wrapped up in the majesty of our wisdom on a soil held as holy ground for us by an adoring world with our sacred frontier traced beyond dispute by the sea they contend that it is our destiny to rule the world and that even when we were shortlived we did so they say that our power and our peace depend on our remoteness our exclusiveness our separation and the restriction of our numbers five minutes ago that was my political faith now i do not think there should be any shortlived people at all she throws herself again carelessly on the sacks  the elderly gentleman am i to infer that you deny my right to live because i allowed myselfperhaps injudiciouslyto give you a slight scolding  zoo is it worth living for so short a time are you any good to yourself  the elderly gentleman stupent well upon my soul  zoo it is such a very little soul you only encourage the sin of pride in us and keep us looking down at you instead of up to something higher than ourselves  the elderly gentleman is not that a selfish view madam think of the good you do us by your oracular counsels  the elderly gentleman i have never heard of any such law madam  zoo well you are hearing of it now  the elderly gentleman let me tell you that we shortlivers as you call us have lengthened our lives very considerably  zoo how  the elderly gentleman by saving time by enabling men to cross the ocean in an afternoon and to see and speak to one another when they are thousands of miles apart we hope shortly to organize their labor and press natural forces into their service so scientifically that the burden of labor will cease to be perceptible leaving common men more leisure than they will know what to do with  zoo daddy the man whose life is lengthened in this way may be busier than a savage but the difference between such men living seventy years and those living three hundred would be all the greater for to a shortliver increase of years is only increase of sorrow but to a longliver every extra year is a prospect which forces him to stretch his faculties to the utmost to face it therefore i say that we who live three hundred years can be of no use to you who live less than a hundred and that our true destiny is not to advise and govern you but to supplant and supersede you in that faith i now declare myself a colonizer and an exterminator  the elderly gentleman oh steady steady pray pray reflect i implore you it is possible to colonize without exterminating the natives would you treat us less mercifully than our barbarous forefathers treated the redskin and the negro are we not as britons entitled at least to some reservations  zoo what is the use of prolonging the agony you would perish slowly in our presence no matter what we did to preserve you you were almost dead when i took charge of you today merely because you had talked for a few minutes to a secondary besides we have our own experience to go upon have you never heard that our children occasionally revert to the ancestral type and are born shortlived  the elderly gentleman eagerly never i hope you will not be offended if i say that it would be a great comfort to me if i could be placed in charge of one of those normal individuals  zoo abnormal you mean what you ask is impossible we weed them all out  the elderly gentleman when you say that you weed them out you send a cold shiver down my spine i hope you dont mean that youthat youthat you assist nature in any way  zoo why not have you not heard the saying of the chinese sage dee ning that a good garden needs weeding but it is not necessary for us to interfere we are naturally rather particular as to the conditions on which we consent to live one does not mind the accidental loss of an arm or a leg or an eye after all no one with two legs is unhappy because he has not three so why should a man with one be unhappy because he has not two but infirmities of mind and temper are quite another matter if one of us has no selfcontrol or is too weak to bear the strain of our truthful life without wincing or is tormented by depraved appetites and superstitions or is unable to keep free from pain and depression he naturally becomes discouraged and refuses to live  the elderly gentleman good lord cuts his throat do you mean  zoo no why should he cut his throat he simply dies he wants to he is out of countenance as we call it  the elderly gentleman well but suppose he is depraved enough not to want to die and to settle the difficulty by killing all the rest of you  zoo oh he is one of the thoroughly degenerate shortlivers whom we occasionally produce he emigrates  the elderly gentleman and what becomes of him then  zoo you shortlived people always think very highly of him you accept him as what you call a great man  the elderly gentleman you astonish me and yet i must admit that what you tell me accounts for a great deal of the little i know of the private life of our great men we must be very convenient to you as a dumping place for your failures  zoo i admit that  the elderly gentleman good then if you carry out your plan of colonization and leave no shortlived countries in the world what will you do with your undesirables  zoo kill them our tertiaries are not at all squeamish about killing  the elderly gentleman gracious powers  zoo glancing up at the sun come it is just sixteen oclock and you have to join your party at halfpast in the temple in galway  the elderly gentleman rising galway shall i at last be able to boast of having seen that magnificent city  zoo you will be disappointed we have no cities there is a temple of the oracle that is all  the elderly gentleman alas and i came here to fulfil two longcherished dreams one was to see galway it has been said see galway and die the other was to contemplate the ruins of london  zoo ruins we do not tolerate ruins was london a place of any importance  the elderly gentleman amazed what london it was the mightiest city of antiquity rhetorically situate just where the dover road crosses the thames it  zoo curtly interrupting there is nothing there now why should anybody pitch on such a spot to live the nearest houses are at a place called strandonthegreen it is very old come we shall go across the water she goes down the steps  the elderly gentleman sic transit gloria mundi  zoo from below what did you say  the elderly gentleman despairingly nothing you would not understand he goes down the steps     act ii   a courtyard before the columned portico of a temple the temple door is in the middle of the portico a veiled and robed woman of majestic carriage passes along behind the columns towards the entrance from the opposite direction a man of compact figure cleanshaven saturnine and selfcentred in short very like napoleon i and wearing a military uniform of napoleonic cut marches with measured steps places his hand in his lapel in the traditional manner and fixes the woman with his eye she stops her attitude expressing haughty amazement at his audacity he is on her right she on his left  napoleon impressively i am the man of destiny  the veiled woman unimpressed how did you get in here  napoleon i walked in i go on until i am stopped i never am stopped i tell you i am the man of destiny  the veiled woman you will be a man of very short destiny if you wander about here without one of our children to guide you i suppose you belong to the baghdad envoy  napoleon i came with him but i do not belong to him i belong to myself direct me to the oracle if you can if not do not waste my time  the veiled woman your time poor creature is short i will not waste it your envoy and his party will be here presently the consultation of the oracle is arranged for them and will take place according to the prescribed ritual you can wait here until they come she turns to go into the temple  napoleon i never wait she stops the prescribed ritual is i believe the classical one of the pythoness on her tripod the intoxicating fumes arising from the abyss the convulsions of the priestess as she delivers the message of the god and so on that sort of thing does not impose on me i use it myself to impose on simpletons i believe that what is is i know that what is not is not the antics of a woman sitting on a tripod and pretending to be drunk do not interest me her words are put into her mouth not by a god but by a man three hundred years old who has had the capacity to profit by his experience i wish to speak to that man face to face without mummery or imposture  the veiled woman you seem to be an unusually sensible person but there is no old man i am the oracle on duty today i am on my way to take my place on the tripod and go through the usual mummery as you rightly call it to impress your friend the envoy as you are superior to that kind of thing you may consult me now she leads the way into the middle of the courtyard what do you want to know  napoleon following her madam i have not come all this way to discuss matters of state with a woman i must ask you to direct me to one of your oldest and ablest men  the oracle none of our oldest and ablest men or women would dream of wasting their time on you you would die of discouragement in their presence in less than three hours  napoleon you can keep this idle fable of discouragement for people credulous enough to be intimidated by it madam i do not believe in metaphysical forces  the oracle no one asks you to a field is something physical is it not well i have a field  napoleon i have several million fields i am emperor of turania  the oracle you do not understand i am not speaking of an agricultural field do you not know that every mass of matter in motion carries with it an invisible gravitational field every magnet an invisible magnetic field and every living organism a mesmeric field even you have a perceptible mesmeric field feeble as it is it is the strongest i have yet observed in a shortliver  napoleon by no means feeble madam i understand you now and i may tell you that the strongest characters blench in my presence and submit to my domination but i do not call that a physical force  the oracle what else do you call it pray our physicists deal with it our mathematicians express its measurements in algebraic equations  napoleon do you mean that they could measure mine  the oracle yes by a figure infinitely near to zero even in us the force is negligible during our first century of life in our second it develops quickly and becomes dangerous to shortlivers who venture into its field if i were not veiled and robed in insulating material you could not endure my presence and i am still a young woman one hundred and seventy if you wish to know exactly  napoleon folding his arms i am not intimidated no woman alive old or young can put me out of countenance unveil madam disrobe you will move this temple as easily as shake me  the oracle very well she throws back her veil  napoleon shrieking staggering and covering his eyes no stop hide your face again shutting his eyes and distractedly clutching at his throat and heart let me go help i am dying  the oracle do you still wish to consult an older person  napoleon no no the veil the veil i beg you  the oracle replacing the veil so  napoleon ouf one cannot always be at ones best twice before in my life i have lost my nerve and behaved like a poltroon but i warn you not to judge my quality by these involuntary moments  the oracle i have no occasion to judge of your quality you want my advice speak quickly or i shall go about my business  napoleon after a moments hesitation sinks respectfully on one knee i  the oracle oh rise rise are you so foolish as to offer me this mummery which even you despise  napoleon rising i knelt in spite of myself i compliment you on your impressiveness madam  the oracle impatiently time time time time  napoleon you will not grudge me the necessary time madam when you know my case i am a man gifted with a certain specific talent in a degree altogether extraordinary i am not otherwise a very extraordinary person my family is not influential and without this talent i should cut no particular figure in the world  the oracle why cut a figure in the world  napoleon superiority will make itself felt madam but when i say i possess this talent i do not express myself accurately the truth is that my talent possesses me it is genius it drives me to exercise it i must exercise it i am great when i exercise it at other moments i am nobody  the oracle well exercise it do you need an oracle to tell you that  napoleon wait this talent involves the shedding of human blood  the oracle are you a surgeon or a dentist  napoleon psha you do not appreciate me madam i mean the shedding of oceans of blood the death of millions of men  the oracle they object i suppose  napoleon not at all they adore me  the oracle indeed  napoleon i have never shed blood with my own hand they kill each other they die with shouts of triumph on their lips those who die cursing do not curse me my talent is to organize this slaughter to give mankind this terrible joy which they call glory to let loose the devil in them that peace has bound in chains  the oracle and you do you share their joy  napoleon not at all what satisfaction is it to me to see one fool pierce the entrails of another with a bayonet i am a man of princely character but of simple personal tastes and habits i have the virtues of a laborer industry and indifference to personal comfort but i must rule because i am so superior to other men that it is intolerable to me to be misruled by them yet only as a slayer can i become a ruler i cannot be great as a writer i have tried and failed i have no talent as a sculptor or painter and as lawyer preacher doctor or actor scores of secondrate men can do as well as i or better i am not even a diplomatist i can only play my trump card of force what i can do is to organize war look at me i seem a man like other men because ninetenths of me is common humanity but the other tenth is a faculty for seeing things as they are that no other man possesses  the oracle you mean that you have no imagination  napoleon forcibly i mean that i have the only imagination worth having the power of imagining things as they are even when i cannot see them you feel yourself my superior i know nay you are my superior have i not bowed my knee to you by instinct yet i challenge you to a test of our respective powers can you calculate what the methematicians call vectors without putting a single algebraic symbol on paper can you launch ten thousand men across a frontier and a chain of mountains and know to a mile exactly where they will be at the end of seven weeks the rest is nothing i got it all from the books at my military school now this great game of war this playing with armies as other men play with bowls and skittles is one which i must go on playing partly because a man must do what he can and not what he would like to do and partly because if i stop i immediately lose my power and become a beggar in the land where i now make men drunk with glory  the oracle no doubt then you wish to know how to extricate yourself from this unfortunate position  napoleon it is not generally considered unfortunate madam supremely fortunate rather  the oracle if you think so go on making them drunk with glory why trouble me with their folly and your vectors  napoleon unluckily madam men are not only heroes they are also cowards they desire glory but they dread death  the oracle why should they their lives are too short to be worth living that is why they think your game of war worth playing  napoleon they do not look at it quite in that way the most worthless soldier wants to live for ever to make him risk being killed by the enemy i have to convince him that if he hesitates he will inevitably be shot at dawn by his own comrades for cowardice  the oracle and if his comrades refuse to shoot him  napoleon they will be shot too of course  the oracle by whom  napoleon by their comrades  the oracle and if they refuse  napoleon up to a certain point they do not refuse  the oracle but when that point is reached you have to do the shooting yourself eh  napoleon unfortunately madam when that point is reached they shoot me  the oracle mf it seems to me they might as well shoot you first as last why dont they  napoleon because their love of fighting their desire for glory their shame of being branded as dastards their instinct to test themselves in terrible trials their fear of being killed or enslaved by the enemy their belief that they are defending their hearths and homes overcome their natural cowardice and make them willing not only to risk their own lives but to kill everyone who refuses to take that risk but if war continues too long there comes a time when the soldiers and also the taxpayers who are supporting and munitioning them reach a condition which they describe as being fed up the troops have proved their courage and want to go home and enjoy in peace the glory it has earned them besides the risk of death for each soldier becomes a certainty if the fighting goes on for ever he hopes to escape for six months but knows he cannot escape for six years the risk of bankruptcy for the citizen becomes a certainty in the same way now what does this mean for me  the oracle does that matter in the midst of such calamity  napoleon psha madam it is the only thing that matters the value of human life is the value of the greatest living man cut off that infinitesimal layer of grey matter which distinguishes my brain from that of the common man and you cut down the stature of humanity from that of a giant to that of a nobody i matter supremely my soldiers do not matter at all there are plenty more where they came from if you kill me or put a stop to my activity it is the same thing the nobler part of human life perishes you must save the world from that catastrophe madam war has made me popular powerful famous historically immortal but i foresee that if i go on to the end it will leave me execrated dethroned imprisoned perhaps executed yet if i stop fighting i commit suicide as a great man and become a common one how am i to escape the horns of this tragic dilemma victory i can guarantee i am invincible but the cost of victory is the demoralization the depopulation the ruin of the victors no less than of the vanquished how am i to satisfy my genius by fighting until i die that is my question to you  the oracle were you not rash to venture into these sacred islands with such a question on your lips warriors are not popular here my friend  napoleon if a soldier were restrained by such a consideration madam he would no longer be a soldier besides he produces a pistol i have not come unarmed  the oracle what is that thing  napoleon it is an instrument of my profession madam i raise this hammer i point the barrel at you i pull this trigger that is against my forefinger and you fall dead  the oracle shew it to me she puts out her hand to take it from him  napoleon retreating a step pardon me madam i never trust my life in the hands of a person over whom i have no control  the oracle sternly give it to me she raises her hand to her veil  napoleon dropping the pistol and covering his eyes quarter kamerad take it madam he kicks it towards her i surrender  the oracle give me that thing do you expect me to stoop for it  napoleon taking his hands from his eyes with an effort a poor victory madam he picks up the pistol and hands it to her there was no vector strategy needed to win it making a pose of his humiliation but enjoy your triumph you have made meme cain adamson charles napoleon emperor of turania cry for quarter  the oracle the way out of your difficulty cain adamson is very simple  napoleon eagerly good what is it  the oracle to die before the tide of glory turns allow me she shoots him  he falls with a shriek she throws the pistol away and goes haughtily into the temple  napoleon scrambling to his feet murderess monster shedevil unnatural inhuman wretch you deserve to be hanged guillotined broken on the wheel burnt alive no sense of the sacredness of human life no thought for my wife and children bitch sow wanton he picks up the pistol and missed me at five yards thats a woman all over  he is going away whence he came when zoo arrives and confronts him at the head of a party consisting of the british envoy the elderly gentleman the envoys wife and her daughter aged about eighteen the envoy a typical politician looks like an imperfectly reformed criminal disguised by a good tailor the dress of the ladies is coeval with that of the elderly gentleman and suitable for public official ceremonies in western capitals at the xviiixix fin de si√®cle  they file in under the portico zoo immediately comes out imperiously to napoleons right whilst the envoys wife hurries effusively to his left the envoy meanwhile passes along behind the columns to the door followed by his daughter the elderly gentleman stops just where he entered to see why zoo has swooped so abruptly on the emperor of turania  zoo to napoleon severely what are you doing here by yourself you have no business to go about here alone what was that noise just now what is that in your hand  napoleon glares at her in speechless fury pockets the pistol and produces a whistle  the envoys wife arnt you coming with us to the oracle sire  napoleon to hell with the oracle and with you too he turns to go       the envoys wife together oh sire     zoo where are you going   napoleon to fetch the police he goes out past zoo almost jostling her and blowing piercing blasts on his whistle  zoo whipping out her tuningfork and intoning hallo galway central the whistling continues stand by to isolate to the elderly gentleman who is staring after the whistling emperor how far has he gone  the elderly gentleman to that curious statue of a fat old man  zoo quickly intoning isolate the falstaff monument isolate hard paralyzethe whistling stops thank you she puts up her tuningfork he shall not move a muscle until i come to fetch him  the envoys wife oh he will be frightfully angry did you hear what he said to me  zoo much we care for his anger  the daughter coming forward between her mother and zoo please madam whose statue is it and where can i buy a picture postcard of it it is so funny i will take a snapshot when we are coming back but they come out so badly sometimes  zoo they will give you pictures and toys in the temple to take away with you the story of the statue is too long it would bore you she goes past them across the courtyard to get rid of them  the wife gushing oh no i assure you  the daughter copying her mother we should be so interested  zoo nonsense all i can tell you about it is that a thousand years ago when the whole world was given over to you shortlived people there was a war called the war to end war in the war which followed it about ten years later hardly any soldiers were killed but seven of the capital cities of europe were wiped out of existence it seems to have been a great joke for the statesmen who thought they had sent ten million common men to their deaths were themselves blown into fragments with their houses and families while the ten million men lay snugly in the caves they had dug for themselves later on even the houses escaped but their inhabitants were poisoned by gas that spared no living soul of course the soldiers starved and ran wild and that was the end of pseudochristian civilization the last civilized thing that happened was that the statesmen discovered that cowardice was a great patriotic virtue and a public monument was erected to its first preacher an ancient and very fat sage called sir john falstaff well pointing thats falstaff  the elderly gentleman coming from the portico to his granddaughters right great heavens and at the base of this monstrous poltroons statue the war god of turania is now gibbering impotently  zoo serve him right war god indeed  the envoy coming between his wife and zoo i dont know any history a modern prime minister has something better to do than sit reading books but  the elderly gentleman interrupting him encouragingly you make history ambrose  the envoy well perhaps i do and perhaps history makes me i hardly recognize myself in the newspapers sometimes though i suppose leading articles are the materials of history as you might say but what i want to know is how did war come back again and how did they make those poisonous gases you speak of we should be glad to know for they might come in very handy if we have to fight turania of course i am all for peace and dont hold with the race of armaments in principle still we must keep ahead or be wiped out  zoo you can make the gases for yourselves when your chemists find out how then you will do as you did before poison each other until there are no chemists left and no civilization you will then begin all over again as halfstarved ignorant savages and fight with boomerangs and poisoned arrows until you work up to the poison gases and high explosives once more with the same result that is unless we have sense enough to make an end of this ridiculous game by destroying you  the envoy aghast destroying us  the elderly gentleman i told you ambrose i warned you  the envoy but  zoo impatiently i wonder what zozim is doing he ought to be here to receive you  the elderly gentleman do you mean that rather insufferable young man whom you found boring me on the pier  zoo yes he has to dressup in a druids robe and put on a wig and a long false beard to impress you silly people i have to put on a purple mantle i have no patience with such mummery but you expect it from us so i suppose it must be kept up will you wait here until zozim comes please she turns to enter the temple  the envoy my good lady is it worth while dressingup and putting on false beards for us if you tell us beforehand that it is all humbug  zoo one would not think so but if you wont believe in anyone who is not dressedup why we must dressup for you it was you who invented all this nonsense not we  the elderly gentleman but do you expect us to be impressed after this  zoo i dont expect anything i know as a matter of experience that you will be impressed the oracle will frighten you out of your wits she goes into the temple  the wife these people treat us as if we were dirt beneath their feet i wonder at you putting up with it amby it would serve them right if we went home at once wouldnt it eth  the daughter yes mamma but perhaps they wouldnt mind  the envoy no use talking like that molly ive got to see this oracle the folks at home wont know how we have been treated all theyll know is that ive stood face to face with the oracle and had the straight tip from her i hope this zozim chap is not going to keep us waiting much longer for i feel far from comfortable about the approaching interview and thats the honest truth  the elderly gentleman i never thought i should want to see that man again but now i wish he would take charge of us instead of zoo she was charming at first quite charming but she turned into a fiend because i had a few words with her you would not believe she very nearly killed me you heard what she said just now she belongs to a party here which wants to have us all killed  the wife terrified us but we have done nothing we have been as nice to them as nice could be oh amby come away come away there is something dreadful about this place and these people  the envoy there is and no mistake but youre safe with me you ought to have sense enough to know that  the elderly gentleman i am sorry to say molly that it is not merely us four poor weak creatures they want to kill but the entire race of man except themselves  the envoy not so poor neither poppa nor so weak if you are going to take in all the powers if it comes to killing two can play at that game longlived or shortlived  the elderly gentleman no ambrose we should have no chance we are worms beside these fearful people mere worms  zozim comes from the temple robed majestically and wearing a wreath of mistletoe in his flowing white wig his false beard reaches almost to his waist he carries a staff with a curiously carved top  zozim in the doorway impressively hail strangers  all reverently hail  zozim are ye prepared  the envoy we are  zozim unexpectedly becoming conversational and strolling down carelessly to the middle of the group between the two ladies well im sorry to say the oracle is not she was delayed by some member of your party who got loose and as the show takes a bit of arranging you will have to wait a few minutes the ladies can go inside and look round the entrance hall and get pictures and things if they want them                                 thank you     the wife    together i should like to they go into     the daughter             very much        the temple   the elderly gentleman in dignified rebuke of zozims levity taken in this spirit sir the show as you call it becomes almost an insult to our common sense  zozim quite i should say you need not keep it up with me  the envoy suddenly making himself very agreeable just so just so we can wait as long as you please and now if i may be allowed to seize the opportunity of a few minutes friendly chat  zozim by all means if only you will talk about things i can understand  the envoy well about this colonizing plan of yours my fatherinlaw here has been telling me something about it and he has just now let out that you want not only to colonize us but tototowell shall we say to supersede us now why supersede us why not live and let live theres not a scrap of illfeeling on our side we should welcome a colony of immortalswe may almost call you thatin the british middle east no doubt the turanian empire with its mahometan traditions overshadows us now we have had to bring the emperor with us on this expedition though of course you know as well as i do that he has imposed himself on my party just to spy on me i dont deny that he has the whip hand of us to some extent because if it came to a war none of our generals could stand up against him i give him best at that game he is the finest soldier in the world besides he is an emperor and an autocrat and i am only an elected representative of the british democracy not that our british democrats wont fight they will fight the heads off all the turanians that ever walked but then it takes so long to work them up to it while he has only to say the word and march but you people would never get on with him believe me you would not be as comfortable in turania as you would be with us we understand you we like you we are easygoing people and we are rich people that will appeal to you turania is a poor place when all is said fiveeighths of it is desert they dont irrigate as we do besidesnow i am sure this will appeal to you and to all rightminded menwe are christians  zozim the old uns prefer mahometans  the envoy shocked what  zozim distinctly they prefer mahometans whats wrong with that  the envoy well of all the disgraceful  the elderly gentleman diplomatically interrupting his scandalized soninlaw there can be no doubt i am afraid that by clinging too long to the obsolete features of the old pseudochristian churches we allowed the mahometans to get ahead of us at a very critical period of the development of the eastern world when the mahometan reformation took place it left its followers with the enormous advantage of having the only established religion in the world in whose articles of faith any intelligent and educated person could believe  the envoy but what about our reformation dont give the show away poppa we followed suit didnt we  the elderly gentleman unfortunately ambrose we could not follow suit very rapidly we had not only a religion to deal with but a church  zozim what is a church  the envoy not know what a church is well  the elderly gentleman you must excuse me but if i attempted to explain you would only ask me what a bishop is and that is a question that no mortal man can answer all i can tell you is that mahomet was a truly wise man for he founded a religion without a church consequently when the time came for a reformation of the mosques there were no bishops and priests to obstruct it our bishops and priests prevented us for two hundred years from following suit and we have never recovered the start we lost then i can only plead that we did reform our church at last no doubt we had to make a few compromises as a matter of good taste but there is now very little in our articles of religion that is not accepted as at least allegorically true by our higher criticism  the envoy encouragingly besides does it matter why i have never read the articles in my life and i am prime minister come if my services in arranging for the reception of a colonizing party would be acceptable they are at your disposal and when i say a reception i mean a reception royal honors mind you a salute of a hundred and one guns the streets lined with troops the guards turned out at the palace dinner at the guildhall  zozim discourage me if i know what youre talking about i wish zoo would come she understands these things all i can tell you is that the general opinion among the colonizers is in favor of beginning in a country where the people are of a different color from us so that we can make short work without any risk of mistakes  the envoy what do you mean by short work i hope  zozim with obviously feigned geniality oh nothing nothing nothing we are thinking of trying north america thats all you see the red men of that country used to be white they passed through a period of sallow complexions followed by a period of no complexions at all into the red characteristic of their climate besides several cases of long life have occurred in north america they joined us here and their stock soon reverted to the original white of these islands  the elderly gentleman but have you considered the possibility of your colony turning red  zozim that wont matter we are not particular about our pigmentation the old books mention redfaced englishmen they appear to have been common objects at one time  the elderly gentleman very persuasively but do you think you would be popular in north america it seems to me if i may say so that on your own shewing you need a country in which society is organized in a series of highly exclusive circles in which the privacy of private life is very jealously guarded and in which no one presumes to speak to anyone else without an introduction following a strict examination of social credentials it is only in such a country that persons of special tastes and attainments can form a little world of their own and protect themselves absolutely from intrusion by common persons i think i may claim that our british society has developed this exclusiveness to perfection if you would pay us a visit and see the working of our caste system our club system our guild system you would admit that nowhere else in the world least of all perhaps in north america which has a regrettable tradition of social promiscuity could you keep yourselves so entirely to yourselves  zozim goodnaturedly embarrassed look here there is no good discussing this i had rather not explain but it wont make any difference to our colonizers what sort of shortlivers they come across we shall arrange all that never mind how let us join the ladies  the elderly gentleman throwing off his diplomatic attitude and abandoning himself to despair we understand you only too well sir well kill us end the lives you have made miserably unhappy by opening up to us the possibility that any of us may live three hundred years i solemnly curse that possibility to you it may be a blessing because you do live three hundred years to us who live less than a hundred whose flesh is as grass it is the most unbearable burden our poor tortured humanity has ever groaned under  the envoy hullo poppa steady how do you make that out  zozim what is three hundred years short enough if you ask me why in the old days you people lived on the assumption that you were going to last out for ever and ever and ever immortal you thought yourselves were you any happier then  the elderly gentleman as president of the baghdad historical society i am in a position to inform you that the communities which took this monstrous pretension seriously were the most wretched of which we have any record my society has printed an editio princeps of the works of the father of history thucyderodotus macollybuckle have you read his account of what was blasphemously called the perfect city of god and the attempt made to reproduce it in the northern part of these islands by jonhobsnoxius called the leviathan those misguided people sacrificed the fragment of life that was granted to them to an imaginary immortality they crucified the prophet who told them to take no thought for the morrow and that here and now was their australia australia being a term signifying paradise or an eternity of bliss they tried to produce a condition of death in life to mortify the flesh as they called it  zozim well you are not suffering from that are you you have not a mortified air  the elderly gentleman naturally we are not absolutely insane and suicidal nevertheless we impose on ourselves abstinences and disciplines and studies that are meant to prepare us for living three centuries and we seldom live one my childhood was made unnecessarily painful my boyhood unnecessarily laborious by ridiculous preparations for a length of days which the chances were fifty thousand to one against my ever attaining i have been cheated out of the natural joys and freedoms of my life by this dream to which the existence of these islands and their oracles gives a delusive possibility of realization i curse the day when long life was invented just as the victims of jonhobsnoxius cursed the day when eternal life was invented  zozim pooh you could live three centuries if you chose  the elderly gentleman that is what the fortunate always say to the unfortunate well i do not choose i accept my three score and ten years if they are filled with usefulness with justice with mercy with goodwill if they are the lifetime of a soul that never loses its honor and a brain that never loses its eagerness they are enough for me because these things are infinite and eternal and can make ten of my years as long as thirty of yours i shall not conclude by saying live as long as you like and be damned to you because i have risen for the moment far above any illwill to you or to any fellowcreature but i am your equal before that eternity in which the difference between your lifetime and mine is as the difference between one drop of water and three in the eyes of the almighty power from which we have both proceeded  zozim impressed you spoke that piece very well daddy i couldnt talk like that if i tried it sounded fine ah here comes the ladies  to his relief they have just appeared on the threshold of the temple  the elderly gentleman passing from exaltation to distress it means nothing to him in this land of discouragement the sublime has become the ridiculous turning on the hopelessly puzzled zozim behold thou hast made my days as it were a span long and mine age is even as nothing in respect of thee                                 poppa poppa dont look like     the wife    running that     the daughterto him oh granpa whats the matter   zozim with a shrug discouragement  the elderly gentleman throwing off the women with a superb gesture liar recollecting himself he adds with noble courtesy raising his hat and bowing i beg your pardon sir but i am not discouraged  a burst of orchestral music through which a powerful gong sounds is heard from the temple zoo in a purple robe appears in the doorway  zoo come the oracle is ready  zozim motions them to the threshold with a wave of his staff the envoy and the elderly gentleman take off their hats and go into the temple on tiptoe zoo leading the way the wife and daughter frightened as they are raise their heads uppishly and follow flatfooted sustained by a sense of their sunday clothes and social consequence zozim remains in the portico alone  zozim taking off his wig beard and robe and bundling them under his arm ouf he goes home     act iii   inside the temple a gallery overhanging an abyss dead silence the gallery is brightly lighted but beyond is a vast gloom continually changing in intensity a shaft of violet light shoots upward and a very harmonious and silvery carillon chimes when it ceases the violet ray vanishes  zoo comes along the gallery followed by the envoys daughter his wife the envoy himself and the elderly gentleman the two men are holding their hats with the brims near their noses as if prepared to pray into them at a moments notice zoo halts they all follow her example they contemplate the void with awe organ music of the kind called sacred in the nineteenth century begins their awe deepens the violet ray now a diffused mist rises again from the abyss  the wife to zoo in a reverent whisper shall we kneel  zoo loudly yes if you want to you can stand on your head if you like she sits down carelessly on the gallery railing with her back to the abyss  the elderly gentleman jarred by her callousness we desire to behave in a becoming manner  zoo very well behave just as you feel it doesnt matter how you behave but keep your wits about you when the pythoness ascends or you will forget the questions you have come to ask her        the envoy               very nervous takes out a paper to                simul   refresh his memory ahem   the daughter taneouslyalarmed the pythoness is she                              a snake   the elderly gentleman tchch the priestess of the oracle a sybil a prophetess not a snake  the wife how awful  zoo im glad you think so  the wife oh dear dont you think so  zoo no this sort of thing is got up to impress you not to impress me  the elderly gentleman i wish you would let it impress us then madam i am deeply impressed but you are spoiling the effect  zoo you just wait all this business with colored lights and chords on that old organ is only tomfoolery wait til you see the pythoness  the envoys wife falls on her knees and takes refuge in prayer  the daughter trembling are we really going to see a woman who has lived three hundred years  zoo stuff youd drop dead if a tertiary as much as looked at you the oracle is only a hundred and seventy and youll find it hard enough to stand her  the daughter piteously oh she falls on her knees  the envoy whew stand by me poppa this is a little more than i bargained for are you going to kneel or how  the elderly gentleman perhaps it would be in better taste  the two men kneel  the vapor of the abyss thickens and a distant roll of thunder seems to come from its depths the pythoness seated on her tripod rises slowly from it she has discarded the insulating robe and veil in which she conversed with napoleon and is now draped and hooded in voluminous folds of a single piece of greywhite stuff something supernatural about her terrifies the beholders who throw themselves on their faces her outline flows and waves she is almost distinct at moments and again vague and shadowy above all she is larger than lifesize not enough to be measured by the flustered congregation but enough to affect them with a dreadful sense of her supernaturalness  zoo get up get up do pull yourselves together you people  the envoy and his family by shuddering negatively intimate that it is impossible the elderly gentleman manages to get on his hands and knees  zoo come on daddy you are not afraid speak to her she wont wait here all day for you you know  the elderly gentleman rising very deferentially to his feet madam you will excuse my very natural nervousness in addressing for the first time in my life aaaa goddess my friend and relative the envoy is unhinged i throw myself upon your indulgence  zoo interrupting him intolerantly dont throw yourself on anything belonging to her or you will go right through her and break your neck she isnt solid like you  the elderly gentleman i was speaking figuratively  zoo you have been told not to do it ask her what you want to know and be quick about it  the elderly gentleman stooping and taking the prostrate envoy by the shoulders ambrose you must make an effort you cannot go back to baghdad without the answers to your questions  the envoy rising to his knees i shall be only too glad to get back alive on any terms if my legs would support me id just do a bunk straight for the ship  the elderly gentleman no no remember your dignity  the envoy dignity be damned im terrified take me away for gods sake  the elderly gentleman producing a brandy flask and taking the cap off try some of this it is still nearly full thank goodness  the envoy clutching it and drinking eagerly ah thats better he tries to drink again finding that he has emptied it he hands it back to his fatherinlaw upside down  the elderly gentleman taking it great heavens he has swallowed halfapint of neat brandy much perturbed he screws the cap on again and pockets the flask  the envoy staggering to his feet pulling a paper from his pocket and speaking with boisterous confidence get up molly up with you eth  the two women rise to their knees  the envoy what i want to ask is this he refers to the paper ahem civilization has reached a crisis we are at the parting of the ways we stand on the brink of the rubicon shall we take the plunge already a leaf has been torn out of the book of the sybil shall we wait until the whole volume is consumed on our right is the crater of the volcano on our left the precipice one false step and we go down to annihilation dragging the whole human race with us he pauses for breath  the elderly gentleman recovering his spirits under the familiar stimulus of political oratory hear hear  zoo what are you raving about ask your question while you have the chance what is it you want to know  the envoy patronizing her in the manner of a premier debating with a very young member of the opposition a young woman asks me a question i am always glad to see the young taking an interest in politics it is an impatient question but it is a practical question an intelligent question she asks why we seek to lift a corner of the veil that shrouds the future from our feeble vision  zoo i dont i ask you to tell the oracle what you want and not keep her sitting there all day  the elderly gentleman warmly order order  zoo what does order order mean  the envoy i ask the august oracle to listen to my voice  zoo you people seem never to tire of listening to your voices but it doesnt amuse us what do you want  the envoy i want young woman to be allowed to proceed without unseemly interruptions  a low roll of thunder comes from the abyss  the elderly gentleman there even the oracle is indignant to the envoy do not allow yourself to be put down by this ladys rude clamor ambrose take no notice proceed  the envoys wife i cant bear this much longer amby remember i havnt had any brandy  his daughter trembling there are serpents curling in the vapor i am afraid of the lightning finish it papa or i shall die  the envoy sternly silence the destiny of british civilization is at stake trust me i am not afraid as i was sayingwhere was i  zoo i dont know does anybody  the elderly gentleman tactfully you were just coming to the election i think  the envoy reassured just so the election now what we want to know is this ought we to dissolve in august or put it off until next spring  zoo dissolve in what thunder oh my fault this time that means that the oracle understands you and desires me to hold my tongue  the envoy fervently i thank the oracle  the wife to zoo serve you right  the elderly gentleman before the oracle replies i should like to be allowed to state a few of the reasons why in my opinion the government should hold on until the spring in the first  terrific lightning and thunder the elderly gentleman is knocked flat but as he immediately sits up again dazedly it is clear that he is none the worse for the shock the ladies cower in terror the envoys hat is blown off but he seizes it just as it quits his temples and holds it on with both hands he is recklessly drunk but quite articulate as he seldom speaks in public without taking stimulants beforehand  the envoy taking one hand from his hat to make a gesture of stilling the tempest thats enough we know how to take a hint ill put the case in three words i am the leader of the potterbill party my party is in power i am prime minister the oppositionthe rotterjackshave won every byeelection for the last six months they  the elderly gentleman scrambling heatedly to his feet not by fair means by bribery by misrepresentation by pandering to the vilest prejudices muttered thunderi beg your pardon he is silent  the envoy never mind the bribery and lies the oracle knows all about that the point is that though our five years will not expire until the year after next our majority will be eaten away at the byeelections by about easter we cant wait we must start some question that will excite the public and go to the country on it but some of us say do it now others say wait til the spring we cant make up our minds one way or the other which would you advise  zoo but what is the question that is to excite your public  the envoy that doesnt matter i dont know yet we will find a question all right enough the oracle can foresee the future we cannot thunder what does that mean what have i done now  zoo severely how often must you be told that we cannot foresee the future there is no such thing as the future until it is the present  the elderly gentleman allow me to point out madam that when the potterbill party sent to consult the oracle fifteen years ago the oracle prophesied that the potterbills would be victorious at the general election and they were so it is evident that the oracle can foresee the future and is sometimes willing to reveal it  the envoy quite true thank you poppa i appeal now over your head young woman direct to the august oracle to repeat the signal favor conferred on my illustrious predecessor sir fuller eastwind and to answer me exactly as he was answered  the oracle raises her hands to command silence  all shshsh  invisible trombones utter three solemn blasts in the manner of die zauberfl√∂te  the elderly gentleman may i  zoo quickly hush the oracle is going to speak  the oracle go home poor fool  she vanishes and the atmosphere changes to prosaic daylight zoo comes off the railing throws off her robe makes a bundle of it and tucks it under her arm the magic and mystery are gone the women rise to their feet the envoys party stare at one another helplessly  zoo the same reply word for word that your illustrious predecessor as you call him got fifteen years ago you asked for it and you got it and just think of all the important questions you might have asked she would have answered them you know it is always like that i will go and arrange to have you sent home you can wait for me in the entrance hall she goes out  the envoy what possessed me to ask for the same answer old eastwind got  the elderly gentleman but it was not the same answer the answer to eastwind was an inspiration to our party for years it won us the election  the envoys daughter i learnt it at school granpa it wasnt the same at all i can repeat it she quotes when britain was cradled in the west the east wind hardened her and made her great whilst the east wind prevails britain shall prosper the east wind shall wither britains enemies in the day of contest let the rotterjacks look to it  the envoy the old man invented that i see it all he was a doddering old ass when he came to consult the oracle the oracle naturally said go home poor fool there was no sense in saying that to me but as that girl said i asked for it what else could the poor old chap do but fake up an answer fit for publication there were whispers about it but nobody believed them i believe them now  the elderly gentleman oh i cannot admit that sir fuller eastwind was capable of such a fraud  the envoy he was capable of anything i knew his private secretary and now what are we going to say you dont suppose i am going back to baghdad to tell the british empire that the oracle called me a fool do you  the elderly gentleman surely we must tell the truth however painful it may be to our feelings  the envoy i am not thinking of my feelings i am not so selfish as that thank god i am thinking of the country of our party the truth as you call it would put the rotterjacks in for the next twenty years it would be the end of me politically not that i care for that i am only too willing to retire if you can find a better man dont hesitate on my account  the elderly gentleman no ambrose you are indispensable there is no one else  the envoy very well then what are you going to do  the elderly gentleman my dear ambrose you are the leader of the party not i what are you going to do  the envoy i am going to tell the exact truth thats what im going to do do you take me for a liar  the elderly gentleman puzzled oh i beg your pardon i understood you to say  the envoy cutting him short you understood me to say that i am going back to baghdad to tell the british electorate that the oracle repeated to me word for word what it said to sir fuller eastwind fifteen years ago molly and ethel can bear me out so must you if you are an honest man come on  he goes out followed by his wife and daughter  the elderly gentleman left alone and shrinking into an old and desolate figure what am i to do i am a most perplexed and wretched man he falls on his knees and stretches his hands in entreaty over the abyss i invoke the oracle i cannot go back and connive at a blasphemous lie i implore guidance  the pythoness walks in on the gallery behind him and touches him on the shoulder her size is now natural her face is hidden by her hood he flinches as if from an electric shock turns to her and cowers covering his eyes in terror  the elderly gentleman no not close to me im afraid i cant bear it  the oracle with grave pity come look at me i am my natural size now what you saw there was only a foolish picture of me thrown on a cloud by a lantern how can i help you  the elderly gentleman they have gone back to lie about your answer i cannot go with them i cannot live among people to whom nothing is real i have become incapable of it through my stay here i implore to be allowed to stay  the oracle my friend if you stay with us you will die of discouragement  the elderly gentleman if i go back i shall die of disgust and despair i take the nobler risk i beg you do not cast me out  he catches her robe and holds her  the oracle take care i have been here one hundred and seventy years your death does not mean to me what it means to you  the elderly gentleman it is the meaning of life not of death that makes banishment so terrible to me  the oracle be it so then you may stay  she offers him her hands he grasps them and raises himself a little by clinging to her she looks steadily into his face he stiffens a little convulsion shakes him his grasp relaxes and he falls dead  the oracle looking down at the body poor shortlived thing what else could i do for you     part v  as far as thought can reach   summer afternoon in the year 31920 ad a sunlit glade at the southern foot of a thickly wooded hill on the west side of it the steps and columned porch of a dainty little classic temple between it and the hill a rising path to the wooded heights begins with rough steps of stones in the moss on the opposite side a grove in the middle of the glade an altar in the form of a low marble table as long as a man set parallel to the temple steps and pointing to the hill curved marble benches radiate from it into the foreground but they are not joined to it there is plenty of space to pass between the altar and the benches  a dance of youths and maidens is in progress the music is provided by a few fluteplayers seated carelessly on the steps of the temple there are no children and none of the dancers seems younger than eighteen some of the youths have beards their dress like the architecture of the theatre and the design of the altar and curved seats resembles grecian of the fourth century bc freely handled they move with perfect balance and remarkable grace racing through a figure like a farandole they neither romp nor hug in our manner  at the first full close they clap their hands to stop the musicians who recommence with a saraband during which a strange figure appears on the path beyond the temple he is deep in thought with his eyes closed and his feet feeling automatically for the rough irregular steps as he slowly descends them except for a sort of linen kilt consisting mainly of a girdle carrying a sporran and a few minor pockets he is naked in physical hardihood and uprightness he seems to be in the prime of life and his eyes and mouth shew no signs of age but his face though fully and firmly fleshed bears a network of lines varying from furrows to hairbreadth reticulations as if time had worked over every inch of it incessantly through whole geologic periods his head is finely domed and utterly bald except for his eyelashes he is quite hairless he is unconscious of his surroundings and walks right into one of the dancing couples separating them he wakes up and stares about him the couple stop indignantly the rest stop the music stops the youth whom he has jostled accosts him without malice but without anything that we should call manners  the youth now then ancient sleepwalker why dont you keep your eyes open and mind where you are going  the ancient mild bland and indulgent i did not know there was a nursery here or i should not have turned my face in this direction such accidents cannot always be avoided go on with your play i will turn back  the youth why not stay with us and enjoy life for once in a way we will teach you to dance  the ancient no thank you i danced when i was a child like you dancing is a very crude attempt to get into the rhythm of life it would be painful to me to go back from that rhythm to your babyish gambols in fact i could not do it if i tried but at your age it is pleasant and i am sorry i disturbed you  the youth come own up arnt you very unhappy its dreadful to see you ancients going about by yourselves never noticing anything never dancing never laughing never singing never getting anything out of life none of us are going to be like that when we grow up its a dogs life  the ancient not at all you repeat that old phrase without knowing that there was once a creature on earth called a dog those who are interested in extinct forms of life will tell you that it loved the sound of its own voice and bounded about when it was happy just as you are doing here it is you my children who are living the dogs life  the youth the dog must have been a good sensible creature it set you a very wise example you should let yourself go occasionally and have a good time  the ancient my children be content to let us ancients go our ways and enjoy ourselves in our own fashion  he turns to go  the maiden but wait a moment why will you not tell us how you enjoy yourself you must have secret pleasures that you hide from us and that you never get tired of i get tired of all our dances and all our tunes i get tired of all my partners  the youth suspiciously do you i shall bear that in mind  they all look at one another as if there were some sinister significance in what she has said  the maiden we all do what is the use of pretending we dont it is natural  several young people no no we dont it is not natural  the ancient you are older than he is i see you are growing up  the maiden how do you know i do not look so much older do i  the ancient oh i was not looking at you your looks do not interest me  the maiden thank you  they all laugh  the youth you old fish i believe you dont know the difference between a man and a woman  the ancient it has long ceased to interest me in the way it interests you and when anything no longer interests us we no longer know it  the maiden you havnt told me how i shew my age that is what i want to know as a matter of fact i am older than this boy here older than he thinks how did you find that out  the ancient easily enough you are ceasing to pretend that these childish gamesthis dancing and singing and matingdo not become tiresome and unsatisfying after a while and you no longer care to pretend that you are younger than you are these are the signs of adolescence and then see these fantastic rags with which you have draped yourself he takes up a piece of her draperies in his hand it is rather badly worn here why do you not get a new one  the maiden oh i did not notice it besides it is too much trouble clothes are a nuisance i think i shall do without them some day as you ancients do  the ancient signs of maturity soon you will give up all these toys and games and sweets  the youth what and be as miserable as you  the ancient infant one moment of the ecstasy of life as we live it would strike you dead he stalks gravely out through the grove  they stare after him much damped  the youth to the musicians let us have another dance  the musicians shake their heads get up from their seats on the steps and troop away into the temple the others follow them except the maiden who sits down on the altar  a maiden as she goes there the ancient has put them out of countenance it is your fault strephon for provoking him she leaves much disappointed  a youth why need you have cheeked him like that he goes grumbling  strephon calling after him i thought it was understood that we are always to cheek the ancients on principle  another youth quite right too there would be no holding them if we didnt he goes  the maiden why dont you really stand up to them i did  another youth sheer abject pusillanimous dastardly cowardice thats why face the filthy truth he goes  another youth turning on the steps as he goes out and dont you forget infant that one moment of the ecstasy of life as i live it would strike you dead haha  strephon now the only one left except the maiden arnt you coming chloe  the maiden shakes her head  the youth hurrying back to her what is the matter  the maiden tragically pensive i dont know  the youth then there is something the matter is that what you mean  the maiden yes something is happening to me i dont know what  the youth you no longer love me i have seen it for a month past  the maiden dont you think all that is rather silly we cannot go on as if this kind of thing this dancing and sweethearting were everything  the youth what is there better what else is there worth living for  the maiden oh stuff dont be frivolous  the youth something horrible is happening to you you are losing all heart all feeling he sits on the altar beside her and buries his face in his hands i am bitterly unhappy  the maiden unhappy really you must have a very empty head if there is nothing in it but a dance with one girl who is no better than any of the other girls  the youth you did not always think so you used to be vexed if i as much as looked at another girl  the maiden what does it matter what i did when i was a baby nothing existed for me then except what i tasted and touched and saw and i wanted all that for myself just as i wanted the moon to play with now the world is opening out for me more than the world the universe even little things are turning out to be great things and becoming intensely interesting have you ever thought about the properties of numbers  the youth sitting up markedly disenchanted numbers i cannot imagine anything drier or more repulsive  the maiden they are fascinating just fascinating i want to get away from our eternal dancing and music and just sit down by myself and think about numbers  the youth rising indignantly oh this is too much i have suspected you for some time past we have all suspected you all the girls say that you have deceived us as to your age that you are getting flatchested that you are bored with us that you talk to the ancients when you get the chance tell me the truth how old are you  the maiden just twice your age my poor boy  the youth twice my age do you mean to say you are four  the maiden very nearly four  the youth collapsing on the altar with a groan oh  the maiden my poor strephon i pretended i was only two for your sake i was two when you were born i saw you break from your shell and you were such a charming child you ran round and talked to us all so prettily and were so handsome and well grown that i lost my heart to you at once but now i seem to have lost it altogether bigger things are taking possession of me still we were very happy in our childish way for the first year werent we  strephon i was happy until you began cooling towards me  the maiden not towards you but towards all the trivialities of our life here just think i have hundreds of years to live perhaps thousands do you suppose i can spend centuries dancing listening to flutes ringing changes on a few tunes and a few notes raving about the beauty of a few pillars and arches making jingles with words lying about with your arms round me which is really neither comfortable nor convenient everlastingly choosing colors for dresses and putting them on and washing making a business of sitting together at fixed hours to absorb our nourishment taking little poisons with it to make us delirious enough to imagine we are enjoying ourselves and then having to pass the nights in shelters lying in cots and losing half our lives in a state of unconsciousness sleep is a shameful thing i have not slept at all for weeks past i have stolen out at night when you were all lying insensiblequite disgusting i call itand wandered about the woods thinking thinking thinking grasping the world taking it to pieces building it up again devising methods planning experiments to test the methods and having a glorious time every morning i have come back here with greater and greater reluctance and i know that the time will soon comeperhaps it has come alreadywhen i shall not come back at all  strephon how horribly cold and uncomfortable  the maiden oh dont talk to me of comfort life is not worth living if you have to bother about comfort comfort makes winter a torture spring an illness summer an oppression and autumn only a respite the ancients could make life one long frowsty comfort if they chose but they never lift a finger to make themselves comfortable they will not sleep under a roof they will not clothe themselves a girdle with a few pockets hanging to it to carry things about in is all they wear they will sit down on the wet moss or in a gorse bush when there is dry heather within two yards of them two years ago when you were born i did not understand this now i feel that i would not put myself to the trouble of walking two paces for all the comfort in the world  strephon but you dont know what this means to me it means that you are dying to me yes just dying listen to me he puts his arm around her  the maiden extricating herself dont we can talk quite as well without touching one another  strephon horrified chloe oh this is the worst symptom of all the ancients never touch one another  the maiden why should they  strephon oh i dont know but dont you want to touch me you used to  the maiden yes that is true i used to we used to think it would be nice to sleep in one anothers arms but we never could go to sleep because our weight stopped our circulations just above the elbows then somehow my feeling began to change bit by bit i kept a sort of interest in your head and arms long after i lost interest in your whole body and now that has gone  strephon you no longer care for me at all then  the maiden nonsense i care for you much more seriously than before though perhaps not so much for you in particular i mean i care more for everybody but i dont want to touch you unnecessarily and i certainly dont want you to touch me  strephon rising decisively that finishes it you dislike me  the maiden impatiently i tell you again i do not dislike you but you bore me when you cannot understand and i think i shall be happier by myself in future you had better get a new companion what about the girl who is to be born today  strephon i do not want the girl who is to be born today how do i know what she will be like i want you  the maiden you cannot have me you must recognize facts and face them it is no use running after a woman twice your age i cannot make my childhood last to please you the age of love is sweet but it is short and i must pay natures debt you no longer attract me and i no longer care to attract you growth is too rapid at my age i am maturing from week to week  strephon you are maturing as you call iti call it ageingfrom minute to minute you are going much further than you did when we began this conversation  the maiden it is not the ageing that is so rapid it is the realization of it when it has actually happened now that i have made up my mind to the fact that i have left childhood behind me it comes home to me in leaps and bounds with every word you say  strephon but your vow have you forgotten that we all swore together in that temple the temple of love you were more earnest than any of us  the maiden with a grim smile never to let our hearts grow cold never to become as the ancients never to let the sacred lamp be extinguished never to change or forget to be remembered for ever as the first company of true lovers faithful to this vow so often made and broken by past generations ha ha oh dear  strephon well you need not laugh it is a beautiful and holy compact and i will keep it whilst i live are you going to break it  the maiden dear child it has broken itself the change has come in spite of my childish vow she rises do you mind if i go into the woods for a walk by myself this chat of ours seems to me an unbearable waste of time i have so much to think of  strephon again collapsing on the altar and covering his eyes with his hands my heart is broken he weeps  the maiden with a shrug i have luckily got through my childhood without that experience it shews how wise i was to choose a lover half my age she goes towards the grove and is disappearing among the trees when another youth older and manlier than strephon with crisp hair and firm arms comes from the temple and calls to her from the threshold  the temple youth i say chloe is there any sign of the ancient yet the hour of birth is overdue the baby is kicking like mad she will break her shell prematurely  the maiden looks across to the hill path then points up it and says she is coming acis  the maiden turns away through the grove and is lost to sight among the trees  acis coming to strephon whats the matter has chloe been unkind  strephon she has grown up in spite of all her promises she deceived us about her age she is four  acis four i am sorry strephon i am getting on for three myself and i know what old age is i hate to say i told you so but she was getting a little hard set and flatchested and thin on the top wasnt she  strephon breaking down dont  acis you must pull yourself together this is going to be a busy day first the birth then the festival of the artists  strephon rising what is the use of being born if we have to decay into unnatural heartless loveless joyless monsters in four short years what use are the artists if they cannot bring their beautiful creations to life i have a great mind to die and have done with it all he moves away to the corner of the curved seat farthest from the theatre and throws himself moodily into it  an ancient woman has descended the hill path during strephons lament and has heard most of it she is like the heancient equally bald and equally without sexual charm but intensely interesting and rather terrifying her sex is discoverable only by her voice as her breasts are manly and her figure otherwise not very different she wears no clothes but has draped herself rather perfunctorily with a ceremonial robe and carries two implements like long slender saws she comes to the altar between the two young men  the sheancient to strephon infant you are only at the beginning of it all to acis is the child ready to be born  acis more than ready ancient shouting and kicking and cursing we have called to her to be quiet and wait until you come but of course she only half understands and is very impatient  the sheancient very well bring her out into the sun  acis going quickly into the temple all ready come along  joyous processional music strikes up in the temple  the sheancient going close to strephon look at me  strephon sulkily keeping his face averted thank you but i dont want to be cured i had rather be miserable in my own way than callous in yours  the sheancient you like being miserable you will soon grow out of that she returns to the altar  the procession headed by acis emerges from the temple six youths carry on their shoulders a burden covered with a gorgeous but light pall before them certain official maidens carry a new tunic ewers of water silver dishes pierced with holes cloths and immense sponges the rest carry wands with ribbons and strew flowers the burden is deposited on the altar and the pall removed it is a huge egg  the sheancient freeing her arms from her robe and placing her saws on the altar ready to her hand in a businesslike manner a girl i think you said  acis yes  the tunic bearer it is a shame why cant we have more boys  several youths protesting not at all more girls we want new girls  a girls voice from the egg let me out let me out i want to be born i want to be born the egg rocks  acis snatching a wand from one of the others and whacking the egg with it be quiet i tell you wait you will be born presently  the egg no no at once at once i want to be born i want to be born violent kicking within the egg which rocks so hard that it has to be held on the altar by the bearers  the sheancient silence the music stops and the egg behaves itself  the sheancient takes her two saws and with a couple of strokes rips the egg open the newly born a pretty girl who would have been guessed as seventeen in our day sits up in the broken shell exquisitely fresh and rosy but with filaments of spare albumen clinging to her here and there  the newly born as the world bursts on her vision oh oh oh oh she continues this ad libitum during the following remonstrances  acis hold your noise will you  the washing begins the newly born shrieks and struggles  a youth lie quiet you clammy little devil  a maiden you must be washed dear now quiet quiet quiet be good  acis shut your mouth or ill shove the sponge in it  the maiden shut your eyes itll hurt if you dont  another maiden dont be silly one would think nobody had ever been born before  the newly born yells  acis serve you right you were told to shut your eyes  the youth dry her off quick i can hardly hold her shut it will you or ill smack you into a pickled cabbage  the dressing begins the newly born chuckles with delight  the maiden your arms go here dear isnt it pretty youll look lovely  the newly born rapturously oh oh oh oh  another youth no the other arm youre putting it on back to front you are a silly little beast  acis here thats it now youre clean and decent up with you oopsh he hauls her to her feet she cannot walk at first but masters it after a few steps now then march here she is ancient put her through the catechism  the sheancient what name have you chosen for her  acis amaryllis  the sheancient to the newly born your name is amaryllis  the newly born what does it mean  a youth love  a maiden mother  another youth lilies  the newly born to acis what is your name  acis acis  the newly born i love you acis i must have you all to myself take me in your arms  acis steady young one i am three years old  the newly born what has that to do with it i love you and i must have you or i will go back into my shell again  acis you cant its broken look here pointing to strephon who has remained in his seal without looking round at the birth wrapped up in his sorrow look at this poor fellow  the newly born what is the matter with him  acis when he was born he chose a girl two years old for his sweetheart he is two years old now himself and already his heart is broken because she is four that means that she has grown up like this ancient here and has left him if you choose me we shall have only a years happiness before i break your heart by growing up better choose the youngest you can find  the newly born i will not choose anyone but you you must not grow up we will love one another for ever they all laugh what are you laughing at  the sheancient listen child  the newly born do not come near me you dreadful old creature you frighten me  acis just give her another moment she is not quite reasonable yet what can you expect from a child less than five minutes old  the newly born i think i feel a little more reasonable now of course i was rather young when i said that but the inside of my head is changing very rapidly i should like to have things explained to me  acis to the sheancient is she all right do you think  the sheancient looks at the newly born critically feels her bumps like a phrenologist grips her muscles and shakes her limbs examines her teeth looks into her eyes for a moment and finally relinquishes her with an air of having finished her job  the sheancient she will do she may live  they all wave their hands and shout for joy  the newly born indignant i may live suppose there had been anything wrong with me  the sheancient children with anything wrong do not live here my child life is not cheap with us but you would not have felt anything  the newly born you mean that you would have murdered me  the sheancient that is one of the funny words the newly born bring with them out of the past you will forget it tomorrow now listen you have four years of childhood before you you will not be very happy but you will be interested and amused by the novelty of the world and your companions here will teach you how to keep up an imitation of happiness during your four years by what they call arts and sports and pleasures the worst of your troubles is already over  the newly born what in five minutes  the sheancient no you have been growing for two years in the egg you began by being several sorts of creatures that no longer exist though we have fossils of them then you became human and you passed in fifteen months through a development that once cost human beings twenty years of awkward stumbling immaturity after they were born they had to spend fifty years more in the sort of childhood you will complete in four years and then they died of decay but you need not die until your accident comes  the newly born what is my accident  the sheancient sooner or later you will fall and break your neck or a tree will fall on you or you will be struck by lightning something or other must make an end of you some day  the newly born but why should any of these things happen to me  the sheancient there is no why they do everything happens to everybody sooner or later if there is time enough and with us there is eternity  the newly born nothing need happen i never heard such nonsense in all my life i shall know how to take care of myself  the sheancient so you think  the newly born i dont think i know i shall enjoy life for ever and ever  the sheancient if you should turn out to be a person of infinite capacity you will no doubt find life infinitely interesting however all you have to do now is to play with your companions they have many pretty toys as you see a playhouse pictures images flowers bright fabrics music above all themselves for the most amusing childs toy is another child at the end of four years your mind will change you will become wise and then you will be entrusted with power  the newly born but i want power now  the sheancient no doubt you do so that you could play with the world by tearing it to pieces  the newly born only to see how it is made i should put it all together again much better than before  the sheancient there was a time when children were given the world to play with because they promised to improve it they did not improve it and they would have wrecked it had their power been as great as that which you will wield when you are no longer a child until then your young companions will instruct you in whatever is necessary you are not forbidden to speak to the ancients but you had better not do so as most of them have long ago exhausted all the interest there is in observing children and conversing with them she turns to go  the newly born wait tell me some things that i ought to do and ought not to do i feel the need of education they all laugh at her except the sheancient  the sheancient you will have grown out of that by tomorrow do what you please she goes away up the hill path  the officials take their paraphernalia and the fragments of the egg back into the temple  acis just fancy that old girl has been going for seven hundred years and hasnt had her fatal accident yet and she is not a bit tired of it all  the newly born how could anyone ever get tired of life  acis they do that is of the same life they manage to change themselves in a wonderful way you meet them sometimes with a lot of extra heads and arms and legs they make you split laughing at them most of them have forgotten how to speak the ones that attend to us have to brush up their knowledge of the language once a year or so nothing makes any difference to them that i can see they never enjoy themselves i dont know how they can stand it they dont even come to our festivals of the arts that old one who saw you out of your shell has gone off to moodle about doing nothing though she knows that this is festival day  the newly born what is festival day  acis two of our greatest sculptors are bringing us their latest masterpieces and we are going to crown them with flowers and sing dithyrambs to them and dance round them  the newly born how jolly what is a sculptor  acis listen here young one you must find out things for yourself and not ask questions for the first day or two you must keep your eyes and ears open and your mouth shut children should be seen and not heard  the newly born who are you calling a child i am fully a quarter of an hour old she sits down on the curved bench near strephon with her maturest air  voices in the temple all expressing protest disappointment disgust oh oh scandalous shameful disgraceful what filth is this a joke why theyre ancients sssssss are you mad arjillax this is an outrage an insult yah etc etc etc the malcontents appear on the steps grumbling  acis hullo whats the matter he goes to the steps of the temple  the two sculptors issue from the temple one has a beard two feet long the other is beardless between them comes a handsome nymph with marked features dark hair richly waved and authoritative bearing  the authoritative nymph swooping down to the centre of the glade with the sculptors between acis and the newly born do not try to browbeat me arjillax merely because you are clever with your hands can you play the flute  arjillax the bearded sculptor on her right no ecrasia i cannot what has that to do with it he is half derisive half impatient wholly resolved not to take her seriously in spite of her beauty and imposing tone  ecrasia well have you ever hesitated to criticize our best flute players and to declare whether their music is good or bad pray have i not the same right to criticize your busts though i cannot make images anymore than you can play  arjillax any fool can play the flute or play anything else if he practises enough but sculpture is a creative art not a mere business of whistling into a pipe the sculptor must have something of the god in him from his hand comes a form which reflects a spirit he does not make it to please you nor even to please himself but because he must you must take what he gives you or leave it if you are not worthy of it  ecrasia scornfully not worthy of it ho may i not leave it because it is not worthy of me  arjillax of you hold your silly tongue you conceited humbug what do you know about it  ecrasia i know what every person of culture knows that the business of the artist is to create beauty until today your works have been full of beauty and i have been the first to point that out  arjillax thank you for nothing people have eyes havnt they to see what is as plain as the sun in the heavens without your pointing it out  ecrasia you were very glad to have it pointed out you did not call me a conceited humbug then you stifled me with caresses you modelled me as the genius of art presiding over the infancy of your master here indicating the other sculptor martellus  martellus a silent and meditative listener shudders and shakes his head but says nothing  arjillax quarrelsomely i was taken in by your talk  ecrasia i discovered your genius before anyone else did is that true or is it not  arjillax everybody knew i was an extraordinary person when i was born my beard was three feet long  ecrasia yes and it has shrunk from three feet to two your genius seems to have been in the last foot of your beard for you have lost both  martellus with a short sardonic cachinnation ha my beard was three and a half feet long when i was born and a flash of lightning burnt it off and killed the ancient who was delivering me without a hair on my chin i became the greatest sculptor in ten generations  ecrasia and yet you come to us today with empty hands we shall actually have to crown arjillax here because no other sculptor is exhibiting  acis returning from the temple steps to behind the curved seat on the right of the three whats the row ecrasia why have you fallen out with arjillax  ecrasia he has insulted us outraged us profaned his art you know how much we hoped from the twelve busts he placed in the temple to be unveiled today well go in and look at them that is all i have to say she sweeps to the curved seat and sits down just where acis is leaning over it  acis i am no great judge of sculpture art is not my line what is wrong with the busts  ecrasia wrong with them instead of being ideally beautiful nymphs and youths they are horribly realistic studies ofbut i really cannot bring my lips to utter it  the newly born full of curiosity runs to the temple and peeps in  acis oh stow it ecrasia your lips are not so squeamish as all that studies of what  the newly born from the temple steps ancients  acis surprised but not scandalized ancients  ecrasia yes ancients the one subject that is by the universal consent of all connoisseurs absolutely excluded from the fine arts to arjillax how can you defend such a proceeding  arjillax if you come to that what interest can you find in the statues of smirking nymphs and posturing youths you stick up all over the place  ecrasia you did not ask that when your hand was still skilful enough to model them  arjillax skilful you highnosed idiot i could turn such things out by the score with my eyes bandaged and one hand tied behind me but what use would they be they would bore me and they would bore you if you had any sense go in and look at my busts look at them again and yet again until you receive the full impression of the intensity of mind that is stamped on them and then go back to the prettypretty confectionery you call sculpture and see whether you can endure its vapid emptiness he mounts the altar impetuously listen to me all of you and do you ecrasia be silent if you are capable of silence  ecrasia silence is the most perfect expression of scorn scorn that is what i feel for your revolting busts  arjillax fool the busts are only the beginning of a mighty design listen  acis go ahead old sport we are listening  martellus stretches himself on the sward beside the altar the newly born sits on the temple steps with her chin on her hands ready to devour the first oration she has ever heard the rest sit or stand at ease  arjillax in the records which generations of children have rescued from the stupid neglect of the ancients there has come down to us a fable which like many fables is not a thing that was done in the past but a thing that is to be done in the future it is a legend of a supernatural being called the archangel michael  the newly born is this a story i want to hear a story she runs down the steps and sits on the altar at arjillaxs feet  arjillax the archangel michael was a mighty sculptor and painter he found in the centre of the world a temple erected to the goddess of the centre called mediterranea this temple was full of silly pictures of pretty children such as ecrasia approves  acis fair play arjillax if she is to keep silent let her alone  ecrasia i shall not interrupt acis why should i not prefer youth and beauty to age and ugliness  arjillax just so well the archangel michael was of my opinion not yours he began by painting on the ceiling the newly born in all their childish beauty but when he had done this he was not satisfied for the temple was no more impressive than it had been before except that there was a strength and promise of greater things about his newly born ones than any other artist had attained to so he painted all round these newly born a company of ancients who were in those days called prophets and sybils whose majesty was that of the mind alone at its intensest and this painting was acknowledged through ages and ages to be the summit and masterpiece of art of course we cannot believe such a tale literally it is only a legend we do not believe in archangels and the notion that thirty thousand years ago sculpture and painting existed and had even reached the glorious perfection they have reached with us is absurd but what men cannot realize they can at least aspire to they please themselves by pretending that it was realized in a golden age of the past this splendid legend endured because it lived as a desire in the hearts of the greatest artists the temple of mediterranea never was built in the past nor did michael the archangel exist but today the temple is here he points to the porch and the man is here he slaps himself on the chest i arjillax am the man i will place in your theatre such images of the newly born as must satisfy even ecrasias appetite for beauty and i will surround them with ancients more august than any who walk through our woods  martellus as before ha  arjillax stung why do you laugh you who have come emptyhanded and it seems emptyheaded  ecrasia rising indignantly oh shame you dare disparage martellus twenty times your master  acis be quiet will you he seizes her shoulders and thrusts her back into her seat  martellus let him disparage his fill ecrasia sitting up my poor arjillax i too had this dream i too found one day that my images of loveliness had become vapid uninteresting tedious a waste of time and material i too lost my desire to model limbs and retained only my interest in heads and faces i too made busts of ancients but i had not your courage i made them in secret and hid them from you all  arjillax jumping down from the altar behind martellus in his surprise and excitement you made busts of ancients where are they man will you be talked out of your inspiration by ecrasia and the fools who imagine she speaks with authority let us have them all set up beside mine in the theatre i have opened the way for you and you see i am none the worse  martellus impossible they are all smashed he rises laughing  all smashed  arjillax who smashed them  martellus i did that is why i laughed at you just now you will smash yours before you have completed a dozen of them he goes to the end of the altar and sits down beside the newly born  arjillax but why  martellus because you cannot give them life a live ancient is better than a dead statue he takes the newly born on his knee she is flattered and voluptuously responsive anything alive is better than anything that is only pretending to be alive to arjillax your disillusion with your works of beauty is only the beginning of your disillusion with images of all sorts as your hand became more skilful and your chisel cut deeper you strove to get nearer and nearer to truth and reality discarding the fleeting fleshly lure and making images of the mind that fascinates to the end but how can so noble an inspiration be satisfied with any image even an image of the truth in the end the intellectual conscience that tore you away from the fleeting in art to the eternal must tear you away from art altogether because art is false and life alone is true  the newly born flings her arms round his neck and kisses him enthusiastically  martellus rises carries her to the curved bench on his left deposits her beside strephon as if she were his overcoat and continues without the least change of tone shape it as you will marble remains marble and the graven image an idol as i have broken my idols and cast away my chisel and modelling tools so will you too break these busts of yours  arjillax never  martellus wait my friend i do not come emptyhanded today as you imagined on the contrary i bring with me such a work of art as you have never seen and an artist who has surpassed both you and me further than we have surpassed all our competitors  ecrasia impossible the greatest things in art can never be surpassed  arjillax who is this paragon whom you declare greater than i  martellus i declare him greater than myself arjillax  arjillax frowning i understand sooner than not drown me you are willing to clasp me round the waist and jump overboard with me  acis oh stop squabbling that is the worst of you artists you are always in little squabbling cliques and the worst cliques are those which consist of one man who is this new fellow you are throwing in one anothers teeth  arjillax ask martellus do not ask me i know nothing of him he leaves martellus and sits down beside ecrasia on her left  martellus you know him quite well pygmalion  ecrasia indignantly pygmalion that soulless creature a scientist a laboratory person  arjillax pygmalion produce a work of art you have lost your artistic senses the man is utterly incapable of modelling a thumb nail let alone a human figure  martellus that does not matter i have done the modelling for him  arjillax what on earth do you mean  martellus calling pygmalion come forth  pygmalion a squarefingered youth with his face laid out in horizontal blocks and a perpetual smile of eager benevolent interest in everything and expectation of equal interest from everybody else comes from the temple to the centre of the group who regard him for the most part with dismay as dreading that he will bore them ecrasia is openly contemptuous  martellus friends it is unfortunate that pygmalion is constitutionally incapable of exhibiting anything without first giving a lecture about it to explain it but i promise you that if you will be patient he will shew you the two most wonderful works of art in the world and that they will contain some of my own very best workmanship let me add that they will inspire a loathing that will cure you of the lunacy of art for ever he sits down next the newly born who pouts and turns a very cold right shoulder to him a demonstration utterly lost on him  pygmalion with the smile of a simpleton and the eager confidence of a fanatical scientist climbs awkwardly on to the altar they prepare for the worst  pygmalion my friends i will omit the algebra  acis thank god  pygmalion continuingbecause martellus has made me promise to do so to come to the point i have succeeded in making artificial human beings real live ones i mean  incredulous voices oh come tell us another really pyg get out you havnt what a lie  pygmalion i tell you i have i will shew them to you it has been done before one of the very oldest documents we possess mentions a tradition of a biologist who extracted certain unspecified minerals from the earth and as it quaintly expresses it breathed into their nostrils the breath of life this is the only tradition from the primitive ages which we can regard as really scientific there are later documents which specify the minerals with great precision even to their atomic weights but they are utterly unscientific because they overlook the element of life which makes all the difference between a mere mixture of salts and gases and a living organism these mixtures were made over and over again in the crude laboratories of the sillyclever ages but nothing came of them until the ingredient which the old chronicler called the breath of life was added by this very remarkable early experimenter in my view he was the founder of biological science  arjillax is that all we know about him it doesnt amount to very much does it  pygmalion there are some fragments of pictures and documents which represent him as walking in a garden and advising people to cultivate their gardens his name has come down to us in several forms one of them is jove another is voltaire  ecrasia you are boring us to distraction with your voltaire what about your human beings  arjillax aye come to them  pygmalion i assure you that these details are intensely interesting cries of no they are not come to the human beings conspuez voltaire cut it short pyg interrupt him from all sides you will see their bearing presently i promise you i will not detain you long we know we children of science that the universe is full of forces and powers and energies of one kind and another the sap rising in a tree the stone holding together in a definite crystalline structure the thought of a philosopher holding his brain in form and operation with an inconceivably powerful grip the urge of evolution all these forces can be used by us for instance i use the force of gravitation when i put a stone on my tunic to prevent it being blown away when i am bathing by substituting appropriate machines for the stone we have made not only gravitation our slave but also electricity and magnetism atomic attraction repulsion polarization and so forth but hitherto the vital force has eluded us so it has had to create machinery for itself it has created and developed bony structures of the requisite strength and clothed them with cellular tissue of such amazing sensitiveness that the organs it forms will adapt their action to all the normal variations in the air they breathe the food they digest and the circumstances about which they have to think yet as these live bodies as we call them are only machines after all it must be possible to construct them mechanically  arjillax everything is possible have you done it that is the question  pygmalion yes but that is a mere fact what is interesting is the explanation of the fact forgive my saying so but it is such a pity that you artists have no intellect  ecrasia sententiously i do not admit that the artist divines by inspiration all the truths that the socalled scientist grubs up in his laboratory slowly and stupidly long afterwards  arjillax to ecrasia quarrelsomely what do you know about it you are not an artist  acis shut your heads both of you let us have the artificial men trot them out pygmalion  pygmalion it is a man and a woman but i really must explain first  all groaning  pygmalion yes i  acis we want results not explanations  pygmalion hurt i see i am boring you not one of you takes the least interest in science goodbye he descends from the altar and makes for the temple  several youths and maidens rising and rushing to him no no dont go dont be offended we want to see the artificial pair we will listen we are tremendously interested tell us all about it  pygmalion relenting i shall not detain you two minutes  all half an hour if you like please go on pygmalion they rush him back to the altar and hoist him on to it up you go  they return to their former places  pygmalion as i told you lots of attempts were made to produce protoplasm in the laboratory why were these synthetic plasms as they called them no use  ecrasia we are waiting for you to tell us  the newly born modelling herself on ecrasia and trying to outdo her intellectually clearly because they were dead  pygmalion not bad for a baby my pet but dead and alive are very loose terms you are not half as much alive as you will be in another month or so what was wrong with the synthetic protoplasm was that it could not fix and conduct the life force it was like a wooden magnet or a lightning conductor made of silk it would not take the current  acis nobody but a fool would make a wooden magnet and expect it to attract anything  pygmalion he might if he were so ignorant as not to be able to distinguish between wood and soft iron in those days they were very ignorant of the differences between things because their methods of analysis were crude they mixed up messes that were so like protoplasm that they could not tell the difference but the difference was there though their analysis was too superficial and incomplete to detect it you must remember that these poor devils were very little better than our idiots we should never dream of letting one of them survive the day of its birth why the newly born there already knows by instinct many things that their greatest physicists could hardly arrive at by forty years of strenuous study her simple direct sense of spacetime and quantity unconsciously solves problems which cost their most famous mathematicians years of prolonged and laborious calculations requiring such intense mental application that they frequently forgot to breathe when engaged in them and almost suffocated themselves in consequence  ecrasia leave these obscure prehistoric abortions and come back to your synthetic man and woman  pygmalion when i undertook the task of making synthetic men i did not waste my time on protoplasm it was evident to me that if it were possible to make protoplasm in the laboratory it must be equally possible to begin higher up and make fully evolved muscular and nervous tissues bone and so forth why make the seed when the making of the flower would be no greater miracle i tried thousands of combinations before i succeeded in producing anything that would fix highpotential life force  arjillax high what  pygmalion highpotential the life force is not so simple as you think a highpotential current of it will turn a bit of dead tissue into a philosophers brain a lowpotential current will reduce the same bit of tissue to a mass of corruption will you believe me when i tell you that even in man himself the life force used to slip suddenly down from its human level to that of a fungus so that men found their flesh no longer growing as flesh but proliferating horribly in a lower form which was called cancer until the lower form of life killed the higher and both perished together miserably  martellus keep off the primitive tribes pygmalion they interest you but they bore these young things  pygmalion i am only trying to make you understand there was the life force raging all round me there was i trying to make organs that would capture it as a battery captures electricity and tissues that would conduct it and operate it it was easy enough to make eyes more perfect than our own and ears with a larger range of sound but they could neither see nor hear because they were not susceptible to the life force but it was far worse when i discovered how to make them susceptible for the first thing that happened was that they ceased to be eyes and ears and turned into heaps of maggots  ecrasia disgusting please stop  acis if you dont want to hear go away you go ahead pyg  pygmalion i went ahead you see the lower potentials of the life force could make maggots but not human eyes or ears i improved the tissue until it was susceptible to a higher potential  arjillax intensely interested yes and then  pygmalion then the eyes and ears turned into cancers  ecrasia oh hideous  pygmalion not at all that was a great advance it encouraged me so much that i put aside the eyes and ears and made a brain it wouldnt take the life force at all until i had altered its constitution a dozen times but when it did it took a much higher potential and did not dissolve and neither did the eyes and ears when i connected them up with the brain i was able to make a sort of monster a thing without arms or legs and it really and truly lived for halfanhour  the newly born halfanhour what good was that why did it die  pygmalion its blood went wrong but i got that right and then i went ahead with a complete human body arms and legs and all he was my first man  arjillax who modelled him  pygmalion i did  martellus do you mean to say you tried your own hand before you sent for me  pygmalion bless you yes several times my first man was the ghastliest creature a more dreadful mixture of horror and absurdity than you who have not seen him can conceive  arjillax if you modelled him he must indeed have been a spectacle  pygmalion oh it was not his shape you see i did not invent that i took actual measurements and moulds from my own body sculptors do that sometimes you know though they pretend they dont  martellus hm  arjillax hah  pygmalion he was all right to look at at first or nearly so but he behaved in the most appalling manner and the subsequent developments were so disgusting that i really cannot describe them to you he seized all sorts of things and swallowed them he drank every fluid in the laboratory i tried to explain to him that he must take nothing that he could not digest and assimilate completely but of course he could not understand me he assimilated a little of what he swallowed but the process left horrible residues which he had no means of getting rid of his blood turned to poison and he perished in torments howling i then perceived that i had produced a prehistoric man for there are certain traces in our own bodies of arrangements which enabled the earlier forms of mankind to renew their bodies by swallowing flesh and grains and vegetables and all sorts of unnatural and hideous foods and getting rid of what they could not digest  ecrasia but what a pity he died what a glimpse of the past we have lost he could have told us stories of the golden age  pygmalion not he he was a most dangerous beast he was afraid of me and actually tried to kill me by snatching up things and striking at me with them i had to give him two or three pretty severe shocks before i convinced him that he was at my mercy  the newly born why did you not make a woman instead of a man she would have known how to behave herself  martellus why did you not make a man and a woman their children would have been interesting  pygmalion i intended to make a woman but after my experience with the man it was out of the question  ecrasia pray why  pygmalion well it is difficult to explain if you have not studied prehistoric methods of reproduction you see the only sort of men and women i could make were men and women just like us as far as their bodies were concerned that was how i killed the poor beast of a man i hadnt provided for his horrible prehistoric methods of feeding himself suppose the woman had reproduced in some prehistoric way instead of being oviparous as we are she couldnt have done it with a modern female body besides the experiment might have been painful  ecrasia then you have nothing to shew us at all  pygmalion oh yes i have i am not so easily beaten as that i set to work again for months to find out how to make a digestive system that would deal with waste products and a reproductive system capable of internal nourishment and incubation  ecrasia why did you not find out how to make them like us  strephon crying out in his grief for the first time why did you not make a woman whom you could love that was the secret you needed  the newly born oh yes how true how great of you darling strephon she kisses him impulsively  strephon passionately let me alone  martellus control your reflexes child  the newly born my what  martellus your reflexes the things you do without thinking pygmalion is going to shew you a pair of human creatures who are all reflexes and nothing else take warning by them  the newly born but wont they be alive like us  pygmalion that is a very difficult question to answer my dear i confess i thought at first i had created living creatures but martellus declares they are only automata but then martellus is a mystic i am a man of science he draws a line between an automaton and a living organism i cannot draw that line to my own satisfaction  martellus your artificial men have no selfcontrol they only respond to stimuli from without  pygmalion but they are conscious i have taught them to talk and read and now they tell lies that is so very lifelike  martellus not at all if they were alive they would tell the truth you can provoke them to tell any silly lie and you can foresee exactly the sort of lie they will tell give them a clip below the knee and they will jerk their foot forward give them a clip in their appetites or vanities or any of their lusts and greeds and they will boast and lie and affirm and deny and hate and love without the slightest regard to the facts that are staring them in the face or to their own obvious limitations that proves that they are automata  pygmalion unconvinced i know dear old chap but there really is some evidence that we are descended from creatures quite as limited and absurd as these after all the baby there is threequarters an automaton look at the way she has been going on  the newly born indignantly what do you mean how have i been going on  ecrasia if they have no regard for truth they can have no real vitality  pygmalion truth is sometimes so artificial so relative as we say in the scientific world that it is very hard to feel quite sure that what is false and even ridiculous to us may not be true to them  ecrasia i ask you again why did you not make them like us would any true artist be content with less than the best  pygmalion i couldnt i tried i failed i am convinced that what i am about to shew you is the very highest living organism that can be produced in the laboratory the best tissues we can manufacture will not take as high potentials as the natural product that is where nature beats us you dont seem to understand any of you what an enormous triumph it was to produce consciousness at all  acis cut the cackle and come to the synthetic couple  several youths and maidens yes yes no more talking let us have them dry up pyg and fetch them along come on out with them the synthetic couple  pygmalion waving his hands to appease them very well very well will you please whistle for them they respond to the stimulus of a whistle  all who can whistle like streetboys  ecrasia makes a wry face and puts her fingers in her ears  pygmalion shshsh thats enough thats enough thats enough silence now let us have some music a dance tune not too fast  the flutists play a quiet dance  martellus prepare yourselves for something ghastly  two figures a man and woman of noble appearance beautifully modelled and splendidly attired emerge hand in hand from the temple seeing that all eyes are fixed on them they halt on the steps smiling with gratified vanity the woman is on the mans left  pygmalion rubbing his hands with the purring satisfaction of a creator this way please  the figures advance condescendingly and pose themselves centrally between the curved seats  pygmalion now if you will be so good as to oblige us with a little something you dance so beautifully you know he sits down next martellus and whispers to him it is extraordinary how sensitive they are to the stimulus of flattery  the figures with a gracious air dance pompously but very passably at the close they bow to one another  on all hands clapping bravo thank you wonderful splendid perfect  the figures acknowledge the applause in an obvious condition of swelled head  the newly born can they make love  pygmalion yes they can respond to every stimulus they have all the reflexes put your arm round the mans neck and he will put his arm round your body he cannot help it  the female figure frowning round mine you mean  pygmalion yours too of course if the stimulus comes from you  ecrasia cannot he do anything original  pygmalion no but then you know i do not admit that any of us can do anything really original though martellus thinks we can  acis can he answer a question  pygmalion oh yes a question is a stimulus you know ask him one  acis to the male figure what do you think of what you see around you of us for instance and our ways and doings  the male figure i have not seen the newspaper today  the female figure how can you expect my husband to know what to think of you if you give him his breakfast without his paper  martellus you see he is a mere automaton  the newly born i dont think i should like him to put his arm round my neck i dont like them the male figure looks offended and the female jealous oh i thought they couldnt understand have they feelings  pygmalion of course they have i tell you they have all the reflexes  the newly born but feelings are not reflexes  pygmalion they are sensations when the rays of light enter their eyes and make a picture on their retinas their brains become conscious of the picture and they act accordingly when the waves of sound started by your speaking enter their ears and record a disparaging remark on their keyboards their brains become conscious of the disparagement and resent it accordingly if you did not disparage them they would not resent it they are merely responding to a stimulus  the male figure we are part of a cosmic system free will is an illusion we are the children of cause and effect we are the unalterable the irresistible the irresponsible the inevitable       my name is ozymandias king of kings     look on my works ye mighty and despair   there is a general stir of curiosity at this  acis what the dickens does he mean  the male figure silence base accident of nature this taking the hand of the female figure and introducing her is cleopatrasemiramis consort of the king of kings and therefore queen of queens ye are things hatched from eggs by the brainless sun and the blind fire but the king of kings and queen of queens are not accidents of the egg they are thoughtout and handmade to receive the sacred life force there is one person of the king and one of the queen but the life force of the king and queen is all one the glory equal the majesty coeternal such as the king is so is the queen the king thoughtout and handmade the queen thoughtout and handmade the actions of the king are caused and therefore determined from the beginning of the world to the end and the actions of the queen are likewise the king logical and predetermined and inevitable and the queen logical and predetermined and inevitable and yet they are not two logical and predetermined and inevitable but one logical and predetermined and inevitable therefore confound not the persons nor divide the substance but worship us twain as one throne two in one and one in two lest by error ye fall into irretrievable damnation  the female figure and if any say unto you which one remember that though there is one person of the king and one of the queen yet these two persons are not alike but are woman and man and that as woman was created after man the skill and practice gained in making him were added to her wherefore she is to be exalted above him in all personal respects and  the male figure peace woman for this is a damnable heresy both man and woman are what they are and must do what they must according to the eternal laws of cause and effect look to your words for if they enter my ear and jar too repugnantly on my sensorium who knows that the inevitable response to that stimulus may not be a message to my muscles to snatch up some heavy object and break you in pieces  the female figure picks up a stone and is about to throw it at her consort  arjillax springing up and shouting to pygmalion who is fondly watching the male figure look out pygmalion look at the woman  pygmalion seeing what is happening hurls himself on the female figure and wrenches the stone out of her hand all spring up in consternation  arjillax she meant to kill him  strephon this is horrible  the female figure wrestling with pygmalion let me go let me go will you she bites his hand  pygmalion releasing her and staggering oh  a general shriek of horror echoes his exclamation he turns deadly pale and supports himself against the end of the curved seat  the female figure to her consort you would stand there and let me be treated like this you unmanly coward  pygmalion falls dead  the newly born oh whats the matter why did he fall what has happened to him  they look on anxiously as martellus kneels down and examines the body of pygmalion  martellus she has bitten a piece out of his hand nearly as large as a finger nail enough to kill ten men there is no pulse no breath  ecrasia but his thumb is clinched  martellus no it has just straightened out see he has gone poor pygmalion  the newly born oh she weeps  strephon hush dear thats childish  the newly born subsiding with a sniff  martellus rising dead in his third year what a loss to science  arjillax who cares about science serve him right for making that pair of horrors  the male figure glaring ha  the female figure keep a civil tongue in your head you  the newly born oh do not be so unkind arjillax you will make water come out of my eyes again  martellus contemplating the figures just look at these two devils i modelled them out of the stuff pygmalion made for them they are masterpieces of art and see what they have done does that convince you of the value of art arjillax  strephon they look dangerous keep away from them  ecrasia no need to tell us that strephon pf they poison the air  the male figure beware woman the wrath of ozymandias strikes like the lightning  the female figure you just say that again if you dare you filthy creature  acis what are you going to do with them martellus you are responsible for them now that pygmalion has gone  martellus if they were marble it would be simple enough i could smash them as it is how am i to kill them without making a horrible mess  the male figure posing heroically ha he declaims       come one come all this rock shall fly     from its firm base as soon as i   the female figure fondly my man my hero husband i am proud of you i love you  martellus we must send out a message for an ancient  acis need we bother an ancient about such a trifle it will take less than half a second to reduce our poor pygmalion to a pinch of dust why not calcine the two along with him  martellus no the two automata are trifles but the use of our powers of destruction is never a trifle i had rather have the case judged  the heancient emerges from the grove the figures are panicstricken  the heancient mildly am i wanted i feel called seeing the body of pygmalion and immediately taking a sterner tone what a child lost a life wasted how has this happened  the female figure frantically i didnt do it it was not me may i be struck dead if i touched him it was he pointing to the male figure  all amazed at the lie oh  the male figure liar you bit him everyone here saw you do it  the heancient silence going between the figures who made these two loathsome dolls  the male figure trying to assert himself with his knees knocking my name is ozymandias king of  the heancient with a contemptuous gesture pooh  the male figure falling on his knees oh dont sir dont she did it sir indeed she did  the female figure howling lamentably boohoo oo ooh  the heancient silence i say  he knocks the male automaton upright by a very light flip under the chin the female automaton hardly dares to sob the immortals contemplate them with shame and loathing the sheancient comes from the trees opposite the temple  the sheancient somebody wants me what is the matter she comes to the left hand of the female figure not seeing the body of pygmalion pf severely you have been making dolls you must not they are not only disgusting they are dangerous  the female figure snivelling piteously im not a doll mam im only poor cleopatrasemiramis queen of queens covering her face with her hands oh dont look at me like that mam i meant no harm he hurt me indeed he did  the heancient the creature has killed that poor youth  the sheancient seeing the body of pygmalion what this clever child who promised so well  the female figure he made me i had as much right to kill him as he had to make me and how was i to know that a little thing like that would kill him i shouldnt die if he cut off my arm or leg  ecrasia what nonsense  martellus it may not be nonsense i daresay if you cut off her leg she would grow another like the lobsters and the little lizards  the heancient did this dead boy make these two things  martellus he made them in his laboratory i moulded their limbs i am sorry i was thoughtless i did not foresee that they would kill and pretend to be persons they were not and declare things that were false and wish evil i thought they would be merely mechanical fools  the male figure do you blame us for our human nature  the female figure we are flesh and blood and not angels  the male figure have you no hearts  arjillax they are mad as well as mischievous may we not destroy them  strephon we abhor them  the newly born we loathe them  ecrasia they are noisome  acis i dont want to be hard on the poor devils but they are making me feel uneasy in my inside i never had such a sensation before  martellus i took a lot of trouble with them but as far as i am concerned destroy them by all means i loathed them from the beginning  all yes yes we all loathe them let us calcine them  the female figure oh dont be so cruel im not fit to die i will never bite anyone again i will tell the truth i will do good is it my fault if i was not made properly kill him but spare me  the male figure no i have done no harm she has kill her if you like you have no right to kill me  the newly born do you hear that they want to have one another killed  arjillax monstrous kill them both  the heancient silence these things are mere automata they cannot help shrinking from death at any cost you see that they have no selfcontrol and are merely shuddering through a series of reflexes let us see whether we cannot put a little more life into them he takes the male figure by the hand and places his disengaged hand on its head now listen one of you two is to be destroyed which of you shall it be  the male figure after a slight convulsion during which his eyes are fixed on the heancient spare her and kill me  strephon thats better  the newly born much better  the sheancient handling the female automaton in the same manner which of you shall we kill  the female figure kill us both how could either of us live without the other  ecrasia the woman is more sensible than the man  the ancients release the automata  the male figure sinking to the ground i am discouraged life is too heavy a burden  the female figure collapsing i am dying i am glad i am afraid to live  the newly born i think it would be nice to give the poor things a little music  arjillax why  the newly born i dont know but it would  the musicians play  the female figure ozymandias do you hear that she rises on her knees and looks raptly into space queen of queens she dies  the male figure crawling feebly towards her until he reaches her hand i knew i was really a king of kings to the others illusions farewell we are going to our thrones he dies  the music stops there is dead silence for a moment  the newly born that was funny  strephon it was even the ancients are smiling  the newly born just a little  the sheancient quickly recovering her grave and peremptory manner take these two abominations away to pygmalions laboratory and destroy them with the rest of the laboratory refuse some of them move to obey take care do not touch their flesh it is noxious lift them by their robes carry pygmalion into the temple and dispose of his remains in the usual way  the three bodies are carried out as directed pygmalion into the temple by his bare arms and legs and the two figures through the grove by their clothes martellus superintends the removal of the figures acis that of pygmalion ecrasia arjillax strephon and the newly born sit down as before but on contrary benches so that strephon and the newly born now face the grove and ecrasia and arjillax the temple the ancients remain standing at the altar  ecrasia as she sits down oh for a breeze from the hills  strephon or the wind from the sea at the turn of the tide  the newly born i want some clean air  the heancient the air will be clean in a moment this doll flesh that children make decomposes quickly at best but when it is shaken by such passions as the creatures are capable of it breaks up at once and becomes horribly tainted  the sheancient let it be a lesson to you all to be content with lifeless toys and not attempt to make living ones what would you think of us ancients if we made toys of you children  the newly born coaxingly why do you not make toys of us then you would play with us and that would be very nice  the sheancient it would not amuse us when you play with one another you play with your bodies and that makes you supple and strong but if we played with you we should play with your minds and perhaps deform them  strephon you are a ghastly lot you ancients i shall kill myself when i am four years old what do you live for  the heancient you will find out when you grow up you will not kill yourself  strephon if you make me believe that i shall kill myself now  the newly born oh no i want you i love you  strephon i love someone else and she has gone old old lost to me for ever  the heancient how old  strephon you saw her when you barged into us as we were dancing she is four  the newly born how i should have hated her twenty minutes ago but i have grown out of that now  the heancient good that hatred is called jealousy the worst of our childish complaints  martellus dusting his hands and puffing returns from the grove  martellus ouf he sits down next the newly born that jobs finished  arjillax ancients i should like to make a few studies of you not portraits of course i shall idealize you a little i have come to the conclusion that you ancients are the most interesting subjects after all  martellus what have those two horrors whose ashes i have just deposited with peculiar pleasure in poor pygmalions dustbin not cured you of this silly imagemaking  arjillax why did you model them as young things you fool if pygmalion had come to me i should have made ancients of them for him not that i should have modelled them any better i have always said that no one can beat you at your best as far as handwork is concerned but this job required brains that is where i should have come in  martellus well my brainy boy you are welcome to try your hand there are two of pygmalions pupils at the laboratory who helped him to manufacture the bones and tissues and all the rest of it they can turn out a couple of new automatons and you can model them as ancients if this venerable pair will sit for you  ecrasia decisively no no more automata they are too disgusting  acis returning from the temple well thats done poor old pyg  ecrasia only fancy acis arjillax wants to make more of those abominable things and to destroy even their artistic character by making ancients of them  the newly born you wont sit for them will you please dont  the heancient children listen  acis striding down the steps to the bench and seating himself next ecrasia what even the ancient wants to make a speech give it mouth o sage  strephon for heavens sake dont tell us that the earth was once inhabited by ozymandiases and cleopatras life is hard enough for us as it is  the heancient life is not meant to be easy my child but take courage it can be delightful what i wanted to tell you is that ever since men existed children have played with dolls  ecrasia you keep using that word what are dolls pray  the sheancient what you call works of art images we call them dolls  arjillax just so you have no sense of art and you instinctively insult it  the heancient children have been known to make dolls out of rags and to caress them with the deepest fondness  the sheancient eight centuries ago when i was a child i made a rag doll the rag doll is the dearest of all  the newly born eagerly interested oh have you got it still  the sheancient i kept it a full week  ecrasia even in your childhood then you did not understand high art and adored your own amateur crudities  the sheancient how old are you  ecrasia eight months  the sheancient when you have lived as long as i have  ecrasia interrupting rudely i shall worship rag dolls perhaps thank heaven i am still in my prime  the heancient you are still capable of thanking though you do not know what you thank you are a thanking little animal a blaming little animal a  acis a gushing little animal  arjillax and as she thinks an artistic little animal  ecrasia nettled i am an animated being with a reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting if your automata had been properly animated martellus they would have been more successful  the sheancient that is where you are wrong my child if those two loathsome things had been rag dolls they would have been amusing and lovable the newly born here would have played with them and you would all have laughed and played with them too until you had torn them to pieces and then you would have laughed more than ever  the newly born of course we should isnt that funny  the heancient when a thing is funny search it for a hidden truth  strephon yes and take all the fun out of it  the sheancient do not be so embittered because your sweetheart has outgrown her love for you the newly born will make amends  the newly born oh yes i will be more than she could ever have been  strephon psha jealous  the newly born oh no i have grown out of that i love her now because she loved you and because you love her  the heancient that is the next stage you are getting on very nicely my child  martellus come what is the truth that was hidden in the rag doll  the heancient well consider why you are not content with the rag doll and must have something more closely resembling a real living creature as you grow up you make images and paint pictures those of you who cannot do that make stories about imaginary dolls or you dress yourselves up as dolls and act plays about them  the sheancient and to deceive yourself the more completely you take them so very very seriously that ecrasia here declares that the making of dolls is the holiest work of creation and the words you put into the mouths of dolls the sacredest of scriptures and the noblest of utterances  ecrasia tush  arjillax tosh  the sheancient yet the more beautiful they become the further they retreat from you you cannot caress them as you caress the rag doll you cannot cry for them when they are broken or lost or when you pretend they have been unkind to you as you could when you played with rag dolls  the heancient at last like pygmalion you demand from your dolls the final perfection of resemblance to life they must move and speak  the sheancient they must love and hate  the heancient they must think that they think  the sheancient they must have soft flesh and warm blood  the heancient and then when you have achieved this as pygmalion did when the marble masterpiece is dethroned by the automaton and the homo by the homunculus when the body and the brain the reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting as ecrasia says stand before you unmasked as mere machinery and your impulses are shewn to be nothing but reflexes you are filled with horror and loathing and would give worlds to be young enough to play with your rag doll again since every step away from it has been a step away from love and happiness is it not true  the sheancient speak martellus you who have travelled the whole path  martellus it is true with fierce joy i turned a temperature of a million degrees on those two things i had modelled and saw them vanish in an instant into inoffensive dust  the sheancient speak arjillax you who have advanced from imitating the lightly living child to the intensely living ancient is it true so far  arjillax it is partly true i cannot pretend to be satisfied now with modelling pretty children  the heancient and you ecrasia you cling to your highly artistic dolls as the noblest projections of the life force do you not  ecrasia without art the crudeness of reality would make the world unbearable  the newly born anticipating the sheancient who is evidently going to challenge her now you are coming to me because i am the latest arrival but i dont understand your art and your dolls at all i want to caress my darling strephon not to play with dolls  acis i am in my fourth year and i have got on very well without your dolls i had rather walk up a mountain and down again than look at all the statues martellus and arjillax ever made you prefer a statue to an automaton and a rag doll to a statue so do i but i prefer a man to a rag doll give me friends not dolls  the heancient yet i have seen you walking over the mountains alone have you not found your best friend in yourself  acis what are you driving at old one what does all this lead to  the heancient it leads young man to the truth that you can create nothing but yourself  acis musing i can create nothing but myself ecrasia you are clever do you understand it i dont  ecrasia it is as easy to understand as any other ignorant error what artist is as great as his own works he can create masterpieces but he cannot improve the shape of his own nose  acis there what have you to say to that old one  the heancient he can alter the shape of his own soul he could alter the shape of his nose if the difference between a turnedup nose and a turneddown one were worth the effort one does not face the throes of creation for trifles  acis what have you to say to that ecrasia  ecrasia i say that if the ancients had thoroughly grasped the theory of fine art they would understand that the difference between a beautiful nose and an ugly one is of supreme importance that it is indeed the only thing that matters  the sheancient that is they would understand something they could not believe and that you do not believe  acis just so mam art is not honest that is why i never could stand much of it it is all makebelieve ecrasia never really says things she only rattles her teeth in her mouth  ecrasia acis you are rude  acis you mean that i wont play the game of makebelieve well i dont ask you to play it with me so why should you expect me to play it with you  ecrasia you have no right to say that i am not sincere i have found a happiness in art that real life has never given me i am intensely in earnest about art there is a magic and mystery in art that you know nothing of  the sheancient yes child art is the magic mirror you make to reflect your invisible dreams in visible pictures you use a glass mirror to see your face you use works of art to see your soul but we who are older use neither glass mirrors nor works of art we have a direct sense of life when you gain that you will put aside your mirrors and statues your toys and your dolls  the heancient yet we too have our toys and our dolls that is the trouble of the ancients  arjillax what the ancients have their troubles it is the first time i ever heard one of them confess it  the heancient look at us look at me this is my body my blood my brain but it is not me i am the eternal life the perpetual resurrection but striking his body this structure this organism this makeshift can be made by a boy in a laboratory and is held back from dissolution only by my use of it worse still it can be broken by a slip of the foot drowned by a cramp in the stomach destroyed by a flash from the clouds sooner or later its destruction is certain  the sheancient yes this body is the last doll to be discarded when i was a child ecrasia i too was an artist like your sculptor friends there striving to create perfection in things outside myself i made statues i painted pictures i tried to worship them  the heancient i had no such skill but i like acis sought perfection in friends in lovers in nature in things outside myself alas i could not create if i could only imagine it  the sheancient i like arjillax found out that my statues of bodily beauty were no longer even beautiful to me and i pressed on and made statues and pictures of men and women of genius like those in the old fable of michael angelo like martellus i smashed them when i saw that there was no life in them that they were so dead that they would not even dissolve as a dead body does  the heancient and i like acis ceased to walk over the mountains with my friends and walked alone for i found that i had creative power over myself but none over my friends and then i ceased to walk on the mountains for i saw that the mountains were dead  acis protesting vehemently no i grant you about the friends perhaps but the mountains are still the mountains each with its name its individuality its upstanding strength and majesty its beauty  ecrasia what acis among the rhapsodists  the heancient mere metaphor my poor boy the mountains are corpses  all the young repelled oh  the heancient yes in the hardpressed heart of the earth where the inconceivable heat of the sun still glows the stone lives in fierce atomic convulsion as we live in our slower way when it is cast out to the surface it dies like deepsea fish what you see is only its cold dead body we have tapped that central heat as prehistoric man tapped water springs but nothing has come up alive from those flaming depths your landscapes your mountains are only the worlds cast skins and decaying teeth on which we live like microbes  ecrasia ancient you blaspheme against nature and against man  the sheancient child child how much enthusiasm will you have for man when you have endured eight centuries of him as i have and seen him perish by an empty mischance that is yet a certainty when i discarded my dolls as he discarded his friends and his mountains it was to myself i turned as to the final reality here and here alone i could shape and create when my arm was weak and i willed it to be strong i could create a roll of muscle on it and when i understood that i understood that i could without any greater miracle give myself ten arms and three heads  the heancient i also came to understand such miracles for fifty years i sat contemplating this power in myself and concentrating my will  the sheancient so did i and for five more years i made myself into all sorts of fantastic monsters i walked upon a dozen legs i worked with twenty hands and a hundred fingers i looked to the four quarters of the compass with eight eyes out of four heads children fled in amazement from me until i had to hide myself from them and the ancients who had forgotten how to laugh smiled grimly when they passed  the heancient we have all committed these follies you will all commit them  the newly born oh do grow a lot of arms and legs and heads for us it would be so funny  the heancient my child i am just as well as i am i would not lift my finger now to have a thousand heads  the sheancient but what would i not give to have no head at all  all the young whats that no head at all why how  the heancient can you not understand  all the young shaking their heads no  the sheancient one day when i was tired of learning to walk forward with some of my feet and backwards with others and sideways with the rest all at once i sat on a rock with my four chins resting on four of my palms and four or my elbows resting on four of my knees and suddenly it came into my mind that this monstrous machinery of heads and limbs was no more me than my statues had been me and that it was only an automaton that i had enslaved  martellus enslaved what does that mean  the sheancient a thing that must do what you command it is a slave and its commander is its master these are words you will learn when your turn comes  the heancient you will also learn that when the master has come to do everything through the slave the slave becomes his master since he cannot live without him  the sheancient and so i perceived that i had made myself the slave of a slave  the heancient when we discovered that we shed our superfluous heads and legs and arms until we had our old shapes again and no longer startled the children  the sheancient but still i am the slave of this slave my body how am i to be delivered from it  the heancient that children is the trouble of the ancients for whilst we are tied to this tyrannous body we are subject to its death and our destiny is not achieved  the newly born what is your destiny  the heancient to be immortal  the sheancient the day will come when there will be no people only thought  the heancient and that will be life eternal  ecrasia i trust i shall meet my fatal accident before that day dawns  arjillax for once ecrasia i agree with you a world in which there were nothing plastic would be an utterly miserable one  ecrasia no limbs no contours no exquisite lines and elegant shapes no worship of beautiful bodies no poetic embraces in which cultivated lovers pretend that their caressing hands are wandering over celestial hills and enchanted valleys no  acis interrupting her disgustedly what an inhuman mind you have ecrasia  ecrasia inhuman  acis yes inhuman why dont you fall in love with someone  ecrasia i i have been in love all my life i burned with it even in the egg  acis not a bit of it you and arjillax are just as hard as two stones  ecrasia you did not always think so acis  acis oh i know i offered you my love once and asked for yours  ecrasia and did i deny it to you acis  acis you didnt even know what love was  ecrasia oh i adored you you stupid oaf until i found that you were a mere animal  acis and i made no end of a fool of myself about you until i discovered that you were a mere artist you appreciated my contours i was plastic as arjillax says i wasnt a man to you i was a masterpiece appealing to your tastes and your senses your tastes and senses had overlaid the direct impulse of life in you and because i cared only for our life and went straight to it and was bored by your calling my limbs fancy names and mapping me into mountains and valleys and all the rest of it you called me an animal well i am an animal if you call a live man an animal  ecrasia you need not explain you refused to be refined i did my best to lift your prehistoric impulses on to the plane of beauty of imagination of romance of poetry of art of  acis these things are all very well in their way and in their proper places but they are not love they are an unnatural adulteration of love love is a simple thing and a deep thing it is an act of life and not an illusion art is an illusion  arjillax that is false the statue comes to life always the statues of today are the men and women of the next incubation i hold up the marble figure before the mother and say this is the model you must copy we produce what we see let no man dare to create in art a thing that he would not have exist in life  martellus yes i have been through all that but you yourself are making statues of ancients instead of beautiful nymphs and swains and ecrasia is right about the ancients being inartistic they are damnably inartistic  ecrasia triumphant ah our greatest artist vindicates me thanks martellus  martellus the body always ends by being a bore nothing remains beautiful and interesting except thought because the thought is the life which is just what this old gentleman and this old lady seem to think too  the sheancient quite so  the heancient precisely  the newly born to the heancient but you cant be nothing what do you want to be  the heancient a vortex  the newly born a what  the sheancient a vortex i began as a vortex why should i not end as one  ecrasia oh that is what you old people are vorticists  acis but if life is thought can you live without a head  the heancient not now perhaps but prehistoric men thought they could not live without tails i can live without a tail why should i not live without a head  the newly born what is a tail  the heancient a habit of which your ancestors managed to pure themselves  the sheancient none of us now believe that all this machinery of flesh and blood is necessary it dies  the heancient it imprisons us on this petty planet and forbids us to range through the stars  acis but even a vortex is a vortex in something you cant have a whirlpool without water and you cant have a vortex without gas or molecules or atoms or ions or electrons or something not nothing  the heancient no the vortex is not the water nor the gas nor the atoms it is a power over these things  the sheancient the body was the slave of the vortex but the slave has become the master and we must free ourselves from that tyranny it is this stuff indicating her body this flesh and blood and bone and all the rest of it that is intolerable even prehistoric man dreamed of what he called an astral body and asked who would deliver him from the body of this death  acis evidently out of his depth i shouldnt think too much about it if i were you you have to keep sane you know  the two ancients look at one another shrug their shoulders and address themselves to their departure  the heancient we are staying too long with you children we must go  all the young people rise rather eagerly  arjillax dont mention it  the sheancient it is tiresome for us too you see children we have to put things very crudely to you to make ourselves intelligible  the heancient and i am afraid we do not quite succeed  strephon very kind of you to come at all and talk to us im sure  ecrasia why do the other ancients never come and give us a turn  the sheancient it is difficult for them they have forgotten how to speak how to read even how to think in your fashion we do not communicate with one another in that way or apprehend the world as you do  the heancient i find it more and more difficult to keep up your language another century or two and it will be impossible i shall have to be relieved by a younger shepherd  acis of course we are always delighted to see you but still if it tries you very severely we could manage pretty well by ourselves you know  the sheancient tell me acis do you ever think of yourself as having to live perhaps for thousands of years  acis oh dont talk about it why i know very well that i have only four years of what any reasonable person would call living and three and a half of them are already gone  ecrasia you must not mind our saying so but really you cannot call being an ancient living  the newly born almost in tears oh this dreadful shortness of our lives i cannot bear it  strephon i made up my mind on that subject long ago when i am three years and fifty weeks old i shall have my fatal accident and it will not be an accident  the heancient we are very tired of this subject i must leave you  the newly born what is being tired  the sheancient the penalty of attending to children farewell  the two ancients go away severally she into the grove he up to the hills behind the temple  all ouf a great sigh of relief  ecrasia dreadful people  strephon bores  martellus yet one would like to follow them to enter into their life to grasp their thought to comprehend the universe as they must  arjillax getting old martellus  martellus well i have finished with the dolls and i am no longer jealous of you that looks like the end two hours sleep is enough for me i am afraid i am beginning to find you all rather silly  strephon i know my girl went off this morning she hadnt slept for weeks and she found mathematics more interesting than me  martellus there is a prehistoric saying that has come down to us from a famous woman teacher she said leave women and study mathematics it is the only remaining fragment of a lost scripture called the confessions of st augustin the english opium eater that primitive savage must have been a great woman to say a thing that still lives after three hundred centuries i too will leave women and study mathematics which i have neglected too long farewell children my old playmates i almost wish i could feel sentimental about parting from you but the cold truth is that you bore me do not be angry with me your turn will come he passes away gravely into the grove  arjillax there goes a great spirit what a sculptor he was and now nothing it is as if he had cut off his hands  the newly born oh will you all leave me as he has left you  ecrasia never we have sworn it  strephon what is the use of swearing she swore he swore you have sworn they have sworn  ecrasia you speak like a grammar  strephon that is how one ought to speak isnt it we shall all be forsworn  the newly born do not talk like that you are saddening us and you are chasing the light away it is growing dark  acis night is falling the light will come back tomorrow  the newly born what is tomorrow  acis the day that never comes he turns towards the temple  all begin trooping into the temple  the newly born holding acis back that is no answer what  arjillax silence little children should be seen and not heard  the newly born putting out her tongue at him  ecrasia ungraceful you must not do that  the newly born i will do what i like but there is something the matter with me i want to lie down i cannot keep my eyes open  ecrasia you are falling asleep you will wake up again  the newly born drowsily what is sleep  acis ask no questions and you will be told no lies he takes her by the ear and leads her firmly towards the temple  the newly born ai oi ai dont i want to be carried she reels into the arms of acts who carries her into the temple  ecrasia come arjillax you at least are still an artist i adore you  arjillax do you unfortunately for you i am not still a child i have grown out of cuddling i can only appreciate your figure does that satisfy you  ecrasia at what distance  arjillax arms length or more  ecrasia thank you not for me she turns away from him  arjillax ha ha he strides off into the temple  ecrasia calling to strephon who is on the threshold of the temple going in strephon  strephon no my heart is broken he goes into the temple  ecrasia must i pass the night alone she looks round seeking another partner but they have all gone after all i can imagine a lover nobler than any of you she goes into the temple  it is now quite dark a vague radiance appears near the temple and shapes itself into the ghost of adam  a womans voice in the grove who is that  adam the ghost of adam the first father of mankind who are you  the voice the ghost of eve the first mother of mankind  adam come forth wife and shew yourself to me  eve appearing near the grove here i am husband you are very old  a voice in the hills ha ha ha  adam who laughs who dares laugh at adam  eve who has the heart to laugh at eve  the voice the ghost of cain the first child and the first murderer he appears between them and as he does so there is a prolonged hiss who dares hiss at cain the lord of death  a voice the ghost of the serpent that lived before adam and before eve and taught them how to bring forth cain she becomes visible coiled in the trees  a voice there is one that came before the serpent  the serpent that is the voice of lilith in whom the father and mother were one hail lilith  lilith becomes visible between cain and adam  lilith i suffered unspeakably i tore myself asunder i lost my life to make of my one flesh these twain man and woman and this is what has come of it what do you make of it adam my son  adam i made the earth bring forth by my labor and the woman bring forth by my love and this is what has come of it what do you make of it eve my wife  eve i nourished the egg in my body and fed it with my blood and now they let it fall as the birds did and suffer not at all what do you make of it cain my firstborn  cain i invented killing and conquest and mastery and the winnowing out of the weak by the strong and now the strong have slain one another and the weak live for ever and their deeds do nothing for the doer more than for another what do you make of it snake  the serpent i am justified for i chose wisdom and the knowledge of good and evil and now there is no evil and wisdom and good are one it is enough she vanishes  cain there is no place for me on earth any longer you cannot deny that mine was a splendid game while it lasted but now out out brief candle he vanishes  eve the clever ones were always my favorites the diggers and the fighters have dug themselves in with the worms my clever ones have inherited the earth alls well she fades away  adam i can make nothing of it neither head nor tail what is it all for why whither whence we were well enough in the garden and now the fools have killed all the animals and they are dissatisfied because they cannot be bothered with their bodies foolishness i call it he disappears  lilith they have accepted the burden of eternal life they have taken the agony from birth and their life does not fail them even in the hour of their destruction their breasts are without milk their bowels are gone the very shapes of them are only ornaments for their children to admire and caress without understanding is this enough or shall i labor again shall i bring forth something that will sweep them away and make an end of them as they have swept away the beasts of the garden and made an end of the crawling things and the flying things and of all them that refuse to live for ever i had patience with them for many ages they tried me very sorely they did terrible things they embraced death and said that eternal life was a fable i stood amazed at the malice and destructiveness of the things i had made mars blushed as he looked down on the shame of his sister planet cruelty and hypocrisy became so hideous that the face of the earth was pitted with the graves of little children among which living skeletons crawled in search of horrible food the pangs of another birth were already upon me when one man repented and lived three hundred years and i waited to see what would come of that and so much came of it that the horrors of that time seem now but an evil dream they have redeemed themselves from their vileness and turned away from their sins best of all they are still not satisfied the impulse i gave them in that day when i sundered myself in twain and launched man and woman on the earth still urges them after passing a million goals they press on to the goal of redemption from the flesh to the vortex freed from matter to the whirlpool in pure intelligence that when the world began was a whirlpool in pure force and though all that they have done seems but the first hour of the infinite work of creation yet i will not supersede them until they have forded this last stream that lies between flesh and spirit and disentangled their life from the matter that has always mocked it i can wait waiting and patience mean nothing to the eternal i gave the woman the greatest of gifts curiosity by that her seed has been saved from my wrath for i also am curious and i have waited always to see what they will do tomorrow let them feed that appetite well for me i say let them dread of all things stagnation for from the moment i lilith lose hope and faith in them they are doomed in that hope and faith i have let them live for a moment and in that moment i have spared them many times but mightier creatures than they have killed hope and faith and perished from the earth and i may not spare them for ever i am lilith i brought life into the whirlpool of force and compelled my enemy matter to obey a living soul but in enslaving lifes enemy i made him lifes master for that is the end of all slavery and now i shall see the slave set free and the enemy reconciled the whirlpool become all life and no matter and because these infants that call themselves ancients are reaching out towards that i will have patience with them still though i know well that when they attain it they shall become one with me and supersede me and lilith will be only a legend and a lay that has lost its meaning of life only is there no end and though of its million starry mansions many are empty and many still unbuilt and though its vast domain is as yet unbearably desert my seed shall one day fill it and master its matter to its uttermost confines and for what may be beyond the eyesight of lilith is too short it is enough that there is a beyond she vanishes
