materially from the fourth i have incorporated some new material including colomb and boltons flashing signals but in other respects the work is little altered i therefore reprint the   preface to the fourth edition   in publishing a fourth edition of the art of travel it is well that i should preface it with a few words of explanation on the origin and intention of the book and on the difference between this and former editions  the idea of the work occurred to me when exploring southwestern africa in 185051 i felt acutely at that time the impossibility of obtaining sufficient information on the subjects of which it treats for though the natives of that country taught me a great deal it was obvious that their acquaintance with bush lore was exceedingly partial and limited then remembering how the traditional maxims and methods of travelling in each country differ from those of others and how every traveller discovers some useful contrivances for himself it appeared to me that i should do welcome service to all who have to rough itwhether explorers emigrants missionaries or soldiersby collecting the scattered experiences of many such persons in various circumstances collating them examining into their principles and deducing from them what might fairly be called an art of travel to this end on my return home i searched through a vast number of geographical works i sought information from numerous travellers of distinction and i made a point of retesting in every needful case what i had read or learned by hearsay  footnote     the soldier should be taught all such practical expedients and their philosophy as are laid down in mr galtons useful little book    minute by the late sir james outram on army management parliamentary return of may 240 p 159  it should be understood that i do not profess to give exhaustive treatises on each of the numerous subjects comprised in this volume but only such information as is not generally known among travellers a striking instance of the limited geographical area over which the knowledge of many useful contrivances extends is that described as a dateram p 164 by which tent ropes may be secured in sand of the loosest description though tents are used over an enormous extent of sandy country in all of which this simple contrivance would be of the utmost value on every stormy night and though the art of pitching tents is studied by the troops of all civilised and partly civilised nations yet i believe that the use of the dateram never extended beyond the limits of a comparatively small district in the south of the sahara until i had described it in a former edition and further my knowledge of that contrivance was wholly due to a single traveller the late dr barth  the first edition of the art of travel was published in 1854 it was far less comprehensive than the later ones for my materials steadily accumulate and each successive edition has shown a marked improvement on its predecessor hitherto i have adhered to the original arrangement of the work but am now obliged to deviate from it for the contents have outgrown the system of classification i first adopted before i could interpolate the new matter prepared for this edition i found it necessary to recast the last one by cutting it into pieces sorting it into fresh paragraphs and thoroughly revising the writingdisentangling here and consolidating there the present edition will consequently be found more conveniently arranged than those that preceded it and at the same time i trust the copiousness of its index will enable persons to find with readiness any passage they had remarked in a former edition and to which they may desire again to refer  i am still most thankful to strangers as well as to friends for contributions of hints or corrections having been indebted to many a previously unknown correspondent for valuable information i beg that such communications may be addressed to me care of my publisher mr murray 50 albermarle street london        psa reviewer of my third edition accused me of copying largely from an american book called the prairie traveller by the then capt randolph b marcy i therefore think it well to remark that the first edition of that work was published in 1859 harper and brothers new yorkby authority of the american war department and that the passages in question are all taken from my second edition published in 1856 part of them are copies of what i had myself written the rest are reprints of my quotations as though the author of the prairie traveller had himself originally selected them  i take this opportunity of remarking that though i have been indebted for information to a very large number of authors and correspondents yet i am sorry to be unable to make my acknowledgements except in comparatively few instances the fact is that the passages in this book are seldom traceable to distinctly definite sources commonly more than one person giving me information that partially covers the same subject and not unfrequently my own subsequent enquiries modifying or enlarging the hints i had received consequently i have given the names of authorities only when my information has been wholly due to them or when their descriptions are so graphic that i have transferred them without alteration into my pages or else when their statements require confirmation it will be easy to see by the context to which of these categories each quotation belongs  francis galton     art of travel    preparatory inquiries   to those who meditate travelqualifications for a travellerif you have health a great craving for adventure at least a moderate fortune and can set your heart on a definite object which old travellers do not think impracticable thentravel by all means if in addition to these qualifications you have scientific taste and knowledge i believe that no career in time of peace can offer to you more advantages than that of a traveller if you have not independent means you may still turn travelling to excellent account for experience shows it often leads to promotion nay some men support themselves by travel they explore pasture land in australia they hunt for ivory in africa they collect specimens of natural history for sale or they wander as artists  reputed dangers of travela young man of good constitution who is bound on an enterprise sanctioned by experienced travellers does not run very great risks let those who doubt refer to the history of the various expeditions encouraged by the royal geographical society and they will see how few deaths have occurred and of those deaths how small a proportion among young travellers savages rarely murder newcomers they fear their guns and have a superstitious awe of the white mans power they require time to discover that he is not very different to themselves and easily to be made away with ordinary fever are seldom fatal to the sound and elastic constitution of youth which usually has power to resist the adverse influences of two or three years of wild life  advantages of travelit is no slight advantage to a young man to have the opportunity for distinction which travel affords if he plans his journey among scenes and places likely to interest the stayathome public he will probably achieve a reputation that might well be envied by wiser men who have not had his opportunities  the scientific advantages of travel are enormous to a man prepared to profit by them he sees nature working by herself without the interference of human intelligence and he sees her from new points of view he has also undisturbed leisure for the problems which perpetually attract his attention by their novelty the consequence is that though scientific travellers are comparatively few yet out of their ranks a large proportion of the leaders in all branches of science has been supplied it is one of the most grateful results of a journey to the young traveller to find himself admitted on the ground of his having so much of special interest to relate into the society of men with whose names he had long been familiar and whom he had reverenced as his heroes  to obtain informationthe centres of information respecting rude and savage countries are the geographical ethnological and anthropological societies at home and abroad any one intending to travel should put himself into communication with the secretary and become a member of one or more of these societies he will not only have access to books and maps but will be sure to meet with sympathy encouragement and intelligent appreciation if he is about to attempt a really bold exploration under fair conditions of success he will no doubt be introduced to the best living authorities on the country to which he is bound and will be provided with letters of introduction to the officials at the port where he is to disembark that will smooth away many small difficulties and give him a recognised position during his travels  information on scientific mattersowing to the unhappy system of education that has hitherto prevailed by which boys acquire a very imperfect knowledge of the structure of two dead languages and none at all of the structure of the living world most persons preparing to travel are overwhelmed with the consciousness of their incapacity to observe with intelligence the country they are about to visit i have been very frequently begged by such persons to put them in the way of obtaining a rudimentary knowledge of the various branches of science and have constantly made inquiries but i regret to say that i have been unable to discover any establishment where suitable instruction in natural science is to be obtained by persons of the age and station of most travellers nor do i know of any persons who advertise private tuition in any of its branches whose names i might therefore be at liberty to publish except professor tennant who gives private lessons in mineralogy at his shop in the strand where the learner might easily familiarise himself with the ordinary minerals and fossils and where collections might be purchased for after reference an intending traveller could readily find naturalists who would give lessons in museums and botanical gardens adapting their instruction to his probable wants and he would thus obtain some familiarity with the character of the principal plants and animals amongst which he would afterwards be thrown if he has no private means of learning the names of such persons i should recommend him to write to some public professor stating all particulars and begging the favour of his advice the use of the sextant may be learnt at various establishments in the city and east end of london where the junior officers of merchant vessels receive instruction at small cost a traveller could learn their addresses from the maker of his sextant he might also apply at the rooms of the royal geographical society 1 savile row london where he would probably receive advice suitable to his particular needs and possibly some assistance of a superior order to that which the instructors of whom i spoke profess to afford that wellknown volume the admiralty manual of scientific inquiry has been written to meet the wants of uninformed travellers and a small pamphlet hints to travellers has been published with the same object by the royal geographical society it is procurable at their rooms there is perhaps no branch of natural history in which a traveller could do so much without more information than is to be obtained from a few books than that of the science of man he should see the large collection of skulls in the college of surgeons and the flint and bone implements in the british museum the christie museum and elsewhere and he should buy the principal modern works on anthropology to be carefully restudied on his outward voyage  conditions of success and failure in travelan exploring expedition is daily exposed to a succession of accidents any one of which might be fatal to its further progress the cattle may at any time stray die or be stolen water may not be reached and they may perish one or more of the men may become seriously ill or the party may be attacked by natives hence the success of the expedition depends on a chain of eventualities each link of which must be a success for if one link fails at that point there must be an end of further advance it is therefore well especially at the outset of a long journey not to go hurriedly to work nor to push forward too thoughtlessly give the men and cattle time to become acclimatised make the bush your home and avoid unnecessary hardships interest yourself chiefly in the progress of your journey and do not look forward to its end with eagerness it is better to think of a return to civilisation not as an end to hardship and a haven from ill but as a close to an adventurous and pleasant life in this way risking little and insensibly creeping on you will make connections and learn the capabilities of the country as you advance all which will be found invaluable in the case of a hurried or disastrous return and thus when some months have passed by you will look back with surprise on the great distance travelled over for if you average only three miles a day at the end of the year you will have advanced 1200 which is a very considerable exploration the fable of the tortoise and the hare is peculiarly applicable to travellers over wide and unknown tracts it is a very high merit to accomplish a long exploration without loss of health of papers or even of comfort  physical strength of leaderpowerful men do not necessarily make the most eminent travellers it is rather those who take the most interest in their work that succeed the best as a huntsman says it is the nose that gives speed to the hound dr kane who was one of the most adventurous of travellers was by no means a strong man either in health or muscle  good tempertedious journeys are apt to make companions irritable one to another but under hard circumstances a traveller does his duty best who doubles his kindliness of manner to those about him and takes harsh words gently and without retort he should make it a point of duty to do so it is at those times very superfluous to show too much punctiliousness about keeping up ones dignity and so forth since the difficulty lies not in taking up quarrels but in avoiding them  reluctant servantsgreat allowance should be made for the reluctant cooperation of servants they have infinitely less interest in the success of the expedition than their leaders for they derive but little credit from it they argue thuswhy should we do more than we knowingly undertook and strain our constitutions and peril our lives in enterprises about which we are indifferent it will perhaps surprise a leader who having ascertained to what frugal habits a bush servant is inured learns on trial how desperately he clings to those few luxuries which he has always had thus speaking generally a cape servant is happy on meat coffee and biscuit but if the coffee or biscuit has to be stopped for a few days he is ready for mutiny    organising an expedition   size of partythe best size for a party depends on many considerations it should admit of being divided into two parts each strong enough to take care of itself and in each of which is one person at least able to write a letterwhich bus servants excellent in every other particular are too often unable to do in travel through a disorganised country where there are small chiefs and bands of marauders a large party is necessary thus the great success of livingstones earlier expeditions was largely due to his being provided with an unusually strong escort of wellarmed and warlike but not too aggressive caffres in other cases small parties succeed better than large ones they excite less fear do not eat up the country and are less delayed by illness the last fatal expedition of mungo park is full of warning to travellers who propose exploring with a large body of europeans  solitary travellersneither sleepy nor deaf men are fit to travel quite alone it is remarkable how often the qualities of wakefulness and watchfulness stand every party in good stead  servantsnature of engagementsthe general duties that a servant should be bound to independently of those for which he is specially engaged areunder penalty of his pay being stopped and it may be of dismissalto maintain discipline take share of campduties and nightwatch and do all in his power to promote the success of the expedition his wages should not be payable to him in full till the return of the party to the town from which it started or to some other civilised place it is best that all clothing bedding etc that the men may require should be issued out and given to them as a present and that none of their own old clothes should be allowed to be taken they are more careful of what is their own and by supplying the things yourself you can be sure that they are good in quality uniform in appearance and equal in weight while this last is ascertainable  the following form of agreement is abridged from one that was used in mr austins expedition in australia it seems short explicit and reasonable  we the undersigned forming an expedition about to explore the interior of  under mr a consent to place ourselves horses and equipments entirely and unreservedly under his orders for the above purpose from the date hereof until our return to or on failure in this respect to abide all consequences that may result we fully recognise mr b as the second and mr c as the third in command and the right of succession to the command and entire charge of the party in the order thus stated  we severally undertake to use our best endeavours to promote the harmony of the party and the success of the expedition  in witness whereof we sign our names here follow the signatures read over and signed by the respective parties in my presence here follows the signature of some person of importance in the place where the expedition is organised  by the words abide all consequences the leader would be justified in leaving a man to shift for himself and refusing his pay if the case were a serious one  good interpreters are very important men who have been used by their chiefs missionaries etc as interpreters are much to be preferred for so great is the poverty of thought and language among common people that you will seldom find a man taken at hazard able to render your words with correctness recollect to take with you vocabularies of all the tribes whom you are at all likely to visit  engaging nativeson engaging natives the people with whom they have lived and to whom they have become attached and learnt to fear should impress on them that unless they bring you back in safety they must never show their faces again nor expect the balance of their pay which will only be delivered to them on your return  womennatives wivesif some of the natives take their wives it gives great life to the party they are of very great service and cause no delay for the body of a caravan must always travel at a foots pace and a woman will endure a long journey nearly as well as a man and certainly better than a horse or a bullock they are invaluable in picking up and retailing information and hearsay gossip which will give clues to much of importance that unassisted you might miss mr hearne the american traveller of the last century in his charming book writes as follows and i can fully corroborate the faithfulness with which he gives us a savages view of the matter after the account of his first attempt which was unsuccessful he goes on to saythe very plan which by the desire of the governor we pursued of not taking any women with us on the journey was as the chief said the principal thing that occasioned all our want for said he when all the men are heavy laden they can neither hunt nor travel to any considerable distance and if they meet with any success in hunting who is to carry the produce of the labour women said he were made for labour one of them can carry or haul as much as two men can do they also pitch our tents make and mend our clothing keep us warm at night and in fact there is no such thing as travelling any considerable distance or for any length of time in this country without their assistance women said he again though they do everything are maintained at a trifling expense for as they always stand cook the very licking of their fingers in scarce times is sufficient for their subsistence  strength of womeni believe there are few greater popular errors than the idea we have mainly derived from chivalrous times that woman is a weakly creature julius c aesar who judged for himself took a very different view of the powers of certain women of the northern races about whom he wrote i suppose that in the days of baronial castles when crowds of people herded together like pigs within the narrow enclosures of a fortification and the ladies did nothing but needlework in their boudoirs the mode of life wasvery prejudicial to their nervous system and muscular powers the women suffered from the effects of ill ventilation and bad drainage and had none of the counteracting advantages of the military life that was led by the males consequently women really became the helpless dolls that they were considered to be and which it is still the fashion to consider them it always seems to me that a hardworked woman is better and happier for her work it is in the nature of women to be fond of carrying weights you may see them in omnibuses and carriages always preferring to hold their baskets or their babies on their knees to setting them down on the seats by their sides a woman whose modern dress includes i know not how many cubic feet of space has hardly ever pockets of a sufficient size to carry small articles for she prefers to load her hands with a bag or other weighty object a nurserymaid who is on the move all day seems the happiest specimen of her sex and after her a maidofall work who is treated fairly by her mistress    outfit   it is impossible to include lists of outfit in any reasonable space that shall suit the various requirements of men engaged in expeditions of different magnitudes who adopt different modes of locomotion and who visit different countries and climates i have therefore thought it best to describe only one outfit as a specimen selecting for my example the desiderata for south africa in that country the traveller has or had a few years ago to take everything with him for there were no civilised settlers and the natural products of the country are of as little value in supplying his wants as those of any country can be again south african wants are typical of those likely to be felt in every part of a large proportion of the region where rude travel is likely to be experienced as in north africa in australia in southern siberia and even in the prairies and pampas of north and south america to make such an expedition effective all the articles included in the following lists may be considered as essential i trust on the other hand that no article of real importance is

money and without money a person can no more travel in savagedom than in christendom it is a great mistake to suppose that savages will give their labour or cattle in return for anything that is bright or new they have their real wants and their fashions as much as we have and unless what a traveller brings meets either the one or the other he can get nothing from them except through fear or compulsion  the necessities of a savage are soon satisfied and unless he belongs to a nation civilised enough to live in permanent habitations and secure from plunder he cannot accumulate but is only able to keep what he actually is able to carry about his own person thus the chief at lake ngami told mr andersson that his beads would be of little use for the women about the place already grunted like pigs under the burdens of those that they wore and which they had received from previous travellers these are matters of serious consideration to persons who propose to travel with a large party and who must have proportionably large wants  speaking of presents and articles for payment as of money it is essential to have a great quantity and variety of small change wherewith the traveller can pay for small services for carrying messages for draughts of milk pieces of meat etc beads shells tobacco needles awls cotton caps handkerchiefs claspknives small axes spear and arrow heads generally answer this purpose  there is infinite fastidiousness shown by savages in selecting beads which indeed are their jewellery so that valuable beads taken at haphazard are much more likely to prove failures than not it would always be well to take abundance 40 or 50 lbs weight goes but a little way of the following cheap beads as they are very generally accepteddull white dark blue and vermilion red all of a small size  it is the ignorance of what are the received articles of payment in a distant country and the using up of those that are taken which more than any other cause limits the journeyings of an explorer the demands of each fresh chief are an immense drain upon his store  summaryto know the minimum weight for which a proposed expedition must find means of transport the

patients are generally cripples who want to be made whole in a moment and other suchlike impracticable cases powerful emetics purgatives and eyewashes are the most popular physickings  the traveller who is sick away from help may console himself with the proverb that though there is a great difference between a good physician and a bad one there is very little between a good one and none at all  drugs and instrumentsoutfit of medicinesa traveller unless he be a professed physician has no object in taking a large assortment of drugs he wants a few powders ready prepared which a physician who knows the diseases of the country in which he is about to travel will prescribe for him those in general use are as follows  1 emetic mild 2 ditto very powerful for poison sulphate of zinc also used as an eyewash in ophthalmia e aperient mild 4 ditto powerful 5 cordial for diarrhoea 6 quinine for ague 7 sudorific dovers powder 8 chlorodyne 9 camphor 10 carbolic acid  in addition to these powders the traveller will want warburgs feverdrops glycerine or cold cream mustardpaper for blistering heartburn lozenges lint a small roll of diachylon lunarcaustic in a proper holder to touch old sores with and for snakebites a scalpel and a bluntpointed bistoury with which to open abcesses the blades of these should be waxed to keep them from rust a good pair of forceps to pull out thorns a couple of needles to sew up gashes waxed thread or better silver wire a mild effervescing aperient like moxons is very convenient seidlitzpowders are perhaps a little too strong for frequent use in a tropical climate  how to carry medicinesthe medicines should be kept in zinc pillboxes with a few letters punched both on their tops and bottoms to indicate what they contain as emet astr etc it is more important that the bottoms of the boxes should be labelled than their tops because when two of them have been opened at the same time it often happens that the tops run a risk of being changed  it will save continual trouble with weights and scales if the powders be so diluted with flour that one measureful of each shall be a full average dose for an adult and if the measure to which they are adopted be cylindrical and of such a size as just to admit a common leadpencil and of a determined length it can at any time be replaced by twisting up a paper cartridge i would further suggest that the powders be differently coloured one colour being used for emetics and another for aperients  lint to makescrape a piece of linen with a knife  ointmentsimple cerate which is spread on lint as

bush remediesemeticsfor want of proper physic drink a charge of gunpowder in a tumblerful of warm water of soapsuds and tickle the throat  vapourbaths are used in many countries and the following plan used in russia is often the most convenient heat stones in the fire and put them on the ground in the middle of the cabin or tent on these pour a little water and clouds of vapour are given off in other parts of the world branches are spread on hot woodembers and the patient is placed upon these wrapped in a large cloth water is then sprinkled on the embers and the patient is soon covered with a cloud of vapour the traveller who is chilled or overworked and has a day of rest before him would do well to practise this simple and pleasant remedy  bleeding and cuppingphysicians say nowadays that bleeding is rarely if ever required and that frequently it does much harm but they used to bleed for everything many savages know how to cup they commonly use a piece ofa horn as the cup and they either suck at a hole in the top of the horn to produce the necessary vacuum or they make a blaze as we do but with a wisp of grass  illnessesfevers of all kinds diarrhoea and rheumatism are the plagues that most afflict travellers ophthalmia often threatens them change of air from the flat country up into the hills as soon as the first violence of the illness is past works wonders in hastening and perfecting a cure  feverthe number of travellers that have fallen victims to fever in certain lands is terrible it is a matter of serious consideration whether any motives short of imperious duty justify a person in braving a feverstricken country in the illfated niger expedition three vessels were employed of which the albert stayed the longest time in the river namely two months and two days her english crew consisted of 62 men of these 55 caught fever in the river and 23 died of the remaining seven only two ultimately escaped scotfree the others suffering more or less severely on their return to england in dr mcwilliamss medical history of this expedition it is laid down that the niger fever which may be considered as a type of pestilential fever generally usually sets in sixteen days after exposure to the malaria and that one attack instead of acclimatising the patient seems to render him all the more liable to a second every conceivable precaution known in those days had been taken to ensure the health of the crew of the albert a great discovery of modern days is the power of quinine to keep off many types of fever a person would now have little to fear in taking a passage in a niger steamer supposing that vessels ran regularly up that river the quinine he would take beginning at the coast would render him proof against fever until he had passed the delta but nothing would remove the risk of a long sojourn in the delta itself however i should add that dr livingstones experience on the zambesi throws doubt on the power of quinine to keep off the type of fever that prevails upon that river  precautions in unhealthy placesthere are certain precautions which should be borne in mind in unhealthy places besides that which i have just mentioned of regularly taking small doses of quinine such as never to encamp to the leeward of a marsh to sleep close in between large fires with a handkerchief gathered round your face natural instinct will teach this to avoid starting too early in the morning and to beware of unnecessary hunger hardship and exposure it is a widelycorroborated fact that the banks of a river and adjacent plains are often less affected by malaria than the low hills that overlook them  diarrhoeawith a bad diarrhoea take nothing but broth rice water and it may be rice in very small quantities at a meal until you are quite restored the least piece of bread or meat causes an immediate relapse  ophthalmiasulphate of zinc is invaluable as an eyewash for ophthalmia is a scourge in parts of north and south africa in australia and in many other countries the taste of the solution which should be strongly astringent is the best guide to its strength  toothachetough diet tries the teeth so severely that a man about to undergo it should pay a visit to a dentist before he leaves england an unskilled traveller is very likely to make a bad job of a first attempt at toothdrawing by constantly pushing and pulling an aching tooth it will in time loosen and perhaps after some weeks come out  thirstpour water over the clothes of the patient and keep them constantly wet restrain his drinking after the first few minutes as strictly as you can summon heart to do it see thirst in the chapter on water in less severe cases drink water with a teaspoon it will satisfy a parched palate as much as if you gulped it down in tumblerfuls and will disorder the digestion very considerably less  hungergive two or three mouthfuls every quarter of an hour to a man reduced to the last extremity by hunger strong broth is the best food for him  poisoningthe first thing is to give a powerful emetic that whatever poison still remains unabsorbed in the stomach may be thrown up use soapsuds or gunpowder see emetics if proper emetics are not at hand if there be violent pains and gripings or retchings give plenty of water to make the vomitings more easy next do your best to combat the symptoms that are caused by the poison which was absorbed before the emetic acted thus if the mans feet are cold and numbed put hot stones against them and wrap them up warmly if he be drowsy heavy and stupid give brandy and strong coffee and try to rouse him there is nothing more to be done save to avoid doing mischief  fleasitalian fleapowder sold in the east is really efficacious it is the powdered pire oti or fleabane mentioned in curzons armenia as growing in that country it has since become an important article of export a correspondent writes to me i have often found a light cotton or linen bag a great safeguard against the attacks of fleas i used to creep into it draw the loop tight round my neck and was thus able to set legions of them at defiance  vermin on the personi quote the following extract from hucs travels in tartarywe had now been travelling for nearly six weeks and still wore the same clothing we had assumed on our departure the incessant pricklings with which we were harassed sufficiently indicated that our attire was peopled with the filthy vermin to which the chinese and tartars are familiarly accustomed but which with europeans are objects of horror and disgust before quitting tchagankouren we had bought in a chemists shop a few sapeksworth of mercury we now made with it a prompt and specific remedy against the lice we had formerly got the receipt from some chinese and as it may be useful to others we think it right to describe it here you take half an ounce of mercury which you mix with old tealeaves previously reduced to paste by mastication to render this softer you generally add saliva water could not have the same effect you must afterwards bruise and stir it a while so that the mercury may be divided into little balls as fine as dust i presume the blue pill is a pretty exact equivalent to this preparation you infuse this composition into a string of cotton loosely twisted which you hang round the neck the lice are sure to bite at the bait and they thereupon as surely swell become red and die forthwith in china and in tartary you have to renew this salutary necklace once a month  blistered feetto prevent the feet from blistering it is a good plan to soap the inside of the stocking before setting out making a thick lather all over it a raw egg broken into a boot before putting it on greatly softens the leather of course the boots should be well greased when hard walking is anticipated after some hours on the road when the feet are beginning to be chafed take off the shoes and change the stockings putting what was the right stocking on the left foot and the left stocking on the right foot or if one foot only hurts take off the boot and turn the stocking inside out these were the plans adopted by captain barclay when a blister is formed rub the feet on going to bed with spirits mixed with tallow dropped from a candle into the palm of the hand on the following morning no blister will exist the spirits seem to possess the healing power the tallow serving only to keep the skin soft and pliant this is captain cochranes advice and the remedy was used by him in his pedestrian tour murrays handbook of switzerland the recipe is an excellent one pedestrians and teachers of gymnastics all endorse it  rarefied air effects ofon high plateaux or mountains newcomers must expect to suffer the symptoms are described by many south american travellers the attack of them is there among other names called the puna the disorder is sometimes fatal to stout plethoric people oddly enough cats are unable to endure it at villages 13000 feet above the sea dr tschudi says that they cannot live numerous trials have been made with these unhappy feline barometers and the creatures have been found to die in frightful convulsions the symptoms of the puna are giddiness dimness of sight and hearing headache faintingfits blood from mouth eyes nose lips and a feeling like seasickness nothing but time cures it it begins to be felt severely at from 12000 to 13000 feet above the sea m hermann schlagintweit who has had a great deal of mountain experience in the alps and in the himalayas up to the height of 20000 feet or more tells me that he found the headache etc come on when there was a breeze far more than at any other time his whole party would awake at the same moment and begin to complain of the symptoms immediately on the commencement of a breeze the symptoms of overwork are not wholly unlike those of the puna and many young travellers who have felt the first have ascribed them to the second  scurvy has attacked travellers even in australia and i have myself felt symptoms of it in africa when living wholly on meat any vegetable diet cures it limejuice treacle raw potatoes and acid fruits are especially efficacious dr kane insists on the value of entirely raw meat as a certain antiscorbutic this is generally used by the esquimaux  haemorrhage from a woundwhen the blood does not pour or trickle in a steady stream from a deep wound but jets forth in pulses and is of a bright red colour all the bandages in the world will not stop it it is an artery that is wounded and unless there be some one accessible who knows how to take it up and tie it i suppose that the method of our forefathers is the only one that can be used as you would for a snakebite see next paragraph or else to pour boiling grease into the wound this is of course a barbarous treatment and its success is uncertain as the cauterised artery may break out afresh still life is in question and it is the only hope of saving it after the cautery the wounded limb should be kept perfectly still well raised and cool until the wound is nearly healed a tourniquet which will stop the blood for a time is made by tying a strong thong string or handkerchief firmly above the part putting a stick through and screwing it tight if you know whereabouts the artery lies which is the object to compress put a stone over the place under the handkerchief the main arteries follow pretty much the direction of the inner seams of the sleeves and trousers  snakebitestie a string tight above the part suck the wound and caustic it as soon as you can or for want of caustic explode gunpowder in the wound of else do what mr mansfield parkyns well suggests ie cut away with a knife and afterwards burn out with the end of your iron ramrod heated as near a white heat as you can readily get it the arteries lie deep and as much flesh may without much danger be cut or burnt into as the fingers can pinch up the next step is to use the utmost energy and even cruelty to prevent the patients giving way to that lethargy and drowsiness which is the usual effect of snakepoison and too often ends in death  wasp and scorpionstingsthe oil scraped out of a tobaccopipe is a good application should the scorpion be large his sting must be treated like a snakebite  broken bonesit is extremely improbable that a man should die in consequence of a broken leg or arm if the skin be uninjured but if the broken end forces its way through the flesh the injury is a very serious one abscesses form the parts mortify and the severest consequences often follow hence when a man breaks a bone do not convert a simple injury into a severe one by carrying him carelessly if possible move the encampment to the injured man and not vice versa mr druitt sayswhen a man has broken his leg lay him on the other side put the broken limb exactly on the sound one with a little straw between and tie the two legs together with handkerchiefs thus the two legs will move as one and the broken bone will not hurt the flesh so much nor yet come through the skin  drowninga halfdrowned man must be put to bed in dry heated clothes hot stones etc placed against his feet and his head must be raised moderately human warmth is excellent such as that of two big men made to lie close up against him one on each side all rough treatment is not only ridiculous but full of harm such as the fashionwhich still exists in some placesof hanging up the body by the feet that the swallowed water may drain out of the mouth  i reprint here the instructions circulated by dr marshall hall  1 treat the patient instantly on the spot in the open air exposing the face and chest to the breeze except in severe weather  to clear the throat2 place the patient gently on the face with one wrist under the forehead all fluids and the tongue itself then fall forwards leaving the entrance into the windpipe free if there be breathingwait and watch if not or if it fail  to excite respiration3 turn the patient well and instantly on his side and4 excite the nostrils with snuff the throat with a feather etc dash cold water on the face previously rubbed warm if there be no success lose not a moment but instantly  to imitate respiration5 replace the patient on his face raising and supporting the chest well on a folded coat or other article of dress6 turn the body very gently on the side and a little beyond and then briskly on the face alternately repeating these measures deliberately efficiently and perseveringly fifteen times in the minute occasionally varying the side when the patient reposes on the chest this cavity is compressed by the weight of the body and expiration takes place when he is turned on the side this pressure is removed and inspiration occurs 7 when the prone position is resumed make equable but efficient pressure with brisk movement along the back of the chest removing it immediately before rotation on the side the first measure augments the expiration the second commences inspiration the result isrespirationand if not too latelife  to induce circulation and warmth8 rub the limbs upwards with firm grasping pressure and with energy using handkerchiefs etc by this measure the blood is propelled along the veins towards the heart 9 let the limbs be thus dried and warmed and then clothed the bystanders supplying coats waistcoats etc 10 avoid the continuous warmbath and the position on or inclined to the back  litter for the woundedif a man be wounded or sick and has to be carried upon the shoulders of others make a little for him in the indian fashion that is to say cut two stout poles each 8 feet long to make its two sides and three other crossbars of 2 12 feet each to be lashed to them then supporting this laddershaped framework over the sick man as he lies in his blanket knot the blanket up well to it and so carry him off palanquinfashion one crossbar will be just behind his head

see palanquin  black and white sketch of two indians carrying litter  surveying instruments   in previous editions i reprinted here with a few trifling alterations part of a paper that i originally communicated to the royal geographical society and which will be found at the end of their volume for 1854 in addition to it communications are published there from lieutenant raper admiral fitzroy admiral smyth admiral beechey and colonel sykes the whole of which was collected under the title of hints to travellers they were printed in a separate form and widely circulated when the edition was exhausted a fresh committee was appointed by the council of the royal geographical society consisting of admiral sir george back admiral r collinson and myself to revise the pamphlet thoroughly this process was again gone through in 1871 and now the pamphlet is so much amended and enlarged that i should do no good by making extracts it is much better that intending travellers should apply for this third edition of the hints to travellers at the societys rooms 1 savile row for it gives a great deal of information upon instruments that they would find of real value its price is 1s  porters

up a living by such easy service  measuring low angles by reflexionan ordinary artificial horizon is useless for very low angles they can be measured to within two or three minutes by means of a vertical point of reference obtained in the following mannertie two pieces of thread crossing each other at two feet above the ground put the vessel of mercury underneath it and look down upon the mercury when the eye is so placed that the crossed threads exactly cover their reflexion the line of sight is truly vertical and if the distant object be brought down to them by the sextant the angle read off will be 90 degrees  altitude captain georges arrangement of glass floating on mercury made by cary fleet street london allows of very low angles being observed but the use of this instrument requires considerable caution as to the purity of the mercury and the cleanliness of the glass  substitute for glass roof to horizonfor want of a glass roof to place over the mercury a piece of gauze stretched over the vessel will answer very tolerably for the purpose of keeping off the wind the diameter of the pupil of the eye is so large compared to the thickness of the threads of the gauze that the latter offer little impediment to a clear view of the image  silvering glasses for sextantsbefore taking leave of this subject it may not be unimportant to describe the operation of silvering the glasses of sextants as those employed on surveying duties very frequently have to perform the operation  the requisites are clean tinfoil and mercury a hares foot is handylay the tinfoil which should exceed the surface of the glass by a quarter of an inch on each side on a smooth surface the back of a book rub it out smooth with the finger add a bubble of mercury about the size of a small shot which rub gently over the tinfoil until it spreads itself and shows a silvered surface gently add sufficient mercury to cover the leaf so that its surface is fluid prepare a slip of paper the size of the tinfoil take the glass in the left hand previously well cleaned and the paper in the right brush the surface of the mercury gently to free it from dross lay the paper on the mercury and the glass on it pressing gently on the glass withdraw the paper turn the glass on its face and leave it on an inclined plane to allow the mercury to flow off which is accelerated by laying a strip of tinfoil as a conductor to its lower edge the edges may after twelve hours rest be removed in twentyfour hours give it a coat of varnish made from spirits of wine and red sealingwax it may be as well to practise on small bits of common glass which will soon prove the degree of perfection which the operator has attained admiral sir e belcher    memoranda and logbooks   best form for memorandai have remarked that almost every traveller who is distinguished for the copiousness and accuracy of his journals has written them in a remarkably small but distinct handwriting hard pencilmarks hhh pencils on common paper or on metallic paper are very durable dr barth wrote his numerous observations entirely in indianink he kept a tiny saucer in his pocket rubbed with the ink when he wanted to use it he rubbed it up with his wetted fingertip or resupplied it with fresh ink and filled his pen and wrote captain burton wrote very much in the dark when lying awake at night he used a board with prominent lines of wood such as is adopted by the blind it is very important that what is written should be intelligible to a stranger after a long lapse of time a traveller may die and his uncompleted work perish with him or he may return and years will pass by and suddenly some observations he had made will be called in question  professor j forbes saysthe practice which i have long adopted is thisto carry a memorandumbook with harwoods prepared paper in this point of detail i do not concur see next paragraph and metallic pencil in which notes and observations and slight sketches of every description are made on the spot and in the exact order in which they occur these notes are almost ineffaceable and are preserved for reference they are then extended as far as possible every evening with pen and ink in a suitable book in the form of a journal from which finally they may be extracted and modified for any ultimate purpose the speedy extension of memoranda has several great advantages it secures a deliberate revision of observations whether of instruments or of nature whilst further explanation may be sought and very often whilst ambiguities or contradictions admit of removal by a fresh appeal to facts by this precaution too the risk of losing all the fruits of some weeks of labour by the loss of a pocketbook may be avoided  it has occurred to me frequently to be consulted about the best was of keeping mss captain blakiston who surveyed the northern part of the rocky mountains and subsequently received the medal of the royal geographical society for his exploration and admirable map of the yangtsekiang in china paid great attention to the subject he was fully in possession of all i had to say on the matter and i gladly quote the method he adopted in north america with slight modifications according to the results of his experience and with a few trivial additions of my own for the purposes of memoranda and mapping data he uses three sets of books which can be ordered at any lithographers  no 1 pocket memorandum book measuring three inches and a half by five made of strong paper captain blakston did not use and i should not advise travellers to use prepared paper for it soon becomes rotten and the leaves fall out besides that wet makes the paper soppy the books are paged with bold numbers printed in the corners two faint red lines are ruled down the middle of each page half an inch apart to enable the book to be used as a fieldsurveyors book when required in this pocketbook every single thing that is recorded at all is originally recorded with a hard hhh pencil everything is written consecutively without confusion or attempt to save space there may easily be 150 pages in each of these books and a sufficient number should be procured to admit of having at least one per month do not stint yourself in these  no 2 logbookthis is an orderly way of collecting such parts of the surveying material as has been scattered over each day in your notebook it is to be neatly written out and will become the standard of future reference by using a printed form the labour of drawing up the log on the one hand and that of consulting it on the other will be vastly diminished i give captain blakistons form in pages 28 29 and i would urge intending travellers not to depart from it without very valid reasons for it is the result of considerable care and experience the size in which the form is printed here is not quite accurate because the pages of this book are not large enough to admit of it but the proportion is kept the actual size is intended to be five and a half inches high and nine inches wide so that it should open freely along one of the narrow sides of the page in the way that all memoranda books ought to open four pages go to a day of these the pages 1 and 2 are alone represented in this book pages 3 and 4 being intended to be left blank   p 28 and p 29 show samples of the log book pages being described  the bold figures 17 and 18 in the righthand corners of the form i give show how the pages should be numbered the lines in p 18 should be faint blue  no 3 calculation bookthis should be of the same size and shape as the log book and should contain outline forms for calculations the labour and confusion saved by using these and the accuracy of work that they ensure are truly remarkable the instruments used the observations made and especially the tables employed are so exceedingly diverse that i fear it would be to little purpose if i were to give special examples each traveller must suit himself i will therefore simply make a few general remarks on this subject in the following paragraph  number of observations requiring recorda traveller does excellently who takes latitudes by meridian altitudes once in the twentyfour hours a careful series of lunars once a fortnight on an average compass variations as often and an occulation now and then he will want occasionally a time observation by which to set his watch i am supposing he uses no chronometer he ought therefore to provide himself with outline forms for calculating these observations even if he finds himself obliged to have them printed or lithographed on purpose and in preparing them he should bear the following wellknown maxims in mind  let all careful observations be in doubles if they be for latitudes observe a star n and a star s the errors of your instruments will then affect the results in opposite directions and the mean of the results will destroy the error so if for time observe in doubles viz a star e and a star w also if for lunars let your sets be in doublesone set of distances to a star e of moon and one to a star w of moon whenever you begin on lunars give three hours at least to them and bring away a reliable series you will be thus possessed of a certainty to work upon instead of the miserably unsatisfactory results obtained from a single set of lunars taken here and another set there scattered all over the country and impossible to correlate a series should consist of six sets each set including three simple distances three of these sets should be to a star or stars e of moon and three to a star or stars w of moon lunars not taken on the e and w plan are almost worthless no matter how numerous they may be for the sextant etc might be inaccurate to any amount and yet no error be manifest in their results but the e and w plan exposes errors mercilessly and also eliminates them one of the best authorities on the requirements of sextant observations in rude land travel the astronomer royal of cape town says to this effectdo not observe the altitude of the star in taking lunars but compute it the labour requisite for that observation is better bestowed in taking a large number of distances so much delicacy of hand and of eyesight is requisite in taking lunars that shall give results reliable to seven or eight miles and so small an exertion or flurry spoils that delicacy that economy of labour and fidget is a matter to be carefully studied  these things being premised it will be readily understood that outline forms sufficient for an entire series of lunars will extend over many pagesthey will in fact require eighteen pages there are four sets of observations for timeone e and one w both at beginning and close of the whole one for latitudes n and s six for six sets of lunars as described above six for the corresponding altitudes of the stars which have to be computed and finally one page for taking means and recording the observations for adjustment etc each double observation for latitude would take one page each single time observation one page and each single compass variation one page an occulation would require three pages in all one of which would be for time at this rate and taking the observations mentioned above a book of 500 pages would last half a year of course where the means of transport is limited travellers must content themselves with less thus captain speke who started on his great journey amply equipped with logbooks and calculationbooks such as i have described found them too great an incumbrance and was compelled to abandon them the result was that though he brought back a very large number of laborious observations there was a want of method in them which made a considerable part of his work of little or no use while the rest required very careful treatment in order to give results commensurate with their high intrinsic value    measurements   distanceto measure the length of a journey by timethe pace of a caravan across average country is 2 12 statute or 2 geographical miles per hour as measured with compasses from point to point and not following the sinuosities of each days course but in making this estimate every minute lost in stoppages by the way is supposed to be subtracted from the whole time spent on the road a careful traveller will be surprised at the accuracy of the geographical results obtainable by noting the time he has employed in actual travel experience shows that 10 english miles per day measured along the roador what is much the same thing 7 geographical miles measured with a pair of compasses from point to pointis taking one day with another and including all stoppages of every kind whatever be their causevery fast travelling for a caravan in estimating the probable duration of a journey in an unknown country or in arranging an outfit for an exploring expedition not more than half that speed should be reckoned upon indeed it would be creditable to an explorer to have conducted the same caravan for a distance of 1000 geographical miles across a rude country in six months these data have of course no reference to a journey which may be accomplished by a single great effort nor to one where the wateringplaces and pasturages are well known but apply to an exploration of considerable length in which a traveller must feel his way and where he must use great caution not to exhaust his cattle lest some unexpected call for exertion should arise which they might prove unequal to meet persons who have never travelledand very many of those who have from neglecting to analyse their own performancesentertain very erroneous views on these matters  rate of movement to measurea when the length of pace etc is known before beginning to observea man or a horse walking at the rate of one mile per hour takes 10 paces in some ascertainable number of seconds dependent upon the length of his step if the length of his step be 30 inches he will occupy 17 seconds in making 10 paces conversely if the same person counts his paces for 17 seconds and finds that he has taken 10 in that time he will know that he is walking at the rate of exactly 1 mile per hour if he had taken 40 paces in the same period he would know that his rate had been 4 miles per hour if 35 paces that it had been 35 or 3 12 miles per hour thus it will be easily intelligible that if a man knows the number of seconds appropriate to the length of his pace he can learn the rate at which he is walking by counting his paces during that number of seconds and by dividing the number of his paces so obtained by 10 in short the number of his paces during the period in question gives his rate per hour in miles and decimals of a mile to one place of decimals i am indebted to mr archibald smith for this very ingenious notion which i have worked into the following tables in table i i give the appropriate number of seconds corresponding to paces of various lengths i find however that the pace of neither man nor horse is constant in length during all rates of walking consequently where precision is sought it is better to use this table on a method of approximation that is to say the traveller should find his approximate rate by using the number of seconds appropriate to his estimated speed then knowing the length of pace due to that approximate rate he will proceed afresh by adopting a revised number of seconds and will obtain a result much nearer to the truth than the first table i could of course be employed for finding the rate of a carriage when the circumference of one of its wheels was known but it is troublesome to make such a measurement i therefore have calculated table ii in terms of the radius of the wheel the formulae by which the two tables have been calculated are ml x 05682 for table i and mr x 3570 for table ii where m is the appropriate number of seconds l is the length of the pace or circumference of the wheel and r is the radius of the wheel  the tables will be found on the next page  tables i and ii appear on p 34  b when the length of pace is unknown till after observationin this case the following plan gives the rate of travel per hour with the smallest amount of arithmetic  for statute miles per hourobserve the number of paces n taken in 57 seconds let i be the number of inches to be subsequently determined at leisure in a single pace then ni100 is the rate per hour  for geographical miles per hourthe number of seconds to be employed is 5 this formula is therefore very simple and it is a useful one a statute mile is 1760 yards and a geographical mile is 2025 yards  for finding the rate in statute miles per hour in a carriageobserve the number of revolutions n made by the wheel in 18 seconds let d be the number of inches in the diameter of the wheel then n d200 is the rate per hour  the above method is convenient for measuring the rate at which an animal gallops after counting its paces it may be through a telescope during the prescribed number of seconds you walk to the track and measure the length of its pace if you have no measuring tape stride in yards alongside its track to find the number of yards that are covered by 36 of its paces this is of course identical with the number of inches in one of its paces  convenient equivalentsthe rate of 1 mile per hour is the equivalent to each of the rates in the following list     yards

unassisted guess especially to an unpractised eye  natural units of lengtha man should ascertain his height height of his eye above ground ditto when kneeling his fathom his cubit his average pace the span from ball of thumb to tip of one of his fingers the length of the foot the width of two three or four fingers and the distance between his eyes in all probability some one of these is an even and a useful number of feet or inches which he will always be able to recollect and refer to as a unit of measurement the distance between the eyes is instantly determined and i believe never varies while measurements of stature and certainly those of girth of limb become very different when a man is exhausted by long travel and bad diet it is therefore particularly useful for measuring small objects to find it hold a stick at armslength at right angles to the line of sight then looking past its end to a distant object shut first one eye and then the other until you have satisfied yourself of the exact point on the stick that covers the distant object as seen by the one eye when the end of the stick exactly covers the same object as seen by the other eye a stones throw is a good standard of reference for greater distances cricketers estimate distance by the length between wickets pacing yards should be practised it is well to dot or burn with the lens of your operaglass a scale of inches

report for even a storm of wind only makes 4 per cent difference one way or the other in the velocity of sound  measurement of anglesrude measurementsi find that a capital substitute for a very rude sextant is afforded by the outstretched hand and arm the span between the middle finger and the thumb subtends an angle of about 15 degrees and that between the forefinger and the thumb an angle of 11 14 degrees or one point of the compass just as a person may learn to walk yards accurately so may he learn to span out these angular distances accurately and the horizon however broken it may be is always before his eyes to check him thus if he begins from a tree or even from a book on his shelves and spans all round until he comes to the tree or book again he should make twentyfour of the larger spans and thirtytwo of the lesser ones these two angles of 15 degrees and 11 14 degrees are particularly important the sun travels through 15 degrees in each hour and therefore by spanning along its course as estimated from the place where it would stand at noon aided in this by the compass the hour before or after noon and similarly after sunrise or before sunset can be instantly reckoned again the angles 30 degrees 45 degrees 60 degrees and 90 degrees all of them simple multiples of 15 degrees are by far the most useful ones in taking rough measurements of heights and distances because of the simple relations between the sides of rightangled triangles one of whose other angles are 30 degrees 45 degrees or 60 degrees and also because 60 degrees is the value of an angle of an equilateral triangle as regards 11 14 degrees or one point of the compass it is perfectly out of the question to trust to bearings taken by the unaided eye or to steer a steady course by simply watching a star or landmark when this happens to be much to the right or the left of it now nothing is easier than to span out the bearing from time to time  rightangles to lay outa triangle whose sides are as 3 4 and 5 must be a rightangled one since 5 x 5  3 x 3  4 x 4 therefore we can find a rightangle very simply by means of a measuringtape we take a length of twelve feet yards fathoms or whatever it may be and peg its two ends side by side to the ground peg no 2 is driven in at the third division and peg no 3 is held at the seventh division of the cord which is stretched out till it becomes taut then the peg is driven in these three pegs will form the corners of a rightangled triangle peg no 2 being situated at the rightangle  proximate arcs 1 degree subtends at a

means of a table of chords so also may any required angle be protracted on paper through the same simple means in the first instance draw a circle on paper with its centre at the apex of the angle and with a radius of 1000 next measure the distance between the points where the circle is cut by the two lines that enclose the angle lastly look for that distance which is the chord of the angle in the annexed table where the corresponding number of degrees will be found where the corresponding number of degrees will be found if it be desired to protract a given angle the same operation is to be performed in a converse sense i need hardly mention that the chord of an angle is the same thing as twice the sine of half that angle but as tables of natural sines are not nowadays commonly to be met with i have thought it well worth while to give a table of chords when a traveller who is unprovided with regular instruments wishes to triangulate or when having taken some bearings but having no protractor he wishes to lay them down upon his map this little table will prove of very great service to him see measurement of distances to inaccessible places  table of chords to radius of 1000  triangulationmeasurement of distance to an inaccessible placeby similar trianglesto show how the breadth of a river may be measured without instruments without any table and without crossing it i have taken the following useful problem from the french manuel du genie those usually given by english writers for the same purpose are strangely enough unsatisfactory for they require the measurement of an angle this plan requires pacing only to measure a g produce it for any distance as to d from d in any convenient direction take any equal distances d c c d produce b c to b making c bc b join d b and produce it to a that is to say to the point where a c produced intersects it then the triangles to the left of c are similar to those on the right of c and therefore a b is equal to a b the points d c etc may be marked by bushes planted in the ground or by men standing   the disadvantages of this plan are its complexity and the usual difficulty of finding a sufficient space of level ground for its execution the method given in the following paragraph is incomparably more facile and generally applicable  triangulation by measurement of chordscolonel everest the late surveyorgeneral of india pointed out journ roy geograph soc 1860 p 122 the advantage to travellers unprovided with angular instruments of measure the chords of the angles they wish to determine he showed that a person who desired to make a rude measurement of the angle c a b in the figure p 40 has simply to pace for any convenient length from a towards c reaching we will say the point a and then to pace an equal distance from a towards b reaching the point a ae then it remains for him to pace the distance a a which is the chord of the angle a to the radius a a knowing this he can ascertain the value of the angle c a b by reference to a proper table in the same way the angle c b a can be ascertained lastly by pacing the distance a b to serve as a base all the necessary data will have been obtained for determining the lines a c and b c the problem can be worked out either by calculation or by protraction i have made numerous measurements in this way and find the practical error to be within five per cent   table for rude triangulation by chordsit occurred to me that the plan described in the foregoing paragraph might be exceedingly simplified by a table such as that which i annex in which different values of a a are given for a radius of 10 and in which the calculations are made for a base  100 the units in which a a a a and b b bb are to be measured are intended to be paces though of course any other units would do the units in which the base is measured may be feet yards minutes or hours journey or whatever else is convenient any multiple or divisor of 100 may be used for the base if the tabular number be similarly multiplied therefore a traveller may ascertain the breadth of a river or that of a valley or the distance of any object on either side of his line of march by taking not more than some sixty additional paces and by making a single reference to my table particular care must be taken to walk in a straight line from a to b by sighting some more distant object in a line with b it will otherwise surprise most people on looking back at their track to see how curved it has been and how far their b b is from being in the right direction  contains table for

and a bit of stick a foot long when the stars begin to appear and before it is dark go to the stake lie down on the ground and plant the stick so adjusting it that its top and the point where the string is tied to the stake shall be in a line with the polar star or rather with the pole see below then get up stretch the string so as just to touch the top of the stick and stake it down with the

ascertain where to mark the hourlines on the ground or wall on which the shadow of the gnomon falls the simplest plan is to use a watch or whatever makeshift means of reckoning time be at hand

down has no need to be disheartened from going on with his longitudinal observations especially if he observes occulations and eclipses the object of a watch is to tell the number of seconds that elapse between the instant of occulation eclipse etc and the instant a minute or two later when the sextant observation for time is made all that a watch actually does is to beat seconds and to record the number of beats now a string and stone swung as a pendulum will beat time and a native who is taught to throw a pebble into a bag at each beat will record it and for operations that do not occupy much time he will be as good as a watch the rate of the pendulum may be determined by taking two sets of observations with three or four minutes interval between them and if the distance from the point of suspension to the centre of the stone be thirtynine inches and if the string be thin and the stone very heavy it will beat seconds very nearly indeed the observations upon which the longitude of the east african lakes depended after captain spekes first journey to them were lunars timed with a string and a stone in default of a watch  hourglasseither dry sand or water may be used in an

following directions for climbing palms and other trees that have very rough barkstake a strip of linen or two towels or strong handkerchiefs tied together and form a loop at each end for the feet to pass tightly into without going through or for want of such material make a rope of grass or straw in the same way the length should embrace a little more than half of the diameter of the trunk to be climbed now being at the foot of the tree fix the feet well into the loops and opening the legs a little embrace the tree as high up as you can raise your legs and pressing the cord against the tree with your feet stand as it were in your stirrups and raise your body and arms higher hold fast again by the arms open the legs and raise them a stage higher and so on to the top the descent is effected in the same way reversing of course the order of the movements the ruggedness of the bark and the weight of the body pressing diagonally across the trunk of the tree prevent the rope from slipping anything provided it be strong enough is better than a round rope which does not hold so fast a loop or hoop embracing the body of the climber and the tree is a helpful addition large nails carried in a bag slung round the waist to be driven into the bare trunk of the tree will facilitate its ascent gimlets may be used for the same purpose high walls can be climbed by help of this description a weight attached to one end of a rope being first thrown over the wall and the climber assisting himself by holding on to the other end trees of soft wood are climbed by cutting notches two feet apart on alternate sides also by driving in bamboo pegs sloping alternately to left or to right these pegs correspond to the rungs of a ladder  laddersa notched pole or a knotted rope makes a ladder we hear of people who have tied sheets together to let themselves down high walls when making an escape the best way of making a long rope from sheets is to cut them into strips of about six inches broad and with these to twist a twostranded rope or else to plait a threestranded one  descending cliffs with ropes is an art which naturalists and others have occasion to practise it has been reduced to a system by the inhabitants of some rocky coasts in the northern seas where innumerable seabirds go for the breeding season and whose ledges and crevices are crammed with nests full of large eggs about the end of may and the beginning of june they are no despicable prize to a hungry native i am indebted to a most devoted rockclimber the late mr woolley for the following facts it appears that the whole population are rockclimbers in the following placesst kilda in the hebrides foula island in shetland the faroe islands generally and in the westmarver islands off iceland flamborough head used to be a famous place for this accomplishment but the birds have become far less numerous they have been destroyed very wantonly with shot  in descending a cliff two ropes are used one a supply wellmade manystranded inch rope see ropes to which the climber is attached and by which he is let down the other is a much thinner cord left to dangle over the cliff and made fast to some stone or stake above the use of the second rope is for the climber to haul upon when he wishes to be pulled up by resting a large part of his weight upon it he makes the task of pulling him up much more easy he can also convey signals by jerking it a usual rockclimbing arrangement is shown in the sketch one man with a post behind him as in fig 1 or two men as in fig 2 are entrusted with the letting down of a comrade to the depth of 100 or even 150 feet they pass the rope either under their thighs or along their sides as shown in the figures the climber is attached to the rope as shown in fig 2 the band on which he sits is of worsted a beginner ought to be attached far more securely to the rope  fig 1 and fig 2 appear on p 45  i have tried several plans and find that which is shown in fig 1 to be thoroughly comfortable and secure a stick forms the seat at either end of it is a short stirrup garters secure the stirrup leathers to the knees there is a belt under the arms  it is convenient but not necessary to have a wellgreased leather sheath a tube of eighteen inches in length through which the rope runs as shown in both figures it lies over the edges of the cliff and the friction of the rock keeps it steadily in its place  it is nervous work going over the edge of a cliff for the first time however the sensation does not include giddiness once in the air and when confidence is acquired the occupation is very exhilarating the power of locomotion is marvellous a slight push with the foot or a thrust with a stick will swing the climber twenty feet to a side few rocks are so precipitous but that a climber can generally make some use of his hands and feet enough to cling to the rock when he wishes and to clamber about its face the wind is seldom a gale above but the air will be comparatively quiet upon the face and therefore there is no danger of a chance gush dashing the climber against the rocks a short stick is useful but not necessary there are three cautions to be borne in mind 1 as you go down test every stone carefully if the movement of the rope displaces any one of them after you have been let down below it it is nearly sure to fall upon your head because you will be vertically beneath it some climbers use a kind of helmet as a shield against these very dangerous accidents 2 take care that the rope does not become jammed in a cleft or you will be helplessly suspended in midair keep the rope pretty tight when you are clambering about the ledges else if you slip the jerk may break the rope or cause an overpowering strain upon the men who are holding it above  turf and solid rock are much the best substances for the rope to run over in the faroes they tar the ropes excessively they are absolutely polished with tar good ropes are highly valued in st kilda leather ropes are used they last a lifetime and are a dowry for a daughter a new rope spins terribly  leaping polesin france they practise a way of crossing a deep brook by the help

climbing difficult placesalways face difficult places if you slip let your first effort be to turn upon your stomach for in every other position you are helpless a mountaineer when he meets with a formidable obstacle does not hold on the rock by means of his feet and his hands only but he clings to it like a caterpillar with every part of his body that can come simultaneously into contact with its roughened surface  snow mountainsprecautionsthe real dangers of the high alps may be reduced to three1 yielding of snowbridges over crevices 2 slipping on slopes of ice 3 the fall of ice or rocks from above absolute security from the first is obtainable by tying the party together at intervals to a rope if there be only two in company they should be tied together at eight or ten paces apart against the second danger the rope is usually effective though frightful accidents have occurred by the fall of one man dragging along with him the whole chain of his companions against the third danger there is no resource but circumspection ice falls chiefly in the heat of the day it is from limestone cliffs that the falling rocks are nearly always detached when climbing ice of the most moderate slope nailed boots are an absolute necessity and for steep slopes of ice the iceaxe described below is equally essential  alpine outfit consists of ropes iceaxe or alpenstock there must be at least one iceaxe in the party nailed boots coloured spectacles veil or else a linen mask muffettees and gaiters  i give the following extracts from the report of a committee appointed by the alpine club in 1864 on ropes axes and alpenstocks  ropeswe have endeavoured to ascertain what ropes will best stand the sharp jerk which would be caused by a man falling suddenly into a crevasse or down an iceslope and on this subject we lay before the club the result of nearly a hundred experiments made with various kinds of rope purchased of the best london makers we considered that the least weight with which it was practically useful to test ropes was twelve stone as representing the average weight of a light man with his whole alpine equipment in the preliminary experiments therefore all ropes were rejected which did not support the strain produced by twelve stone falling five feet under this trial all those plaited ropes which are generally supposed to be so strong and many most carefullymade twisted ropes gave way in such a manner as was very startling to some of our number who had been in the habit of using these treacherous cords with perfect and most unfounded confidence only four ropes passed successfully through this trial these were all made by messrs buckingham and sons of 33 broadstreet bloomsbury and can be procured only of them we confined our further experiments to these ropes one of which failed under severer tests while the remaining three made respectively of manilla hemp italian hemp and flax proved so nearly equal in strength that it may fairly be doubted which is on the whole to be preferred each of these three ropes will bear twelve stone falling ten feet and fourteen stone falling eight feet and it may be useful to say that the strain upon a rope loaded with a weight of fourteen stone and suddenly checked after a fall of eight feet is nearly equal to that which is caused by a dead weight of two tons none of these ropes however will bear a weight of fourteen stone falling ten feet and the result of our experiments is that no rope can be made whether of hemp flax or silk which is strong enough to bear that strain and yet light enough to be portable we believe that these ropes which weigh about threequarters of an ounce to the foot are the heaviest which can be conveniently carried about in the alps we append a statement of the respective merits of the three kinds all of which are now made by messrs buckingham expressly for the club and marked by a red worsted thread twisted in the strands  no 1 manilla hemp weight of 20 yards 48 oz advantagesis softer and more pliable than 2 is more elastic than 2 and 3 when wet is far more pleasant to handle than 2 and 3 disadvantageshas a tendency to wear and fray at a knot  no 2 italian hemp weight of 20 yards 43 oz advantagesis less bulky than 1 and 3 is harder and will probably wear best being least likely to cut against rocks disadvantagesis much more still and difficult to untie than 1 and 3 when wet is very disagreeable to handle and is apt to kink  no 3 flax weight of 20 yards 44 oz advantageswhen dry is softer more pliable and easier to handle than 1 and 2 and will probably wear better than 1 disadvantageswhen wet becomes decidedly somewhat weaker and is nearly as disagreeable to handle as 2  knotsthere can be no doubt that every knot in a rope weakens its power of resisting a sudden jerking strain how great a loss of strength results from a knot we cannot undertake to estimate but that the loss is a very serious one the following statement will show these ropes which we report will resist the strain of fourteen stone falling eight feet will not resist it if there is a knot in any one of them or even if the knots used in attaching them to the point of support or to the weights be roughly or carelessly made the rope in these cases breaks at the knot for two reasons partly because of the folds as they cross in the knot are strained suddenly across each other and one of them is cut through and partly because the rope is so sharply bent that the outer side of each fold in the knot is much more stretched than the inner side so that the strain comes almost entirely upon one side only of each fold for the first reason we found it necessary to put a pad of some kind inside the knotleather linen or a little tow or waste rope will do for the second reason we preferred knots in which the folds are least sharply bent round each other that is in which the curves are large we therefore conclude that1st no knot which is not absolutely necessary ought to be allowed to remain on the rope 2nd the tighter and harder a knot becomes the worse it is 3rd the more loose and open a knot is made the better it isand we append diagrams of those knots which we found by experiment weaken the rope least for alpine ropes only three sorts of knots are ever required and we suggest one of each kindno 1 is for the purpose of joining two ends no 2 is for the purpose of making a loop at one end no 3 is for the purpose of making a loop in the middle when the ends are fastened no 4 is a knot of which we give a diagram in order that no one may imitate it it is one of those which most weaken the rope the only one which seemed to be equally injurious is the common single knot of which no diagram is necessary as the topes which we have recommended are very liable to become untwisted unless the loose ends are secured we advise travellers in order to avoid knots to have the ends of every piece of rope bound with waxed twine it should also be known that it is very unsafe to join two pieces of rope by looping one end through the other so that when the jerk comes they will be strained across each other as two links of a chain are strained across each other unless a pad of some kind divides the loops one will cut the other through  four diagrams of knots on this page  axesthe axes made in england for the purpose of being taken out to switzerland may be divided into two classes namely travellers axes intended to be used for chipping a few occasional steps for enlarging and clearing out those imperfectly made and for holding on to a snowslopeand guides axes which are the heavier implements required for making long staircases in hard blue ice we have had three models prepared of which diagrams are appended the first two represent the lighter axe or what we have termed the travellers axe and the third the heavier instrument required for guides work diagram no 1 represents a light axe or pick of a kind somewhat similar to that recommended by mr stephen in a paper published a short time ago in the journal it has in the first place the great advantage of lightness and handiness while its single blade to some extent combines the stepcutting qualities possessed by the two cutters of the ordinary doubleheaded axe though the latter instrument is on the whole decidedly superior the small hammerheaded axe though the latter instrument is on the whole decidedly superior the small hammerhead at the back is added in order to balance the pick and in some degree to improve the hold when the axehead comes to be used as a crutch handle this form it should be understood we recommend on account of its lightness and of its convenient shape diagram no 2 represents a travellers axe slightly heavier than the first and as this is the shape which appears to us the best adapted for mountain work of all kinds we desire shortly to state our reasons for recommending it to members of the club  fig 1 and fig 2 shapes of axes are on this page  in the first place it is absolutely necessary that one of the cutters should be made in the form of a pick as this is by far the best instrument for hacking into hard ice and is also extremely convenient for holding on to a snowslope or hooking into crannies or on to ledges of rock  for the other cutter we recommend an adzeshaped blade and we are convinced that this is the form which will be found most generally useful as being best suited for all the varieties of stepcutting the hatchetshaped blade used by the chamouni guides is no doubt a better implement for making a staircase diagonally up a slope but on the other hand it is exceedingly difficult to cut steps downwards with a blade set on in this manner and as mountaineers rarely come down the way by which they went up if they can help it it is obvious that this objection to the chamouni form of axe is conclusive  we recommend that the edge of the blade should be angular instead of circular although the latter shape is more common because it is clear that the angular edge cuts into frozen snow more quickly and easily  the curve which is the same in all the axes approaches to coincidence with the curve described by the axe in making the stroke a curve is in our opinion desirable in order to bring the point more nearly opposite the centre of percussion and to make the head more useful for holding on to rocks or a slope  the axe shown in diagram no 2 though slightly heavier than no 1 is not of sufficient weight or strength for cutting a series of steps in hard ice to those gentlemen therefore who do not object to carrying weight but who desire to have an axe fit for any kind of work we recommend no 3 as this is exactly similar in shape to no 2 differing from it only in size we have not thought it necessary to give a separate diagram of no 3  as to the mode of fastening which is the same in all three axes we should have felt some diffidence in giving an opinion had we not been fortunate enough to obtain the advice of an experienced metalworker by whom we were strongly recommended to adopt the fastening shown in the diagrams as being the method generally considered best in the trade for attaching the heads of hatchets or large hammers likely to be subjected to very violent strains it will be seen that the axehead and fastening are forged in one solid piece the fastening consisting of two strong braces or straps of steel which are pressed into the wood about oneeighth of an inch and are secured by two rivets passed through the wood and clenched on each side the braces are put at the side instead of in front of and behind the axe because by this means the strain which falls on the axe acts against the whole breadth of the steel fastenings and not against their thickness merely  we believe that this is the firmest method of fastening which can be adopted and that so long as the wood is sound it is scarcely possible for the head of the axe to get loose or to come off and it has the further advantage of strengthening the wood instead of weakening it and of distributing the strain produced by stepcutting over a large bearing it should be added that these axeheads and fastenings ought to be made entirely of steel  the dimensions of the axeheads are as follow  no 1  length of blade measured from the wood 4 12 inches            breadth of blade at

might be made moveable so as to be capable of being put on and taken off the handle quickly and easily we regret to say however that we were unable to discover any plan by which this can be effectually done we examined very carefully the numerous and formidable weapons which have been sent in by members for exhibition most of which had elaborate contrivances for fastening on the axehead these were all however liable to very serious objections some were evidently insecure with others it was necessary that the axehead should be surmounted by a huge knob which would prove a most serious impediment in stepcutting while in the best and firmest which we found the axehead was attached to the pole by means of nuts and screws projecting at the side or over the top of the axe this latter method of fastening seems to us awkward and possibly dangerous as the nuts from their position are very likely to become loose or to get broken off and cannot except when dangerously loose be fastened or unfastened without a key or wrencha troublesome article certain to be lost on the first expedition  the handle of the axe should we think be made of ash we recommend this wood in preference to deal which is lighter and nearly as strong because in choosing a piece of ash it is easier to select with certainty thoroughly sound and wellseasoned wood and in preference to hickory and lancewood which are stronger because these woods are extremely heavy  the handle should we believe be of a very slightly oval form as it is then more convenient to the grasp than if round as to the thickness of the wood we are satisfied it ought nowhere to be less than 1 38 inch since a pole of that diameter made of ordinarily good ash is the smallest which cannot be permanently bent by a heavy mans most violent effort although we have seen some pieces of unusually strong ash of a less thickness which proved inflexible  we recommend then that the oval section of the handle should have a shorter diameter of 1 38 inch and a longer diameter of 1 12 inch and that the thickness should be the same from one end to the other the length of the handles for nos 1 and 2 should be such that they will reach to just under the arm at the shoulder the handle for no 3 which is intended to be used exclusively as an axe should be between 3 12 and 4 feet long the lower end of the handle should be strengthened in the usual way by a ferrule and armed with a spike  the spike should be from 3 12 to 4 inches long clear of the end of the handle and should be prevented from moving by a slight rivet passed through it near the upper end after it is fastened in the exact form of the spike and ferrule are represented in the diagram  we have further to recommend for axehandles an addition which is liable to suspicion as an entire innovation but which we are confident will be found valuable at those critical moments when the axe is required to hold up two or three men it has happened that when the axe has been struck into the snow a man has been unable to keep his hold of the handle which slips out of his hand and leaves him perfectly helpless to guard against this mischance we propose to fasten a band of leather round the handle at a distance of a foot from the ferrule at the lower end this leather should be about an eighth of an inch thick and will be quite sufficient to check the hand when it is sliding down the handle it should be lashed round the wood and strained tight when wet  alpenstockswhat we have said about the handle of the axe applies in all respects to the alpenstock except that the length of the latter should be different and that the leathern ring would of course not be required it is generally thought most convenient that the alpenstock should be high enough to touch the chin of its owner as he stands upright but this is a matter on which it is scarcely possible and were it possible scarcely necessary to lay down an absolute rule  bootsseveral nails are sure to be

shoemakers when they hammer nails into the boot there is a wellknown contrivance of screws with jagged heads for screwing into boots when a little ice has to be crossed they do excellently for occasional purposes but not for regular icework as they are easily torn out crampons are soles of leather with spikes they are tied over the shoes but neither english mountaineers nor modern guides

far as i have now described it would exclude every ray of light from the eyes next a long narrow slit of the thickness of a thin sawcut is made along the middle almost from end to end through this

coloured glass  maskis merely a pockethandkerchief with strings to tie it over the face eyeholes are cut in it also a hole for the nose over which a protecting triangular piece of linen is thrown and another hole opposite the mouth to breathe through it is drawn below the chin so as to tie firmly in place the mask prevents the face from being cut to pieces by the cold dry winds and blistered by the powerful rays of the sun reverberated from the snow    cattle   happy is the traveller who has the opportunity of hiring his cattle with their attendants for his delay and cares are then reduced to those of making a bargain and of riding what he has hired and when one set of animals is tired or worn out he can leave them behind and ride on with others but for the most part explorers must drive their own beasts with them they must see to their being watered tended and run after when astray help to pack and harness them fatigue themselves for their benefit and drudge at the work of a cowherd for some hours a day  in fitting out a caravan as few different kinds of animals should be taken as possible or they will split into separate herds and require many men to look after them  the dispositions of the animals that compose a caravan affect in no small degree the pleasure of travelling with it now it is to be noticed that men attach themselves to horses and asses and in a lesser degree to mules and oxen but they rarely make friends of camels  weights carried by cattlethe net weights that these different animals carry in trying longcontinued journeysthrough stages uncertain in length sometimes leading to good pasture sometimes to badmust not be reckoned higher than the following and an animal draws about 2 12 times as much net weight as he carriesan ass 65 lbs a small mule 90 lbs a horse lbs an ox lbs a camel lbs to 200 lbs elephant lbs in level countrieswhere there is grain and where the road is known and a regularity in the days work can be ensuredthe weights that may be carried are fully double those of the above list captain burtons donkeys in east africa carried immense weights dogs will draw a travail which see of 60 lbs for a distance of 15 miles a day upon hard level country  theory of loads and distanceshow should we load men or animals of transport and how should we urge them in order to obtain the largest amount of effective labour if they carry a mere featherweight they may make long days journeys but their value as animals of transport is almost nothing again on the other hand if we load them with an excessive weight they will soon come to a standstill and in this case as in the first their value as beasts of transport is almost nil what then is that moderate load by which we shall obtain the largest amount of useful effect this is a problem which many of the ablest engineers and philosophers have endeavoured to solve and the formulaepartly based on theory and partly on experimentwhich were used by euler are generally accepted as a fair approximation they are very simple and peculiarly interesting on account of their wide applicability they are equally true for men animals or machines and are wholly independent of the way in which the power is applied whether for instance a man carries his burden or draws it or rows or punts it in a boat or winds it up with a crank or treadmill  travellers might well turn the theory to account on their own behalf they are well situated for testing its truthfulness by observing the practices of the countries in which they are travelling reliable facts upon the extreme distances that can be travelled over day after day by people carrying different loads but equally circumstanced in every other respect would be very acceptable to me  the formulae are as followlet b be the burden which would just suffice to prevent an animal from moving a step d the distance he could travel daily if unloaded also let b1 be some burden less than b and let d1 be the distance to which he could travel daily when carrying b1                       then b1 d2  bdd12   1  again the useful effect is a maximum if b1d1 is a maximum  when this is the case then                       b1  49 b   2 and                      3 d1  d     3  in other words an animal gets through most work in the day if he carries 49 of the greatest load he could just stagger under in which case he will be able to travel 13 of the distance he could walk if he carried no load at all machinery requires no repose and therefore d the distance per day is convertible into v the velocity of movement  as an examplesuppose a man is able to walk 10 miles a day with a load of 130 lbs and 33 miles a day when he carries nothing then from equation 1 the value of b the burden under which he would be brought to a standstill would be about 267 12 and the best load for him from equation 2 would be 119 lbs which he would be able to carry according to equation 3 11 miles a day  horsesthe mode of taking wild horses is by throwing the lasso whilst pursuing them at full speed and dropping a noose over their necks by which their speed is soon checked and they are choked down  mr rareys sixpenny book tells all that can be told on the subject of horsebreaking but far more lies in the skill and horseknowledge of the operator than in the mere theory his way of mastering a vicious horse is by taking up one forefoot bending the knee slipping a loop over the knee until it comes to the pasternjoint and then fixing it tight the loop must be caused to embrace the part between the hoof and the pasternjoint firmly by the help of a strap of some kind lest it should slip the horse is now on three legs and he feels conquered if he gets very mad wait leisurely till he becomes quiet then caress him and let the leg down and allow him to rest then repeat the process if the horse kicks in harness drive him slowly on three legs  in breakingin a stubborn beast it is convenient to physic him until he is sick and out of spirits or to starve him into submission  salt keeps horses from straying if they are accustomed to come up to the camp and get it but it is a bad plan as they are apt to hang about instead of going off to feed they are so fond of salt that they have been known to stray back to a distant house where they had been allowed to lick it  shooting horsespur him as much as you will but never use a whip

described elsewhere see horses in index  mulesmules require men who know their habits they are powerful beats and can only be mastered with skill and address a savage will not assist in packing them for he fears their heels the swiss say mules have always an arrierepensee they have odd secret ways strange fancies and lurking vice when they stray they go immense distances and it is almost beyond the power of a man on foot to tend them in a wild country he can neither overtake them easily nor when overtaken catch them the female is in most breeds much the more docile they suffer from african distemper but in a less degree than horses the following descriptions of mule caravans are exceedingly graphic and instructivethe madrina or godmother is a most important personage she is an old steady mare with a little bell round her neck and wheresoever she goes the mules like good children follow her if several large troops are turned into one field to graze in the morning the muleteer has only to lead the madrinas a little apart and tinkle their bells and although there may be 200 or 300 mules together each immediately knows its own bell and separates itself from the rest the affection of these animals for their madrina saves infinite trouble it is nearly impossible to lose an old mule for if detained several hours by force she will by the power of smell like a dog track out her companions or rather the madrina for according to the muleteer she is the chief object of affection the feeling however is not of an individual nature for i believe i am right in saying that any animal with a bell will serve as a madrina charles darwin  after travelling about 14 miles we were joined by three miners and our mules taking a sudden liking for their horses jogged on at a more brisk rate the instincts of the mulish heart form an interesting study to the traveller in the mountains i would were the comparison not too ungallant liken it to a womans for it is quite as uncertain in its sympathies bestowing its affections when least expected and when bestowed quite as constant so long as the object is not taken away sometimes a horse sometimes an ass captivates the fancy of a whole drove of mules but often an animal nowise akin lieutenant beale told me that his whole train of mules once galloped off suddenly on the plains of the cimarone and ran half a mile when they halted in apparent satisfaction the cause of their freak was found to be a buffalocalf which had strayed from the herd they were frisking around it in the greatest delight rubbing their noses against it throwing up their heels and making themselves ridiculous by abortive attempts to neigh and bray while the poor calf unconscious of its attractive qualities stood trembling in their midst it is customary to have a horse in the muletrains of the traders of north mexico as a sort of magnet to keep together the separate atoms of the train for whatever the temptation they will never stray from him taylors eldorado  assesnotwithstanding his inveterate obstinacy the ass is an excellent and sober little beast far too much despised by us he is not only the most enduring but also one of the quickest walkers among cattle being usually promoted to the leadership of a caravan he is nearly equal to the camel in enduring thirst and thrives on the poorest pasture suffers from few diseases and is unscathed by african distemper the long desertroads and pilgrimtracts of north africa are largely travelled over by means of asses  asses taught not to kickmungo park says that the negroes where he travelled taught their asses as followsthey cut a forked stick and put the forked part into the asss mouth like the bit of a bridle they then tied the two smaller parts together above his head leaving the lower part of sufficient length to strike against the ground if the ass should attempt to put his head down it always proved effectual  not to braymessrs huc and gabet who were distracted by the continual braying of one of their asses throughout the night appealed to their muleteer he put a speedy close to the nuisance by what appears to be a customary contrivance in china viz by lashing a heavy stone to the beasts tail it appears that when an ass wants to bray he elevates his tail and if his tail be weighted down he has not the heart to bray in hostile neighbourhoods where silence and concealment are sought it might be well to adopt this rather absurd treatment an ass who was being schooled according to the method of this and the preceding paragraph both at the same time would be worthy of an artists sketch  oxenthough oxen are coarse gross and phlegmatic beasts they have these merits they are eminently gregarious and they ruminate their food the consequence is first that one two or more are very seldom missing out of a drove and secondly that they pick up what they require in a much shorter time than horses mules etc who have to chew as they eat oxen require less tending than any other beasts of burden  to train a packoxan ox of any age however wild he may be can be broken in in three or four days so as to carry a pack of about 70 lbs though it is true that he will frequently kick it off during the journey and give excessive trouble it would be scarcely possible to drive more than three of these newlytaught oxen at a time on account of the frequent delays caused by the unruliness of one or other of them muich depends on the natural aptitude of the animal in estimating the time required for making a steady packox some will carry a good weight and go steadily after only a fortnights travel some will never learn but in all cases they prove unruly at the beginning of a journey  to breakin an ox take a long thong or cord make a noose at one end of it and let two or three men lay hold of the other then driving all the herd together in a clump go in among them and aided by a long stick push or slip the noose round the hind leg of the ox that you want and draw tight he will pull and struggle with all his might and the other oxen will disperse leaving him alone dragging the men about after him next let another man throw a noose round his horns and the beast is comparatively speaking secured it is now convenient to throw the animal down on his side which is easily done by the judicious tugging at his tail and at the thongs to keep him on the ground let one man take the tail and passing it round one thigh hold him down by that while one or two men force the horns down against the ground his nose has next to be pierced a stick shaped like a y eight inches long is cut of some tough wood and the foot of it being first sharpened is forcibly poked through the wall that divides the nostrils and a thin thong is tied firmly to either end of this nosestick the thong is gathered together and wound in a figure of 8 round the two horns where it henceforward remains while the animal feeds and by clutching at which he is at any time caught  next for the packing as the ox lies on the ground scrape a hole in the sand under his belly and then having laid a few skins on his back pass a thong round him and them several times tie the ends fast and taking a stick pass it through and twist it round until the lashings are extremely tight then let it be secured now let the ox go and get quickly out of his way in case he should be savage when the ox gets up he is sulky and ferocious by turns and kicks jumps and bellows but at last joins his companions  if he has been well packed the skins will keep in place and not fall off but whether they do or not he must be recaught and repacked every day a young ox is generally more difficult to breakin than an old one i do not know why an ox requires no packsaddle his back is too round to carry one with advantage it is therefore usual to lay spare skins etc upon him and over these the bags that have to be packed a great length of thong is required to lash them it is convenient to make a pair of very large saddlebags out of skin or canvas which require simply to be placed on the oxs back and there girthed  to train an ox to carry a riderit takes a very long time to train an ox to carry a ridingsaddle well and steadily indeed very few oxen can be taught to go wherever they may be guided by the rider they are of so gregarious a nature that for the most part they will not move a step without companions hence those oxen only are thought worth breakingin which are observed to take the part of leaders of the drove when pasturing and which are therefore supposed to have some independence of disposition the first time of mounting an ox to break him in is a work of almost certain mischance for the long horns of the ox will often reach the rider however far back he may sit and the animal kicks and bucks in a way that severely tries the best of seats all ridingoxens horns should have the tips sawn off after being mounted a very few times the ox goes pretty steadily but it is long before he learns to carry a rider with ease to himself i should like to hear if rareys plan of tying up the foreleg would influence them their character is so wholly unlike that of a horse that i doubt if it would  in riding it must be recollected that the temper of an ox is far less quick though his sensations may be as acute as those of a horse thus he does not start forwards on receiving a cut with the whip even though he shrink with the pain but he thinks about it shakes his head waits a while and then breaks gradually into a faster pace an ox will trot well enough with a light weight and though riding myself upwards of 13 stone i once took an ox 60 miles in a day and a half this is perhaps as much as an ox could in fairness be made to do a rideox can be tied up by his nosebridle but if wild or frightened he will assuredly struggle till the nosestick be torn out of his nose and he becomes free it is therefore better to tie the bridle to a tuft of grass or a slender twig rather than to a tree or to the saddlebags mounting an ox is usually a troublesome business on account of his horns to make rideoxen quiet and tame scratch their backs and tailsthey dearly love itand hold salt in your hands for them to lick they soon learn their names and come to be caressed when called  cowsmost breeds of cows out of europe cease to give milk after their calf dies and the only way of making them continue their yield is to spread out the calfs hide for them to lick some time before milking them it retains its effect for a week or more messrs huc and gabet give the following graphic account of this contrivance as applied to restive cowsthese longtailed cows are so restive and difficult to milk that to keep them at all quiet the herdsman has to give them a calf to lick meanwhile but for this device not a single drop of milk could be obtained from them one day a lama herdsman who lived in the same house with ourselves came with a long dismal face to announce that his cow had calved during the night and that unfortunately the calf was dying it died in the course of the day the lama forthwith skinned the poor beast and stuffed it with hay this proceeding surprised us at first for the lama had by no means the air of a man likely to give himself the luxury of a cabinet of natural history when the operation was completed we observed that the haycalf had neither feet nor head whereupon it occurred to us that after all it was perhaps a pillow that the lama contemplated we were in error but the error was not dissipated till the next morning when our herdsman went to milk his cow seeing him issue forththe pail in one hand the haycalf under the other armthe fancy occurred to us to follow him his first proceeding was to put the haycalf down before the cow he then turned to milk the cow herself the mamma at first opened enormous eyes at her beloved infant by degrees she stooped her head towards it then smelt at it sneezed three or four times and at last proceeded to lick it with the most delightful tenderness this spectacle grated against our sensibilities it seemed to us that he who first invented this parody upon one of the most touching incidents in nature must have been a man without a heart a somewhat burlesque circumstance occurred one day to modify the indignation with which this treachery inspired us by dint of caressing and licking her little calf the tender parent one fine morning unripped it the hay issued from within and the cow manifesting not the slightest surprise nor agitation proceeded tranquilly to devour the unexpected provender  the highlanders used this contrivance and called it a tulchan hence king jamess bishops were nicknamed tulchan bishops to imply that they were officials of straw merely set up as

troublesome to drive than sheep neither are they such enduring walkers nor do they give as much meat but their skins are of such great use to furnish strong leather that it is seldom convenient to

much use to flog him twisting or biting his tail is the usual way or making a blaze with grass and a few sticks under his nostrils the stubborness of a halfbroken ox is sometimes beyond conception  cattle bells in countries where they can be used without danger should always be taken it adds greatly to the cheerfulness and gregariousness of the animalsmules positively require them hard wood is sonorous enough for bells  brands and cattlemarksin buying oxen out of the herds of pastoral people it is very difficult to remember each animal so as to recognise it again if it strays back to its former home it requires quite a peculiar talent to do so therefore it is advisable that the travellers cattle should be marked or branded a trader in namaqua land took red paint and tied a brush on to a long stick with this he made a daub on the hind quarters of the freshlybought and halfwild cattle as they pushed through the door of his kraal it naturally excites great ridicule among natives to paint an ox that he may be known again but for all that i think the traders plan well worth adopting the same might be done to sheep as a slit ear is not half conspicuous enough a good way of marking a sheeps ear is to cut a wad out of the middle of it with a gunpunch but it will sometimes tear this hole into a slit by scratching with its foot  chaff to cuttie a sickle against a tree with its blade projecting then standing in front of the blade hold a handful of reeds across it with both hands one hand on either side of the blade pull it towards you and the reeds will be cut through drop the cut end seize the bundle afresh and repeat the process in this way after a little practice chaff is cut with great ease and quickness a broken sickle does as well as a whole one and a knife may be used but the curve of its edge is ill adapted for the work  cattle will eat many sorts of herbage as reeds and gorse if cut small but will not touch them if uncut  occasional food for cattlethey will also eat seaweed and leaves especially birch and poplar leaves and even thrive upon them  illustration of man cutting chaff as described on p 64  pulling cattle out of holesthe bight of a cord or of some substitute for one may be thrown over a horses head and he can be dragged out by a team of cattle with but very little danger to his neck a crupper under his tail or a thong as a breeching may be used in canada and the united states a noose of rope is often run round the horses neck and hauled tightthus temporarily choking the animal and making him still he is then pulled as quickly as possible out of the hole and no time is lost in slackening the rope    harness   saddles for ridinggood saddles for riding and i may add especially for packing are of nearly as great importance as the goodness of the animal who carries them english saddlers never i believe can be induced to stuff a saddle sufficiently because they have no opportunity of seeing the miserable scraggy condition of a travelled horses back to which it is destined to fit but an english saddle restuffed at a bush frontier town is excellent  three rings and nine of what saddlers call ds should be fixed to the saddle not simply into the leatherwork but firmly riveted or secured into the tree itself this must be especially insisted on or frequent disasters will occur the three rings are to be fixed to the pommelone on the top and one on each side of it the nine ds are placed as followsthree along the back of the saddle two more on each side of the seat and two in front for the breastplate  fittingsto these may be tied a light valise in front a gunholster on the right of the pommel and a small bagcontaining odds and ends gunpowder spare bullets a few presents etcon its left on the right of the seat a

perhaps the watercanteen can then be taken an ox carries a saddle precisely like a horse i rode mine nearly 1600 miles in south africa with a common huntingsaddle and its ordinary girths  in default of ridingsaddles a packsaddle must be cushioned to form a comfortable seat see packsaddles  saddlebags are so troublesome to open and require so many straps that i believe it is best to use a bag of macintosh or canvas rolled up and tied behind the saddle where it should rest on a pad the pad is made of two cushions each 9 inches long and 4 broad sewn on a piece of leather lying parallel to one another and 4 inches apart the space between the cushions corresponds to the backbone of the horse to keep the whole in shape it is usual to stitch four or five laths of wood lengthways to the upper surface of the pad upon these laths the bag will rest if there be occasion to carry a bag on horseback for a short distance pass one of the stirrupleathers through its string then throw the bag over to the other side of the saddle it will lie behind the riders leg and be out of his way and he will sit upon part of its string  australians as is well known insist on the merits of a swag or a long package formed by rolling all their possessions into their blanket they carry it over the saddlebows  sore backssore backs are the plague of beasts of burden for if the skin be once broken it will never heal thoroughly again during the whole journey every precaution should therefore be taken at first starting the saddles should be wellstuffed the saddlecloths ample and without hem or edging blankets are as good as any the journeys should be short the packs light and carefully balanced rests of a day or two should frequently be given and saltwater should be rubbed on the back travelling in the very early morning is found to be bad for animals backs but travelling late at night is not so an australian correspondent remarks that a party of travellers or explorers in australia on leaving their camp invariably saddle their horses with ample saddlecloths below the saddle and assist each other by turns to fold the cloths in various ways for instance if the ridge of the back or wither should be found galled the cloth would be folded up so that the saddle should rest entirely on the two folded pads as in the figureother modes of folding will suggest themselves according to the way in which the back may be rubbed  drawing of folded saddlecloth  the first appearance of a sore back is a small hardish swelling or warble this must at once be attended to either by folding the saddlecloth in some appropriate way or by picking out the saddlestuffing so as to ease all pressure from off it otherwise it will get larger and larger and a single day will convert what might have been easily cured into a serious and irremediable gall girthgalls on their first appearance may be relieved if not cured by sewing two rolls of soft woollen material on to the girth the hair from the animals mane or tail has been used on an emergency to stuff a saddle  fig 1 2 3 show different pack saddles  packsaddlesto make when travellingcut four bent pieces of touch wood and two small planks

packropes  packsaddles made by saddlersthere has been perhaps no journey in which packhorses worked so effectively as during the exploration of north australia under mr gregory i am much indebted to mr baines the artist of the expedition who has subsequently travelled extensively for the following very interesting account  the packsaddles were made after a model by mr gregory and are the best i have yet seen two boards of light wood are connected by bows of iron 1 12 inch wide and 14 inch thick with hooks inserted in either side for the packbags to hook on to the straps for the breastings breechings and girths were screwed to the boards the crupper passed through a ring on the after bow and a light pad which could easily be taken out to be restuffed was secured by small thongs passed through holes in the ends of the boards we had two girths which crossed each other under the horse in unloading the neckstrap is unbuckled on the near side also the breasting and girths and the whole is drawn off behind  fig 1 and 2 and an unlabelled figure on this page further illustrate packing  the packbags were made of one width of canvas turned up so as to have no seam in the bottom pearshaped pieces were sewn in to form the ends and rope was stitched along the seams having eyes above by which the bag was hung upon the hooks fig 2 the flourbags were made of canvas of the usual width with a round bottom stitched into them the mouth was sewn up when full and an oiled bag of the same size drawn over it  when all our horses were saddled up the word on packs was given dr mueller and i used to work together and had our packs laid out in pairs so that when each horse was led between his bags we hooked them on at the same moment when we halted we laid our bags on a couple of poles to keep them from the ground as in the drawing  the bags sometimes came off when we were travelling but it was generally easy to catch the horse and reload him when a horse rolled over or fell in a river it was rather an advantage than otherwise to get clear of them our waterproof bags were of leather lined with waterproof cloth just large enough to fill one of the canvas packbags they had a brass neck with a worm inside in which we screwed a plug of soft wood there was rarely if ever occasion to use them each pair of bags was carefully balanced one against the other that the horses might not be unequally loaded the average weight of stores carried in each bag was 75 lbs making a load at starting or 150 lbs exclusive of bags packages or saddlery bells were attached to the necks of the horses most apt to stray but the clappers were tied up with a piece of thong to keep them quiet on the march and were loosened at night so that the sound might guide us in searching for them next morning  sketch of saddle bags on tree  we watched two hours each during night the morning watch boiled the water and woke the rest at four we made our breakfast of tea or coffee damper and pork which we ate raw and went out for the horses which were generally saddled up and on the move before sunrise we travelled till one or two when we led the horses to water looked to any sores that might be caused by the pressure of their saddles dressed them and altered the stuffing of the saddle to give them relief and after dinner which was rather a brief ceremony had the rest of the day for scientific or artistic pursuitsthat is if something else did not require immediate attention we could never trust to our guns for provision as game was very scarce and we had no opportunity of seeking it  sir samuel baker gave considerable attention to the subject of packsaddles the following is his account of the method he adopted in africai had arranged their the donkeys packs so well that they carried their loads with the greatest comfort each animal had an immense pad well stuffed with goats hair this rested from the shoulder to the hip bones upon this rested a simple form of saddle made of two forks of boughs inverted and fastened together with rails there were no nails in these saddles all the fastenings being secured with thongs of raw hide the great pad projecting before and behind and also below the side of the saddle prevented the loads from chafing the animal every donkey carried two large bags made from the hides of antelopes that i had formerly shot on the frontier of abyssinia and these were arranged with toggles on the one to fit into loops on the other so that the loading and unloading was exceedingly simple the success of an expedition depends mainly upon the perfection of the details and where animals are employed for transport the first consideration should be bestowed upon saddlepacks the facility of loading is allimportant and i now had an exemplification of its effect upon both animals and men the latter began to abuse the camels and to curse the father of this and the mother of that because they had the trouble of unloading them for the descent into the rivers bed while the donkeys were blessed with the endearing name of my brother and alternately whacked with the stick  the art of packingthe art of good packing is to balance the packs accurately and to lash tightly to the saddle so that they will never slip the entire load is then secured to the animals back by moderate girthing it is going on a false principle to wind one long cord round the horse saddle and packs making as it were a great faggot of them  to tighten the lashings of a pack thrust a stick through them twist it forcibly round and round till the lashings

are strangled out of shape and never lie firmly against the saddle  other harnesscruppersa crupper rope should be passed through a leather tube fitting it loosely cruppers for packsaddles adapted to very mountainous countries like those used in norway can readily be made by travellers instead of employing a ring to enclose the tail of the beast which is sure to fret its sides he should pass a curved bar of wood a foot long underneath the tail and tie a cord to the packsaddle from either end of the bar  girthsa roll of spare webbing should be taken to patch up torn girths but a good substitute for a girth is made by cutting a band of tanned or even of dressed leather to within four inches of its end into seven or nine bands and plaiting these together but it takes a beginner just ten times as long to plait a girth as to weave it and therefore for making more than one girth it is well worth while to set up a rude loom do this as though you were making a mat see mat girths need not be buckled they may be laced  stirrups must be very roomy enough to admit clumsilyshaped shoes such as are made in the bush they must be broad under the sole of the foot and also at the place

but two in the paragraph on rings  sketch of foot and stirrup  bridles and bitsleave behind all english notions of snaffles and double reins and ride with nothing but an easy curb the horse must also carry a headstall and a halter i like one with plenty of tassels to keep off the flies a temporary substitute for a curb is made by noosing a string and putting the noose round the horses lower jaw if the string be long enough it can be doubled back again and tied to the other side of the noose so as to make a complete bridle the grooms fashion of giving the halter a hitch and putting it round the jaw is well known  bucklesa contrivance like this will often be found useful to replace a buckle and strap by twisting the lower thong more tightly its length can be shortened as much as may be required if the tongue of a buckle breaks a nail or a peg pushed through the bucklehole as in the figure below will replace it  three sketches to illustrate items described on this page  to padlock a

are apprehended determine which plan is most advisable a kneehaltered horse has a good change of escape if he scents a wild beast that is creeping up to him for he can gallop though with labour to a short distance a hobbled horse has no chance at all though indeed they have been known to fight desperately with their teeth and feet and learn to be cunning and watchful if the hobbles are of iron and made like handcuffs it is hardly possible for robbersat all events for savagesto unlock or cut them a horse that is hobbled or kneehaltered can graze during the night but if tied up or pounded his grass must be cut for him a horse may be successfully hobbled with a stirrupleather by putting its middle round one fetlock then twisting it halfadozen times and lastly buckling it round the other fetlock the hobble used by mr gregory takes into five separate pieces viz two fetlock straps a1 a2 a chain b having a swivel point c in the middle and two double pothooks d1 d2 which pass through eyes in the fetlock straps and also through the end links in the chain the two ends of both d1 and d2 are thickened and pierced so as to admit of tying a thong across their mouths as shown on one side of d2 the fetlock strap is made of a strip of thick leather folded lengthways down its middle and having its edges sewn together the sewn edge should always be the uppermost when on the horses legs  two sketches on this page illustrating equipment  oxen are often picketed to their yokes i have already mentioned that it is hazardous to secure ride and pack oxen by their nose reams as they will tear themselves loose without heeding the pain if really frightened horses are often tied to the wheels etc of the wagon when you wish to picket horses in the middle of a sandy plain dig a hole two or three feet deep and tying your rope to a faggot of sticks or brushwood or even to a bag filled with sand bury this in it see dateram  swivelthe woodcut shows how a makeshift swivel can be fitted to a tether rope without one the rope will be twisted almost up to a knot by the horse walking round and round his picket peg with one the rope will turn freely in the hole through which its large knotted head prevents it from being drawn  this page has two sketches showing material described below  the figure below is a better sort of swivel it must be made of hard tough wood like oak it is six inches in length it has i presume some advantages over those of iron because in countries where iron abounds as in piedmont it holds its ground against them the ropes have been drawn thinner than their just proportion for the sake of distinctness  i give a drawing of yet another description of swivel it is a trifle more complicated than the first but i am assured that it acts so much better as to be greatly preferable  horsecollarthis in its simplest form consists of two stout bars that are a little bent or shaped with a knife they go one on either side of the animals neck and are tied together both above and below it to these bars which are very thickly padded the traces are fastened  traces and trektows can be made of raw hide cut into a long thong then bent into three parts and twisted and laid together as is done in ropemaking the whole is then stretched tight between two trees to dry an oxhide will make a trektow for four pairs of oxen poles of wood are very generally used as traces a thong or a few links of chain being fastened at either end by which to attach them  greasing harnessin dry climates take frequent opportunities of greasing every part of the harness see hides leather to grease    carriages   wagonsa travellers wagon should be of the simplest possible construction and not too heavy the cape wagons or at all events those of a few years back undoubtedly shared the ponderousness of all dutch workmanship weight is required only when crashing through a bushy country where a wagon must break down all before it in every other case it is objectionable it is a saving of labour to have one large wagon rather than two small ones because a driver and a leader are thereby spared but if a very light wagon has to be taken i should greatly prefer its being made on the swiss and german fashion with a shifting perch as in the figure  drawing of fastening  these are the simplest of affairs and will split up into two cartsthe pole and the forewheels forming one and the perch and the hindwheels another now should a great loss occur among the travellers cattle or should he break a wheel or even strain an axletree in a timberless country it may be very convenient to him to abandon part of his stores and to build up a cart for carrying on the remainder lady vavasour describes one of these wagons in the following graphic mannerthe perch is moveable and they can make it any length they please it is of so simple a construction that every farmer can repair his own and make anything of it if he has a perch a pole and four wheels that is enough with a little ingenuity he makes it carry stones hay earth or anything he wants by putting a plank at each side when he wants a carriage for pleasure he fits it up for that purpose his moveable perch allows him to make it anything i counted seventeen grown persons sitting side by side looking most happy in one of them drawn only by a pair of small horses and in this hilly country  draystwowheeled drays and not wagons are used very generally in australia a long bar is crossed by a short one near one of its endsthis latter forms the axletree the body of the dray is built where the two cross and the cattle are yoked or harnessed to the long end of the bar which acts as a pole  tarring wheelstar is absolutely essential in a hot country to mix with the grease that is used for the wagonwheels grease alone melts and runs away like water the object of the tar is to give consistency to the grease a very small proportion of tar suffices but without any at all a wagon is soon brought to a standstill it is therefore most essential to explorers to have a sufficient quantity in reserve tar is also of very great use in hot dry countries for daubing over the wheels and the woodwork generally of wagons during extreme heat when the wood is ready to crack all the paint should be scraped off it and the tar applied plentifully it will soak in deeply and preserve the wood in excellent condition both during the drought and the ensuing wet season see tar to make it is not necessary to take off the wheels in order to grease the axles it is sufficient to bore an augerhole right through the substance of the nave between the feet of two of the spokes and to keep a plug in the hole then when you want to tar a wheel turn it till the hole is uppermost take the plug out and pour in the tar  breaks and dragsbreaksevery cart and wagon in switzerland and indeed in most parts of the continent has a break attached to it the simplest kind of break is shown in fig 2 which represents a cart tilted upwards fig 1 shows the break itself fig 2 explains how it is fitted on to the cart fig 1 it will easily be understood how by tightening the free end of the cord the break is pressed against the wheels the bent piece of iron shown in fig 2 by which the bar of the break is kept in its place may be replaced by a piece of wood or even by a thong of leather every explorers wagon should be furnished with a break  fig 2  a simple break used in italy in some parts of england and probably elsewhere is shown in fig 3 a rail is lashed to the body of the cart both before and behind the wheel and is made to press against the wheel either both lashings can be tightened at the same time as at a a or only one of them as at b when the lashings are loose the rail rests partly on the nave of the wheel and does not sensibly interfere with its movement  fig 3  other means of checking a wagon on a hillsidein going down a steep hill a middlingsized tree may be felled and its root tied to the hind axletree while its branchy top sweeps along the ground as is seen in the lowermost wagon in the sketch sketch of horses and wagons on hill in the southwest of france the leaders of the team are unharnessed and taken to the back of the wagon to which the collar of the front horse is made fast in this way they can aid the horses in the shafts the same plan may be seen practised hourly in the strand in london whence heavy wagons are taken down a very steep and narrow lane to the adelphi   in descending short steep pitches unharness the cattle and fasten a rope round the axle of the wagon then passing the other end round a tree or rock as a check you may let her slide which she will do without any further trouble on your part f marryat  in some places the hind wheels are taken off and sledge runners are fitted to the hind axletree this is an excellent plan it has the further advantage that the wagon settles down into a more horizontal position than before i have seen timber carried on a wagon down a steep hill by separating the front wheels from the hind ones lashing a trail see travail below or two short poles to the fore axletree and resting one end of the timber on the hind axletree and the other end on the trail  shoe the wheel on the side furthest from the precipice  if you have to leave a cart or wagon untended for a while lock the wheel  sketch of loaded sledge  sledgeswhen carrying wood or stones and doing other heavy work a traveller should spare his wagon and use a sledge this is made by cutting down a forked tree lopping off its branches and shaping it a little with an axe if necessary a few bars may be fixed across the fork so as to make a stage great distances may be traversed by one of these rude affairs if the country is not very stony should it capsize no great harm is done and if it breaks down or is found to have been badly made an hours labour will suffice to construct another sledges are very useful where there is an abundance of horse

wrapped with pieces of buffalo robe where they press against the dog captain blakistona very accurate authorityconsiders that a horse will travel 30 miles in the day dragging on the travail a weight of about 200 lbs including a child whose mother sits on the horses back and that a dog the size of an average retriever will draw about 80 lbs for the same distance nb the north american plains are perfectly level  sketch of horse with travail  palanquins carried like sedanchairs between two animalsone going before the other in shaftsare in use in various countries but i am not aware that explorers have ever properly tried them their advantage would lie in combining the convenience of a cart with much of the independence of packhorses for whatever is lashed on a packsaddle must be securely tied up it is therefore severely compressed and cannot be taken out en route but with a cart or a palanquin there is no such inconvenience things may be quickly thrown into them or taken out pockets and drawers may be fitted up and the palanquin would afford some shelter in rain i should think it would be well worth while to try one of these contrivances it might be made en route first accustoming the animals when carrying their packs to walk between long shafts then after some days taking the load off their saddles and lashing them on to the shafts if all went well a regular palanquin might be constructed with legs to be let down when the animals are offpacked and on which it might stand until ready to be again carried onwards halfadozen palanquins in file would make a pretty and i should think a manageable and effective caravan asses ought to be able to carry them well a couple of asses would probably carry a greater weight than a single packhorse and would give no greater trouble if so their hardiness would be invaluable    swimming   general remarksrate of swimming people swim much more slowly than is commonly supposed in races between firstrate swimmers for distances of 300 yards and upwards the average pace of two miles an hour is barely if at all exceeded  learning to swima good way of teaching a person to swim is a modification of that adopted at eton the teacher may sit in a punt or on a rock with a stout stick of 6 or 10 feet in length at the end of which is a cord of 4 feet or so with loops the learner puts himself into the loops and the teacher plays him as a fisherman would play a fish in water that is well out of his depth he gives him just enough support to keep him from drowning after six or a dozen lessons many boys require no support at all but swim about with the rope dangling slack about them when a boy does this he can be left to shift for himself the art of swimming far is acquired like the art of running far by a determination to go on without resting a moment until utterly unable to make a stroke further and then to stop altogether each succeeding day the distance travelled is marvellously increased until the natural limit of the mans powers is attained the chilliness consequent on staying long in water is retarded by rubbing all over the body before entering it about twice as much oil or bearsgrease as a person uses for his hair  to support those who cannot swimif a person cannot swim a stroke he should be buoyed up with floats under his arms and lashed quite securely to his own satisfaction then he can be towed across the river with a string if he lose courage halfway it cannot be helped it will do him no harm and his swimming friend is in no danger of being grappled with and drowned for very short distances a usual way is for the man who cannot swim to hold his friend by the hips a very little floating power is enough to buoy a mans head above still water see african swimming ferry below  landing through breakersin landing through a heavy surf wait for a large wave and come in on the crest of it then make every possible exertion to scramble up to some firm holdingplace whence its indraught when it returns can be resisted if drawn back you will be heavily battered perhaps maimed certainly far more exhausted than before and not a whit nearer to safety avoid receiving a breaker in the attitude of scrambling away from it on hands and knees from such a position the wave projects a man headforemost with fearful force and rolls him over and over in its surge he ought to turn on his back the instant before the breaker is upon him and then all will go well and he will be helped on and not halfkilled by it men on shore can rescue a man who is being washed to and fro in the surf by holding together very firmly handinhand and forming a line down to the sea the foremost man clutches the swimmer as soon as he is washed up to him and holds him firmly while the wave is retiring the force of the indraught is enormous and none but strong men can withstand it  floatsif a traveller can swim pretty well it is a good plan to make a float when he wishes to cross a river and to lay his breast upon it while his clothes and valuables are enclosed in a huge turban on his head in this way he may cross the broadest streams and float great distances down a river he may tie paddles to his hands his float may consist of a faggot of rushes a log of wood or any one of his empty watervessels whether barrels or bags for whatever will keep water in will also keep it out the small quantity of air which might escape through the sides of a bag should be restored by blowing afresh into it during the voyage a few yards of intestine blown out and tied here and there so as to form so many watertight compartments makes a capital swimming belt it may be wound in a figure of 8 round the neck and under the armpits when employing empty bottles they should be well corked and made fast under the armpits or be stuffed within the shirt or jersey and a belt tied round the waist below them to keep them in place  african swimming ferrythe people of yariba have a singular mode of transporting passengers across rivers and streams when the violence and rapidity of their currents prevent them from using canoes with safety the passenger grasps the float see fig on the top of which his luggage is lashed and a perfect equilibrium is preserved by the ferryman placing himself opposite the passenger and laying hold of both his arms they being thus face to face the owner of the float propels it by striking with his legs the natives use as their float two of their largest calabashes cutting off their small ends and joining the openings face to face so as to form a large hollow watertight vessel  sketch of african swimming ferry  makeshift lifebelta moderately effective lifebelt may be made of holland ticking canvas or similar materials in the following manner and might be used with advantage by the crew of a vessel aground some way from the mainland who are about to swim for their livescut out two complete rings of 16 inches outer diameter and 8 inches inner diameter sew these together along both edges with as fine a needle as possible and with double thread add strong shoulderstraps so that it shall not by any possibility slip down over the hips and lastly sew into it a long narrow tube made out of a strip a foot long and two inches wide of the same material as the belt at the mouth of this a bit of wood an inch long with a hole bored down its middle should be inserted as a mouthpiece through this tube the belt can be reinflated by the swimmer while in the water as often as may be necessary and by simply twisting the tube and tucking its end in the belt its vent can always be closed after a canvas belt is thoroughly drenched it will hold the air very fairly the seams are its weakest parts for supporting a swimmer in calm water a collar is as good as a belt  transport on waterparcelsthe swimmers valuables may as well be put inside the empty vessel that acts as his float as in the turban on his head see floats a goatskin is often filled half full of the things he wants to carry and is then blown out and its mouth secured a very good lifebelt may be bought which admits of this arrangement it has a large opening at one end which is closed by a brass door that shuts like the top of an inkstand and is then quite airtight  a small parcel if tightly wrapped up in many folds will keep dry for a long time though partly immersed in water the outside of it may be greased oiled or waxed for additional security if deeply immersed the water is sure to get in  swimming with horsesin crossing a deep river with a horse or other large animal drive him in or even lead him along a steep bank and push him sideways suddenly into the water having fairly started him jump in yourself seize his tail and let him tow you across if he turns his head with the intention of changing his course splash water in his face with your right or left hand as the case may be holding the tail with one hand and splashing with the other and you will in this way direct him just as you like this is by far the best way of swimming a horse all others are objectionable and even dangerous with animals new to the worksuch as to swim alongside the horse with one hand on his shoulder or worst of all to retain your seat on his back if this last method be persisted in at least let the rider take his feet out of the stirrups before entering the water  sketch of horse and man crossing river  to float a wagon across a riverit must be well ballasted or it will assuredly capsize the heavy contents should be stowed at the bottom the planking lashed to the axletrees or it will float away from them great bundles of reeds and the empty watervessels should be made fast high above all and then the wagon will cross without danger when it is fairly under weigh the oxen will swim it across pulling in their yokes  water spectacleswhen a man opens his eyes under water he can see nothing distinctly but everything is as much out of focus as if he looked in air through a pair of powerful spectacles that were utterly unsuited to him he cannot distinguish the letters of the largest print in a newspaper advertisement he cannot see the spaces between the outstretched fingers at arms length in clear water nor at a few inches distance in water that is somewhat opaque i read a short paper on this subject at the british association in 1865 in which i showed the precise cause of this imperfection of vision and how it might be remedied if the front of our eyeballs had been flat we should have had the power of seeing under water as clearly as in air but instead of being flat they are very convex consequently our eye stamps a concave lens of high power into the water and it is the seeing through this concave eyeglass which our eyeball makes for itself that causes the indistinctness of our vision knowing the curvature of the eyeball it is easy to calculate as i did in the memoir mentioned above the curvature of a convex lens of flintglass that should when plunged into water produce effects of an exactly equal and contrary value exactly neutralizing the effects of the concave eyeglass of water if it were held immediately in front of the pupil of the eye i have made several experiments with a view to obtaining serviceable spectacles for seeing under water the result is as followsexperience has shown the distance from the eyeball at which spectacleglasses can be most conveniently placed now at that distance the joint effect of the concave waterlens and the convex glass spectaclelens is to produce an operaglass of exceedingly low magnifying power that requires a small adjustment for accurate definition at different distances  if the spectaclelens be of flintglass and doubly convex each of its faces should have a curvature of not greater than 6 12 tenths of an inch nor more than 8 12 tenths of an inch in radius within these limits it is practicable to obtain perfectly distinct vision under water by pressing the spectacles forwards or backwards to a moderate degree lenses of these high magnifying powers are sometimes sold by spectaclemakers for persons who have undergone an operation for cataract i have tried but hitherto without much success to arrange the fittings by which the lenses are secured so that by a movement of the jaw or by an elevation of the eyebrows i could give the necessary adjustment of the glasses leaving my hands free for the purpose of swimming see also under fishing to see things deep under water    rafts and boats   raftsrafts of woodrafts are made of logs of wood held together by pairs of crossbars one of each pair lying above the raft and the other below then the whole may be made quite firm by a little judicious notching wherethe logs cross and a few pegs and lashings briers woodbines etc will do for these if the logs are large they should be separately launched into the river and towed into their proper places outriggers vastly increase the stability of a raft the

floating power of various woodsthe floating power of a raft depends on the buoyancy of the wood of which it is made i give in a table p 90 a list of the specific gravities of a few wellknown woods and

of raft x specific floating power weight of wood required to support a given burden  burden x spec gr1spec gr the last column gives the latter factor  hence to find the actual floating power of a raft it is simply necessary to multiply its weight into the specific floating power of the wood of which it is made  thus a raft of 12 logs of larch averaging 30 lbs each weighs 360 lbs this multiplied by 47 is equal to 169 lbs very nearly which is the weight the raft will support without sinking poplar is the lightest on the list                 specific          specific      factors to be multiplied

raftsmr andersson in exploring the tioughe river in south africa met with two very simple forms of rafts the one was a vast quantity of reeds cut down heaped into a stack of from 30 to 50 feet in diameter pushed out into the water and allowed to float down stream each day as the reeds became waterlogged more were cut and thrown on the stack its great bulk made it sure of passing over shallow places and when it struck against snags the force of the water soon slewed it round and started it afresh on an affair of this description mr andersson with seven attendants and two canoes hauled up upon it descended the river for five days the second reed raft was a small and neat one and used for ferries it was a mattress of reeds 5 feet long 3 broad and some 8 inches thick tied together with strips of the reeds themselves to each of its four corners was fixed a post made of an upright faggot of reeds 18 inches high other faggots connected the tops of the posts horizontally in the place of rails this was all it held one or two men and nothing but reeds or rushes were used in its construction  rafts of distended hidesa single oxhide may be made into a float capable of sustaining about 300 lbs the skin is to be cut to the largest possible circle then gathered together round a short tube to the inner end of which a valve like that of a common pair of bellows has been applied it is inflated with bellows and as the air escapes by degrees it may be refilled every ten or twelve hours handbook for field service  we read of the skins of animals stuffed with hay to keep them distended having been used by alexander the great and by others  goatskin rafts are extensively used on the tigris and elsewhere these are inflated through one of the legs they are generally lashed to a framework of wood branches and reeds in such a way that the leg is accessible to a person sitting on the raft when the air has in part escaped he creeps round to the skins one after the other untying and reinflating them in succession  sketch fig 1 and fig 2 showing gourd rafts  african gourd raftover a large part of bornu especially on its komaduguthe socalled river yeou of central africano boat is used except the following ingenious contrivance it is called a makara or boat pareminence  two large open gourds are nicely balanced and fixed bottom downwards on a bar or yoke of light wood 4 feet long 4 12 inches wide and 34 or 1 inch thick the fisherman or traveller packs his gear into the gourds launches the makara into the river and seats himself astride the bar he then paddles off with help of his hands fig 1 when he leaves the river he carries the makara on his back fig 2 the late dr barth wrote to me a person accustomed to such sort of voyage sits very comfortably a stranger holds on to one of the calabashes there is no fear of capsizing as the calabashes go under water according to the weight put upon them from ten to sixteen inches the yoke is firmly fastened to the two calabashes for it is never taken off i am scarcely able at present to say how it is fastened as far as i remember it is fixed by a very firm lashing which forms a sort of network over the calabash and at the same time serves to strengthen the latter and guard it against an accident it is obvious that the gourds might be replaced by inflated bags or baskets covered with leather or by copper or tin vessels or by any other equivalent i quite agree with dr barth that a makara would be particularly suitable for a traveller in bornu they make large rafts by putting a frame over several of these makara placed side by side  sketch of sailing boat  rude boatsbrazilian sailingboata simpler sailingboat or raft could hardly be imagined than that shown in the figure it is used by fishermen in

and fig 2 sketch of boat and pattern  canoe of three planksa swift safe and graceful little boat with a sharp stem and stern and with a bottom that curves upwards at both ends can be made out of three planks the sketch fig 1 is a foreshortened view of the boat and the diagram fig 2 shows the shape of the planks from which it is made the thwart or seat shown in fig 1 is important in giving the proper inclination to the sides of the boat for without it they would tend to collapse and the bottom would be less curved at either end if the reader will take the trouble to trace fig 2 on a stout card to cut it out in a single piece cutting only half through the cardboard where the planks touch and to fasten it into shape with pieces of gummed paper he will understand the architecture of the boat more easily than from any description if he wishes to build a boat he had best proceed to make as large a model in pasteboard as his materials admit and to cut the planks to scale according to the pattern of his model the grace of the boat depends on the cut of its planks just as much as the elegance of a dress does on that of its cloth these threeplank canoes are in frequent use in norway bark may be used instead of planks if the canoe be built of five planks instead of three a second narrow sideplank being added above each gunwale the section of the canoe is decidedly improved  inflatable indiarubber boats are an invention that has proved invaluable to travellers they have been used in all quarters of the globe and are found to stand every climate a fullsized one weighs only 40 lbs they have done especial service in arctic exploration the waters of the great salt lake in the mormon country were first explored and navigated with one by fremont they were also employed by dr livingstone on the rivers of south africa they stand a wonderful amount of wear and tear but as boats they are inferior to native canoes as they are very slow in the water it is indeed impossible to paddle them against a moderate headwind for the general purposes of travellers i should be inclined to recommend as small a macintoshboat as can be constructed just sufficient for one or at the most for two persons such as the cloaks that are made inflatable and convertible into boats a traveller wants a portable boat chiefly as means to cross over to a village for help or to carry his valuables across a river while the heavy things are risked at a ford or for shooting fishing or surveying now a very small boat weighing about ten pounds would do as well for all these purposes as a large one and would be far more portable  it is perfectly easy to get into a macintoshboat after having been capsized out of it into deep water  basketboat with canvas sidesfitzroy gives an account of a party of his sailors whose boat had been stolen while they were encamped putting out to sea in a large basket woven with such boughs as were at hand and covered with their canvas tentthe inside of which they had puddled with clay to keep the water from oozing through too fast they were eighteen hours afloat in this crazy craft i mention this instance to show how almost anything will make a boat canvas saturated with grease or oil is waterproof and painted canvas is at first an excellent covering for a boat but it soon becomes rotten  canoe of reeds or vegetable fibrea canoe may be made of reeds rushes or the light inner bark of trees either of these materials is bound into three long faggots pointed at one end these are placed side by side and lashed together and the result is a serviceable vessel of the appearance fig 1 and section as fig 2 the lake titicaca which lies far above the limit of trees is navigated by boats made of rushes and carrying sails woven of rushes also little boats are sometimes made of twigs and are then plastered both inside and outside with clay but they are very leaky  fig 1 and fig 2sketches of reed canoe  hide traythis is a good contrivance and if the hide be smoked see hides after it is set it is vastly improved in its simplest form peruvian travellers describe it as a dish or tray consisting of a dry hide pinched up at the four corners and each corner secured with a thorn the preferable plan is to make eyeletholes round its rim and pass a thong through drawing it pretty close the tray is kept in shape by sticks put inside and athwart its bottom  coracle and skin puntif a traveller has one hide only at his disposal he should make a coracle if he has two a punt this last is a really useful boat one in which very great distances of river may be descended with safety and much luggage taken hide boats are very light since the weight of a bullocks skin only averages 45 lbs but unless well greased they soon rot when taken out of the water they should be laid bottom upwards to dry to make a proper and substantial coracle a dozen or more oxier or other wands must be cut these are to be bent and have both ends stuck in the ground in such a way as to form the framework of the required boat bottom upwards much like half a walnutshell in shape but flatter where these wands cross they should be lashed and sticks should be wattled in to fill up gaps a raw hide is then thrown over the framework sewn in place and left to dry finally the projecting ends of the osiers have to be cut off should this boat by any chance prove a failure the hide is not wasted but can be removed soaked till soft and used again  a skin punt requires two bullocks or other hides and also about ten small willowtrees or other tough flexible wood 14 feet long captain palliser says that a couple of days is sufficient for two people to complete an entire punt of this description he has been so good as to furnish me with the following minute description of the way of making this very useful boat  1 the keel stem and stern might be in one but because the stem and stern ought to be strong this whole line is made of two small trees lashed together with the thick ends outwards as in fig 1 where ab is a lithe clean little willowtree and ab another similar one they are lashed together at their taper ends  2 cut notches halfway through kk at about 20 to 25 inches from each end then turn up the notched portions and you have stem keel and stern all in one piece as in fig 2  fig 1 and fig 2 sketches  3 stake out the ground according to the size your boat will cover by driving eight strong pointed stakes of wood into the ground to these lash four cross willowtree sticks notched in two places so that each of these four willows shall form two knees as well as run across the bottom of the boat  4 bent two more main willows for gunwales for the boat and two more for bottom rails each separate stick as will be perceived by fig 3 is lashed in five different places and the keep in eight places  fig 3 and fig 4sketches as described  the main framework being now completed loosen it from the stakes driven into the ground  5 fasten a large number of little slender willowtwigs between each of the main crossknees as shown by the thin lines in fig 3 it is then fit for covering lift it up like a basket and turn it topsyturvy  6 kill two bulls skin them and in skinning be careful to make your cuts in the skin down the rump to the hock of the animal and down the brisket in front of the foreleg to the knee so as to have your skins as square as possible fig 4 cut off the heads and sew the skins together at the nape of the necks and while reeking cover the wickerwork turning them over it the hairy side inwards and fasten it all round by means of skincords cut holes with a knife round the edges to pass the cords through as you lash up to the toprails of the boat  7 leave it 24 hours in the sun cover the seam where the skins are sewn together with melted fat and the boat is fit for use  bark boatsfrom a pine or other tree take off with care the longest possible entire portion of the bark while fresh and flexible spread it flat as a long rectangular sheet then turn it carefully up at the sides the smooth side outwards sew the ends together and caulk them well a few crosssticks for thwarts complete this contrivance which is made by an american indian in a few hours and in which the rapid waters of the mackenzie are navigated for hundreds of miles ways of strengthening the structure will readily suggest themselves the native material for sewing is the fibrous root of the pine handbook for field service lieutcol lefroy  figs i ii iii and ivsketches as described  birchbark canoesbirch bark as is well known is used for building canoes in north america and the bark of many other trees would do for covering the framework of a boat in default of leather but it is useless to give a detailed account of birch canoes as great skill and neat execution are required both in making and in using them  boats of sheettin covered with pitched canvasthese might be made at any of the outposts of civilization i am indebted to a correspondent whose name i regret exceedingly to be unable to insert having unfortunately mislaid it for the following full description of his shootingpunt it will be obvious that his methods are applicable not only to their professed object but also to tin boats of any shape whatever  form the bottom fig i as followsselect the thickest sheets of tin and solder them together by their narrowest sides until as many lengths are made as when laid side by side will be sufficient for the whole length and breadth of the figure the soldering should be by a joint of this kind  sketch of join  these lengths must then be soldered side by side by a similar joint and the whole sheet thus made trimmed to the shape of fig i care being taken that no two joints in the lengths should be exactly opposite each other form two other sheets in a similar manner for the two sides and of the shape of fig ii the dotted lines a b c d e f fig i show the portions of the tin round the edges 1 inch wide which must be turned up at right angles with the bottom and to which the sides are to be soldered on the inside they should have triangular pieces clipped out of them as shown in the fig where the bends of the boat begin to make them take the curve required the two extra pieces at the ends a d e f 2 inches wide are for turning down over an iron rod which is to pass round the gunwale to give stiffness to the boat g h fig ii is a breadth of 2 inches of extra tin for the same purpose of turning down over the iron rod  each side is now to be soldered to the bottom piece beginning with the centre and working in to each end  the soldering of the turnedup edges to the bottom on the outside may then be done separate slips of tin 2 inches wide should then be bent up longitudinally in halves like angleiron and fitted along the joining of the bottom and sides on the inside and soldered these slips may also be clipped on either side when necessary to make them take the curves  the measure round the gunwale may now be taken within the edge of the tin and an iron rod 38 of an inch thick to go round this gunwale bent to the form of the outline of fig iii i b k c which will now be that of the boat and the ends welded at their meeting sufficient iron rod must be taken to form eyes at i and k to receive rings of 3 or 4 inches diameter through which a pole is to be passed for carrying the boat and for their welding at the meeting of the ends  the ironrod gunwale may now be put in and the 2 inches width of tin allowed in excess on the sides and ends of the bottom turned down closely over the rod all round and soldered on the inside the side elevation of the boat will now be as w x y fig iv the boat should be proved as to being watertight by filling it with water any leak being stopped by more solder  the outside must now be covered with pitched canvas thus  turn it upside down in a sheltered spot exposed to the sun or warm it by other means and have a caldron of boiling pitch on a fire at hand also have sufficient canvas sewn together in breadths as will quite cover the boat bottom and sides then beginning across the middle of the bottom brush on a layer 3 or 4 inches wide of the boiling pitch and quickly press down the corresponding central portion of the canvas upon it work on thus from the centre of the bottom to the ends laying on a breadth of pitch and then pressing down and stretching a portion of canvas over it then turn down the canvas over each side and pitch in the same way butting out the parts of the canvas that would overlap too much at the bends but leaving no tin uncovered the boat may then be righted the excess of canvas cut off and the edge laid down with pitch a little short of the gunwale  the bottom may then be pitched over the canvas for 6 inches up and the rest of the outside with the inside be painted with two or three coats  a flooring of thin planking for 3 12 feet of the central portion of the boat must now be made as followsmake five planks between 8 and 9 inches wide to fit across the beam of the boat and in each of the outer planks o o p p fig iii fix uprights m n 6 inches high to support a seat mortised on the pair of uprights in each board the ends of each seat should be short of the breadth of the boat by an inch or so so as not to bear against the sides then lay down two ribs of tough wood fitted to bear equally across the planking on each side as rs r1 s1 and screw each end of them down to the outer planks only  wooden cleats can be fixed on each board at t t each to receive the butts of two guns while their barrels lie in hollows formed in the cushions of the seat opposite them so that the rower can put down his paddles and take up his gun instantly steps for a mast can be also contrived at the same points the woodwork is to be also well painted it can be taken out with ease as it is nowhere connected with the tin of the boat care should be taken that no projections in this woodwork such as screwheads etc should chafe the tin and that it should be always kept well painted  the boat of which this is a description drew 2 12 inches water with one person in with two guns and ammunition etc it was furnished with two short paddles which were tied by a short length of string to the sides so as to be dropped without loss of time on taking up the gun to fire the boat turned with the greatest ease by one backing and pulling stroke of the two paddles and was very stiff in the water  iron rowlocks were fitted to it on the outside at b e fig i i do not give the diagram by which the author illustrated his description the rowlocks were applied to the sides of the boat and each rowlock was secured to the side by three bolts the two upper bolts had clawheads to seize the ironrod gunwale on the inside and a piece of wood was fitted on the inside through which the three bolts passed to give substance for their hold their nuts were on the outside with these rowlocks two oars of 7 feet long were used the breadth between the horns should be only just enough to admit the oars  this boat could be carried on the shoulders of two persons when suspended on a pole passed through the end rings for a distance of twelve or fifteen miles daily with guns and ammunition stowed in it it could be fired from standing without risk and be poled over marshy ground barely covered with water or dragged with ease by the person seated in it through high reeds by grasping a handful on each side and hauling on them a rudder was unnecessary it was in use for more than three years and with due care in getting in and out on a rough shore and by keeping it well painted and pitched it never leaked or became impaired in any way  boatsof woodenglishmade boats have been carried by explorers for great distances on wheels but seldom seem to have done much useful service they would travel easiest if slung and made fast in a strong wooden crate or framework to be fixed on the body of the carriage a white covering is necessary for a wooden boat on account of the sun both boat and covering should be frequently examined mr richardson and his party took a boat divided in four quarters on camelback across the sahara all the way from the mediterranean to lake tchad a portable framework of metal tubes to be covered with indiarubber sheeting on arrival was suggested to me by a very competent authority the late mr mgregor laird  copper boats have been much recommended because an accidental dent however severe it may be can be beaten back again without doing injury to the metal one of the boats in mr lynchs expedition down the jordan was made of copper  corrugated iron makes excellent boats for travellers they are stamped by machinery burton took one of them to zanzibar they were widely advertised some ten years ago but they never came into general use and i do not know where they can now be procured  canoesthe earlier exploits of the rob roy canoe justly attracted much attention and numerous canoe voyages have subsequently been made the canoe club is now a considerable institution many of whose members make yearly improvements in the designs of their crafts although canoes are delicately built and apparently fragile experience has amply proved that they can stand an extraordinary amount of hard usage in the hands of careful travellers as a general rule it is by no means the heaviest and most solid things that endure the best if a lightlymade apparatus can be secured from the risk of heavy things falling upon it it will outlast a heavy apparatus that shakes to pieces under the jar of its own weight  a hole cut in the square sail enables the voyager to see ahead  to carry on horsebackmr macgregor when in syria took two strong poles each 16 feet long and about 3 inches thick at the larger end these were placed on the ground 2 feet apart and across them at 3 feet from each end he lashed two stout staves about 4 feet long then a leading horse was selected that is one used to lead caravans and on his back a large bag of straw was well girthed and flattened down the frame was firmly tied on this and the canoe wrapped in carpets was placed on the frame this simple method was used for three months over sand and snow rock and jungle mud and marshanywhere indeed that a horse could go the frame was elevated in front so as to allow the horses head some room under the boats keel two girthstraps kept the canoe firmly in position above and carpets were used as cushions under its bilge a boy led the horse and a strong man was told off to hold fast to the canoe in every difficulty it will be seen that in the event of a fall the corners of the framework would receive the shock not the canoe  boating gearanchors may be made of wood weighted with stones fig 1 shows the anchor used by brazilian fishermen with their rude boat or sailingraft already described fig 2 shows another sort of anchor that is in common use in norway  mastwhere there is difficulty in stepping a mast use a bar across the thwarts and two poles one lashed at either end of it and coming together to a point above this triangle takes the place of shrouds fore and aft it is a very convenient rig for a boat with an outrigger the sooloo pirates use it  fig 2sketch of anchor  outrigger ironsmr gilby informs me that he has travelled with a pair of light sculls and outrigger irons which he was able to adapt to many kinds of rude boats he found them of much service in egypt  keels are troublesome to make leeboards are effective substitutes and are easily added to a rude boat or punt when it is desired to rig her as a sailingcraft   ruddera rude oar makes the most powerful though not the most convenient rudder in the lakes of north italy where the winds are steady the heavy boats have a bar upon which the tiller of the rudder rests this bar is full of small notches and the bottom of the tiller at the place where it rests on the bar is furnished with a blunt knifeedge the tiller is not stiffly joined to the rudder but admits of a little play up and down when the boatman finds that the boat steers steadily he simply drops the tiller which forthwith falls into the notch below it where it is held tight until the steersman cares to take the tiller into his hand again  buoysan excellent buoy to mark out a passage is simply a small pole anchored by a rope at the end it is very readily seen and exposes so little surface to the wind and water that it is not easily washed away a pole of the thickness of a walkingstick is much used in sweden such a buoy costs only a rope a stick and a stone a tuft of the smallbranches may be left on the top of the pole  logfor a log use a conical canvas bag thus  sketch of bag in two positions  when the peg is drawn out by the usual jerk the bag no longer presents its mouth to the water but is easily drawn in by the line attached to its point  boat buildingcaulkingalmost anything that is fibrous does for caulking the seams of a boat the inner bark of trees is one of the readiest materials  securing planksin default of nails it is possible to drill or to burn holes in the planks and to sew them together with strips of hide woodbine or string made from the inner bark of fibrous trees holes may be drilled on precisely the same principle as that which i have described in making fire by friction  lengthening boatsif you have an ordinary boat and wish to make it of greater burden saw it in half and lengthen it comparatively coarse carpentering is good enough for this purpose  boat managementhauling boats on shoreto haul up a boat on a barren shore with but a few hands lay out the anchor ahead of her to make fast your purchase to or back the body of a wagon underneath the boat as she floats and so draw her out upon wheels a makeshift framework on small solid wheels has been used and recommended  towinga good way of fastening a towrope to a boat that has no mast is shown in the diagram which however is very coarsely drawn a curved pole is lashed alongside one of the knees of the boat and the towrope passing with a turn or two round its end is carried on to the stern of the boat by taking a few turns more or less with the rope round the stick the line of action of the towrope on the boats axis may be properly adjusted when all is right the boat ought to steer herself  sketch of boat being towed  when caught by a gale recollect that a boat will lieto and live through almost any weather if you can make a bundle of a few spare spars oars etc and secure them to the boats head so as to float in front of and across the bow they will act very sensibly as a breakwater and will always keep the boats head towards the wind kroomen rig out three oars in a triangle lash the boats sail to it throw overboard after making fast and pay out as much line as they can muster by making a canvas halfdeck to an open boat you much increase its safety in broken water and if it be made to lace down the centre it can be rolled up on the gunwale and be out of the way in fine weather  in floating down a stream when the wind blows right against you and on rivers the wind nearly always blows right up or right down a plan generally employed is to cut large branches to make them fast to the front of the boat weight them that they may sink low in the water and throw them overboard the force of the stream acting on these branches will more than counterbalance that of the wind upon the boat for want of branches a kind of watersail is sometimes made of canvas  steering in the darkin dark nights when on a river running through pine forests the mid stream canbe kept by occasionally striking the water sharply with the blade of the oar and listening to the echoes they should reach the ear simultaneously or nearly so from either bank on the same principle vessels have been steered out of danger when caught by a dense fog close to a rocky coast  awningthe best is a wagonroof awning made simply of a couple of parallel poles into which the ends of the bent ribs of the roof are set without any other crosspieces this roof should be of two feet larger span than the width of the boat and should rest upon prolongations of the thwarts or else upon crooked knees of wood one arm of each of the knees is upright and is made fast to the inside of the boat while the other is horizontal and projects outside it it is on these horizontal and projecting arms that the roof rests and to which it is lashed such an awning is airy roomy and does not interfere with rowing if the rowlocks are fixed to the poles it also makes an excellent cabin for sleeping in at night  sail tenta boats sail is turned into a tent by erecting a gableshaped framework the mast or other spar being the ridgepole and a pair of crossed oars lashed together supporting it at either end and the whole is made stable by a couple of ropes and pegs then the sail is thrown across the ridgepole not over the crossed loops of the oars for they would fret it and is pegged out below the natural fall of the canvas bends to close the two ends as with curtains  sketch of tent  treesnakeswhere these abound travellers on rivers with overhanging branches should beware of keeping too near inshore lest the rigging of the boat should brush down the snakes    fords and bridges   fordsin fording a swift stream carry heavy stones in your hand for you require weight to resist the force of the current indeed the deeper you wade the more weight you require though you have so much the less at command on account of the water buoying you up  rivers cannot be forded if their depth exceeds 3 feet for men or 4 feet for horses fords are easily discovered by typing a soundingpole to the stern of a boat rowing down the middle of the stream and searching those places where the pole touches the bottom when no boat is to be had fords should be tried for where the river is broad rather than where it is narrow and especially at those places where there are bends in its course in these the line of shallow water does not run straight across but follows the direction of a line connecting a promontory on one side to the nearest promontory on the other as in the drawing that is to say from a to b or from b to c and not right across from b to b from a to a or from c to c along hollow curves asa b c the stream runs deep and usually beneath overhanging banks whilst in front of promontories as at a b and c the water is invariably shoal unless it be a jutting rock that makes the promontory therefore by entering the stream at one promontory with the intention of leaving it at another you ensure that at all events the beginning and end of your course shall be in shallow water which you cannot do by attempting any other line of passage  sketch of river as described  to cross boggy and uncertain groundswampswhen you wish to take a wagon across a deep miry and reedy swamp outspan and leg the cattle feed then cut faggots of reeds and strew them thickly over the line of intended passage when plenty are laid down drive the cattle backwards and forwards and they will trample them in repeat the process two or three times till the causeway is firm enough to bear the weight of the wagon or in default of reeds cut long poles and several short crossbars say of two fee long join these as best you can so as to make a couple of laddershaped frames place these across the mud one under the intended track of each wheel faggots strewn between each round of the ladder will make the causeway more sound a succession of logs laid crosswise with faggots between them will also do but not so well  passing from hand to handwhen many things have to be conveyed across a piece of abominably bad roadas over sanddunes heavy shingle mud of two feet deep a morass a jagged mountain tract or over steppingstones in the bed of a rushing torrentit is a great waste of labour to make laden men travel to and fro with loads on their backs it is a severe exertion to walk at all under these circumstances letting along the labour of also carrying a burden the men should be stationed in a line each at a distance of six or seven feet from his neighbour and should pass the things from hand to hand as they stand  plank roadsmiry boggy lines of road along which people had been seen for months crawling like flies across a plate of treacle are suddenly and i may almost say magically converted into a road as hard and good as regent street by the following simple process which is usually adopted as soon as the feeble funds of the young colony can purchase the blessing a small gang of men with spades and rammers quickly level one end of the earth road as fast as they proceed four or five rows of strong beams or sleepers which have been brought in the light wagons of the country are laid down longitudinally four or five feet asunder and no sooner are they in position than from other wagons stout planks touching each other are transversely laid upon them from a third series of wagons a thin layer of sand or grit is thrown upon the planks which instantly assume the appearance of a more level mcadam road than in practice can ever be obtained upon this newborn road the wagons carrying the sleepers planks and sand convey with perfect ease these three descriptions of materials for its continuance the work advances literally about as fast as an old gouty gentleman can walk and as soon as it is completed there can scarcely exist a more striking contrast than between the two tenses of what it was and what it is this plank road as it is termed in america usually lasts from eight to twelve years and as it is found quite unnecessary to spike the planks to the sleepers the arrangement admits of easy repair which however is but seldom required sir francis head in times jan 25  snowsir r dalyell tells me that it is the practice of muleteers in the neighbourhood of erzeroum when their animals lose their way and flounder in the deep snow to spread a horsecloth or other thick rug from off their packs upon the snow in front of them the animals step upon it and extricate themselves easily i have practised walking across deep snowdrifts on this principle with perfect success  weak icewater that is slightly frozen is made to bear a heavy wagon by cutting reeds strewing them thickly on the ice and pouring water upon them when the whole is frozen into a firm mass the process must be repeated  bridgesflying bridges are well known a long cord or chain of poles is made fast to a rock or an anchor in the middle of a river the other end is attached to the ferryboat which being so slewed as to receive the force of the current obliquely traverses the river from side to side  bridges of felled treesif you are at the side of a narrow but deep and rapid river on the banks of which trees grow long enough to reach across one or more may be felled confining the trunk to its own bank and letting the current force the head round to the opposite side but if the river be too wide to be spanned by one treeand if two or three men can in any manner be got acrosslet a large tree be felled into the water on each side and placed close to the banks opposite to each other with their heads lying upstreamwards fasten a rope to the head of each tree confine the trunks shove the head off to receive the force of the current and ease off the ropes so that the branches may meet in the middle of the river at an angle pointing upwards the branches of the trees will be jammed together by the force of the current and so be sufficiently united as to form a tolerable communication especially when a few of the upper branches have been cleared away if insufficient towards the middle of the river to bear the weight of men crossing a few stakes with the forks left near their heads may be thrust down through the branches of the trees to support them sir h douglas    clothing   general remarksthere are such infinite varieties of dress that i shall only attempt a few general remarks and give a single costume that a traveller of great experience had used to his complete satisfaction the military authorities of different nations have long made it their study to combine in the best manner the requirements of handsome effect of cheapness and of serviceability in all climates but i fear their results will not greatly help the traveller who looks more to serviceability than to anything else of late years even garibaldi with his redshirted volunteers and alpine men with their simple outfit have approached more nearly to a travellers ideal  materials for clothesflannelthe importance of flannel next the skin can hardly be overrated it is now a matter of statistics for during the progress of expeditions notes have been made of the number of names of those in them who had provided themselves with flannel and of those who had not the list of sick and dead always included names from the latter list in a very great proportion  cotton is preferable to flannel for a sedentary life in hot damp countries or where flannel irritates the skin persons who are resident in the tropics and dress in civilised costume mostly wear cotton shirts  linen by universal consent is a dangerous dress wherever there is a chance of much perspiration for it strikes cold upon the skin when it is wet the terror of swiss guides of the old school at a coup dair on the mountain top and of italians at the chill of sundown is largely due to their wearing linen shirts those who are dressed in flannel are far less sensitive to these influences  leather is the only safeguard against the stronger kinds of thorns in pastoral and in hunting countries it is always easy to procure skins of a tough quality that have been neatly dressed by hand also it will be easy to find persons capable of sewing them together very neatly after you have cut them out to the pattern of your old clothes  bark cloth is used in several parts of the work it is simply a piece of some kind of peculiarly fibrous bark

musquito curtains will be glad to read it the r√©pertoire de chimie pure et appliquee publishes the following remarks by the celebrated chemists mm d¬¶bereiner and oesner on the various methods for rendering stuffs incombustible or at least less inflammable than they naturally are the substances employed for this purpose are borax alum soluble glass and phosphate of ammonia for wood and common stuffs any one of these salts will do but fine and light tissues which are just those most liable to catching fire cannot be treated in the same way borax renders fine textile fabrics stiff it causes dust and will swell out under the smoothingiron so does alum beside weakening the fibres of the stuff so as to make it tear easily soluble glass both stiffens and weakens the stuff depriving it both of elasticity and tenacity phosphate of ammonia alone has none of these inconveniences it may be mixed with a certain quantity of salammoniac and then introduced into the starch prepared for stiffening the linen or else it may be dissolved in 20 parts of water in weight to one of phosphate and the stuff steeped into the solution then allowed to dry and ironed as usual  phosphate of ammonia is cheap enough to allow of its introduction into common use so that it may be employed at each wash phosphate of ammonia is obtained by saturating the biphosphate of lime with liquid ammonia

a strong but not too thick tweed coat is the best for rough work in a very thorny country a leather coat is almost essential a blouse cut short so as to clear the saddle is neat cool and easy whether as a riding or walking costume generally speaking the traveller will chiefly spend his life in his shirtsleeves and will only use his coat when he wants extra warmth  to carry a coatthere are two ways the first is to fold it small and strap it to the belt if the coat be a light one it can be carried very neatly and comfortably in this way lying in the small of the back the second is the contrivance of a friend of mine an eminent scholar and divine who always employs it in his vacation rambles it is to pass an ordinary strap once round the middle of the coat and a second time round both the coat and the left arm just above the elbow and then to buckle it the coat hangs very comfortably in its place and does not hamper the movements of the left arm it requires no further care except that after a few minutes it will generally be found advisable to buckle the strap one hole tighter a coat carried in this way will be found to attract no attention from passers by  waistcoats are more convenient for their pockets than for their warmth when travelling in countries where papers have to be carried an inside pocket between the lining and the waistcoat with a button to close it is extremely useful letters of credit and paper money can be carried in it more safely than in any other pocket  trousersif you are likely to have much riding take extra leather or moleskin trousers or tweed covered down the inside of the legs with leather such as cavalry soldiers generally wear leather is a better protection than moleskin against thorns but not so serviceable against wet it will far outlast moleskin

the toes now the art consists in so drawing up these ends that the foot can be placed in the shoe or boot without any wrinkles appearing in the bandage one wrinkle is sure to make a blister and therefore persons who have to use them should practise frequently how to put them on socks similar to these but made of thick blanket and called blanket wrappers are in use at hudsons bay instead of shoes  shirtsleeveswhen you have occasion to tuck up your shirtsleeves recollect that the way of doing so is not to begin by turning the cuffs inside out but outside inthe sleeves must be rolled up

secured under my chin by rheimpys or strips of dressed skin a coarse linen shirt sometimes a kilt and sometimes a pair of buckskin kneebreeches and a pair of veltschoens or homemade shoes i entirely discarded coat waistcoat and neckcloth and i always hunted with my arms bare my heels were armed with a pair of powerful persuaders and from my left wrist depended by a double rheimpy thong an equally persuasive seacow jambok whip of solid leather around my waist i wore two leathern belts or girdles the smaller did the duty of suspender and from it on my left side depended a plaited rheimpy eight inches in length forming a loop in which dangled my powerful loadingrod formed of a solid piece of horn of the rhinoceros the larger girdle was my shootingbelt this was a broad leather belt on which were fastened four separate compartments made of otterskin with flaps to button over of the same material the first of these held my percussioncaps the second a large powderflask the third and fourth which had divisions in them contained balls and patches two sharp claspknives a compass flint and steel in this belt i also carried a loadingmallet formed from the horn of the rhinoceros this and the powderflask were each secured to the belt by long rheimpys to prevent my losing them last but not least in my right hand i usually carried my doublebarrelled twogrooved rifle which was my favourite weapon this however i subsequently made up my mind was not the tool for a mounted man especially when quick loading is required  wet clothes to dryfire for drying clothesto dry clothes it is a very convenient plan to make a domeshaped framework of twigs over a smouldering fire by bending each twig or wand into a halfcircle and planting both ends of it in the ground one on each side of the fire the wet clothes are laid on this framework and receive the full benefit of the heat their steam passes readily upwards  two sketches of drying frame  to keep clothes from the wetmr parkyns says i may as well tell also how we managed to keep our clothes dry when travelling in the rain this was rather an important consideration seeing that each mans wardrobe consisted of what he carried on his back our method was at once effective and simple if halting we took off our clothes and sat on them if riding they were placed under the leathern shabraque of the mules saddle or under any article of similar material bed or bag that lay on the camels pack a good showerbath did none of us any harm and as soon as the rain was over and the moisture on our skins had evaporated we had our garments as warm dry and comfortable as if they had been before a fire in populous districts we kept on our drawers or supplied their place with a piece of rag or a skin and then when the rain was over we wrapped ourselves up in our quarry and taking off the wetted articles hung them over the animals cruppers to dry another traveller writes  the only means we had of preserving our sole suit of clothes dry from the drenching showers of rain was by taking them off and stuffing them into the hollow of a tree which in the darkness of the night we could do with propriety  mr pallisers boatmen at chagre took each a small piece of cloth under which they laid their clothes every time that they stripped in expectation of a coming storm  dipping clothes wetted with rain in seawatercaptain bligh who was turned adrift in an open boat after the mutiny of the bounty writes thus about his experiencewith respect to the preservation of our health during a course of 16 days of heavy and almost continual rain i would recommend to every one in a similar situation the method we practised which is to dip their clothes in the salt water and wring them out as often as they become filled with rain it was the only resource we had and i believe was of the greatest service to us for it felt more like a change of dry clothes than could well be imagined we had occasion to do this so often that at length our clothes were wrung to pieces for except the few days we passed on the coast of new holland we were continually wet either with rain or sea  washing clothessubstitute for soapthe lye of ashes and the gall of animals are the readiest substitutes for soap the sailors recipe for washing clothes is well known but it is too dirty to describe bran and the meal of many seeds is good for scouring also some earths

rubbing andbeating in snow cleanses all clothing remarkably well particularly woollens when preparing for a regular days washing it is a good plan to boil an abundance of ashes in water strain off the

stone and knead and wring them with the hands  lye of ashesin choosing plants to burn for ashes whence the lye is to be made by pouring hot water on them it must be recollected that all plants are not equally efficacious those that contain the most alkali either potash or soda are the best on this account the stalks of succulent plants as reeds maize broom heath and furze are very much better than the wood of any trees and twigs are better than timber pine and firtrees are the worst of woods the ashes of most kinds of seaweed yield abundance of alkali potash is the alkali that is obtained from

the water boils away or is sucked up by the fat after one or two trials the knack of soapmaking is easily caught the presence of salt makes the soap hard its absence soft now many ashes contain a good

oneselfwarmth of dirtthere is no denying the fact though it be not agreeable to confess it that dirt and grease are great protectors of the skin against inclement weather and that therefore the leader of a party should not be too exacting about the appearance of his less warmlyclad followers daily washing if not followed by oiling must be compensated by wearing clothes take the instance of a dog he will sleep out under any bush and thrive there so long as he is not washed groomed and kept clean but if he be he must have a kennel to lie in the same is the case with a horse he catches cold if he is groomed in the day and turned out at nights but he never catches cold when left wholly to himself a savage will never wash unless he can grease himself afterwardsgrease takes the place of clothing

washingthe most convenient time for a traveller to make his toilet in rough travel is after the early mornings ride a bath being now and then taken in the afternoon it is trying work to wash in

whether for clothes boots or hair and the accompanying section of one will explain itself bristles are usually employed but fibres of various kinds may be used  sketch of brush    bedding   general remarksthe most bulky and often the heaviest parts of a travellers equipment are his clothes sleepingmat and blankets nor is it at all desirable that these should be stinted in quantity for the hardship that most tries a mans constitution and lays the seeds of rheumatism dysentery and fever is that of enduring the bitter cold of a stormy night which may happen to follow an exhausting day of extreme heat or drenching wet after many months travel and camping the constitution becomes far less susceptible of injury from cold and damp but in no case is it ever proof against their influence indeed the oldest travellers are ever those who go the most systematically to work in making their sleepingplaces dry and warm unless a traveller makes himself at home and comfortable in the bush he will never be quite contented with his lot but will fall into the bad habit of looking forwards to the end of his journey and to his return to civilisation instead of complacently interesting himself in its continuance this is a frame of mind in which few great journeys have been successfully accomplished and an explorer who cannot divest himself of it may suspect that he has mistaken his vocation  it is a common idea among men who are preparing to travel for the first time that all the bedclothing about which they need concern themselves is a sufficiency to cover them forgetting that a man has an under as well as an upper side to keep warm and must therefore have clothing between him and the earth as well as between him and the air indeed on trying the experiment and rolling oneself up in a single blanket the undermost side in a cold night is found to be by far the colder of the two the substance of the blanket is compressed by the weight of the sleeper the interstices between its fibres cease to exist and the air which they contained and which is a powerful nonconductor of heat is squeezed out consequently wherever the blanket is compressed its power of retaining the heat of the sleeper is diminished soft fleecy substances like eiderdown quilts which are extremely warm as coverlets are wellnigh useless as mattresses there is another cause why a sleeper requires more protection from below than from above it is that if the ground be at all wet its damp will penetrate through very thick substances laid upon it it will therefore be clearly understood that the object of a mattress is not alone to give softness to the bed but also to give warmth and that if a man lies in a hammock with only the hammock below and blankets above he will be fully as much chilled as if the arrangement had been reversed and he had lain upon blankets with only the hammock as a sheet to cover him  vital heatthe vital heat of a man either in an active or a latent form is equal to that which is given out by two ordinary candles i judge so from the following reasons all our vital heat is produced by the combustionfor it is simple combustionof the carbon in our food now the quantity of carbon consumed by a man in full diet in 24 hours is about 22 oz in weight on the other hand i find that ordinary candles which mainly consist of carbon burn at the rate of 11 oz in 24 hours therefore the heat given out by two candles is just about the same as that given out by one man either in a sensible form or else under a latent form by the vapour of the breath secondly i have frequently heard it estimated as the result of the ordinary experience of social life that a saloon is warmed by each couple of candles somewhat more than it is by the presence of a single guest where i write these lines i have not an opportunity of verifying my rough estimate by reference to physiological works but accuracy is of little consequence to my present purpose which is to give a general idea of the magnitude of the problem to be solved by clothes and tenting their joint office is to retain the heat of a mass of flesh and blood the size and shape of a man warmed by two candles burning within it at a temperature of not less than 96 degrees in its inward parts  mattresses and their substitutesa strip of macintoshif a traveller can do so he should make a point of having a strip of macintosh sheeting 7 feet by 4 certainly not less than 6 feet by 3 to lay on the ground below his bedding every white servant in the expedition ought to be furnished with a strip of macintosh sheeting or failing that with a strip of painted canvas however painted cloth is much inferior to macintosh as it will not fold up without cracking it also tears easily and is heavy macintosh of the sort that suits all climates and made of linen not of silk is invaluable to an explorer whether in the form of sheeting coats waterbags swimming belts or inflatable boats a little box full of the composition for mending it and a spare bit of macintosh should always be taken  mattressmaking a mattress is indeed a very simple affair a bag of canvas or other cloth is made of the size wanted it is then stuffed full of hair wool dry leaves or cotton and a strong stitch is put through it every few inches the use of the stitching is to prevent the stuffing from being displaced and forming lumps in different parts of the bag  palliassestraw well knitted or plaited together forms a good mattress commonly called a palliasse  shavings of woodeight pounds weight of shavings make an excellent bed and i find i can cut them with a common spokeshave in 3 12 hours out of a log of deal it is practicable to make an efficient spokeshave by tying a large claspknife on a common stick which has been cut into a proper shape to receive it  oakumold cord picked into oakum will also make a bed  various makeshiftsif a traveller as is very commonly the case should have no mattress he should strew his sleepingplace with dry grass plucked up from the ground or with other things warm to the touch imitating the structure of a birdsnest as far as he has skill and materials to do so leaves fern feathers heather rushes flags of reeds and of maize woodshavings bundles of faggots and such like materials as chance may afford should be looked for and appropriated a pile of stones or even two trunks of trees rolled close together may make a dry bedstead in a marshy land over these let him lay whatever empty bags skins saddlecloths or spare clothes he may have which from their shape or smallness cannot be turned to account as coverings and the lower part of his bed is complete  if a night of unusual cold be expected the best use to make of spare wearingapparel is to put it on over that which is already on the person with two or three shirts stockings and trousers though severally of thin materials a man may get through a night of very trying weather  preparing the ground for a bedtravellers should always root up the stones and sticks that might interfere with the smoothness of the place where they intend to sleep this is a matter worth taking a great deal of pains about the oldest campaigners are the most particular in making themselves comfortable at night they should also scrape a hollow in the ground of the shape shown in fig 2 next page before spreading their sleepingrugs it is disagreeable enough to lie on a perfectly level surface like that of a floor but the acme of discomfort is to lie upon a convexity persons who have omitted to make a shapely lair for themselves should at least scrape a hollow in the ground just where the hipbone would otherwise press  sketch of person sleeping and bed fig 1 and 2  the annexed sketch fig 1 represents a man

on furniture  coverletsgeneral remarksfor an upper cover it is of importance to an otherwise unsheltered person that its texture should be such as to prevent the wind blowing through if it does so no thickness is of any avail in keeping out the cold hence the advantage of skin carosses buffalo robes leather sheets and macintosh rugs all clothes lose much of their closeness of texture in a hot dry climate the fibres shrink extremely and the wind blows through the tissue as through network it is in order to make their coverings windproof that shepherdlads on the hills in scotland when the nights are cold dip their plaids in water before sitting or lying down in them the wet swells up the fibres of the plaid and makes the texture of it perfectly dense and close it is also of importance that the outer covering should have a certain weight so as not to be too easily displaced either by the person fidgeting in his sleep or by the blowing of the wind in dry weather there is nothing like furs but in a rainy country i prefer a thick blanket bag see sleeping bags a large spare blanket and a macintosh sheet and counterpane it may be objected that the bag and macintosh would be close and stuffy but be assured that the difficulty when sleeping on mother earth on a bitter night is to keep the fresh air out not to let it in on fine nights i should sleep on the bag and under the spare blanket  stuffy beddingit must be understood that while recommending coverlets that resist the wind i am very far from advocating extreme stuffiness and for the following reason though a free passage of the wind abstracts an excessive amount of animal heat from the sleeper yet the freshness of pure air stimulates his body to give it out in an increased proportion on the other hand sleepingclothes that are absolutely impervious to the passage of the wind necessarily retain the cutaneous excretions these poison the sleeper acting upon his blood through his skin and materially weaken his power of emitting vital heat the fire of his life burns more languidly i therefore suspect it would be more dangerous to pass a very cold night enclosed tightly in thin macintosh buttoned up to the chin than without it much less heat would be robbed from the sleeper in the first case but he would have very much less heat to spare there is therefore an intermediate arrangement of sleepinggear neither too stuffy on the one hand nor too open on the other by which the maximum power of resisting the chill of the night is obtainable  sleeping clothessome travellers prefer to have their blanket at once made up into a loose coat trousers and cap pockets ad libitum and a tape in the trouser band an extra suit is thus always at hand the sleeper loses little of the advantages of comfortable bedding and is always in some sense dressed for any emergency  featherswhen you collect bed feathers for coverlets recollect that if they are cleanly plucked they will require no dressing of any kind save drying and beating  brown paperbrown paper is an excellent nonconductor of heat and excluder of draughts english cottagers often enclose sheets of it within their quilted counterpanes if thoroughly soaked and then dried it will not crackle  extra clothesif a man be destitute of proper wraps he cannot do better than put on all the spare clothes he possesses the additional warmth of a single extra shirt is remarkable  dry clotheshowever wet the weather may be during the day the traveller should never relax his endeavours to keep a dry and warm change of clothes for his bivouac at night hardships in rude weather matter little to a healthy man when he is awake and moving and while the sun is above the horizon but let him never forget the deplorable results that may follow a single nights exposure to cold malaria and damp  pillowsa mound of sand or earth scraped together for a pillow is ground down into flatness after a few minutes a bag filled with earth or it may be with grass keeps its shape many people use their saddles as pillows they roll up the flaps and stirrups and place the saddle on the ground with a stone underneath at its hindmost end to keep it level and steady and then lay their heads on the seat i prefer using anything else as for instance the stone without the saddle but i generally secure some bag or other for the purpose as without a pillow it is difficult to sleep in comfort a bag shaped like a pillowcase and stuffed with spare clothes is very convenient some people advocate aircushions  mr mansfield parkyns excellent plan of sleeping on the side with the stock of the gun between the head and the arm and the barrel between the legs will be described when i speak of guns    bivouac   there are four ways in which travellers who are thrown upon their own resources may house themselves they may bivouac that is to say they may erect a temporary shelter of a makeshift character partly from materials found on the spot and partly from the cloths they may happen to possess they may build a substantial hut which of course takes a good deal of labour to complete they may use sleepingbags or they may pitch a regular tent i will speak of these four methods of encamping the bivouac the hut the sleepingbag and the tent in that order  general remarksbivouacking is miserable work in a wet or unhealthy climate but in a dry and healthy one there is no question of its superiority over tenting men who sleep habitually in the open breathe fresher air and are far more imbued with the spirit of wild life than those who pass the night within the stuffy enclosure of a tent it is an endless pleasure to lie half awake watching the stars above and the picturesque groupings of the encampment round about and to hear on all sides the stirrings of animal life and later in the night when the fire is low and servants and cattle are asleep and there is no sound but of the wind and an occasional plaintive cry of wild animals the traveller finds himself in that close communion with nature which is the true charm of wild travel now all this pleasure is lost by sleeping in a tent tent life is semicivilization and perpetuates its habits this may be illustrated by a simple trait a man who has lived much in bivouacs if there be a night alarm runs naturally into the dark for safety just as a wild animal would but a man who travels with tents becomes frightened when away from its lights or from the fancied security of its walls  in a dangerous country there can be no comparison between the hazard of a tent and that of a bivouac in the former a mans sleep is heavy he cannot hear nearly so well he can see nothing his cattle may all decamp while marauders know exactly where he is lying and may make their plans accordingly they may creep up unobserved and spear him through the canvas the first napoleon had a great opinion of the advantages of bivouacking over those of tenting he said it was the healthier of the two for soldiers see p 153  shelter from the windstudy the form of a hare in the flattest and most unpromising of fields the creature will have availed herself of some little hollow to the lee of an insignificant tuft of grass and there she will have nestled and fidgeted about till she has made a smooth round grassy bed compact and fitted to her shape where she may curl herself snugly up and cower down below the level of the cutting night wind follow her example a man as he lies upon his mother earth is an object so small and low that a screen of eighteen inches high will guard him securely from the strength of a storm a common mistake of a novice lies in selecting a tree for his campingplace which spreads out nobly above but affords no other shelter from the wind than that of its bare stem below  sketch of sleeping man behind wall  it may be that as he walks about in search of shelter a mass of foliage at the level of his eye with its broad shadow attracts him and as he stands to the leeward of it it seems snug and therefore without further reflection he orders his bed to be spread at the foot of some tree but as soon as he lies down on the ground the tree proves worthless as a screen against the wind it is a roof but it is not a wall the real want in blowy weather is a dense low screen perfectly windtight as high as the knee above the ground thus if a traveller has to encamp on a bare turf plain he need only turn up a sod seven feet long by two feet wide and if he succeeds in propping it on its edge it will form a sufficient shield against the wind  in heavy gales the neighbourhood of a solitary tree is a positive nuisance it creates a violent eddy of wind that leaves palpable evidence of its existence thus in cornfields it is a common result of a storm to batter the corn quite flat in circles round each tree that stands in the field while elsewhere no injury takes place this very morning that i am writing these remarks november 158 i was forcibly struck by the appearance of kensington gardens after last nights gale which had covered the ground with an extraordinary amount of dead leaves they lay in a remarkably uniform layer of from three to five inches in depth except that round each and every tree the ground was absolutely bare of leaves for a radius of about a yard the effect was as though circular discs had been cut out leaving the edges of the layer of leaves perfectly sharp and vertical it would have been a dangerous mistake to have slept that night at the foot of any one of those trees  again in selecting a place for bivouac we must bear in mind that a gale never blows in level currents but in all kinds of curls and eddies as the driving of a duststorm or the vagaries of bits of straw caught up by the wind unmistakably show us little hillocks or undulations combined with the general lay of the ground are a chief cause of these eddies they entirely divert the current of the wind from particular spots such spots should be looked for they are discovered by watching the grass or the sand that lies on the ground if the surface be quiet in one place while all around it is agitated by the wind we shall not be far wrong in selecting that place for our bed however unprotected it may seem in other respects it is constantly remarked that a very slight mound or ridge will shelter the ground for many feet behind it and an old campaigner will accept such shelter gladly notwithstanding the apparent insignificances of its cause  shelter from the skythe shelter of a wall is only sufficient against wind or driving rain we require a roof to shield us against vertical rain and against dew or what is much the same thing against the cold of a clear blue sky on a still night the temperature of the heavens is known pretty accurately by more than one method of calculation it is 239 degrees fahr the greatest cold felt in the arctic regions being about 40 degrees fahr if the night be cloudy each cloud is a roof to keep off the cold if it be clear we are exposed to the full chill of the blue sky with only such alleviation as the warming and the nonconducting powers of the atmosphere may afford the effect is greater than most people would credit the uppermost layer of the earth or whatever may be lying exposed upon it is called upon to part with a great quantity of heat if it so happen that the uppermost layer is of a nonconducting nature the heat abstracted from it will be poorly resupplied by communication from the lower ones again if the night be a very calm one there will be no supply of warmth from fresh currents of air falling down upon it hence in the treble event of a clear blue sky a nonconducting soil and a perfectly still night we are liable to have great cold on the surface of the ground this is shared by a thin layer of air that immediately rests upon it while at each successive inch in height the air becomes more nearly of its proper temperature a vast number of experiments have been made by mr glaisher on this subject phil trans 1847 the upshot of which is that a thermometer laid on grass under a blue sky on a calm night marks on an average 8 degrees fahr colder than one 4 feet above it 1 inch above grass 5 12 degrees 1 foot 1 degrees 4 feet 12 degrees on gravel and sand the differences are only about onethird as much sheep have a practical knowledge of these differences often in an early walk on dewy mornings i see all the sheep in hyde park bivouacked on the gravel walks of rotten row the above figures are the results of experiments made in england where the air is always moist and the formation of dew while it testifies to the cold of the night assists largely to moderate it in arid climates the chill would be far greater such would also be the case at high elevations one of mr glaishers experiments showed a difference of no less than 28 degrees between the cold on the ground and that at 8 feet high this might often be rivalled in an elevated desert as in that of mongolia hence the value of the protection of a roof and of a raised sleepingplace to a man sleeping under a blue sky in still weather admits of easy interpretation  various methods of bivouackingunprotectedmr shaw the traveller in thibet saysmy companion and i walked on to keep ourselves warm but halting at sunset had to sit and freeze several hours before the things came up the best way of keeping warm on such an occasion is to squat down kneeling against a bank resting your head on the bank and nearly between your knees then tuck your overcoat in all round you over head and all and if you are lucky and there is not too much wind you will make a little atmosphere of your own inside the covering which will be snug in comparison with the outside air your feet suffer chiefly but you learn to tie yourself into a kind of knot bringing as many surfaces of your body together as possible i have passed whole nights in this kneeling position and slept well whereas i should not have got a wink had i been stretched at full length with such a scanty covering as a greatcoat  bushesi have shown that the main object before sleeping out at night is to secure a long windtight wall and that the next is to obtain a roof both these objects may be attained by pleachingtwo or three small neighbouring bushes into one or branches may be torn off elsewhere and interwoven between the bushes a few leafy boughs cut and stuck into the ground with their tops leaning over the bed and secured in that position by other boughs wattledin horizontally give great protection long grass etc should be plucked and strewn against them to make them as windtight as possible  wallsa pile of saddlebags and other travelling gear may be made into a good screen against the wind and travellers usually arrange them with that intention walls of stone may be built as a support to cloths whose office it is to render the walls windtight and also by lapping over their top to form a partial roof we have already spoken of a broad sod of turf propped up on edge  the thibetan traveller cares for no roof overhead if he can shelter himself from the wind behind a threefoot wall hence the numerous little enclosures clustered together like cells of a honeycomb at every haltingplace with one side always raised against the prevailing wind shaw these walls are built round shallow pits each with its rough fireplace in the middle  clothsany cloth may be made to give shelter by an arrangement like that in the sketch  sketch of cloth shelter  the corners of the cloth should be secured by simple hitches in the rope and never by knots the former are sufficient for all purposes of security but the latter will jam and you may have to injure both cloth and string to get them loose again it is convenient to pin the sides of the cloth with a skewer round the ropes any strip of wood makes a skewer earth should be banked against the lowest edge of the cloth to keep out the wind and to prevent its flapping the sticks may on an emergency be replaced by faggots of brushwood by guns or by ropes carried down from the overhanging branches of a large tree for a sail supported by oars see sail

together to cut it in case of an alarm over this extempore framework was thrown a large indiarubber cloth with which he covered his packs when on the road it made a cover sufficiently large to receive about half of his bed and was a place of shelter for his instruments  gordon cummingthe following extract is from mr gordon cummings book on africa it describes the preparations of a practised traveller for a short excursion from his wagons away into the bush i had at length got into the way of making myself tolerably comfortable in the field and from this date i seldom went in quest of elephants without the following impedimenta ie a large blanket which i folded and secured before my saddle as a dragoon does his cloak and two leather sacks containing a flannel shirt warm trousers and a woollen nightcap spare ammunition washingrod coffee bread sugar pepper and salt dried meat a wooden bowl and a teaspoon these sacks were carried on the shoulders of the natives for which service i remunerated them with beads they also carried my coffeekettle two calabashes of water two american axes and two sickles which i used every evening to cut grass for my bed and likewise for my horses to eat throughout the night and my afterrider carried extra ammunition and a spare rifle  importance of comfortto conclude these general hints let the traveller when out in trying weather work hard at making his sleepingplace perfectly dry and comfortable he should not cease until he is convinced that it will withstand the chill of the early morning when the heat of the yesterdays sun is exhausted and that of the coming sun has not begun to be felt it is wretched beyond expression for a man to lie shivering beneath a scanty covering and to feel the night air become hourly more raw while his lifeblood has less power to withstand it and to think selfreproachfully how different would have been his situation if he had simply had forethought and energy enough to cut and draw twice the quantity of firewood and to spend an extra halfhour in labouring to make himself a snugger berth the omission once made becomes irreparable for in the cold of a pitiless night he has hardly sufficient stamina to rise and face the weather and the darkness makes him unable to cope with his difficulties  bivouac in special localitiesencampment in forestsa clump of trees yields wonderful shelter the swedes have a proverb that the forest is the poor mans jacket in firwoods there is great facility in making warm encampments for a young tree when it is felled yields both poles to support branches for shields against weather and finer cuttings for flooring above the snow or damp a common plan is to support a crossbar by two uprights as shown in the figure against this crossbar a number of poles are made to lean on the back of the poles abundance of fir branches are laid horizontally and lastly on the back of these are another set of leaning poles in order to secure them by their weight  sketch of pole shelter on bare plainsavoid sleeping in slight hollows during clear still weather the cold stratum of air of which i spoke in the section of shelter from the sky pours down into them like water from the surrounding plain and stagnates spring frosts are always more severely felt in hollows therefore in a broad level plain especially if the night be clear and calm look out for some slightly rising ground for an encampment the chilled stratum of air drains from off it and is replaced by warmer air horses and cattle as the night sets in always draw up to these higher grounds which rise like islands through the sea of mist that covers the plain  walls have been built for shelter against the wind on a bare sandy plain by taking empty bags filling them with sand and then building them up as if they had been stones  buried or in holesa european can live through a bitter night on a perfectly dry sandy plain without any clothes besides what he has on if he buries his body pretty deeply in the sand keeping only his head above ground it is a usual habit of the naked natives in australia to do so and not an unfrequent one of the hottentots of south africa mr moffat records with grateful surprise how he passed a night of which he had gloomy forebodings in real comfort even luxury by adopting this method a man may be as comfortable in a burrow as in a den i shall speak of underground houses under hutting and for the present will only mention that in arid countries dry wells dug by natives and partially choked by drifted sand are often to be met with they are generally found near existing wateringplaces where they have been superseded by others better placed and deeper now there are few warmer sleepingplaces than one of these dry wells a small fire is easily kept burning at the bottom and the top may be partially roofed over  in ashes of camp firea few chill hours may be got over in a plain that affords no other shelter by nestling among the ashes of a recently burntout camp fire  warm carcasesin napoleons retreat after his campaign in russia many a soldier saved or prolonged his life by creeping within the warm and reeking carcase of a horse that had died by the way  by the watersidea stony beach makes a fine dry encampingplace and has this advantage that it makes it impossible for marauders to creep up unheard but the immediate neighbourhood of fresh water is objectionable for besides being exposed to malaria and mosquitoes the night air is more cold and penetrating by its side than at one or two hundred yards distance from it i will speak of walls of rushes and reeds under huts  by rocksin the cruel climate of thibet dr hooker tells us that it is the habit to encamp close to some large rock because a rock absorbs heat all day and parts with it but slowly during the nighttime it is therefore a reservoir of warmth when the sun is down and its neighbourhood is coveted in the nighttime owing to the same cause acting in the opposite direction the shadow of a broad rock is peculiarly cool and grateful during the heat of the day in a thirsty land  on heathermr st john tells us of an excellent way in which highland poachers when in a party usually pass frosty nights on the moorside they cut quantities of heather and strew part of it as a bed on the ground then all the party lie down side by side excepting one man whose place among the rest is kept vacant for him his business is to spread plaids upon them as they lie and to heap up the remainder of the heather upon the plaids this being accomplished the man wriggles and works himself into the gap that has been left for him in the midst of his comrades  sketch of sleeping arrangement  on snowi shall have to describe snowhouses and snowwalls covered with sailcloth under huts here i will speak of more simple arrangements dr kane sayswe afterwards learnt to modify and reduce our travellinggear and found that in direct proportion to its simplicity and to our apparent privation of articles of supposed necessity were our actual comfort and practical efficiency step by step as long as our arctic service continued we went on reducing our sledging outfit until we at last came to the esquimaux ultimatum of simplicityraw meat and a fur bag lieut cresswell rn who having been detached from captain mcclures ship in 1853 was the first officer who ever accomplished the famous northwest passage gave the following graphic account of the routine of his journeying in a speech at lynnyou must be aware that in arctic travelling you must depend entirely on your own resources you have not a single thing else to depend on except snowwater no produce of the country nor firewood or coals or anything off the sort and whatever you have to take to sustain you for the journey you must carry or drag it is found by experience more easy to drag it on sledges than to carry it the plan we adopt is thiswe have a sledge generally manned by about six or ten men which we load with provisions with tents and all requisites for travelling simple cooking utensils spiritsofwine for cooking etc and start off the quantity of people can generally drag over the ice is forty days provisions that gives about 200 lbs weight to each after starting from the ship and having travelled a certain number of hoursgenerally ten or elevenwe encamp for the night or rather for the day because it is considered better to travel at night and sleep at day on account of the glare of the sun on the snow we used to travel journeys of about ten hours and then encamp light our spiritsofwine put our kettle on it to thaw our snowwater and after we had had our supperjust a piece of pemmican and a glass of waterwe were glad to smoke our pipes and turn into bed the first thing we did after pitching the tent was to lay a sort of macintosh covering over the snow on this a piece of buffalo robe was stretched each man and officer had a blanket sewn up in the form of a bag and into these we used to jump much in the same way as you may see a boy do in a sack we lay down head and feet the next person to me having his head to my feet and his feet to my head so that we lay like herrings in a barrel after this we covered ourselves with skin spreading them over the whole of us and the closer we got the better as there was more warmth we lay till the morning and then the process was the same again it appears that people may bury themselves in snow and want neither air nor warmth i have never made the experiment but have read of numerous instances of people falling into snowdrifts and not being extricated for many days and when at length they were taken out they never seem to have complained of cold or any other sufferings than those of hunger and of anxiety    huts   huts and snowhousesin making a dep√¥t it is usual to build a house often the men must pass weeks in inactivity and they had better spend their time in making their quarters comfortable than in idleness whatever huts are used by the natives are sure if made with extra care to be good enough for european travellers  loghutsin building loghuts four poles are planted in the ground to correspond to the four corners against these logs are piled one above another as in the drawing below they are so deeply notched where their ends are crossed that the adjacent sides are firmly dovetailed when the walls are entirely completed the door and windows are chopped out  sketch of cabin  the spaces between the logs must be caulked with moss etc or the logcabin will be little better than a logcage it requires a great many logs to make a hut for supposing the walls to be 8 feet high and the trees to average 8 inches in diameter twelve trees would be required to build up one side or fortyeight for all four walls other timber would also be wanted for the roof  underground huts are used in all quarters of the globe the experience of our troops when encamped before sebastopol during an inclement season told strongly in their favour their timely adoption was the salvation of the british army they are essentially nothing else than holes in the ground roofed over fig 1  sketch of roof and geometrical measure  the shape and size of the hole corresponds to that of the roof it may be possible to procure for it its depth is no greater than requisite for sitting or standing if the roof has a pitch of 2 feet in the middle the depth of the hole need not exceed 4 12 feet in the crimea the holes were rectangular and were roofed like huts  where there is a steep hillside a a fig 2 an underground hut b is easily contrived because branches laid over its top along the surface of the ground have sufficient pitch to throw off the rain of course the earth must be removed from a at the place intended for the doorway  reed hutsthe reed huts of the affej arabs and other inhabitants of the chaldean marshes are shaped like wagonroofs and are constructed of semicircular ribs of reeds planted in the ground one behind the other at equal distances apart each rib being a faggot of reeds of 2 feet in diameter for strength they are bound round every yard with twisted bands of reeds when this framework has been erected it is covered with two or three sheets of fine reed matting see matting which forms a dwelling impervious to rain some of the chiefs huts are as much as 40 feet long and 12 high the other huts are considerably smaller many of these reed dwellings are contained in compounds enclosed by lofty reed fences the reeds being planted upright and simply strung together by a thread run through them as they stand side by side see straw and reed walls  snowhousesfew travellers have habitually made snowhouses except sir j franklins party and that of dr rae great praises are bestowed on their comfort by all travellers but skill and practice are required in building them the mode of erection of these domeshaped buildings is as followsit is to be understood that compact underlying snow is necessary for the floor of the hut and that the looser textured upper layer of snow is used to build the house first select and mark out the circular plot on which the hut is to be raised then cut out of that plot with knives deep slices of snow 6 inches wide 3 feet long and of a depth equal to that of the layer of loose snow say one or two feet these slices are to be of a curved shape so as to form a circular ring when placed on their edges and of a suitable radius for the first row of snowbricks other slices are cut on the same principle for the succeeding rows but when the domed roof has to be made the snowbricks must be cut with the necessary double curvature a conical plug fills up the centre of the dome loose snow is next heaped over the house to fill up crevices lastly a doorway is cut out with knives also a window which is glazed with a sheet of the purest ice at hand for inside accommodation there should be a pillar or two of snow to support the lamps  snow walls with tenting for their roofssir l mcclintock sayswe travelled each day until dusk and then were occupied for a couple of hours in building our snowhut the four walls were run up until 5 12 feet high inclining inwards as much as possible over these our tent was laid to form a roof we could not afford the time necessary to construct a dome of snow our equipment consisted of a very small brownholland tent macintosh floorcloth and felt robes besides this each man had a bag of double blanketing and a pair of fur boots to sleep in we wore mocassins over the pieces of blanketing in which our feet were wrapped up and with the exception of a change of this footgear carried no spare clothes  when we halted for the night thompson and i usually sawed out the blocks of compact snow and carried them to petersen who acted as the mastermason in building the hut the hourandahalf or two hours usually employed in erecting the edifice was the most disagreeable part of the days labour for in addition to being already well tired and desiring repose we became thoroughly chilled while standing about the dogs were then fed then the sledge unpacked and everything carried into it the door was now blocked up with snow the cookinglamp lighted footgear changed diary writing up watches wound sleepingbags wriggled into pipes lighted and the merits of the various dogs discussed until supper was ready the supper swallowed the upper robe or coverlet pulled over and then to sleep next morning came breakfast a struggle to get into frozen mocassins after which the sledges were packed and another days march commenced in these little huts we usually slept warm enough although latterly when our blankets and clothes became loaded with ice we felt the cold severely when our low doorway was carefully blocked up with snow and the cookinglamp alight the temperature quickly rose so that the walls became glazed and our bedding thawed but the cooking over or the doorway partially opened it as quickly fell again so that it was impossible to sleep or even to hold ones pannikin of tea without putting mits on so intense was the coldsir l mcclintock is here speaking of a temperature of 39 degrees fahr  materials for building hutsthe materials whence the walls and roofs of huts may be constructed are very numerous there is hardly any place which does not furnish one or other of them those principally in use are as follows  wattleanddaub to be executed neatly required wellshaped and flexible sticks but a hut may be constructed much like the sketch see p 120 of the way of drying clothes it is made by planting in the ground a number of bare sticks 4 feet long and 1 foot apart bending their tops together lashing them fast with string or strips of bark and wattling them judiciously here and there by means of other boughs laid horizontally then by heaping leavesand especially broad pieces of bark if you can get themover all and banking up the earth on either side pretty high an excellent kennel is made if daubed over with mud clay or cattledung the hut becomes more secure against the weather to proceed a step furtheras many poles may be planted in the ground as sticks have been employed in making the roof and then the roof may be lifted bodily in the air and lashed to the top of the poles each stick to its corresponding pole this sort of structure is very common among savages  for methods of digging holes in which to plant the hutpoles see the chapter on wells the holes made in the way i have there explained are far better than those dug with spades for they disturb no more of the hardened ground than is necessary for the insertion of the palisades to jam a pole tightly in its place wedges of wood should be driven in at its side and earth rammed down between the wedges  palisades are excellent as walls or as enclosures they are erected of vast lengths by savages wholly destitute of tools both for the purposes of fortification and also for completing lines of pitfalls across wide valleys the pitfalls occupy gaps left in the palisading the savages burn down the trees in the following mannera party of men go to the forest and light small fires round the roots of the trees they propose to fell the fires are prevented from flaming upwards by the judicious application of leaves etc when the fire has eaten a little way into the tree the man who watches it scrapes the fire aside and knocks away the charred wood exposing a fresh surface for fire to act upon and then replaces the burning embers a single man may easily attend to a dozen trees and indeed to many more if the night be calm some hours elapse before the trees actually fall their tops and branches are burnt off as they lie on the ground the poles being thus procured for the palisading they are carried to the required place where holes are dug for their reception on the principle described in wells to which i have just alluded  straw or reed walls of the following kind are very effective and they have the advantage of requiring a minimum of string or substitute for string in their manufacture the straw reeds or herbage of almost any description is simply nipped between two pairs of long sticks which are respectively tied together at their ends and at a sufficient number of intermediate places the whole is neatly squared and trimmed  sketch of straw walls  a few of these would give good help in finishing the roof or walls of a house they can be made moveable so as to suit the wind shade and aspect even the hut door can be made on this principle in reedy countries where there are no sticks thin faggots of reeds are used in their place  barkbark is universally used in australia for roofs of huts and temporary buildings the colonists learnt the use of it from the natives and some trees at least in every forestcountry might very probably be found as well fitted for that purpose as those in australia the bark may be easily removed only when the sap is well up in the tree but a skilful person will manage to procure bark at all seasons of the year except in the coldest winter months and even then he will light on some tree from the sunny side of which he can strip broad pieces the process of barkstripping is simply to cut two rings right round the tree usually from 6 to 9 feet apart and one vertical slit to join them starting from the slit and chipping away step by step on either side the whole cylinder of bark is removed the larger the tree the better for if the tree is less than 18 inches or so in diameter the bark is apt to break when flattened out when stripped for huts it is laid on the ground for some days to dry being flattened out on its face and a few stones or logs put on it the ordinary bark of gumtrees is about half an inch to threeeighths thick so that a large sheet is very heavy most exploring expeditions are accompanied by a black whose dexterity in stripping bark for a wet night is invaluable as if the bark will come off well he can procure enough of it in an hours time to make a shelter for a large party  mats can be woven with ease when there is abundance of string or some equivalent for it see string in the following manner  sketch of loom  a b are two pegs driven into the ground and standing about a foot out of it a stake a b is lashed across them a row of pegs e are driven into the ground parallel to a b and about 6 inches apart two sets of strings are then tied to a b one set are fastened by their loose ends into clefts in the pegs e and the other set are fastened to the stick c d if there be ten strings in all then 1 3 5 7 9 are tied to c d and 2 4 6 8 10 to a b by alternately raising and depressing c d and by pushing in a handful of rushes between the two sets of strings after each of its movements and finally by patting them home with a flat stick this rough sort of weaving is carried on very successfully mats are also plaited in breadths and the breadths are stitched together side by side or a thicker kind of mat may be made by taking a wisp of straw and working it in the same way in which straw beehives are constructed straw is worked more easily after being damped and beaten with a mallet  malay hitchi know no better name for the wonderfully simple way shown in the figure of attaching together wisps of straw rods laths reeds planks poles or anything of the kind into a secure and flexible mat the sails used in the far east are made in this way and the moveable decks of vessels are made of bamboos joined together with a similar but rather more complicated stitch  sketch of fastening  i may remark that soldiers might be trained to a great deal of hutting practice in a very inexpensive way if they were drilled at putting together huts whose roofs and walls were made of planks lashed together by this simple hitch and whose supports were short scaffolding poles planted in deep holes dug as explained in the chapter on wells with the hand and a small stick the poles planks and cords might be used over and over again for an indefinite time further bedsteads could be made in a similar way by short crossplanks lashed together and resting on a framework of horizontal poles lashed to uprights planted in the ground the soldiers bedding would not be injured by being used on these bedsteads as much as if it were laid on the bare ground kinds of designs and experiments in hutting could be practised without expense in this simple way  tarpaulings are very suitable for roofs those made after the method used by sailors are much superior to others in softness and durability the plan is as followsas soon as the canvas has been sewn together it is thoroughly wetted with seawater and while still wet it is smeared over on one of its sides with tar and grease boiled togetherabout two parts tar and one of grease after being hung up till it is dry it is turned and the other side being a second time well wetted is at once painted over with the tar and grease just as the first side had been before the sailors say that the tar dries in as the water dries out a saying which i confess i cannot understand  other materialsi will merely mention these by name for they require no explanation they are fascines or faggots bricks sundried or baked in the oven turf stones and bags or mats filled with sand or shingle  whitewash is lime and water lime is made by burning limestone chalk shells or coral in a simple furnace  roofsthatchingafter the framework of the roof has been made the thatcher begins at the bottom and ties a row of bundles of straw side by side on to the framework then he begins a second row allowing the ends of the bundles composing it to overlap the heads of those in the first row  woodshingles are tileshaped slices of wood easily cut from firtrees they are used for roofing on the same principle as tiles or slates  floorsconcrete for floors is made of eight parts

twentyfive years by the french douaniers who watch the mountainpasses of the pyrenean frontier the bags are made of sheepskin with the wool inside when not in use they are folded up and buckled with five buckles into the shape of a somewhat bulky knapsack p 152 which the recent occupant may shoulder and walk away with  the accompanying sketches are drawn to scale they were made from the sleepingbag belonging to a man 5 feet 6 inches in height the scale should therefore be lengthened for a taller person but the breadth seems ample its weight was exactly seven pounds the douaniers post themselves on watch more or less immersed in these bags they lie out in wet and snow and find them impervious to both when they sleep they get quite inside them stuff their cloaks between their throats and the bag and let its flap cover their faces it is easy enough for them to extricate themselves they can do so almost with a bound the spanish customhouse officers who watch the same frontier use their cloaks and other wraps which are far more weighty and far inferior in warmth and protection to the bags i described these knapsack bags in vacation tourists for 1860 p 449 and i subsequently had a macintosh bag lined with drugget made on the same principle i had a hood to it and also the means of buttoning it loosely under my chin to make myself watertight during heavy rain in that bag i passed many nights of very trying weather on one instance i selected a hilltop in switzerland on the way from chambery to the dent du midi during a violent and longcontinued thunderstorm the storm began above my head then slowly sank to my level and finally subsided below me many alpine travellers notably mr packe and mr tuckett have adopted these bags and used them continually macintosh is certainly oppressive to sleep in though less so than might have been expected as the halfunconscious fidgeting of the sleeper changes the air a man in travelling condition would probably find a druggetbag more healthy than macintosh even though he became somewhat wet inside it beds used to be almost unknown in some parts of the pyrenees sheepskin sleepingbags were employed instead thus i am assured that at the beginning of this century there was hardly a bed in the whole of the little republic of andorre the way of arranging them as knapsacks is as i have said a recent invention  in fig 1 the wide opening to the mouth of the bag is shown also the ends of the buckles and straps that are sewn on patches of leather for additional strength to the lower side of the bag as seen in fig 2  fig 1 and 2  it must be understood that the woolly sides of the skins are inwards the straps that hold the knapsack to the shoulders are secured by a simple fastening shown in figs 2 and 3 but the ordinary knapsack hooks and rings if procurable would answer the purpose better the straight lines in fig 1 show the way in which the bag is to be folded into the shape of fig 3 fig 4 shows the sleeper inside his bag in which he fits very like a grub in its cocoon there is no waste of space for the sake of warmth the bag is made double from the knees downwards and also opposite to the small of the back  figs 3 and 4  during the daytime when the weather is wet or cold the bags are of much use for the douaniers sit with them pulled up to their waist when carried in the manner of a knapsack the bag sits perfectly well against the shoulders but owing to the yielding nature of its substance it lies too close to the back and is decidedly oppressive a wicker frame might well be interposed  arctic sleepingbagsarctic travellers use coarse drugget bags covered with brown holland to make them less pervious to the wind and having a long flap at the upper end to fold down over the face i have already extracted passages from travellers accounts relating to them in speaking of encamping on snow p 140 and another when speaking of snowwalls with tenting for their roofs p 143  macintosh sackmr falconer writes to me as followsi travelled in 1841 from austin in texas to mexico through new mexico i left austin in june and reached zacateras on christmas day during nearly the whole period we travelled from austin to new mexico i camped without any covering at night for myself except a large macintosh made up as a sack with a piece so laid as a continuation of one side as to be used as a coverlet sufficient in length to be brought from the back over the head and down on the breast inside i placed my blankets i slept under this covering during many a heavy storm at night and got out of my softcoated shell dry in the morning my opinion is that every traveller who works his way with a horse should fix on his own saddle the said macintosh sack two blankets a tin cup and a fryingpan it is amazing when you get into real working order how few things are sufficient  peasants sackthe peasants in the northern parts of germany use a strong linen sack made to draw at one end this they stuff with straw hay dry leaves etc and putting their feet into it pull its mouth up to their armpits they use them when driving their wagons in winter and when lodging at their wretched roadside inns see a letter in the times february 125  bag combined with tenti should think that a combination of a sleeping bag with a very small tent just large enough to enclose the mans head and shoulders so as to permit him to eat or write when lying in his bag without fear of the wet would be the smallest and lightest arrangement compatible with efficiency in a stormy climate    tents   general remarksalthough tents are not worth the trouble of pitching on dry nights in a healthy climate they are invaluable protectors to a wellequipped traveller against rain dew and malaria but a man who is not so equipped who has no change of clothes and no bedstead to sleep on will do better to sleep in the open air in front of a good camp fire napoleon i speaking of soldiers says maximes de guerretents are not healthy it is better for the soldier to bivouac because he sleeps with his feet to the fire whose neighbourhood quickly dries the ground on which he lies some planks or a little straw shelter him from the wind nevertheless a tent is necessary for superior officers who have need to write and to consult a map to a party encamped for a few days tents are of great use as storehouses for property which otherwise becomes scattered about at the risk of being lost or pilfered  materials for tentinglight canvas is usually employed and is to all intents and purposes waterproof silk of equal strength with the canvas is very far lighter its only disadvantage is its expense calico or cotton canvas is very generally used for small tents leather and felt are warm but exceedingly heavy and would only be used in very inclement climates or where canvas could not be met with light matting is not to be despised it is warm and pretty durable and makes excellent awning or covering to a framework  diagonal bracinga wornout tent may be strengthened by sewing bands of canvas which cross each other and make a kind of network old sails are strengthened in this way  tent pegs should be of galvanized iron they are well worth the weight of carriage for not only do wooden ones often fail on an emergency but cooks habitually purloin them when firewood is scarce  tentslarge tentsthe art of tentmaking has greatly advanced since the days of the oldfashioned belltent which is so peculiarly objectionable as to make it a matter of surprise that it was ever invented and used it is difficult to pitch it requires many tentpegs it has ropes radiating all round it over which men and horses stumble and it is incommodious and ugly  in choosing a tent select one that will stand in some sort of shape with only four pegs or with six at the very utmost it should admit of being pegged close to the ground without any intervening fly it is no objection that it should require more than one pole and when considering how much weight it will be possible to carry it must be borne in mind that the tent will become far heavier than it is found to be in the peculiarly dry atmosphere of a tentmakers showroom it is very convenient that a tent should admit of being pitched in more than one form for instance that one side should open and form an awning in hot weather also that it should be easy to attach flys or awning to the tent to increase its available size during the daytime all tents should be provided with strong covers for packropes are sure to fray whatever they press against and it is better that the cover should suffer than the tent itself  comparative size of tentsthe annexed diagram will show the points on which the roominess of a tent mainly depends  sketch of tent and occupants  a man wants space to sit at a table and also to get at his luggage in order either to pack it or to unpack it lastly he wants a reasonable amount of standing room a fairsized tent ought to include the figures drawn in the diagram and i have indicated by lines and shaded spaces the section of various descriptions of tents that would be just sufficient to embrace

good tent for hot weather for it is far too stuffy though by taking an additional joint to the tentpole and using tentropes as may also be done with any other kind of tent it may be made more airy by being raised up and by having walls added to it fig 7 in default of canvas the walls may be constructed of other materials see materials for huts  tent pitched over an excavationa hole may be dug

weather if i recollect aright they are weighted with stones or they are stitched together there is no metal in the structure the laths of willowwood that form the sides are united where they cross by pieces of sinew knotted at either end these act as pivots when the sides are shut up i am indebted to the late mr atkinson for my information on these interesting structures further particulars about them the native way of making the felt by continually rolling sheepskins with the wool between them and numerous pictures in which jourts form a striking feature will be found in his beautifully

represented in fig 1 the ends are slit down their middles and are laced or buttoned together so that by unfastening these the tent spreads out to a flat sheet of the form of fig 2 well adapted for an awning or else it can be simply unrolled and used with the bedding it is necessary that a tent should be roomy enough to admit of a man undressing himself when wet through without treading upon his bed and drenching it with mud and water and therefore a tent of the above description is found to be unserviceable if less than about 7 feet long or ending in a triangle of less than 5 12 feet in the

continuous with the sides it is supported by poles that slip into hems of the clothtwo poles at either end these tents have been used on various occasions by mr whympers brother in alaska and by mr freshfield in the caucasus and were highly approved of but i do not know whether these tents would be altogether suitable for more comfortable travel i myself had a tent made on this principle some years ago but disliked it for i found the continuity of the floor with the sides to act unsatisfactorily the tent retained the damp and the weight of the body acting on the floor of the tent was apt to disturb its walls mr whympers tent is procurable at carters alpine outfitter 295 oxford street london  boating tentfurther on in the chapter on boats the way is shown by which sailors make a tent out of their lugsail throwing it over a framework of oars  gipsy tenta traveller who has only a blanket a plaid or broad piece of material of any kind with which he wishes to improvise a tent may make a framework of long wands planting their ends in the ground bending their tops together and lashing or wattling them securely over this the blanket is thrown fig 3 if the sticks are sufficiently long and pliant their ends should be bent over the roof halfway down the opposite side as in fig 1 this adds considerably to the strength of the arrangement  fig 13 as described in text  the gipsies in england use the following excellent contrivance to save the trouble of tying the sticks together they carry a light bar of wood 2 12 feet long bound with string here and there to keep it from splitting through this six holes each big enough to admit the tip of the little finger are bored or burnt they also carry eight hazel rods with them each six feet long and arrange their framework as in fig 2 it will be observed that the two rods which are planted behind give additional roominess and stability to the affair the rug and pillow show the position in which the occupants sleep blankets not sheeting pinned together with wooden pegs are thrown over the whole as in fig 3  fig 1 and 2 as described in the text  tente dabrithe french tente dabri has not so far as i know been adopted by travellers it seems hardly suitable except for soldiers each man carried a square of canvas fig 1 with buttons and buttonholes all round it by which it can be doubly attached to other similar squares of canvas and thus from several separate pieces one large cloth can be made the square carried by the french soldier measures 5 feet 4 12 inches in the side reckoning along the buttons of these there are nine along each edge including the corner ones each soldier has also to carry a tentstaff or else a proportion of the pegs and cord when six men club together they proceed as followsthree tentsticks are fixed into the ground whose tops are notched a light cord is then passed round their tops and fastened into the ground with a peg at each eng fig 2 two sheets a and b are buttoned together and thrown over the cord and then two other sheets c and d and c is buttoned to a and d to b fig 3 lastly another sheet is thrown over each of the slanting cords the one buttoned to a and b and the other to c and d and thus a sort of dogkennel is formed in which six menthe bearers of the six pieces of canvassleep the sides of the tent are of course pegged to the ground there are many modifications in the way of pitching these tents should the sticks be wanting faggots or muskets can be used in their place   tent of mosquitonettingi have been informed of a sportsman in ceylon who took with him into the woods a cot with mosquitocurtains as a protection not only against insects but against malaria he also had a blanket rolled at his feet at 3 in the morning when the chill arose in the woods he pulled his blanket over him  pitching a tentit is quite an art so to pitch a tent as to let in or exclude the air to take advantage of sun and shade etc etc every available cloth or sheet may be pressed into service to make awnings and screens as we see among the gipsies there is a great deal of character shown in each different persons encampment a tent should never be pitched in a slovenly way it is so far more roomy secure and pretty when tightly stretched out that no pains should be spared in drilling the men to do it well i like to use a piece of string marked with knots by which i can measure the exact places in which the tentpegs should be struck for the eye is a deceitful guide in estimating squareness see squaring it is wonderful how men will bungle with a tent when they are not properly drilled to pitch it  to secure tentropeswhen the soil is loose scrape away the surface sand before driving the tentpegs loose mould is made more tenacious by pouring water upon it when one peg is insufficient it may be backed by another see fig the outermost peg must be altogether buried in the earth heavy saddlebags are often of use to secure the tentropes and in rocky ground heavy piles of stones may be made to answer the same purpose the tentropes may also be knotted to a cloth on which stones are afterwards piled   dateram is as the late dr barth informed me the bornu name for a most excellent african contrivance used in some parts of the sahara desert by means of which tentropes may be secured or horses picketed in sand of the driest description as in that of a sand dune whence a tentpeg would be drawn out by a strain so slight as to be almost imperceptible i have made many experiments upon it and find its efficiency to be truly wonderful the plan is to tie to the end of the tentrope a small object of any description by its middle as a short stick a stone a bundle of twigs or a bag of sand and to bury it from 1 to 2 feet in the loose sand it will be found if it has been buried 1 foot deep that a strain equal to about 50 lbs weight is necessary to draw it up if 1 12 feet deep that a much more considerable strain is necessary and that if 2 feet deep it is quite impossible for a single man to pull it up in the following theoretical case the resistance would be as the cube of the depth but in sand or shingle the increase is less rapid it varies under different circumstances but it is no exaggeration to estimate its increase as seldom less than as the square of the depth the theoretical case of which i spoke is thislet x be part of a layer of shingle of wide extent the shingle is supposed to consist of smooth hard spherical balls all of the same size let s be a d√°ter√°m buried in x and t the string to which it is tied now on considering fig 2 where a series of balls are drawn on a larger scale and on a plane surface it is clear that the ball a cannot move in any degree to the right or the left without disturbing the entire layer of balls on the same plane as itself its only possible movement is vertically upwards in this case it disturbs b1 and b2 these for the same reason as a can only move vertically upwards and in doing so they must disturb the three balls above them and so on consequently the uplifting of a single ball in fig 2 necessitates the uplifting of the triangle of balls of which it forms the apex and it obviously follows from the same principle that the uplifting of s in the depth of x in fig 1 necessitates the uplifting of a cone of balls whose apex is at s but the weight of a cone is as the cube of its height and therefore the resistance to the uplifting of the d√°ter√°m is as the cube of the depth at which it has been buried in practice the grains of sand are capable of a small but variable amount of lateral displacement which gives relief to the movement of sand caused by the dateram for we may observe the surface of the ground to work very irregularly although extensively when the d√°ter√°m begins to stir on the other hand the friction of the grains of sand tends to increase the difficulty of movement the arrangement shown in the diagram of a spring weighingmachine tied to the end of a lever is that which i have used in testing the strain the dateram will resist under different circumstances the size of the dateram is not of much importance it would be of still less importance in the theoretical case anything that is more than 4 inches long seems to answer the plan succeeds in a dry soil of any description whether it be shingly beach or sand  bushing a tent means the burying of bushes in the soil so far as to leave only their cut ends above the ground to which a corresponding number of tentropes are tied  tentpoleswhen a tent is pitched for an encampment of some duration it is well to lay aside the jointed tentpole and to cut a stout young tree to replace it this will be found far more trustworthy in stormy weather if the shape of the tent admits of the change it is still better to do away with the centre pole altogether and in the place of it to erect a substantial framework of poles which are to be planted just within the rim of the tent and to converge to a point under its peak a tentpole can be lengthened temporarily by lashing it to a log with the help of a toggle and strop which see a broken tentpole can be mended permanently by placing a splint of wood on either side of the fracture and by whipping the whole together with soft cord or with the untwisted strand of a piece of rope  to prevent tentpoles from slippingwhen the tent is pitched in the ordinary way on a smooth rocky surface there is considerable danger that the foot of the pole may slip whenever a gust of wind or other sudden impulse sways the tent this danger is to be obviated on precisely the same principle as that by which builders secure their scaffoldingpoles upon the smooth footways of a street they put the foot of each pole into a bucket filled with sand as the base of the bucket is broad the scaffolding is much less liable to slip than if the narrow bases of the poles had rested directly upon the pavement  to tie things to tentpolesto hang clothes or anything else upon a smooth tentpole see clovehitch a strap with hooks attached to it buckled round the pole is very convenient the method shown in the sketch suffices if the pole be notched or jointed or in any way slightly uneven bags etc are supposed to be hung upon the bit of wood that is secured to the free end convenient pegs made of bits of wood roughly sharpened may be driven into the tree if any when the encampment is made   preparations for a stormbefore a storm dig a ditch as deep as you can round the outside of the tent to divert the coming sheet of surfacewater and see that the ditch has a good outfall the ditch will also drain the floor of the tent if the rain should soak in even a furrow scratched with a tentpeg is better than no ditch at all fasten guyropes to the spike of the tentpole and be careful that the tent is not too much on the strain else the further shrinking of the materials under the influence of the wet will certainly tear up the pegs earth banked up round the bottom of the tent will prevent gusts of wind from finding their way beneath it is also a good plan to prepare a small hole near the foot of the tentpole with a stone firmly rammed into the bottom into which the tentpole may be shifted as soon as the strain of the tent under the influence of the wet becomes dangerous to its safety  to warm tentswhen living in a tent in otago new zealand during a severe winter we were perfectly numb with cold at nights until we adopted the maori plan which is to dig a hole about a foot square in the clear to cover the bottom with a stone or stones and to fill it at night with redhot cinders from the camp fire and lastly to close the tent excepting a small opening near the top the cinders are not nearly burnt out by morning they diffused a pleasant warmth through the tent and rendered us comfortable all night there is no danger of suffocation unless the tent be closed up very tight indeedw m cooper  permanent campthe accompanying sketch shows a tent pitched for a lengthened habitation it has a deep drain a seat and table dug out and a fireplace see the following paragraphs   lost articlessmall articles are constantly mislaid and trampled in the sand of the floor of the tent in searching for them the ground should be disturbed as little as possible it is a usual plan to score its surface in parallel lines with a thin wand it would be well worth while to make a small light rake to use for this purpose  precautions against thievesnatives are apt to creep up to tents and putting their hands under the bottom of them to steal whatever they can a hedge of thornbushes is a protection against this kind of thieving in some countries a net with three or four bells attached to it is thrown over the packages inside a tent

or when people sit as in the east on the ground the seats should not be more than 1 foot high though as wide and deep as an ordinary footstool habit very soon reconciles travellers to this but without a seat at all a man can never write draw nor calculate as well as if he had one the stool represented in the figure above is a good pattern it has a fullsized seat made of canvas or leather or of

and cracks excessively there is no difficulty in carrying furniture like the above on a packhorse  makeshift chair and tablefor want of a chair it is convenient to dig a hole or a trench in the ground

of the box then when the box is laid face downwards and both the lid and the bottom are opened out and secured in the same horizontal plane with the side to which they are hinged a table of 3 feet by 2 feet is made the lid and bottom form the two leaves of the table and what was the hindmost side when the box stood on its bottom is now uppermost and forms the middle of the table such a box would

sticks or the horns of animals against the walls as pegs    fire   general remarksalthough in the teeth of every precaution fires constantly break out yet when a traveller wants a light and does not happen to have any of his ingenious firemaking contrivances at hand it is very difficult for him to obtain it and further though sparks of their own accord and in the most unlikely places too often give rise to conflagrations yet it requires much skill and practice to succeed without fail in coaxing a small spark into a serviceable camp fire therefore every traveller should carry on his person the means of procuring a light under ordinary circumstances of wind and weather that is to say he should have in his pocket a light handy steel a flint or an agate and amadou or other tinder i also strongly recommend that he should carry a bundle of halfadozen fine splinters of wood like miniature toothpicks thinner and shorter than lucifermatches whose points he has had dipped in melted sulphur also a small spare lump of sulphur of the size of a pea or bean in reserve the cook should have a regular tinderbox such as he happens to have been used to and an abundance of wax lucifers paper fusees are not worth taking in travel as wet entirely spoils them  there are usually three separate agents in making a fire each of which may be varied in many ways and requires separate description 1 the spark or other light to start with 2 the tinder that is some easily ignited and smouldering substance 3 fuel judiciously applied to the burning tinder or other feeble light so as to develop it into a serviceable fire  to obtain fire from the sunburningglassesthe objectglass and every other convex glass of a telescope is a burningglass and has only to be unscrewed to be fit for use the object lenses of an operaglass are very efficient the larger the glass and the shorter its focus the greater is its heating power convex spectacle glasses and eye glasses are too small and of too long a focus to be used with effect except when the sun is very hot an oldfashioned watchglass filled with water and having the rays of a powerful sun glittered down upon it vertically by help of a mirror will give a light dr kane and other arctic travellers have made burningglasses of ice  reflectorsthe inside of the polished metal cover of a huntingwatch will sometimes converge a sufficiency of rays to burn the vestal fire of rome and the sacred fire of the mexicans were obtained by means of reflectors if i understand aright they consisted of a stone with a conical hollow carefully polished the apex of the hollow cone was a right angle the tinder was held in the axis of the cone see tylors early history of mankind  black tindertinder that is black by previous charring or from any other cause ignites in the sun far sooner than lightcoloured tinder  fire by conversion of motion into heatgeneral remarkswhen a moving body is arrested heat is given out the quantity of heat being in exact proportion to the mass multiplied into the square of its velocity thus if a cannon ball be fired at an iron target both it and the ball become exceedingly hot there is even a flash of light when the velocity of the ball is very high when bullets are fired with heavy charges at a target the lead is just melted by the heat of impact and it splashes to use a common phrase it is obvious from these two examples that no velocity which the hand of man is able to give to a steel when striking a flint or to one stick rubbing against another stick will be competent to afford a redhot temperature unless the surface against which impact or friction is made be very small or unless great care be taken to avoid the wasteful dissipation of heat the spark made by a flint and steel consists of a thin shaving of steel scraped off by the flint and heated by the arrested motion when well struck the spark is whitehot and at that temperature it burns with bright scintillations in the air just as iron that is merely redhot burns in pure oxygen this is the theory now for the practice  flintsif we may rely on a wellknown passage in virgil concerning √Üneas and his comrades fire was sometimes made in ancient days by striking together two flints but i confess myself wholly unable to light tinder with flints alone and i am equally at a loss to understand what were the dry leaves that they are said in the same passage to have used for tinder neither can i obtain fire except with a flint and steel or at least hardened iron a flint and ordinary iron will not give an available spark flints may be replaced by any siliceous stone as agate rockcrystal or quartz agate is preferred to flint for it gives a hotter spark it is sold by tobacconists a partly siliceous stone such as granite will answer in default of one that is wholly siliceous i have been surprised at finding that crockery and porcelain of all kinds will make a spark and sometimes a very good one there are cases where a broken teacup might be the salvation of many lives in a shipwrecked party on coralreefs and other coasts destitute of flinty stones search should be made for driftwood and drifted seaweed in the roots of these the pebbles of other shores are not unfrequently entangled and flint may be found among them the joints of bamboos occasionally contain enough silex to give a spark  steelsthe possession of a really good steel is a matter of great comfort in rough travel for as i have just said common iron is incompetent to afford a useful spark and hardened iron or soft steel is barely sufficient to do so any blacksmith will make a good steel out of an old file if he has nothing more appropriate at hand a substitute for a steel can be made even by an ordinary traveller out of common iron by means of casehardening which see the link of a chain or the heel of a boot or a broken horseshoe is of a convenient shape for the purpose  pyrites are and have been widely used for striking sparks two pieces struck together or one piece struck with a steel gives a good spark but it is a very friable mineral and therefore not nearly so convenient as flint  gunsif you wish to get a light by means of a flintandsteel gun the touchhole may be stuffed up and a piece of tinder put among the priming powder a light can be obtained in that way without firing the gun with a percussioncap gun a light may be obtained by putting powder and tinder outside the nipple and round the cap it will though not with certainty catch fire on exploding the cap but the common way with a gun is to pour in a quarter of a charge of powder and above it quite loosely a quantity of rag or tinder on firing the gun straight up in the air the rag will be shot out lighted you must then run after it as it falls and pick it quickly up with percussioncaps gunpowder and tinder and without a gun a light may sometimes be had on an emergency by scratching and boring with a knife awl or nail at the fulminating composition in the cap till it explodes but a cap is a somewhat dangerous thing to meddle with as it often flies with violence and wounds crushing gunpowder with hard stones may possibly make it explode  lucifersan inexperienced hand will waste an entire boxful of them and yet will fail in lighting a fire in the open air on a windy day the convenience of lucifers in obtaining a light is very great but they have two disadvantages they require that the air should be perfectly still while the burning sulphur is struggling to ignite the stick and again when the match is thrust among the wood the sticks upon which is has to act have not been previously warmed and consequently though one or two of them may become lighted the further progress of the fire is liable to cease on the other hand in methods where the traveller begins with tinder and blows its spark into a flame the adjacent wood becomes thoroughly heated by the process and the flame once started is almost certain to maintain itself consequently in lighting a fire with lucifers be careful to shield the match from the wind by throwing a cloak or saddlecloth or something else over the head whilst you operate and secondly to have abundance of twigs of the smaller sizes that there may be no uncertainty of the lucifermatch being able to light them and set the fire agoing in a steady downfall of rain you may light a match for a pipe under your horses belly if you have paper to spare it is a good plan to twist it into a hollow cone to turn the cone with its apex to the wind and immediately after rubbing the match to hold it inside the cone the paper will become quickly heated by the struggling flame and will burst into a miniature conflagration too strong to be puffed out by a single blast of air wax lucifers are undoubtedly better than wooden ones for in damp weather wooden ones will hardly burn but wax is waterproof and independent of wet or dry when there is nothing dry at hand to rub the lucifermatch against scratch the composition on its head with the edge of a knife or with the fingernail it is a sure way of lighting it and with care there is no need of burning the fingers  firesticksin every country without exception where inquiry has been made the method of obtaining fire by rubbing one stick against another has been employed in savage countries the method still remains in present use in nearly all the more civilised ones it has been superseded within historic periods by flints and steels and the like and within this present generation by lucifermatches the only instance i know in which flints are said to have preceded firesticks is in the quotation below from pliny a light has also been obtained in prehistoric times as i have already mentioned by reflecting the sun from a hollow surface but this method required costly apparatus and could never have been in common use hence although so far as i am aware the bible and homer and other records of great antiquity are absolutely silent on the contemporary methods of procuring fire and although pliny says the reversei think we are justified in believing that the plan of rubbing sticks together was absolutely universal in the barbaric infancy of the human race in later greek history prometheus is accredited with the invention of firesticks among the romans both seneca and pliny write about them pliny says nat hist xvi 76 77 there is heat in the mulberry in the baylaurel in ivy and in all plants whence firesticks are made the experience of soldiers reconnoitring for encampinggrounds and that of shepherds made this discovery for a stone is not always at hand whence a spark might be struck one piece of wood therefore is rubbed by another and it catches fire through the friction while a dry tindery substancefungus and leaves are the most easilyattainableis used to perpetuate the fire nothing is better than ivy used as the stick to be rubbed and baylaurel as the stick to rub with wild vinenot the labruscais also found good  i have made a great many experiments with different kinds of wood having procured an assortment of those used by the fancy toymakers of tunbridge wells and the chippings from botanical gardens i find what i have heard from savages to be quite true viz that it is much more difficult to procure good wood for the fireblock than for the drillstick any though hard and dry stick will do for the latter but the fireblock must be of wood with little grain of a middle degree of softness readily inflammable and i presume a good onconductor of heat but i do not know if there be much difference in this latter respect between woods of the same quality if it be too hard the action of the drillstick will merely dent and polish it if very soft it will be worn away before the friction has time to heat it sufficiently ivy is excellent i find it not at all difficult to produce smoke it is much more difficult to produce fire with a broken fishingrod or ramrod as a drillstick and a common wooden pillbox or toothpowder box as a fireblock walnut also does as a fireblock and the stock of a gun is of walnut deal and mahogany are both worthless for firesticks  it is well so to notch the fireblock that the wooddust as it is formed by the rubbing should all run into one place it will then glow with a smouldering heat ready to burst out into an available flame with a very little fanning as soon as a degree of heat sufficient to ignite tinder has been attained tinder is a great convenience in ensuring that the fire once obtained shall not be lost again but it is not essential to have it  there are many ways of rubbing the sticks together in use among different nations those curious in the matter should consult tylors early history of mankind but the traveller will not obtain much assistance from these descriptions as it will be out of his power to obtain fire by any but the simplest of them on a first trial he is only likely to succeed at first by working at leisure with perfectly dry wood even savages who practise the art all their lives fail to procure fire in very wet weather when the shelter is bad of the plans employed by savages the simplest is that in use both in south africa and in australia  fig 1 as described  the australian blacks use the flowerstem of the grasstree which is of a tough pithy nature and about one inch in diameter the operation of making the fire is assisted by the use of a little charcoalpowder which in australia is found on the bark of almost every tree from the constant passage of grassfires over the ground the process is as followsone piece of the stick is notched in the middle fig 1 and the notch slightly hollowed out another is roundly pointed at one end the black fellow being seated on the ground holds down one end of the notched stick with each foot fig 2 and placing the point of the other stick into the notch twirls it rapidly and forcibly between the palms of his hands in doing this his hands gradually slip down the stick and he has to shift them rapidly up again which loses time but two people seated opposite can alternately take up the rubbing and more easily produce fire a little of the abovementioned powdered charcoal is dropped into the notch during the operation in a very few minutes redhot powdery ashes commence to work up out of the notch which falling on a small heap of tow or of dry towlike bark or lint or cotton stuff is quickly blown into a flame the africans carry the drillstick which in shape and size is like an arrow in a quiver with their arrows and the fireblocka stick three inches long and one in diameter of a different woodas a pendant to their necklace   a plan more practicable to an unpractised hand is that in use among some of the north american indians i copy the illustration of it from schoolcrafts work upon those people  one person works the drillstick with a rude bow and with his other hand holds a piece of stone or of wood above it both to steady it and to give the requisite pressuregentle at first and increasing judiciously up to the critical moment when the fire is on the point of bursting out another man puts his hands on the lower piece of wood the fireblock to steady it and holds a piece of tinder ready to light it as soon as fire is produced if a serious emergency should occur it is by no means hopeless to obtain fire after this method a large party have considerable advantages over only one or two men because as the work is fatiguing the men can undertake it in turns and again as considerable knack is required for success it is much more probable that one man out of many should succeed than that only one man taken at hazard should do so but the best plan of all for a party of three or more men is for one of them to hold the upper block another to hold the lower block and the tinder should there be any and the third man to cause the drillstick to rotate he will effect this best by dispensing with the bow and by simply using a string or thong of a yard or four feet long he makes one or two turns with the string round the drillstick and then holding one end of the string in either hand he saws away with all his force i believe that a party of three men furnished with dry wood of an appropriate quality and plenty of string would surely produce smoke on the first few trials but that they would fail in producing fire if however they had a couple of hours leisure to master the knack of working these sticks i think they would succeed in producing fire before the end of that time the period of time necessary for a successful operation is from one to three minutes it is of little use fatiguing yourself with sustaining the exertion for a longer period at a time unless the wood becomes continuously hotter as soon as the temperature remains uniform it shows that you have let the opportunity slip it is then the best economy of effort to desist at once to rest to take breath and recommence with fresh vigour  sketch unlabelled  fire by chemical meansit is not in the province of this book to describe the various matches that take fire by dipping them into compositions and i have already spoken of lucifermatches in the last section only one source of fire remains to be noticed it is  spontaneous combustionit is conceivable that the property which masses of greasy rags and suchlike matter possess of igniting when left to themselves might under some circumstances be the only means available to procure fire it is at all events well that this property should be borne in mind when warehousing stores in order to avoid the risk of their taking fire any oil mixed with a hatful of shavings tow cotton wool or rags heaped together will become very hot in one two or more days and will ultimately burst into flame the rapidity of the process is increased by warmth  tindergeneral remarksthere are two divisions of tinder those that are of a sufficiently strong texture to admit of being grasped in the hand and those that are so friable as to require a box to hold them in the first division a are the followingamadon a roll of rag a cotton lampwick a roll of touchpaper a mass of hair of certain plants and a long string of pith sewed up in a sheath to ignite these we must hold them as in fig 1 and use the steel to strike downwards upon the flint in the second division b aretinder of burnt rags tinder of any kind with grains of gunpowder strewed over it and touchwood all these require tinderboxes as explained below there are also many other substances belonging to both divisions of tinder in use a traveller should inform himself about those peculiar to the country that he visits   a amacou punk or german tinder is made from a kind of fungus or mushroom that grows on the trunks of old oaks ashes beeches etc many other kinds of fungus and i believe all kinds of puffballs will also make tinder it should be gathered in august or september and is prepared by removing the outer bark with a knife and separating carefully the spongy yellowish mass that lies within it this is cut into thin slices and beaten with a mallet to soften it till it can easily be pulled asunder between the fingers it is then boiled in a strong solution of saltpetre  a roll of ragcotton rag will easily take fire from the spark from a flint in a very dry climate if well struck it must be rolled up moderately tight so as to have the end of the roll fluffy the rag having been torn not cut a rag rolled in this way is not bad tinder if the sparks are strong and one commences to blow it the instant one of the fibres is seen to be alight if its fluffy end be rubbed into a little dry gunpowder its property as tinder is greatly improved   cotton lampwicka piece of it drawn through a tin tube to shield the previously charred part from being rubbed off is excellent in dry climates see fig 1 p 180  touchpaper is merely paper dipped in a solution of saltpetre or what comes to nearly the same thing and is somewhat better paper smeared with damp gunpowder until it is blackened some grains of uncrushed gunpowder should be left adhering to the paper and a few more should be allowed to lie loosely upon it unsized paper like that out of a blottingbook is the best suited for making into touchpaper paper is rendered unsized by being well soaked and washed in water see next paragraph  saltpetre for tinderin all cases the presence of saltpetre makes tinder burn more hotly and more fiercely and saltpetre exists in such great quantities in the ashes of many plants as tobacco dill maize sunflower that these can be used just as they are in the place of it thus if the ashes of a cigar be well rubbed into a bit of paper they convert it into touchpaper so will gunpowder for out of four parts of it three are saltpetre damaged gunpowder may be used for making touchpaper if it be an object to prepare a store of tinder a strong solution of saltpetre in water should be obtained and the paper or rags or fungus dipped into it and hung to dry this solution may be made by pouring a little water on a charge of gunpowder or on the ashes abovementioned which will dissolve the saltpetre out of them boiling water makes a solution fortyfold stronger than icecold water and about eight times stronger than water at 60 degrees fahr  hair of plantsthe silky down of a particular willow s lanata was used by the esquimaux with whom dr kane had intercourse and the botanist dr lindley once informed me that he had happened to receive a piece of peculiarly excellent tinder that was simply the hair of a treefern the gomuti tinder of the eastern archipelago is the hair of a palm  pithmany kinds of pith are remarkable as tinders that whence the wellknown pith hats are made is used as tinder in india pieces of pith are often sewn round with thin cotton or silk so as to form a long cord like the cotton lampwick i have described above and they are carried in tubes for the same reason  b we now come to the different kinds of tinder that fall into our second division namely those that are too friable to bear handling  ragscharred linen rags make the tinder that catches fire most easily that burns most hotly when blown upon and smoulders most slowly when left to itself of any kind of tinder that is generally to be obtained in making it the rags are lighted and when in a blaze and before they are burnt to white ashes the flame is stifled out it is usual to make this kind of tinder in the box intended to hold it but it can easily be made on the ground in the open air by setting light to the rag and dropping pinches of sand upon the flaming parts as soon as it is desired to quench them the sand is afterwards brushed away and the tinder gently extricated  touchwood is an inferior sort of tinder but is always to be met with in woody countries  dry dungdry and powdered cattle dungespecially horsedungwill take a spark but with trouble after it is lighted it can be kept burning with little difficulty  tinderboxesthere are three ways of striking a flint which are best explained by sketches fig 1 p 180 shows how tinder that is tough enough to bear handling is grasped together with the flint when no tinderbox is at hand the more friable kinds of tinder as touchwood may be enveloped in a roll of rag and be used either as in fig 1 or in fig 3 fig 2 shows how tinder may be laid on the ground and how sparks may be struck upon it the household tinderboxes of thirty years ago before lucifers were invented were for use in this way fig 3 shows how sparks may be struck into a small tinderbox it is the method most commonly adopted by travellers for instance it is universally used in south africa and in north america a hollow cylinder of wood or metal about three inches long and corked up at one end is all that is essential if it be barrelshaped the flint lies against its sides at the most convenient angle for striking sparks into the box as is shown by the bottom drawing of fig 3  fig 2 and 3 as described  wet weatherin longcontinued soaking weather the best way of keeping a tinderbox dry is to put it into a small pocket hung close under the armpit  fuelfirewoodthere is a knack in finding firewood it should be looked for under bushes the stump of a tree that is rotted nearly to the ground has often a magnificent root fit to blaze throughout the night  dry cattledungthe dry dung of cattle and other animals as found on the ground is very generally used throughout the world in default of better fuel and there is nothing whatever objectionable in employing it the canadians call it by the apt name of bois de vache in north and south africa it is frequently used throughout a large part of armenia and of thibet the natives rely entirely upon it there is a great convenience in this sort of fuel because as it is only in camps that fuel is wanted so it is precisely at old encampingplaces that cattledung is abundantly found  bonesanother remarkable substitute for firewood is bones a fact which mr darwin was i believe the first to mention the bones of an animal when freshly killed make good fuel and even those of cooked meat and such as have been exposed to the air for some days will greatly increase the heat of a scanty fire their smell is not disagreeable it is simply that of roast or burnt meat in the falkland islands where firewood is scarce it is not unusual to cook part of the meat of a slaughtered bull with its own bones when the fire is once started with a few sticks it burns well and hotly the flame of course depends on the fat within the bones and therefore the fatter the animal the better the fire during the russian campaign in 1829 the troops suffered so severely from cold at adrianople that the cemeteries were ransacked for bones for fuel moltke in the appendix  seaweed makes a hot though not a cheerful fire it is largely used the vraic or seaweed gatherers of the channel islands are represented in many picturesque sketches the weed is carted home spread out and dried  peattravellers must bear in mind that peat will burn especially as the countries in which it is found are commonly destitute of firewood and besides that are marshy cold and aguish  charcoal is frequently carried by travellers in sacks they use a prepared charcoal in the east which is made in the form of very large buttons that are carried strung together on a string an indian correspondent informs me that they are made by mixing powdered charcoal with molasses in the proportion of ten to one or thereabouts rolling the mass into balls and drying them in the sun a single ball is called a gul they are used for igniting hookhas they are also burnt inside the smoothingiron used by washermen in order to heat it the juice or sap of many plants would probably answer the purpose of molasses in their preparation  small fuel for lighting the fireshreds and fibresthe live spark has to be received and partly enclosed in a loose heap or nest of finelyshredded fuel the substances for making such a nest are one or other of the following list  dry grass of the finest kinds leaves moss lichen and wild cotton stalks or bark broken up and rubbed small between the fingers peat or cattledung pulverised paper that has been doubled up in many folds and then cut with a sharp knife into the finest possible shavings tow or what is the same thing oakum made by unravelling rope or string and scrapings and fine shavings from a log of wood the shreds that are intended to touch the live spark should be reduced to the finest fibre the outside of the nest may be of coarser but still of somewhat delicate material  cook should collect themit is the duty of a cook when the time of encamping draws near to get down from his horse and to pick up as he walks along a sufficiency of dry grass little bits of wood and the like to start a fire which he should begin to make as soon as ever the caravan stops the fire ought to be burning and the kettle standing by its side by the time that the animals are caught and are ready to be offpacked  small sticksthere should be abundance of small sticks and if neither these nor any equivalent for them are to be picked up the traveller should split up his larger firewood with his knife in order to make them it is a wise economy of time and patience to prepare plenty of these otherwise it will occasionally happen that the whole stock will be consumed and no fire made then the traveller must recommence the work from the very beginning under the disadvantage of increasing darkness i have made many experiments myself and have seen many novices as well as old campaigners try to make fires and have concluded that to ensure success the traveller should be provided with small bundles of sticks of each of the following sizes1st size of lucifermatch 2nd of lead pencil 3rd smaller than little finger 4th size of forefinger 5th stout stakes  in wet weather the most likely places to find wherewithal to light a fire are under large stones and other shelter but in soaking wet weather little chips of dry wood can hardly be procured except by cutting them with an axe out of the middle of a log the fire may then be begun as the late admiral the hon c murray well recommended in his travels in north america in the fryingpan itself for want of a dry piece of ground  to kindle a spark into a flameby whirling1st arrange the fuel into logs into small fuel assorted as described above and into shreds and fibres 2nd make a loose nest of the fibre just like a sparrows nest in shape and size and let the finer part of the fibres be inwards 3rd drop the lighted tinder in the next 4th holding the nest quite loosely in the halfclosed hand whirl the outstretched arm in vertical circles round the shoulderjoint as indicated by the dotted line in the diagram in 30 seconds or about 40 revolutions it will begin to glow and will shortly after burst out in a grand flame 5th drop it and pile small twigs round it and nurse the young fire carefully bearing in mind the proverb that small sticks kindle a flame but large ones put it out   by blowingsavages usually kindle the flame by blowing at the live spark and feeding it with little bits of stick just so much as is necessary but it is difficult to acquire the art of doing this well and i decidedly recommend the plan i have described in the foregoing paragraph in preference to it when the wind blowssteadily and freshly it suffices to hold up the nest against the wind  sulphur matches are so very useful to convert a spark into a flame and they are so easily made in any quantity out of split wood straw etc if the traveller will only take the trouble of carrying a small lump of sulphur in his baggage that they always ought to be at hand the sulphur is melted on a heated stone or in an old spoon bit of crockery bit of tin with a dent made in it or even a piece of paper and the points of the pieces of wood dipped in the molten mass a small chip of sulphur pushed into the cleft end of a splinter of wood makes a fair substitute for a match see lucifermatches  camp fireslarge logsthe principle of making large logs to burn brightly is to allow air to reach them on all sides and yet to place them so closely together that each supports the combustion of the rest a common plan is to make the fire with three logs whose ends cross each other as in the diagram the dots represent the extent of the fire as the ends burn away the logs are pushed closer together another plan is to lay the logs parallel with the burning ends to the windward then they continue burning together   in the pineforests of the north at winter time it is usual to fell a large tree and cutting a piece six or eight feet long off the large end to lay the thick short piece upon the long one which is left lying on the ground having previously cut flat with the axe the sides that come in contact and notched them so as to make the upper log lie steady the chips are then heaped in between the logs and are set fire to the flame runs in between them and the heat of each log helps the other to burn it is the work of nearly an hour to prepare such a fire but when made it lasts throughout the night in all cases one or two great logs are far better than many small ones as these burn fast away and require constant looking after many serious accidents occur from a large log burning away and toppling over with a crash sending a volley of blazing cinders among the sleeping party savages are always getting burnt and we should take warning from their carelessness sometimes they find a single scathed tree without branches which they have no means of felling this they set fire to as it stands and when all have fallen off to sleep the tree tumbles down upon them indeed savages are seldom free from scars or severe burns they are so cold during the night that they cannot endure to be an inch further from the fire than necessary and consequently as they turn about in their sleep often roll into it  diagram as described following  logs to cut up with a small axe or knife   let a o be the log cut two notches 1 2 on opposite sides hold the log by the end a and strike the end violently against the ground the piece o 1 2 will fly off then make the cut 3 on the side opposite to 2 and again strike and the piece 1 2 3 will fly off so again with cut 4 etc peal  brushwoodif in a country where any a number of small sticks and no large logs can be collected as firewood the best plan is to encamp after the manner of the ovampos these as they travel collect sticks each man his own faggot and when they stop each takes eight or nine stones as large as bricks or larger and sets them in a circle and within these he lights up his little fire now the party make their fireplaces close together in two or more parallel lines and sleep in between them the stones prevent the embers from flying about and doing mischief and also after the fires have quite burnt out they continue to radiate heat  charcoalif charcoal be carried a small chafingdish or other substitute for a fireplace ought also be taken

happen to pass by which will blaze up and give a new life to the brand    food   the nutritive elements of foodmany chemists have applied themselves in recent years to discover the exact percentage of nutriment contained in different substances and to determine the minimum nutriment on which human life can be supported the results are not very accordant but nevertheless a considerable approximation to truth has been arrived at it is now possible to tell whether a proposed diet has any great faults of excess or deficiency and how to remedy those faults but it also must be recollected that the stomach is an assimilating machine of limited performance and must be fed with food that it can digest it is not enough that the food should contain nutritious matter if that matter should be in an indigestible form burke and wills perished from sheer inability to digest the seeds upon which the australian savages lived and gardiners party died of starvation in tierra del fuego because they could not digest the shellfish which form a common article of diet of the natives of that country the question of diet must then be limited to food that is perfectly digestible by the traveller it remains to learn how much nourishment is contained in different kinds of digestible food dr smith has recently written an elaborate essay on this subject applying his inquiries chiefly to the food of the poor in england but for my more general purpose as it is impossible to do justice to a large and imperfectly understood subject in the small space i can give to it it will be better that i should reprint the results given in my previous edition these are principally extracted from a remarkable paper by dr christison inserted in the bluebook report of the commission of inquiry on crimean matters in which the then faulty dietary of our soldiers was discussed it appears 1st that a man of sedentary life can exist in health on seventeen ounces per day of real nutriment that a man engaged in active life requires fully twentyeight ounces per day and during severe labour he requires thirty ounces or even more 2ndly that this nutriment must consist of threequarters by weight of one class of nutritive principles c and one quarter of another class of nutritive principles n 3rdly that all the articles of common food admit of being placed as below in a table by which we see at a glance how much nutriment of class c and how much of class n is found in 100 parts gross weight of any of them thus by a simple computation the effective value of a dietary may be ascertained class c are the carboniferous principles that maintain respiration class n are the nitrogenous principles that repair waste of tissue n will partly replace c but at a great waste c will not replace n  a large number of diets such as those of various armies and navies of prisons and infirmaries and of the ordinary diets of different classes of people have been examined by aid of this table with surprisingly uniform results but these diets chiefly refer to temperate climates it would therefore be a matter of great interest if travellers in distant lands would accurately observe and note down the weight of their own rations and those of the natives it is a great desideratum to know the lightest portable food suitable to different countries any such reports if carefully made and extending over a period of not less than two months would be very acceptable to me to make them of any use it is necessary that every article consumed should be noted down and that the weight and state of health at the beginning and at the end of the period should be compared   table showing the quantity of nutriment contained in different articles of diet  articles of diet        c                 n total real

to travel exceedingly well on unusually scanty diets  food suitable for the stores of travellersthe most portable kind of food is unquestionably the flesh of cattle for the beasts carry themselves the draught oxen used in african and australian explorations serve as a last resource when all other food is wanting  it has been truly remarked with reference to australian exploring expeditions that if an exploring party would make up their minds to eat horseflesh stores of provisions might be largely dispensed with a few extra horses could be taken and one shot occasionally and its flesh dried and slightly salted sufficiently to preserve it from becoming tainted before the men could consume it  portable foodthe kinds of food that are the most portable in the ordinary sense of the term arepemmican meatbiscuit fried meat dried fish wheat flour biscuit oatmeal barley peas cheese sugar preserved potatoes and chollets compressed vegetables extract of meat as i am assured by the highest physiological authors is not a portable food but a portable savour it is quite impossible that life should be maintained on any minute amount of material because so many grains of carbon and so many of nitrogen are daily consumed and an equivalent weight of those elements must of course be replaced salt meat is not to be depended upon for it is liable to become hard and worthless by long keeping  pemmican general remarksof all food usually carried on expeditions none is so complete in itself nor contains so large a proportion of nutriment as pemmican it is especially useful to those who undergo severe work in cold and rainy climates it is the mainstay of arctic expeditions whether on water by sledge or on foot but though excellent to men who are working laboriously it is distasteful to others  pemmican is a mixture of about fiveninths of pounded dry meat to fourninths of melted or boiled grease it is put into a skin bag or tin can whilst warm and soft the grease ought not to be very warm when poured on the dry meat wild berries are sometimes added the skin bags for the pemmican should be shaped like pillow not bolster cases for the convenience of packing on horseback the pemmican is chopped out with an axe when required  i do not know if it can be bought anywhere in england it was usually prepared in the government yards at deptford when made for the arctic expeditions it is largely used in the hudsons bay territory a traveller who desired to furnish himself with pemmican might procure his supplies from thence  pemmican as made in englandsir john richardson describes in his narrative the preparation of the pemmican that he took with him in his last journey the following is a r√©sum√© of what he saysthe meat used was round of beef the fat and membranous parts were pared away it was then cut into thin slices which were dried in a maltkiln over an oakwood fire till they were quite dry and friable then they were ground in a malt mill after this process the powder resembled finelygrated meal it was next mixed with nearly an equal weight of melted beef suet or lard and the plain pemmican was made part of the pemmican was mixed with zante currants and another part with sugar both of these mixtures were much liked especially the latter the pemmican when complete cost at the rate of 1x u 12 d per pound but then the meat was only 6 34 d per pound it is dearer now the meat lost more than threequarters of its weight in drying he had 17424 lbs of pemmican in all it was made fromfresh beef 35641 lbs lard9 lbs currants3 lbs and sugar lbs  pemmican as made in the prairiemr ballantyne who was in the service of the hudsons bay company gives the following accounthaving shot a buffalo the hunters cut lumps of his flesh and slitting it up into flakes or layers hang it up in the sun or before a slow fire to dry and the fat can be dried as well as the lean in this state it is often made into packs and sent about the country to be consumed as dried meat it is often best relished raw for when grilled without fat it burns and becomes ashy but when pemmican is wanted it has to go through another process when dry the meat is

carrion is not noxious to starving menin reading the accounts of travellers who have suffered severely from want of food a striking fact is common to all namely that under those circumstances carrion and garbage of every kind can be eaten without the stomach rejecting it life can certainly be maintained on a revolting diet that would cause a dangerous illness to a man who was not compelled to adopt it by the pangs of hunger there is moreover a great difference in the power that different people possess of eating rank food without being made ill by it it appears that no flesh and very few

of the rankness lies in their skin or if unskinned they should be buried for some hours because earth absorbs the oil that makes them rank their breast and wings are the least objectionable parts and

abyssinians and others occasionally slicing out a piece of a live ox for food is sufficiently confirmed thus dr beke observes there could be no doubt of the fact he had questioned hundreds of natives on the subject and though at first they positively declared the statement to be a lie many on being more closely questioned admitted the possibility of its truth for they could not deny that cattle are frequently attacked by hyaenas whose practice is to leap on the animals from behind and at once begin devouring the hind quarters and yet if driven off in time the cattle have still livedtimes jan 167  it is reasonable enough that a small wornout party should adopt this plan when they are travelling in a desert where the absence of water makes it impossible to delay and when they are sinking for want of food if the ox were killed outright there would be material for one meal only because a wornout party would be incapable of carrying a load of flesh by the abyssinian plan the wounded beast continues to travel with the party carrying his carcase that is destined to be turned into butchers meat for their use at a further stage of course the idea is very revolting for the animal must suffer as much as the average of the tens or hundreds of wounded hares and pheasants that are always left among the bushes after an ordinary english battue to be sure the abyssinian plan should only be adopted to save human life  when i travelled in southwest africa at one part of my journey a plague of bushticks attacked the roots of my oxens tails their bites made festering sores which ended in

from poisonous ones but it has been observed that much the same thing suits the digestion of a bird that suits that of a man and therefore that a traveller who otherwise would make trials at haphazard ought to examine the contents of those birds crops that he may catch or shoot to give a clue to his experiments the rule has notable exceptions but in the absence of any other guide it is a very useful one  the only general rules that botany can give are vague and full of exceptions they are that a great many wholesome plants are found among the cruciferae or those whose petals are arranged like a maltese cross and that many poisonous ones are found amongst the umbelliferae  nettle and fernthere are two moderately nutritious plantsnettle and fernthat are found wild in very many countries and therefore the following extract from messrs hue and gabets travels in thibet may be of servicewhen the young stems of ferns are gathered quite tender before they are covered with down and while the first leaves are bent and rolled up in themselves you have only to boil them in pure water to realise a dish of delicious asparagus we would also recommend the nettle which in our opinion might be made an advantageous substitute for spinach indeed more than once we proved this by our own experience the nettle should be gathered quite young when the leaves are perfectly tender the plant should be pulled up whole with a portion of the root in order to preserve your hands from the sharp biting liquid which issues from the points you should wrap them in linen of close texture when once the nettle is boiled it is perfectly innocuous and this vegetable so rough in its exterior becomes a very delicate dish we were able to enjoy this delightful variety of esculents for more than a month then the little tubercles of the fern became hollow and horny and the stems themselves grew as hard as wood while the nettle armed with a long white beard p 203 presented only a menacing and awful aspect the roots of many kinds of ferns perhaps of all of them are edible our poor in england will eat neither fern nor nettle they say the first is innutritious and the second acrid i like them both  seaweedseveral kinds of seaweed such as laver and irish moss are eatable  cooking utensilscookery booksa book on cooking is of no use at all in the rougher kinds of travel for all its recipes consist of phrases such as take a pound of soandso half a pound of something else a pinch of this and a handful of that now in the bush a man has probably none of these thingshe certainly has not all of themand therefore the recipe is worthless  pots and kettlescooking apparatus of any degree of complexity and of very portable shapes can be bought at all military outfitters but for the bush and travelling roughly nothing is better than a light roomy iron pot and a large strong tin kettle it is disagreeable to make tea in the same pot that meat is boiled in besides if you have only one vessel it takes a longer time to prepare meals if possible take a second small tin kettle both as a reserve against accidents and for the convenience of the thing an iron pot whose lid is the size of the crown of a hat cooks amply enough for three persons at a time and can without much inconvenience be made to do double duty and therefore the above articles would do for six men an iron pot should have very short legs or some blow will break one of them off and leave a hole iron kettles far outwear tin ones but the comparative difficulty of making them boil and their great weight are very objectionable a good tin kettle carefully cherished and it is the interest of the whole party to watch over its safety lasts many months in the bush copper is dangerous but the recipe is given further on for tinning copper vessels when they require it have the handle of the kettle notched or bored near the place where it joins the body of the kettle so as to give a holding by which the lid may be tied tightly down then if you stuff a wisp of grass into the spout the kettle will carry water for a journey  damaged potsa pot or kettle with a large hole in its bottom filled up with a piece of wood has been made to boil water by burying it a little way in the earth and making the fire round it a hole in the side of a pot can be botched up with clay or wood so as not to leave it altogether useless  substitutes for pots and kettlesit is possible to boil water over a slow fire in many kinds of vessels that would be destroyed by a greater degree of heat in bark wooden skin and even paper vessels it is quite possible to boil water the ruder tribes of the indian archipelago use a bamboo to boil their rice the green cane resisting the fire sufficiently long for the cooking of one mass of rice crawfurd if however you have no vessel that you choose to expose to the risk of burning you must heat stones and drop them into the water it contains but sandstones especially are apt to shiver and make grit the dacota indians and very probably other tribes also used to boil animals in their own hide the description runs thus they stuck four stakes in the ground and tied the four corners of the hide up to them leaving a hollow in the middle three or four gallons of water and the meat cut up very fine were then put in three or four hot stones each the size of a 6lb cannonshot cooked the whole into a good soup to a fastidious palate the soot dirt and ashes that are usually mixed up with the soup are objectionable but these may be avoided by a careful cook who dusts and wipes the stones before dropping them in the specific heat of stone is much less than that of water so that the heating power of a measure of stone is only about onehalf of that of an equal measure of equally

thibet they are cut out of the knots that are found in timber  spoonsit is easy to replace a lost spoon by cutting a new one out of hard wood or by making one of horn see horn  fireplaces for cookingthe most elementary fireplace consists of three stones in a triangle to support the pot if stones are not procurable three piles of mud or three stakes or greenwood driven into the earth are an equivalent small recesses neatly cut in a bank one for each fireplace are much used when the fuel is dry and well prepared a more elaborate plan is to excavate a shallow saucerlike hole in the ground a foot or eighteen inches in diameter and kneading the soil so excavated into a circular wall with a doorway in the windward side the upper surface is curved so as to leave three pointed turrets upon which the cookingvessel rests as in the sketch thus the wind enters at the doorway and the flames issue through the curved depressions at the top and lick round the cookingvessel placed above the wall is sometimes built of stones   trenches and holesin cooking for a large party with a small supply of fuel either dig a narrow trench above which all the pots and kettles may stand in a row and in which the fire is madethe mouth being open to the wind and a small chimney built at the other endor else dig a round hole one foot deep and place the pots in a ring on its edge half resting on the earth and half overlapping the hole a space will remain in the middle of them and through this the fire must be fed  esquimaux lampthe cooking of the esquimaux is wholly effected by stone lamps with wicks made of moss which are so carefully arranged that the flame gives little or no smoke their lamps vary in size from one foot and a half long to six inches each of the bits of moss gives a small but very bright flame the lamp is all in all to the esquimaux it dries their clothes and melts the snow for their drinkingwater its construction is very ingenious without it they could not have inhabited the arctic regions  ovensbedouin ovendig a hole in the ground wall and roof it with stones leaving small apertures in the top they make a roaring fire in and about the oven the roof having been temporarily removed for the purpose and when the stones including those of the roof have become very hot sweep away the ashes and strew the inside of the oven with grass or leaves taking care that whatever is used has no disagreeable taste else it would be communicated to the flesh then put in the meat it is a common plan to sew it up in its own skin which shields it from dust and at the same time retains its juices from evaporating now replace the roof a matter of some difficulty on account of the stones being hot and therefore requiring previous rehearsal lastly make the fire again over the oven and let the baking continue for some hours an entire sheep can be baked easily in this way the same process is used for baking vegetables except with the addition of pouring occasionally boiling water upon them through the roof  golddiggers oventhe figure represents a section of the oven a hole or deep notch is dug into the side of a bank and two flat stones are slid horizontally like shelves into grooves made in the sides of the hole as shown in the figure where it will be observed that the uppermost stone does not quite reach to the face of the bank and that the lowermost stone does not quite reach to the back of the hole a fire of redhot embers is placed on the floor of the hole and the bread about to be baked is laid upon the lowermost stone lastly another flat stone is used to close the mouth of the oven it is set with its edge on the floor of the hole it leans forward with the middle of its face resting against the front edge of the lowermost stone a narrow interval being left between its top and the edge of the uppermost stone this interval serves as a vent to the hot air from the embers which takes the course shown in the figure the oven should be thoroughly heated before the bread is put in   baking between two stonesfor baking slices of meat or thin cakes it is sufficient to lay one large stone above another with a few pebbles between to prevent them from touching next make a large fire about the stones until they are thoroughly hot then sweep away the embers and insert the slices  ant hills as ovenswhere there are no stones of which ovens may be built and where there are old whiteant hills the natives commonly dig holes in the sides of the ant hills and use them for that purpose  clay ovensi have heard of a very neat construction built with clay in which grass had been kneaded a fire was lit inside to dry the work as it progressed while the builder placed rings of clay in tiers one above the other until a complete dome was made without mould or framework time was allowed for each ring to dry sufficiently before the next one was added  baking beneath a camp firea small piece of meat enough for four or five people can be baked by simply scraping a tolerably deep hole under the bivouac fire putting in the meat rolled in the skin to which it is attached and covering it with earth and fire it is a slow process of cooking for it requires many hours but the meat when done is soft and juicy and the skin gelatinous and excellent  meat previously wrapped up in paper or cloth may be baked in a clay case in any sort of pit or oven well covered over and with good economy handbook of field service  baking in potsa capital oven is improvised by means of two earthen or metal cookingpots of which one is placed on the fire and in it the article to be baked the other pot is put upon its top as a cover and in it a shovelful of redhot embers  bush cookerytough meathammer it well between two stones before putting it on the fire and again when it is half cooked to separate the fibres i have often seen people save themselves much painful mastication by hammering at each separate piece of meat before putting it in their mouths  rank meati have spoken of this in another section p 200  kabobsbroil the ribbones or skewer your iron ramrod through a dozen small lumps of meat and roast them this is the promptest way of cooking meat but men on hard work are not satisfied with a diet of nothing else but tough roasted flesh they crave for succulent food such as boiled or baked meat  salt meat to prepare hurriedlywarm it slightly on both sidesthis makes the salt draw to the outsidethen rinse it well in a pannikin of water this process extracts a large part of the salt and leaves the meat more fit for cooking  haggishearne the north american traveller recommends a haggis made with blood a good quantity of fat shred small some of the tenderest of the flesh together with the heart and lungs cut or town into small skivers all of which is put into the stomach and roasted by being suspended before the fire with a string care must be taken that it does not get too much heat at first or it will burst it is a most delicious morsel even without pepper salt or any seasoning  theory of teamakingi have made a number of experiments on the art of making good tea we constantly hear that some people are good and others bad teamakers that it takes a long time to understand the behaviour of a new teapot and so forth and lastly that good tea cannot be made except with boiling water now this latter assertion is assuredly untrue because if tea be actually boiled in water an emetic and partly poisonous drink is the certain result i had a tin lid made to my teapot a short tube passed through the lid and in the tube was a cork through a hole in which a thermometer was fitted that enabled me to learn the temperature of the water in the teapot at each moment thus provided i continued to make my tea as usual and to note down what i observed in the first place after warming the teapot in the ordinary way the fresh boiling water that was poured into it sank invariably to under 200 degrees fahr it was usually 180 degrees so great was the amount of heat abstracted by the teapot i also found that my teapotit was a crockery oneallowed the water within it to cool down at the rate of about 2 degrees per minute when the pot was filled afresh of course the temperature of its contents rose afresh and by the addition of water two or three times repeated i obtained a perfect mastery over the temperature of the pot within reasonable limits now after numerous days in which i made tea according to my usual method but measuring strictly the quantity of leaves and recording the times and the temperature and noting the character of tea produced then taking as my type of excellence tea that was full bodied full tasted and in no way bitter or flat i found that this was only produced when the water in the teapot had remained between 180¬∫ and 190 degrees fahr and had stood eight minutes on the leaves it was only necessary for me to add water once to the tea to ensure this temperature bitterness was the certain result of greater heat or of longer standing and flatness was the result of colder water if the tea did not stand for so long a time as eight minutes it was not ripe it was not full bodied enough the palate becomes far less fastidious about the quality of the second cup other people may like tea of a different character from that which i do myself but be that as it may all people can i maintain ensure uniformity of good tea such as they best like by attending to the principle of making itthat is to say to time and quantities and temperature there is no other mystery in the teapot  tea made in the kettlewhere there are no cups or teapot put the leaves in the pot or kettle and drink through a reed with a wisp of grass in it as they do in paraguay if there are cups and no teapot the leaves may be put into the pot previously enclosed in a loose gauze or muslin bag to prevent their floating about a contrivance is sold in the shops for this purpose it is made of metal gauze and shaped like an egg a purse made of metal rings would be better for it would pack flat but the advantage of muslin over metal apparatus is that you may throw away bag and all and avoid the trouble of cleaning   tea made in tin mugsa correspondent assures me that he considers the australian plan of making tea to be preferable to any other for travellers and explorers as it secures that the tea shall be made both well and quickly and without the necessity of carrying kettles on horseback each person has a common tin quart pot and a pint pot slung to his saddle the tea and sugar are carried in small bags the quart pot requires very little fire to make it boil when it begins to boil it is taken from the fire the tea is dropped in and the pint pot is placed on its top as a cover when the tea is ready the sugar is dropped into the pint and the tea is poured from one pot to the other till it is mixed the pint is always kept clean for drinking out of but not the quart for the blacker it is the sooner will the water boil  tea made over nightto prepare tea for a very early breakfast make it over night and pour it away from the tealeaves into another vessel it will keep perfectly well for it is by long standing with the tealeaves that it becomes bitter in the morning simply warm it up tea is drunk at a temperature of 140 degrees fahr or 90 degrees above an average night temperature of 50 degrees it is more than twice as easy to raise the temperature up to 140 than to 212 degrees letting alone the trouble of teamaking  extract of tea and coffeedr rae speaks very highly of the convenience of extract of tea any scientific chemist could make it but he should be begged to use firstrate tea the extract from firstrate tea makes a very drinkable infusion but that from secondrate tea is not good the drink made from the extract always a grade inferior to that made directly from the leaves by pouring a small quantity of the extract into warm water the tea is made and though inferior in taste to properly made tea it has an equally good effect on the digestion  extract of coffee is well known i believe it can be made of very good quality but what is usually sold seems to me to be very much the contrary and not to be wholesome  tea and coffee without hot waterin unyoro sir s baker says they have no idea of using coffee as a drink but simply chew it raw as a stimulant in chinese tartary travellers who have no means of making a cup of tea will chew the leaves as a substitute mr atkinson told me how very grateful he had found this makeshift    water for drinking   general remarksin most of those countries where travelling is arduous it is the daily care of an explorer to obtain water for his own use and for that of his caravan should he be travelling in regions that are for the most part arid and rarely visited by showers he must look for his supplies in ponds made by the drainage of a large extent of country or in those left here and there along the beds of partly driedup watercourses or in fountains if he be unsuccessful in his search or when the dry season of the year has advanced and all water has disappeared from the surface of the land there remains no alternative for him but to dig wells where there are marks to show that pools formerly lay or where there are other signs that wellwater may be obtained  short stagesi may here remark that it is a good general rule for an explorer of an arid country when he happens to come to water after not less than three hours travelling to stop and encamp by it it is better for him to avail himself of his good fortune and be content with his days work than to risk the uncertainty of another supply  purity of wateringplacesmake no litter by the side of wateringplaces and encourage among your party the mahomedan feeling of respect for preserving the purity of drinkingwater old travellers commonly encamp at a distance from the wateringplace and fetch the water to their camp  signs of the neighbourhood of waterthe quick intelligence with which experienced travellers discover wateringplaces is so great that it might almost be mistaken for an instinct  intelligence of dogs and cattledogs are particularly clever in finding water and the fact of a dog looking refreshed and it may be wet has often and often drawn attention to a pond that would otherwise have been overlooked and passed by cattle are very uncertain in their intelligence sometimes oxen go for miles and miles across a country unknown to them straight to a pond of water at other times they are most obtuse dr leichhardt the australian traveller was quite astonished at their stupidity in this respect  trees and ordinary vegetation are not of much help in directing a traveller to water for they thrive on dew or on occasional rain but it is otherwise when the vegetation is unusually green or luxuriant or when the vegetation is unusually green or luxuriant or when those trees are remarked that are seldom seen to grow except near water in the particular country visited as the blackthorntree in south africa  birdssome species of birds as waterfowl parrots and the diamond bird or animals as baboons afford surer promise but the converging flight of birds or the converging fresh tracks of animals is the most satisfactory sign of all it is about nightfall that desert birds usually drink and hence it often happens that the exhausted traveller abandoning all hope as the shades of evening close in has his attention arrested by flights of birds that give him new life and tell him where to go  tracksin tropical countries that have rainy and dry seasons it must be recollected that old paths of men or wild animals only mislead they go to dry ponds that were full at the time they were trodden but have since been abandoned on becoming exhausted  other signswellwater may be sought where the earth is still moist though arid all around or failing that where birds and wild animals have lately been scratching or where gnats hover in swarms  to find the springfrom the number of birds tracks and other signs travellers are often pretty sure that they are near water but cannot find the spring itself in this case the party should at once be spread out as skirmishers and the dogs cheered on  to probe for wellwaterit is unusual when no damp earth can be seen but where the place appears likely to yield wellwater to force an iron ramrod deep into the soil and if it bring up any grains that are moist to dig  pools of waterfor many days after there has been rain water is sure to be found among mountains however desert may be their appearance for not only does more wet fall upon them but the drainage is more perfect long after the ravines and streambeds are quite dry puddles and cupfuls of water will be found here and there along their courses in holes and chinks and under great stones which together form a sufficiency a sponge tied to the end of a stick will do good service in lapping these up  the sandy beds of watercourses in arid countries frequently contain pools of stagnant water but the places where these pools are to be found are not necessarily those where they have been found in preceding years the conditions necessary for the existence of a pool are not alone those of the rocky substratum of the riverbed but more especially the stratifications of mud and clay left after each flooding for instance an extensive bed of sand enclosed between two layers of clay would remain moist and supply wellwater during the dry season but a trivial variation in the force and amount of the current in different years might materially affect the place and the character of the deposition of these clay strata  in searching the beds of partly driedup watercourses the fact must never be forgotten that it is especially in little tributaries at the point where they fall into the main one that most water is to be found and the most insignificant of these should never be overlooked i presume that the bar which always accumulates in front of tributaries and is formed of numerous layers of alluvial deposit parallel to the bed of the great stream is very likely to have one at least of its layers of an impervious character if so the bar would shut in the wet sand of the tributary like a wall and prevent it from draining itself dry  when a riverbed has been long followed by a traveller and a frequent supply of water found along it in pools or even in wells say at every 5 or 10 milesthen should this riverbed appear to lose itself in a plain that is arid there is no reason why the traveller should be disheartened for on travelling further the water will be sure to be found again those plains being always green and grassy where the water in such riverbeds entirely disappears  by seashorefresh water is frequently to be found under the very sands of the seashore whither it has oozed underground from the upper country and where it overlies the denser salt water or else abuts against it if the compactness of the sand resists free percolation in very many places along the skirt of the great african desert fresh water is to be found by digging two or three feet  fountainsfountains in arid lands are as godsends they are far more numerous and abundant in limestone districts than in any others owing to the frequent fissures of those rocks therefore whenever limestone crops out in the midst of sand deserts a careful search should be made for water in granite and other primary rocks many but small springs are usually seen  the theory of ordinary fountains is simple enough and affords help in discovering them in a few words it is as followsall the water that runs from them has originally been supplied by rain dew or fogdamp falling on the face of the land and sinking into it but the subsoil and rocks below are far from being of a uniform character they are full of layers of every imaginable degree of sponginess strata of clay wholly impenetrable by water often divide beds of gravel that imbibe it freely there are also cracks that make continuous channels and dislocations that cause them to end abruptly and there are rents filled with various materials that may either give a free passage or entirely bar the underground course of water hence when water has sunk into the earth it does not by any means soak through it in an equable degree it is an easier matter for it to ooze many miles along a layer of gravel than to penetrate six inches into a layer of clay that may bound the gravel therefore whenever a porous earth or a fissured rock crops out to the light of day there is in ignorance of all other facts some chance of a spring being discovered in the lowest part of the outcrop a favourable condition for the existence of a large and permanent fountain is where a porous stratum spreads over a broad area at a high level and is prolonged by a gradually narrowing course to an outlet at a lower one the broad upper part of the stratum catches plenty of water during the wet season which sinks into the depths as into a reservoir and oozes out in a regular stream at its lower outlet a fissured rock makes a still easier channel for the water  fig 1 and fig 2  as examples of ordinary cases of fountains we will take those represented in the following figures fig i is a mountain fig 2 is a model made to explain more clearly the conditions represented in fig i it will be observed that there is a ravine r in front a line of fault l m n on its left side supposed to be filled with watertight rock and a valley v fig 1 on the extreme right the upper part of the mountain is supposed to be much more porous than its base and the plane which divides the porous from the nonporous rock to cut the surface of the mountain along the line a n m b c d e f the highest point of the plane is f and the lowest point a the effect of rain upon the model fig 2 would be to wet its upper half water would ooze out along the whole of the lines a n and m b c d e f and there would be a small fountain at a and a large one at m but in the actual mountain fig 1 we should not expect to find the same regularity as in the model the rind of the earth with its vegetation and weatherimpacted surface forms a comparatively impermeable envelope to the mountain not likely to be broken through except at a few places but ravines such as r would be probably denuded of their rind and there we should find a line of minute fountains at the base of the porous rock if there be no actual fountains there would at least be some vegetation that indicated dripping water thus the appearance is well known and often described of a ravine utterly bare of verdure above but clothed with vegetation below a sharply defined line whence the moisture proceeds that irrigates all beneath we should also be almost certain of finding a spring breaking forth near m or even near a but in the valley v we should only see a few signs of former moisture along e f such as bunches of vegetation upon the arid cliff or an efflorescence of salts whenever a traveller remarks these signs he should observe the inclination of the strata by which he would learn the position of m where the probability of finding water is the greatest in a very arid country the anatomy of the land is so manifest from the absence of mould that geological indications are peculiarly easy to follow  wellsdigging wellsin default of spades water is to be dug for with a sharppointed stick take it in both hands and holding it upright like a dagger stab and dig it in the ground as in fig 1 then clear out the loose earth with the hand as in fig 2 continue thus working with the stick and hand alternately and a hole as deep as the arm is easily made in digging a large hole or well the earth must be loosened in precisely the same manner handed up to the surface and carried off by means of a bucket or bag in default of a shovel and wheelbarrow  fig 1 and fig 2sketches of digging as described above  after digging deeply the sand will often be found just moist no water actually lying in the well but do not therefore be disheartened wait a while and the water will collect after it has once begun to ooze through the sides of the well it will continue to do so much more freely therefore on arriving at night with thirsty cattle at a well of doubtful character deepen it at once by torchlight that the water may have time to collect then the cattle may be watered in the early morning and sent to feed before the sun is hot  it often happens when digging wells in sandy watercourses that a little water is found and that below it is a stratum of clay now if the digging be continued deeper in hopes of more water the result is often most unfortunate for the clay stratum may prove extremely thin in which case the digging will pierce it then the water that had been seen will drain rapidly and wholly away to the utter discomfiture of the traveller  kerkarii am indebted to correspondents for an account of a method employed in the plains of the sikhim himalaya and in assam where it is called a kerkari also in lower bengal for digging deep holes the natives take a freshly cut bamboo say three inches in diameter they cut it just above one of the knots and then split the wood as far as to the next joint in about a dozen places and point the pieces somewhat the other end of the instrument should be cut slantingly to thrust into the earth and its other end is afterwards worked vertically with both hands  unlabelled figure of kerkari  the soft soil is thus forced into the hollow of the bamboo and spreads out its blades as is intended to be shown in the figure the bamboo is next withdrawn and the plug of earth is shaken out it is then reintroduced and worked up and down as before it is usual to drive a stake in the ground to act as a toothed comb to comb out the plug of earth mr peal writes from assami have just had 4 holes dug in the course of ordinary work in hard earth two men dug the holes in 1 12 hour they were 3 feet 6 inches deep and 6 inches in diameter i weighed the clay raised at each stroke in 4 consecutive strokes the weights were 1 14 lbs 1 34 lbs 1 34 lbs 2 lbs another trial gave 7 lbs lifted after 5 or 6 strokes according to the above data an assamese workman makes a hole 1 foot deep and 6 inches in diameter in 6 minutes holes 10 feet deep and 6 inches wide can be made as i am informed by this contrivance  protecting wellsthe following extract from bishop heber though hardly within the scope of the art of travel is very suggestive the wells of this country bhurtpoor india some of which are very deep are made in a singular manner they build a tower of masonry of the diameter required and 20 or 30 feet high from the surface of the ground this they allow to stand a year or more till its masonry is rendered firm and compact by time then they gradually undermine it and promote its sinking into the sandy soil which it does without difficulty and altogether when level with the surface they raise its walls higher and so go on throwing out the sand and raising the wall till they have reached the water if they adopted our method the soil is so light that it would fall on them before they could possibly raise the wall from the bottom nor without the wall could they sink to any considerable depth a stout square frame of wood scantling boarded like a sentrybox and of about the same size and shape but without top or bottom is used in making wells in america the sides of a well in sandy soil are so liable to fall in that travellers often sink a cask or some equivalent into the water when they are encamped for any length of time in its vicinity  scanty wells in hot climates should be brushed over when not in actual use to check their evaporation  snowwaterit is impossible for men to sustain life by eating snow or ice instead of drinking water they only aggravate the raging torments of thirst instead of assuaging them and hasten death among dogs the esquimaux is the only breed that can subsist on snow as an equivalent for water the arctic animals generally have the same power but as regards mankind some means of melting snow into water for the purposes of drinking is an essential condition of life in the arctic regions without the ingenious esquimaux lamp p 205 which consists of a circle of moss wicks fed by trainoil and chiefly used for melting snow the esquimaux could not exist throughout the year in the countries which they now inhabit  that eating large quantities of snow should seriously disturb the animal system is credible enough when we consider the very large amount of heat that must be abstracted from the stomach in order to melt it a mouthful of snow at 32 degrees fahr that is to say no colder than is necessary for it to be snow at all robs as much heat from the stomach as if the mouthful had been of water 143 degrees colder than icecold water if such a fluid may for the moment be imagined to exist for the latent heat of water is 143 degrees fahr in other words it takes the same quantity of heat to convert a mass of snow of 32 degrees into water of 32¬∫ as it does to raise the same mass of water from 32 degrees to 141¬∫  32 degrees  175 degrees fahr it takes in practice about as long to melt snow of a low temperature into water as it does to cause that same water to boil thus to raise snow of 5 degrees below zero fahr to 32 degrees takes 37 degrees of heat and it requires 143 degrees more or 180 degrees altogether to melt it into water also it requires 180 degrees to convert water of 32 degrees into water of 212 degrees in other words into boiling water  distilled waterit will take six or seven times as long to convert a kettle full of boilingwater into steam as it did to make that kettle boil for the latent heat of steam is 967 degrees fahr therefore if the water that was put into the kettle was 60 degrees it would require to be raised through 212 degrees60¬∫ degrees  152¬∫ degrees of temperature in order to make it begin to boil and it would require a further quantity of heat to the extent of 967 degrees  about 6 12 times 152 degrees to boil it all away hence it is of no use to attempt to distil until you have provided abundance of good firewood of a fit size to burn quickly and have built an efficient fireplace on which to set the kettle unfortunately fuel is commonly deficient in those places where there is a lack of fresh water  rate of distillationa drop per second is fully equivalent to an imperial pint of water in three hours or be an imperial gallon in an entire day and night  the simplest way to distil but a very imperfect one is to light a fire among stones near a hollow in a rock that is filled or can be filled with saltwater when the stones are redhot drop them one by one into it the water will hiss and give out clouds of vapour some of which may be collected in a cloth and wrung or sucked out of it in the same way a pot on the fire may have a cloth stretched over it to catch the steam  sketch of still as described below  still made with a kettle and gunbarrelthere is an account of the crew of the levant packet which was wrecked near the cosmoledo islands who supplied themselves with fresh water by means of distillation alone and whose still was contrived with an iron pot and a gunbarrel found on the spot where they were wrecked they procured on the average sixty bottles or ten gallons of distilled water in each twentyfour hours the iron pot was converted into a boiler to contain salt water a lid was fitted to it out of the root of a tree leaving a hole of sufficient size to receive the muzzle of the gunbarrel which was to set as a steampipe the barrel was run through the stump of a tree hollowed out in the middle and kept full of cold water for the purpose of condensation and the water so distilled escaped at the nipple of the gunbarrel and was conducted into a bottle placed to receive it the accompanying sketch is taken from a model which i made with a soldiers messtin for a boiler and a tin tube in the place of a gun barrel the knob represents the breech and the projection through which the water is dropping the nipple i may remark that there is nothing in the arrangement which would hurt the most highlyfinished gun barrel and that the trough which holds the condensing water may be made with canvas or even dispensed with altogether  condensing pipein default of other tubes a reed may be used one of the long

illustration i have indicated in the sketch by nothing more than a dotted line is made to stand upon the pot it serves as a support for a metal basin s which is filled with salt water and acts as a condenser when the pot boils the steam ascends and condenses itself on the under surface of the basin s whence it drops down and is collected in a cup c that is supported by a rude tripod of sticks t standing in the inside of the iron pot  occasional means of quenching thirsta shower of rain will yield a good supply the clothes may be stripped off and spread out and the rainwater sucked from them or when a storm is approaching a cloth or blanket may be made fast by its four corners and a quantity of bullets thrown in the middle of it they will cause the water that it receives to drain to one point and trickle through the cloth into a cup or bucket set below a reversed umbrella will catch water but the first drippings from it or from clothes that have been long unwashed as from a macintosh cloak are intolerably nauseous and very unwholesome it must be remembered that thirst is greatly relieved by the skin being wetted and therefore it is well for a man suffering from thirst to strip to

pure and sweet blood will stand in the stead of solid food but it is of no avail in the stead of water on account of its saline qualities  vegetable fluidsmany roots exist from which both natives and animals obtain a sufficiency of sap and pulp to take the place of water the traveller should inquire of the natives and otherwise acquaint himself with those peculiar to the country that he visits such as the roots which the eland eats the bitter watermelon etc  to purify water that is muddy or putridwith muddy water the remedy is to filter and to use alum if you have it with putrid to boil to mix with charcoal or expose to the sun and air or what is best to use all three methods at the same time when the water is salt or brackish nothing avails but distillation see distilled water p 218  to filter muddy waterwhen at the wateringplace there is little else but a mess of mud and filth take a good handful of grass or rushes and tie it roughly together in the form of a cone 6 or 8 inches long then dipping the broad end into the puddle and turning it up a streamlet of fluid will trickle down through the small end this excellent plan is used by the northern bushmenat their wells quantities of these bundles are found lying about anderson otherwise suck water through your handkerchief by putting it over the mouth of your mug or by throwing it on the gritty mess as it lies in the puddle for obtaining a copious supply the most perfect plan if you have means is to bore a cask full of auger holes and put another small one that has had the bottom knocked out inside it and then to fill the space between the two with grass moss etc sink the whole in the midst of the pond the water will run through the augerholes filter through the moss and rise in the inner cask clear of weeds and sand if you have only a single cask holes may be bored in the lower part of its sides and alternate layers of sand and grass thrown in till they cover the holes through these layers the water will strain or any coarse bag kept open with hoops made on the spot may be moored in the mud by placing a heavy stone inside it will act on the same principle but less efficiently than the casks sand charcoal sponge and wood are the substances most commonly used in properly constructed filters peat charcoal is excellent charcoal acts not only as a mechanical filter for solid impurities but it has the further advantage of absorbing putrid gases see below putrid water snow is also used as a filter in the arctic regions dr rae used to lay it on the water until it was considerably higher than its level and then to suck the water through the snow  alumturbid water is also in some way as yet insufficiently explained made clear by the indian plan of putting a piece of alum into it the alum appears to unite with the mud and to form a clayey deposit independently of the action it has an astringent effect upon organic matters it hardens them and they subside to the bottom of the vessel instead of being diffused in a glairy viscous state throughout the water no taste of alum remains in the water unless it has been used in great excess three thimblefuls of alum will clarify a bucketful of turbid water  putrid water should always be purified by boiling it together with charcoal or charred sticks as low fevers and dysenteries too often are the consequences of drinking it the mere addition of charcoal largely disinfects it bitter herbs if steeped in putrid water or even rubbed well about the cup are said to render it less unwholesome the indians plunge hot iron into putrid water  thirst to relievethirst is a fever of the palate which may be somewhat relieved by other means than drinking fluids  by exciting salivathe mouth is kept moist and thirst is mitigated by exciting the saliva to flow this can be done by chewing something as a leaf or by keeping in the mouth a bullet or a smooth nonabsorbent stone such as a quartz pebble  by fat or butterin australia africa and n america it is a frequent custom to carry a small quantity of fat or butter and to eat a spoonful at a time when the thirst is severe these act on the irritated membranes of the mouth and throat just as cold cream upon chapped hands  by salt waterpeople may live long without drinking if they have means of keeping their skin constantly wet with water even though it be salt or otherwise

good keep the whole body wet  small water vesselsgeneral remarks on carrying waterpeople drink excessively in hot dry climates as the evaporation from the skin is enormous and must be counterbalanced under these circumstances the daily ration of a european is at least two quarts to make an exploring expedition in such countries efficient there should be means of carrying at least one gallon of water for each white man and in unknown lands this quantity should be carried on from every wateringplace so long as means can possibly be obtained for carrying it and should be served out thustwo quarts on the first day in addition to whatever private store the men may have chosen to carry for themselves a quart and a half during the second day and half a quart on the morning of the third which will carry them through that day without distress besides watervessels sufficient for carrying what i have mentioned there ought to be others for the purpose of leaving water buried in the ground as a store for the return of a reconnoitring expedition also each man should be furnished with a small watervessel of some kind or other for his own use and should be made to take care of it  fill the watervesselsnever mind what the natives may tell you concerning the existence of water on the road believe nothing but resolutely determine to fill the girbas watervessels baker  small watervesselsno expedition should start without being fully supplied with these for no bushman however ingenious can make anything so efficient as casks tin vessels or macintosh bags  sketch of watervessel  a tin vessel of the shape shown in the sketch and large enough to hold a quart is i believe the easiest to carry the cleanest and the most durable of small watervessels the curve in its shape is to allow of its accommodating itself to the back of the man who carries it the tin loops at its sides are to admit the strap by which it is to be slung and which passes through the loops underneath the bottom of the vessel so that the weight may rest directly upon the strap lastly the vessel has a pipette for drinking through and a larger hole by which it is to be filled and which at other times is stopped with a cork or wooden plug when drinking out of the pipette the cork must be loosened in order to admit air like a vent hole macintosh bags for wine or water are very convenient to carry and they will remain watertight for a long period when fairly used memoil and grease are as fatal to macintosh as they are to iron rust but the taste that these vessels impart to their contents is abominable not only at first but for a very long time in twothirds of them it is never to be got rid of never believe shopkeepers in an indiarubber shop in their assurances to the contrary they are incompetent to judge aright for their senses seem vitiated by the air they live in the best shape for a small macintosh watervessel has yet to be determined several alpine men use them and their most recent patterns may probably best be seen at carters alpine outfitter oxford street a flask of dressed hide pig goat or dog with a wooden nozzle and a wooden plug to fit into it is very good canvas bags smeared with grease on the outside will become nearly waterproof after a short soaking a strong glass flask may be made out of a sodawater bottle it should have raw hide shrunk upon it to preserve it from sharp taps likely to make a crack calabashes and other gourds cocoanuts and ostrich eggs are all of them excellent for flasks the bushmen of south africa make great use of ostrich shells as watervessels they have stations at many places in the desert where they bury these shells filled with water corked with grass and occasionally waxed over they thus go without hesitation over wide tracts for their sense of locality is so strong that they never fear to forget the spot in which they have dug their hidingplace  when a dutchman or a namaqua wants to carry a load of ostrich eggs to or from the wateringplace or when he robs a nest he takes off his trousers ties up the ankles puts the eggs in the legs and carries off his load slung round his neck nay i have seen a halfcivilised hottentot carry water in his leather breeches ties up and slung in the way i have just described but without the intervention of ostrich eggs the water squired through the seams but plenty remained after he had carried it to its destination which was a couple of miles from the wateringplace in an emergency waterflasks can be improvised from the raw or dry skins of animals which should be greased down the back or from the paunch the heartbag pericardium the intestines or the bladder these should have a wooden skewer runing and out along one side of their mouths by which they can be carried and a lashing under the skewer to make all tight fig below  sketch of bag with skewer and bag being carried  the bushmen do this the water oozes through the membrane and by its evaporation the contents are kept very cool another plan is after having tied a length of intestine at both ends to roll it up in a handkerchief and wear it as a belt round the waist the fault of these membranous bags besides their disgusting character and want of strength is that they become putrid after a few days use  vessels for cooling water may be made that shall also act efficiently as flasks porous earthen jars are too brittle for long use and their pores choke up if slimy water be put inside them but the arabs use a porous leather flask called a zemsemiya which is hung on the shady side of the camel and by evaporation keeps the water deliciously cool it is a rather wasteful way of carrying water canvas bags are equally effective  open buckets for carrying water for short distances or for storing it in camp may be made of the bark of a tree either taken off in an entire cylinder and having a bottom fitted on or else of a knot or excrescence that has been cut off the outside of a tree and its woody interior scooped out or of birth bark sewed or pegged at the corners and having its seams coated with the gum or resin of the pinetree baskets with oiled cloth inside make efficient watervessels they are in use in france as firemens buckets watertight pots are made on the snake river by winding long touch roots in a spiral manner and lashing the coils to one another just as is done in making a beehive earthenware jars are excellent when they can be obtained  to prevent splashingwhen carrying water in buckets put a wreath of grass or something else that will float on the water to prevent it from splashing and also make a hoop inside which the porter may walk while his laden hands rest on its rim the hoop keeps his hands wide from his body and prevents the buckets from knocking against his legs  mending leather watervesselsif a watervessel becomes leaky the hole should be caulked by stuffing a rag a wedge of wood a tuft of grass or anything else into it as shown in the upper figure and also in the left side of the lower one p 230 and then greasing or waxing it over a larger rent must be seized upon the lips of the wound pinched up a thorn or other spike run through the lips and lastly a piece of twine lashed firmly round underneath the thorn the thorn keeps the string from slipping off see the righthand corner of the lower figure when there is an opportunity the bag must be patched as is also shown in the lower figure  sketch of parts of two bags as referred to in text  repairing a battered metal flaskfill it with dry seed such as peas or mustardseed then pour in water and put the stopper into it after a period varying from 1 to 3 or 4 hours according to the nature of the seeds they will begin to swell and to force the sides of the flask outwards into their original shape the swelling proceeds rather rapidly after it has once commenced so the operation requires watching lest it should be overdone and the flask should burst  corks and stoppersthrust a cork tightly into the mouth of the flask cut a hole through the cork and plug the hole which will henceforth form the outlet of the flaskwith a stopper of wood bone or other hard substance thread wound round a slightly conical plug that has been sufficiently notched to retain it in its place makes it nearly watertight as a stopper it is of less importance that the stopper should fit closely if the flask be so slung that its mouth shall be always uppermost a very imperfect cork will then be sufficient to check evaporation and splashing and to prevent the loss of more than a few drops from occasional upsets  drinking when riding or walkingit is an awkward matter to drink when jolting on wheels on horseback or on foot i adopted the plan of carrying a piece of small indiarubber tubing 6 or 8 inches long and when i wished to drink i removed the stopper and inserted the tube just as an insect might let down its proboscis and sucked the contents sir s baker says of the people of unyoro during a journey a pretty bottleshaped longnecked gourd is carried with a store of plantaincider the mouth of the bottle is stopped with a bundle of the white rush shreds through which a reed is inserted that reaches to the bottom thus the drink can be sucked up during the march without the necessity of halting nor is it possible to spill it by the movement of walking  kegs and tankskeys for packsaddlessmall barrels flattened equally on both sides so that their tops and bottoms shall be of an oval and not a circular shape are the most convenient vessels notwithstanding their weight for carrying water on packsaddles across a broken country they are exceedingly strong and require no particular attention while bags of leather or macintosh suffer from thorns and natives secretly prick them during the march that they may suck a draught of water these kegs should not exceed 22 inches in length 10 in extreme breadth and 7 in extreme width a cask of these measurements would hold about 40 lbs weight of water and its own weight might be 15 lbs as the water is expended it is easy to replace the diminished weight by putting on a bag from one of the other packs before starting away into the bush these kegs should be satisfactorily fitted and adjusted to the packsaddle that is intended to carry them in such a way that they may be packed on to it with the least possible trouble a couple of leather or iron loops fixed to each keg and made to catch on to the hooks which are let flush into the sides of the packsaddle will effect this  sketch as described below  the sketch represents a section of the packsaddle at the place where one of the hooks is situated on either side but the front of the kegs themselves and not their section is given above and between the kegs lies a bag and a strap passing from the near side of the saddle goes over the whole burden and is buckled to a similar short strap on the other side it is of importance that the bunghole should be placed even nearer to the rim than where it is drawn for it is necessary that it should be convenient to pour out of and to pour into and that it should be placed on the highest part of the keg both when on the beasts back and also when it stands on the ground lest water should leak and be lost according to the above plan when water is ladled into it the rim keeps it from spilling and in pouring out water the run acts as a spout in making the bunghole a metal plate with a screwhole in it is firmly fixed in the face of the cask into this a wooden stopper bound with iron is made to screw natives would probably steal a metal one the stopper has a small head and a deeplycut neck by which it is tied to the cask and its body has a large hole bored in it which admits of a stick being put through to prize it round if it should become jammed a spigot to screw into the bunghole on arriving at camp might be really useful but if used a gimlethole must be bored in the cask to act as an airvent a large tundish is very convenient and a spare plug might be taken but a traveller with a little painstaking could soon cut a plug with his own knife sufficiently well made to allow of its being firmly screwed in and of retaining the water if it had a bit of rag wrapped round it a piece of rag rolled tightly will suffice to plug a hole  siphonsa flexible tube of some kind whether of indiarubber guttapercha or still better of macintosh strained over rings would be very valuable as a siphon both for filling large kegs out of buckets and for emptying them again vulcanised indiarubber becomes rotten after short use and guttapercha will stand no extremes of temperature  tanks for wagonsthere still remain many large districts in asia africa and australia which may be explored in wagons but so far as i am aware no particular pattern of a watertank suitable for carriage on wheels has yet been adopted by travellers i believe kegs are generally used but they are far too heavy for the requirements of a wagon probably the tins used for sending milk by cart and railway to towns would be very serviceable for carrying water on expeditions they are invariably made of the same shape and only of few different sizes therefore experience must have shown that their pattern is better than any other yet devised their mouths can be padlocked which is an important matter  macintosh bagsi would also recommend a trial of square bags of strong macintoshsay 18 inches deep and 10 inches square in which case they would hold 60 lbs of waterfitting into square compartments in large panniers like those in a bottlebasket i have made some experiments upon this arrangement the basketwork gives protection against blows and the jolting together of packages and it yields without harm to a strain and the bags yield also moreover water is less churned in halfempty bags than in halfempty barrels no unusual strength of materials would be required in making these bags their mouths should be funnelshaped and corked at the neck of the funnel the funnels should be wide at their mouths for convenience in filling them and a string to secure the cork should be tied round the neck of the funnel the bags should have loops on their sides through which a strap passing underneath might run in order to give a good hold for lifting them up they could easily be filled as they lay in their compartments and would only require to be lifted out in order to empty them there is therefore no objection to their holding as much as 60 lbs weight of water an indiarubber tube as a siphon and with a common spigot at the end of it would be particularly useful a pannier not much exceeding 30 inches long by 20 broad and 18 deep would hold six of these bags or 360 lbs weight of water in all and two such panniers would be ample for exploring purposes i had a pannier and two bags made for a trial which were quite satisfactory and i found that the weight of the panniers and bags together was at the rate of 6 lbs for each compartment therefore the weight of these watervessels is not more than 10 per cent of that of the water which they carry it might be well to vary the contents of some of the compartments putting for instance two or even three small bags into one and tin cases into a few of the others instead of the large bags these panniers with the bags inflated and connected together by a stage would form an excellent and powerful raft if secured within a wagon about to cross a deep river they would have enough power in all ordinary cases to cause it to float and not to sink to the bottom i trust some explorer will try this plan i may add that the macintosh waterbags cost me about 1 pound each  raw hide bagscaptain sturt when he explored in australia took a tank in his cart which burst and besides that he carried casks of water by these he was enabled to face a desert country with a degree of success to which no traveller before had ever attained for instance when returning homewards the water was found to be drying up on all sides of him he was encamped by a pool where he was safe whence the next stage was 118 miles or 4 days journey but it was a matter of considerable doubt whether there remained any water at the end of the stage it was absolutely necessary to reconnoitre and in order to do so he had first to provide the messenger with the means of returning should the wateringplace be found dry he killed a bullock skinned it and filling the skin with water which held 150 gallons sent it by an exdray 30 miles with orders to bury it and to return shortly after he despatched a light onehorse cart carrying 36 gallons of water the horse and man were to drink at the hide and then to go on thus they had 36 gallons to supply them for a journey of 176 miles or 6 days at 30 miles a day at the close of which they would return to the oxhidesleeping in fact 5 nights on 36 gallons of water this a hardy welldriven horse could do even in the hottest climate  to raise water from wells for cattleby handlet one man stand in the water or just above it another 5 feet higher and again another higher still if the depth of the well requires it then let the lowermost man dip a bucket in the water and pass it from hand to hand upwards the top man pours the water into a trough out of which the cattle drink this trough may be simply a ditch scratched in the ground a piece of canvas should be thrown over it if the soil be sandy to keep the water from being lost before the cattle have time to drink it thus eyre speaks of watering his horse out of his black servants duck frock light guttapercha buckets are very useful in temperate climates and so are baskets with oilcloth inside them  the drove of cattle should be brought up to 60 yards from the wateringplace then three or four should be driven outthey will run at once to the water after they have drunk drive them to one side and let another three or four take their place and so on keeping the two droves quite distinctthose that have drunk and those that are waiting to drink they will drink at the rate of one per minute sheep and goats drink very much faster never let the cattle go in a rush to the well else they will stamp it in most of them get no water and they will all do a great deal of damage  by horse powerit does not fall within the scope of this book to describe waterwheels worked by cattle or elaborate mechanism of any kind i therefore only mention under this head that the tartars sometimes draw water from their wells of 150 feet deep and upwards by a rider harnessing the bucketrope to his horse and galloping him off to a mark that tells the proper distance their ropes are of twisted hair and are made to run over a smoothed stone or a log of wood  sketches of pole and bucket and pump as described below  a pole and bucket is a very convenient way of raising water from 4 to 12 feet the bucket may be made of canvas basketwork leather wood or almost any other material leakage though considerable is of little consequence because the action of the apparatus is so quick that there is not time for much water to be lost this contrivance is used over almost the whole globeless in england than elsewhere it is very common where long poles can easily be obtained as in fir forests  pumpan excellent and very simple pump is used by the arabs in algeria a piece of leather or waxed canvas is stretched round one or more hoops it forms a hollow cylinder that admits of being shut flat like an accordion the top and bottom of the cylinder are secured round the edges of two discs of wood holes are bored in these discs and leather valves are fitted to them the lower disc is nailed to the bottom of a tub the hole in it corresponds with the feedpipe and the valve that covers the hole opens upwards the upper disc is attached to the pump handle the valves that cover the holes in this disc open upwards also when the leatherpump barrel is pressed flat water flows through the upper valves into the barrel around it when it is pulled out water is sucked up through the feedpipe and an equal quantity is displaced from the barrel this flows out into the trough a bag would do as well as a tub to hold the water which surrounds the pumpbarrel but without the water which it is the object of either the one or the other to contain the pumpbarrel must be airproof as well as waterproof the action of this pump is marvellously perfect it attracted much attention in the french exhibition of 1855    guns and rifles   general remarksbreechloadersat the present time when the merits of different kinds of breechloader are so hotly discussed when all that have yet been invented have some faults and every month brings to light some new invention it would be foolish in me to write anything about them it would be obsolete before the great majority of my readers should have seen this book therefore omitting breechloaders altogether from the present edition i will confine myself to repeating what i have said before upon muzzleloaders with additions and alterations  size of gunamerican bushrangers advocate a long heavy pearifle on the plea of its accurate shooting and the enormous saving in weight of ammunition when bullets of a small size are used the objections to smallbored rifles are insufficiency against large game even with conical bullets and a tendency to become foul after a few shots a short light rifle whether with a large or a small bore is i believe utterly worthless in the hands of a man trembling with running and with exhaustion it shakes like a wand the shorter the rifle the more quickly does it oscillate and of course in the same proportion is it difficult to catch the exact moment when the sights cover the object  for the larger kinds of game such as elephants and buffaloes experienced sportsmen mostly prefer guns of immense bore carrying round bullets that weigh a quarter of a pound the recoil is tremendous and would injure the shoulder if the sportsman did not use a pad against which he rests the gun the guns must be strong because very large charges of powder are invariably used where great power of penetration is required african sportsmen found this out experimentally long before the idea occurred to artillerists  sightsthe hind sight should be far from the eye even though it be placed halfway down the barrel else it becomes out of focus and indistinct when the eye is firmly set on the object aimed at this drawback is never compensated by the advantage of having the front and hind sights far asunder  ramrodthe guns of servants and indeed those of their masters should have thin softiron ramrods the elasticity of these when slightly bent will retain them in the ramrodtubes both ends of the ramrod must be forged broad  screw to secure the cockin common guns this screw is very liable to get loose fall out and be lost it is therefore desirable to have one or more spare screws  waterproof cover should not be forgotten  rust to preventparaffine and mercurial ointment are perhaps the two best things to keep rust off iron in sea voyages or in boatshooting before embarking for a voyage it is convenient to enclose the guns in a leaden case which on arrival can be melted up into bullets it is remarkable how much better dirty guns withstand rust than clean ones  olive oil to purifyput a piece of lead in the glass bottle that contains the oil and expose to the sun a quantity of cloudy matter will separate after a few days then the refined oil may be decanted  the small of the stock is the weakest part of a gun it is constantly broken by falls in travel sir samuel baker justly recommends that all guns made for sport in wild countries and rough riding should have steel instead of iron from the breechsocket extending far back to within six inches of the shoulder plate the triggerguard should likewise be steel and should be carried back to an equal distance with the above rib the steel should be of extra thickness and screwed through to the upper piece thus the two being connected by screws above and below no fall could break the stock  injuries to guns to repairramrod tubes often break off and it is a very troublesome accident when they do so i know of no contrivance to fasten them on again except by using soft solder the application of which will not in the least hurt the gun ashes at a dull red heat must be heaped over the barrel to warm it sufficiently before applying the solder if the ramrod tubes have been lost others made of tin may replace them  the sight of a gun if it falls out and is lost can easily be replaced by a substitute a groove must be cut with a file across the substance of the barrel if the gun be a single one or across the midrib if doublebarrelled into this a piece of iron ivory bone horn or hard wood with a projection carved in the middle for the sight must be pushed then the metal on either side must be battered down over it with a hammer or stone to keep it firm  a broken stock however much it may be smashed can be well mended by raw hide see hides blacksmiths work and carpentering are seldom sufficient for the purpose it is within the power of a rough workman to make a gunstock but it is a work of great labour  a ramrod may be replaced by cutting a stick from a tree straightening it in the fire and then seasoning it see green wood  guns to hang up to carry and to cleanhanging guns to a wallfix a loop of leather for the muzzle and a strap and buckle for the stock with a piece of sheepskin or canvas nailed so as to hang over it as in fig 1 a more complete way is to sew a long pocket with a flap to it which is tied up on to a stick or bar as in fig 2 the gun has simply to be lifted out and in the pocket must be made baggy at the part which corresponds to the cocks of the gun  fig 1 and fig 2 as described in text  carrying guns on a journeylook at the gun but never let the gun look at you or at your companions is a golden rule for among the chances of death to which a traveller is exposed that of being shot by an attendants gun going off accidentally ranks high servants should carry their guns with the cock down on a piece of rag that covers the cap take it all in all it is the best plan for them a sportsman will find great convenience in having a third nick cut in the tumbler of his lock so as to give an additional low halfcock at which the cock just clears the nipple it will prevent the cap from falling off or receiving a blow i have long used this plan and find no objections to it many pistols are furnished with this contrivance careless gunmakers sometimes make this catch so low that when the cock is lifted a little back from it and let go it strikes the cap by reason of the elasticity of its metal and lets off the gun the traveller should beware of this fault of workmanship  sketch of gun as described  as this book may fall into the hands of persons ignorant of the danger of carrying a gun with the cock down on the nipple to which cause i find that threefourths of gun accidents are owing having once kept a list of those that were reported in the newspapers i will remark that when the cock is down a heavy blow on its back nay even the jar caused by the gun falling on the ground will cause the cap to explode again if the cock catch against the dress or against a twig it is liable to be lifted when on being released it will snap down upon the cap when a gun is at halfcock the first of these accidents obviously cannot occur and as to the second if the cock be pulled back and let drop it falls not down upon the cap but to halfcock again except only in the case where the trigger is also pressed back the objections to carrying a gun at halfcock are that careless people occasionally leave it on fullcock without perceiving the difference and that there is a probability of weakening the mainspring if day after day it be kept on the strain  carrying guns when stalking gamein creeping after game the gun is always troublesome there is no better plan than pushing it as far as the arm can reach then creeping up to it and again pushing it forwards  carrying guns on horsebackallow me very strongly to recommend a trial of the following plan even for a shootingpony in scotland it is the invention of the namaquas i and all my party in south africa used it for a year and a half and many persons have adopted the plan in england since i first published a description of it sew a bag of canvas leather or hide of such a size as to admit the butt of the gun pretty freely the straps that support the bag buckle through a ring in the pommel the thongs by which the slope of the bag is adjusted are fastened round the girth below the exact adjustments may not be hit upon by an unpractised person for some time but when they are once ascertained the thongs need never be shifted the gun is perfectly safe it never comes below the armpit even in taking a crop leap it is pulled out in an instant by bringing the elbow forwards in front of the gun and then backwards pressing it against the side by this manner the gun is thrown to the outside of the arm then lowering the hand catch the gun as near the triggerguard as you can and lift it out of the bag it is a bungling way to take out the gun whilst its barrel lies between the arm and the body any sized gun can be carried in this fashion and it offers no obstacle to mounting or dismounting  i hear that some sportsmen who were probably unacquainted with this method have used a bag or pocket of stiff leather attached to the side of the saddle just behind the right leg into this when tired of carrying the gun they push the butt it is said to lie there securely and to give no trouble the barrel passes forwards under the right arm and the muzzle is in front of the rider  drawing of horse rider and gun as described above  the french dragoons carry a gun in a way that is convenient for military purposes because it does not interfere with the immense housings that cavalry soldiers require but it is not so handy it does not lie so freely as the above nor is it as well suited to a traveller or a sportsman the gun is placed butt downwards as in the namaqua method and leans backwards in the same way but the under side of the gun instead of being backwards or towards the horses tail is towards his head the butt lies in a shallow bucket secured by two straps fixed to the front of the saddle another strap leading from the pommel and passing over the right thigh of the rider is hitched round the barrel of the gun and has to be unbuckled and cast off when the gun is taken out  all ways of carrying the gun with its muzzle downwards are very objectionable since the jolting tends to dislodge the charge if it be considerably dislodged the gun will probably burst on being fired also a very little shaking when the muzzle is downwards will shake the powder out of the nipple and therefore a gun so carried will constantly miss fire  at night to dispose of gunsa gun is a very awkward thing to dispose of at night it has occurred more than once that a native servant has crept up drawn away the gun of his sleeping master and shot him dead the following appears to me an excellent planwhen getting sleepy you return your rifle between your legs roll over and go to sleep some people may think this is a queer place for a rifle but on the contrary it is the position of all others where utility and comfort are most combined  sketch of man and gun as described  the butt rests on the arm and serves as a pillow for the head the muzzle points between the knees and the arms encircle the lock and breech so that you have a smooth pillow and are always prepared to start up armed at a moments notice parkyns abyssinia the longer the gun the more secure is the sleeper from accident the sketch is not quite accurate for in practice the weight of the gun is never allowed to rest so entirely on the arm as it is here represented if it did so the arm would soon be numbed the gunstock may be a little bolstered up if desired to avoid any troublesome pressure on the arm  cleaning gunsa bit of rag does as well as tow and can be used over and over again a top furnished with a sponge to screw to the cleaning rod is convenient a leaded barrel must be cleaned with fine sand hawker

more  powderhorn to makesaw off the required length from an oxs horn flatten it somewhat by heat see horn fit a wooden bottom into it caulk it well and sew raw hide round the edge to keep all tight

may be carried very conveniently by means of a ring with two dozen nippleshaped beads made of some metal strung upon it each bead being intended to be covered by a percussioncap the beads are cleft down the middle which gives them a slight springiness that more effectually secures the caps that are placed upon them the ring is tied by a thong to the belt or buttonhole it is very difficult without this contrivance to keep caps free from sand crumbs and dirt yet always at hand when required i can confidently recommend it though as it is oldfashioned and not well suited for sportsmen in england it is rarely to be met with spring cap holders are i am sure too delicate for rough travel  to protect caps from the rainbefore stalking or watching at night in rainy weather wax or grease the edge of the cap as it rests on the nipple it will thus become proof against water and damp air some persons carry a piece of grease with them when shooting in wet weather and with it they smear the top of the nipple after each loading before putting on the fresh cap it is said that the grease does not prevent the full action of the cap upon the powder a sportsman has recommended to me a couple of wellmarked caps into the heads of which small wads of cork have been fitted he uses them for loaded guns that are to be laid by for some hours or days a broad leaf wrapped loosely round the lock of a gun will protect it during a heavy shower  substitute for capswhen the revolution in spain in 1854 began there was a great want of percussion caps this the insurgents supplied by cutting off the heads of lucifermatches and sticking them into the nipples the plan was found to answer perfectly times july 31  gunprickeri am indebted for the following plan both for clearing the touchhole and also for the rather awkward operation of pricking down fresh gunpowder into it to an old sportsman in the orkney island of sanday he takes a quill and cuts off a broad ring from the large end of it this is pushed over the small end of the quill and lies securely there next he cuts a wooden plug to fit the quill into the plug the pricker is fixed  sketch of gunpricker as described  the whole affair goes safely in the pocket the quill acting as a sheath to the sharp pricker now when powder has to be pricked down the nipple the broad ring is slipped off the quill and put on the nipple which it fits powder is poured into it and the required operation is easily completed this little contrivance which is so simple and light lasts for months and is perfectly effective i have tried metal holders but i much prefer the simple quill on account of its elasticity and lightness a little binding with waxed thread may be put on as shown in the sketch to prevent the quill from splitting  waddingthe bush affords few materials from which wadding can be made some birds nests are excellent for the purpose i am told that a dry hide will not serve as materials for wads  flintsaccording to ures dictionary the best stones to choose for making gunflints are those that are not irregular in shape they should have when broken a greasy lustre and be particularly smooth and finegrained the colour is of no importance but it should be uniform in the same lump and the more transparent the stones the better gunflints are made with a hammer and a chisel of steel that is not hardened the stone is chipped by the hammer alone into pieces of the required thickness which are fashioned by being laid upon the fixed chisel and hammered against it it takes nearly a minute for a practised workman to make one

themselvesburning the charcoal gathering saltpetre from saltpans and buying the sulphur from trading caravans they grind the materials on a stone in chinese tartary and thibet every peasant manufactures it for himself  to make 8 lbs of gunpowder take 1 lb of charcoal 1 lb of sulphur and 6 lbs of saltpetre these proportions should be followed as accurately as possible each of the three materials must be pounded into powder separately and then all mixed together most thoroughly the mixture must have a little water added to it enough to make it bind into a stiff paste about onetenth part by measure of water is sufficient that is to say one cupful of water to ten cupfuls of the mixed powder the paste must be well kneaded together with one stone on another just as travellers usually make meal or grind coffee it should then be wrapped up to a piece of canvas or a skin and pressed with as heavy a pressure as can be obtained to condense it next the cake is squeezed and worked against a sieve made of parchment in which the holes have been burnt with a redhot wire and through which the cake is squeezed in grains these grains are now put into a box which is well shaken about and in this way the grains run each other smooth the fine dust that is then found mixed with the grains must be winnowed away lastly the grains are dried  recapitulation1 pound the ingredients

ingredient in gunpowder  sulphurthe lumps must be melted over a gentle fire the pot should then be put in a heap of hot sand to give the impurities time to settle before it cools into a mass when this

with balls at large game they must not be discouraged at what is a general rule but be satisfied that they will soon do themselves justice  alloycommon bullets of lead whether round or conical are far inferior to those of hard alloy for the latter penetrate much more deeply and break bones instead of flattening against them a mixture of very little tin or pewter which is lead and tin with lead hardens it we read of sportsmen melting up their spoons and dishes for this purpose a little quicksilver has the same effect sir samuel baker who is one of the most experienced sportsmen both in ceylon and in africa latterly used a mixture of ninetenths lead and onetenth quicksilver for his bullets he says this is superior to all other mixtures for that purpose as it combines hardness with extra weight the lead must be melted in a pot by itself to a red heat and the proportion of quicksilver must be added a ladleful at a time and stirred quickly with a piece of iron just in sufficient quantity to make three or four bullets if the quicksilver is subjected to red heat in the large leadpot it will evaporate proper alloy or spelter had best be ordered at a gunmakers shop and taken from england instead of lead different alloys of spelter vary considerably in their degree of hardness and therefore more than one specimen should be tried  shape of bulletsround iron bullets are worthless except at very close quarters on account of the lightness of the metal for the resistance of the air checks their force extremely whether elongated iron bullets would succeed remains to be tried some savagesas for instance those of timorwhen in want of bullets use stones two or three inches long some good sportsmen insist on the advantage for shooting at very close quarters of cleaving a conical bullet nearly down to its base into four parts these partly separate and make a fearful wound i suppose that the bullet leaves the gun with the same force as if it were entire and that it traverses too short a distance for the altered form to tell seriously upon the speed when it strikes it acts like chainshot  bullets to carrybullets should be carried sewn up in their patches for the convenience of loading and they should not fit too tight a few may be carried bare for the sake of rapid loading  recovering bulletswhen ammunition is scarce make a practice of recovering the bullets that may have been shot into a beast if they are of spelter they will be found to have been very little knocked out of shape and may often be used again without recasting  shot and slugstravellers frequently omit to take enough shot which is a great mistake as birds are always to be found while large game is uncertain besides this shot gives amusement and ducks quails and partridges are much better eating than antelopes and buffaloes it must be borne in mind that a rifle will carry shot quite well enough on an emergency probably no 7 is the most convenient size for shot as the birds are likely to be tame and also because a traveller can often fire into a covey or dense flight of birdsand the more pellets the more execution if birds are to be killed for stuffing dustshot will also be wanted otherwise it is undoubtedly better to take only one size of shot  shot is made in manufactories as followsarsenic is added to the lead in the proportion of from 3 lbs to 8 lbs of arsenic to 1000 lbs of lead the melted lead is poured through cullenders drilled with very fine holes and drops many feet down into a tub of water 100 feet fall is necessary for manufactories in which no 4 shot is made 150 for larger sorts if the shot turns out to be lensshaped there has been too much arsenic if hollow flattened or tailed there has been too little pewter or tin is bad as it makes tailed shot the shot are sorted by sieves bad shot are weeded out by letting the shot roll over a slightlyinclined board then the sho that are not quite round roll off to the side lastly the shot is smoothed by being shaken up in a barrel with a little blacklead  slugs are wanted both for nightshooting and also in case of a hostile attack they can be made by running melted lead into reeds and chopping the reeds into short length or by casting the lead in tubes made by rolling paper round a smooth stick whether reeds or paper be used they should be planted in the ground before the lead is poured in the temperature of the lead is regulated by taking care that a small quantity of it remains unmelted in the ladle at the moment of pouring out if it be too hot it will burn the paper see lead    hints on

float on the water while the boat passes quickly by them  shooting over waterwhen shooting from a riverbank without boat or dog take a long light string with a stick tied to one end of it the other

to the handline by a couple of strings each 6 feet long tied round either notch thus the handline terminates in a triangle see the figure i have given of a rude stirrup the two sides of which are of string with the stick for a base a stout stick of this kind can be thrown to a great distance either it may be heaved as a sailors deepsea lead or it may be whirled round the head and then let fly  nightshootingtie a band of white paper round the muzzle of the gun behind the sight mr andersson who has had very great experience ties the paper not round the smooth barrel but over the sight and all and if the sight does not happen to be a large one he ties a piece of thick string round the barrel or uses other similar contrivance to tilt up the fore end of the paper by this means the paper is not entirely lost sight of at the moment when the aim is being taken mr andersson also pinches the paper into a ridge along the middle of the gun to ensure a more defined foresight  nocturnal animalsthere are a large number of nightfeeding animals upon whose flesh a traveller might easily support himself but of whose existence he would have few indications by daylight observation only the following remarks of professor owen in respect to australia are very suggestiveall the marsupial animalsand it is one of their curious peculiaritiesare nocturnal even the kangaroo which is the least so is scarcely ever seen feeding out on the plains in broad daylight it prefers the early morning dawn or the short twilight and above all the bright moonlight nights with regard to most of the other australian forms of marsupial animals they are most strictly nocturnal so that if a traveller were not aware of that peculiarity he might fancy himself traversing a country destitute of the mammalian grade of animal life if however after a weary days journey he could be awakened and were to look out about the moonlight glade or scrub or if he were to set traps by night he would probably be surprised to find how great a number of interesting forms of mammalian animals were to be met with in places where there was not the slightest appearance of them in the daytime  battuesin sweden where hundreds of people are marshalled each man has a number and the number is chalked upon his hat  scarecrowsa string with feathers tied to it at intervals like the tail of a boys kite will scare most animals of the deer tribe by their fluttering and in want of a sufficient force of men passes may be closed by this contrivance the swedes use lappar viz pieces of canvas of half the height of a man painted in glaring colours and left to flutter from a line  mr lloyd tells us of a peasant who when walking without a gun saw a glutton up in a tree he at once took off his hat and coat and rigged out a scarecrow the counterpart of himself which he fixed close by for the purpose of frightening the beast from coming down he then went leisurely home to fetch his gun this notable expedient succeeded perfectly  stalkinghorsesartificiala stalkinghorse or cow is made by cutting out a piece of strong canvas into the shape of the animal and painting it properly loops are sewn in different places through which sticks are passed to stretch the curves into shape a stake planted in the ground serves as a buttress to support the apparatus at a proper height there is a loophole to fire through it packs up into a roll of canvas and a bundle of five or six sticks  sketch of stalkinghorse as described below  bushes are used much in the same way colonel hawker made a contrivance upon wheels which he pushed before him the esquimaux shoot seals by pushing a white screen before them over the ice on a sledge see figure  kane  realboth horses and oxen can be trained to shield a sportsman they are said to enter into the spirit of the thing and to show wonderful craft walking round and round the object in narrowing circles and stopping to graze unconcernedly on witnessing the least sign of alarm oxen are taught to obey a touch on the horn the common but cruel way of training them is to hammer and batter the horns for hours together and on many days successively they then become inflamed at the root and are highly sensitive  panhunting used at saltlickspanhunting is a method of hunting deer at night an iron pan attached to a long stick serving as a handle is carried in the left hand over the left shoulder near where the hand grasps the handle in a small projecting stick forming a fork on which to rest the rifle when firing the pan is filled with burning pineknots which being saturated with turpentine shed a brilliant and constant light all around shining into the eyes of any deer that may come in that direction and making them look like two balls of fire the effect is most curious to those unaccumstomed to it the distance between the eyes of the deer as he approaches appears gradually to increase reminding one of the lamps of a travelling carriage palliser  the rush of an enraged animal is far more easily avoided than is usually supposed the way the spanish bullfighters play with the bull is well known any man can avoid a mere headlong charge even the speed of a racer which is undeniably far greater than any wild quadruped does not exceed 30 miles an hour or four times the speed of a man the speed of an ordinary horse is not more than 24 miles an hour now even the fastest wild beast is unable to catch an ordinary horse except by crawling unobserved close to his side and springing upon him therefore i am convinced that the rush of no wild animal exceeds 24 miles an hour or three times the speed of a man see measurements of the rate of an animals gallop p 37 it is perfectly easy for a person who is cool to avoid an animal by dodging to one side or other of a bush few animals turn if the rush be unsuccessful the buffalo is an exception he regularly hunts a man and is therefore peculiarly dangerous unthinking persons talk of the fearful rapidity of a lion or tigers spring it is not rapid at all it is a slow movement as must be evident from the following consideration no wild animal can leap ten yards and they all make a high trajectory in their leaps now think of the speed of a ball thrown or rather pitched with just sufficient force to be caught by a person ten yards off it is a mere nothing the catcher can play with it as he likes he has even time to turn after it if thrown wide but the speed of a springing animal is undeniably the same as that of a ball thrown so as to make a flight of equal length and height in the air the corollary to all this is that if charged you must keep cool and watchful and your chance of escape is far greater than nonsportsmen would imagine the blow of the free paw is far swifter than the bound  dogs kept at baya correspondent assures me that a dog flying at a man may be successfully repelled by means of a stout stick held horizontally a hand at each end and used to thrust the dog backwards over by meeting him across the throat or breast if followed by a blow on the nose as the brute is falling the result will be sooner attained  a watchdog usually desists from flying at a stranger when he seats himself quietly on the ground like ulysses the dog then contents himself with barking and keeping guard until his master arrives  hiding gamein hiding game from birds of prey brush it over and they will seldom find it out birds cannot smell well but they have keen eyes the meat should be hung from an overhanging bough then if the birds find it out there will be no place for them to stand on and

disputes especially between whites and natives and therefore the custom of the country must be attended to but it is a very general and convenient rule though like all fixed rules often unfair that the animal should belong to the man who first wounded him however slight the wound might have been but that he or they who actually killed the animal should have a right to a slice of the meat it must however be understood that the man who gave the first wound should not thenceforward withdraw from the chase if he does so his claim is lost in america the skin belongs to the first shot the carcase is divided equally among the whole party whaling crews are bound by similar customs in which nice distinctions are made and which have all the force of laws  duckshootingwooden ducks ballasted with lead and painted may be used at night as decoyducks or the skins of birds already shot may be stuffed and employed for the same purpose they should be anchored in the water or made fast to a frame attached to the shootingpunt and dressed with sedge it is convenient to sink a large barrel into the flat marsh or mud as a dry place to stand or sit in when waiting for the birds to come a lady suggests to me that if the sportsman took a bottle of hot water to put under his feet it would be a great comfort to him and in this i quite agree i would take a keg of hot water when about it if real ducks be used as decoybirds the males should be tied in one place and the females in another to induce them to quack an artificial island may be made to attract ducks when there is no real one  crocodileshootingmr gilby says speaking of egypt i killed several crocodiles by digging pits on the sandislands and sleeping a part of the night in them a dry shred of palmbranch the colour of the sand round the hole formed a screen to put the gun through their flesh was most excellent eatinghalfway between meat and fish i had it several times the difficulty of shooting them was that the falcons and spurwingplovers would hover round the pit when the crocodiles invariably took to the water their sight and hearing were good but their scent indifferent i generally got a shot or two at daybreak after sleeping in the pit  trackswhen the neighbourhood of a drinkingplace is trodden down with tracks describe a circle a little distance from it to ascertain if it be much frequented this

over it in order to show the tracks more clearly it is related in the apocrypha that the prophet daniel did this when he wished to learn who it really was who every night consumed the meat which was placed before the idol of bel and which the idol itself was supposed to eat he thus discovered that the priests and their families had a secret door by which they entered the temple and convinced the king of the matter by showing him their footprints  carrying gameto carry small game as fallow deermake a long slit with your knife between the back sinew and the bone of both of the hindlegs cut a thick pole of wood and a stout wooden skewer 8 inches long now thrust the right foreleg through the slit in the left hind one and then the left foreleg through the slit in the right hind one and holding these firmly in their places push the skewer right through the left foreleg so as to peg it from drawing back lastly run the pole between the animals legs and its body and let two men carry it on their shoulders one at each end of the pole or if a beast of burden be at hand the carcase is in a very convenient shape for being packed in animals whose back sinew is not very prominent it is best to cross the legs as above and to lash them together always take the bowels out of game before carrying it it is so much weight saved i rode out accompanied by an afterrider and shot two springboks which we bore to camp secured on our horses behind our saddles by passing the buckles of the girths on each side through the fore and hind legs of the antelopes having first performed an incision between the bone and the sinews with the couteau de chasse according to colonial usage cummings life in south africa after he had skinned and gutted the animal he cut away the flesh from the

baker recommends stripping off the skin of the animal as though it were intended to make a waterskin of it putting a stone up the neck end of the skin thus forming a watertight sack open at one end only all the flesh is now to be cut off the bones and packed into the sack which is then to be inflated and secured by tying up the open end the skin of a large antelope thus inflated will not only

wrapped up in skins and secured with rope mungo park  setting a gun as a springgungeneral remarksthe string that goes across the pathway should be dark coloured and so fine that if the beast struggles against it it should break rather than cause injury to the gun i must however add that in the numerous cases in which i have witnessed or heard of guns being set with success for large beasts of prey i have never known of injury occurring to the gun the height of the muzzle should be properly arranged with regard to the height of the expected animal thus the heart of a hyena is the height of a mans knee above the ground that of a lion is a span higher the string should not be tight but hang in a bow or the animal will cause the gun to go off on first touching the string and will only receive a fleshwound across the front of his chest  1st methodthe annexed sketch p 258 explains the method i have described in previous editions of this book the stock is firmly lashed to a tree and the muzzle to a stake planted in the ground a leverstick 8 inches long is bound across the grip of the gun so as to stand upright but it is not bound so tightly as to prevent a slight degree of movement the bottom of the leverstick is tied to the trigger and the top of it to a long fine darkcoloured string which is passed through the empty ramrod tubes and is fixed to a tree on the other side of the pathway it is evident that when a beast breasts this string the trigger of the gun will be pulled  sketch of man setting up gun to be fired as above  1nd methodi have however been subsequently informed of a better plan of adapting the leverstick it is shown in the accompanying diagram below the fault of the previous plan is the trouble of tying the string to the trigger since the curvature is usually such as to make it a matter of some painstaking to fix it securely a b c is the leverstick notch it deeply at a where it is to receive the trigger notch it also at b half an inch from a and at c 5 inches or so from b in lashing b to the grip of the stock at d the firmer you make the lashing the better if d admit of any yielding movement on c being pulled the gun will not go off either readily or surely as will easily be seen on making experiment  sketch of rifle with stick rigged as above  3rd methodi am indebted to captain j meaden for the following account of the plan used in ceylon for setting a spring gun for leopards  remove the sear or tie up the trigger load the gun and secure it at the proper height from the ground opposite the muzzle of the gun or at such distance to the right or left as may be required fasted the end of a black string or line made of horsehair or fibre and pass it across the path to the gun fasten the other end to a stake long enough to stand higher than the hammer stick the end of the stake slightly in the ground and let it rest upright against the lock projection the black line being fastened nearly at that height pass round the small of the stock a loop of single or double string take a piece of stick 6 or 8 inches long pass through the loop and twist tourniquet fashion until the loop is reduced to the required length raise the hammer carefully and pass the short end of the leverstick from the inner to the outer side over the comb and let the long end of the lever rest against the stake the pressure of the hammer will keep the lever steady against the stake to prevent the lower end of the stake flying out from the pressure of the lever on the upper part place a log or stone against the foot  an animal pushing against the black string draws the upper end of the stake towards the muzzle until the lever is disengaged and releases the hammer  in laying the long arm of the lever against the stake sufficient play must be allowed for the contraction of the black string when wet by dew or rain  if a double gun is set two stakes and two levers will be required the stakes to be connected above and below the gun by cross sticks the levers must be passed round the combs the opposite way to allow of the long arms pressing outwards from the gun and enable the levers to disengage without entangling  the carcase or live bait must be hedged round and means adopted to guide the leopard across the string by running out a short hedge on one side in this case the black line to be set taut and some 4 inches from the line of fire the breast than catches the string and the push releases the hammer when the muzzle is in line with the chest  on this principle two or more guns can be set slightly varying in elevation to allow of one barrel at least being effective  bow and arrow set for beaststhe chinese have some equivalent contrivance with bows and arrows m huc tells us that a simply constructed machine is sold in the shops by which when sprung a number of poisoned arrows are fired off in succession these machines are planted in caves of sepulture to guard them from pillage they use springguns and used to have springbows in sweden and in many other countries  kniveshuntingknifea great huntingknife is a useless encumbrance no old sportsman or traveller cares to encumber himself with one but a butchers knife carried in a sheath is excellent both from its efficient shape the soft quality of the steel its lightness and the strong way in which the blade is set in the haft  pocketknifeif a traveller wants a pocketknife full of all kinds of tools he had best order a very light one of 2 34 inches long in a tortoiseshell handle without the usual turnscrew at the end it should have a light picker to shut over its back this will act as a strikelight and a file also if its under surface be properly roughened underneath the picker there should be a small triangular borer for making holes in leather and a gimlet the front of the knife should contain a long narrow penblade of soft steel a cobblers awl slightly bent and a packingneedle with a large eye to push thongs and twine through holes in leather between the tortoiseshell part of the handle and the metal frame of the knife should be a space to contain three flat thin pieces of steel turning on the same pivot the ends of these are to be ground to form turnscrews of brass instruments when this excellent contrivance is used it must be opened out like the letter t the foot of which represents the turnscrew in use and the horizontal part represents the other two turnscrews which serve as the handle it may be thought advisable to add a buttonhook a corkscrew and a large blade but that is not my recommendation because it increases the size of the knife and makes it heavy now a heavy knife is apt to be laid by and not to be at hand when wanted while a light knife is a constant pocket companion

their aid the sight of man is raised nearly to a par with that of nightroving animals therefore a sportsman would find them of great service when watching for game at night a small and inexpensive glass is as useful for this purpose as a large one but there is a considerable difference between the clearness of different operaglasses    other means of capturing game   general remarksa trapper will never succeed unless he thoroughly enters into the habits of life and mind of wild animals he must ever bear in mind how suspicious they are how quickly their eye is caught by unusual traces and lastly how strong and enduring a taint is left by the human touch our own senses do not make us aware of what it is disagreeable enough to acknowledge that the whole species of man yields a powerful and widespreading emanation that is utterly disgusting and repulsive to every animal in its wild state it requires some experience to realise this fact a man must frequently have watched the heads of a herd of far distant animals tossed up in alarm the moment that they catch his wind he must have observed the tracks of animalshow when they crossed his path of the preceding day the beast that made the tracks has stopped scrutinised and shunned itbefore he can believe what a yahoo he is among the brute creation no cleanliness of the individual seems to diminish this remarkable odour indeed the more civilised the man the more subtle does it appear to be the touch of a gamekeeper scares less than that of the master and the touch of a negro or bushman less than that of a traveller from europe  if a novice thinks he will trap successfully by such artless endeavours as putting a bait on the plate of a trap that is covered over with moss or by digging a pitfall in the middle of a wild beasts track he is utterly mistaken the bait should be thrown on the ground and the trap placed on the way to it then the animals mind being fixed on the meat takes less heed of the footpath or a pitfall should be made near the main path this being subsequently stopped by boughs causes the animal to walk in the bushes and to tumble into the covered hole the slightest thing diverts an animals step watch a wild beasts path across a forest little twigs and tufts of grass will be seen to have changed its course and caused it to curve it is in trifles of this sort that the trapper should look for auxiliaries after setting traps mr st john recommends the use of a small branch of a tree first to smooth the ground and then having dipped it in water to sprinkle the place this entirely obliterates all footmarks  springesgeneral remarksharden the wood of which the mechanism has to be made by means of fire either baking it in hot sand or ashes or otherwise applying heat to a degree just short of charring its surface the mechanism will then retain the sharpness of its edges under a continuance of pressure and during many hours of wet weather the slighter the strain on the springe the more delicately can its mechanism be set  noosescatgut which see makes better nooses than string because it is stiff enough to keep in shape when set brass wife that has been heated redhot is excellent for it has no tendency whatever to twist and yet is perfectly pliable fishhooks are sometimes attached to springes sometimes a tree is bent down and a strong cord is used for the noose by which large animals are strangled up in the air as leopards are in abyssinia a noose may be set in any place where there is a run it can be kept spread out by thin rushes or twigs set crosswise in it if the animal it is set for can gnaw a heavy stone should be loosely propped up which the animal in its struggles may set free and by the weight of which it may be hung up and strangled it is a very convenient plan for a traveller who has not time to look for runs to make little hedges across a creek or at right angles to a clump of trees and to set his snares in gaps left in these artificial hedges on the same principle artificial islands of piles and faggots are commonly made in lakes that are destitute of any real ones in order that they may become a resort of wildfowl  javelinsheavy poisoned javelins hung over elephant and hippopotamus paths and dropped on a catch being touched after the manner of a springe are used generally in africa they sometimes consist of a sharp little assegai or spike most thoroughly poisoned and stuck firmly into the end of a heavy block of thornwood about four feet long and five inches in diameter this formidable affair is suspended over the centre of a seacow path at about thirty feet from the ground by a bark cord which passes over a high branch of a tree and thence by a peg on one side of a path beneath gordon cumming  triggerwhere a trigger has to release a strong spring an arrangement on the principle of a figure of 4 trap is i believe the most delicate the standard may be a branch or the stock of a tree and the other pieces should be hardened by fire  pitfallsvery small pitfalls with sharpened stakes planted inside them that have been baked hard by the fire and well poisoned are easily to be set but they are very dangerous to man and beast in preparing a pitfall for animals of prey it is usual to ascertain whether they are deep enough by putting in a large dog if he cannot get out it is very unlikely that any wild beast can see trous de loup p 312  pitfalls are often dug in great numbers near frequented wateringplaces to which numerous intersecting paths lead by stopping up particular paths the pitfalls can be brought separately into use therefore those pitfalls need never be employed in which animals have been freshly killed and where the smell of blood would scare the game it is difficult to prevent the covers of pitfalls becoming hollow the only way is to build the roofs in somewhat of an arch so as to allow for subsidence if a herd of animals be driven over pitfalls some are sure to be pushed in as the crush makes it impossible for the beasts however wary to pick their way  uganda thornwreathcaptain grant found a very ingenious contrivance in use in uganda in africa two small stout hoops of equal diameter made of wood fully an inch in thickness were lashed one above the other long acacia thorns were interposed forming the spokes of a wheel of which the hoops formed the rim the bases of the thorns were nipped between the hoops and their points radiated towards the centre a great many thorns were used so that the appearance was that of a wheel without a nave whose spokes were so close together that they touched each other and as thorns taper from base to point the spokes touched one another along their whole length from circumference to centre this apparatus is always made with great neatness it is laid over a hole 18 inches deep dug in the beasts path and the noose of a cord of which the other end is secured to a log is laid closely within the upper hoop when the beast treads on the apparatus he crashes through the thorns but on withdrawing his foot from the hole the wreath clings to his fetlock like a ruff and prevents the noose from slipping off thus there is time for the noose to become firmly jammed during the struggles of the beast of course the trapper artfully bushes the path so as to induce him to step full upon the trap he sets a great many of them and they require no looking after the diameter of the hoops is made proportionate to the size of the beast for which they are intended six inches interior diameter was the size used for buffalo and hartebeest  trapssteel traps should never be tied fast or the captured animal may struggle loose or even gnaw off his leg it is best to cut small bushes and merely to secure the traps to their cut

of these gnaws and crunches it it blows his head to atoms  poisoned bulletsi take the following extract from galignanis messengera new method of catching whales is now being tried with considerable success science having contributed to its discovery our readers are well aware of the deadly effects of the indian poison called wurare or woorali concerning which we have often had occasion to record the most interesting experiments especially in mentioning the attempts made to use it as a specific for lockjaw its peculiar action consisting in relaxing the muscular system strychnine is a poison producing the contrary effect the excessive contraction of that system or in other words tetanus or lockjaw it is a curious fact that by the conjunction of these two agents so diametrically opposite in their effects a poison is obtained that will kill almost instantly if only administered in the dose of half a milligramme per kilogramme of the animal to be subjected to its action provided its weight do not exceed ten kilogrammes if larger the dose must be proportionally increased m thiercelin the inventor of this poison composes it by mixing a salt of strychnine with onetwentieth of woorali to apply it to whale fishing he makes the compound up into cartridges of thirty grammes an ounce each which is enough to kill an animal of 60000 kilogrammes weight each cartridge is imbedded in the gunpowder contained in an explosive shell which is fired off on the whale in a late whaling voyage ten whales received such missiles and all died within from four to eighteen minutes after the infliction of the wound out of these ten whales six were cut up for their blubber and whalebone their remains were handled by careless men who frequently had scratches and sores on their skin and yet not one of them suffered the slightest injury a circumstance which shows that the poison cannot be transmitted from the fish to the men its poisonous action on the whale is however so great that practically the dose will have to be diminished so that the death of the creature may not be so sudden we should not forget to state that two out of the ten whales above mentioned were lost by one of the many accidents incident to whaling and that two others were of a kind that is not worth fishing for  poisoned arrowsarrows are most readily poisoned by steeping a thread in the juice and wrapping

other trees holly and young elder shoots also afford it the bark is boiled for seven or eight hours till quite soft and is then drained of its water and laid in heaps in pits dug in the ground where it is covered with stones and left for two or three weeks to ferment but less time is required if the weather be hot it is watered from time to time if necessary in this way it passes into a mucilaginous state and is then pounded into a paste washed in running water and kneaded till it is free from dirt and chips lastly it is left for four or five days in earthen vessels to ferment and

with the handduckswe hear of hindoos who taking advantage of the many gourds floating on their waters put one of them on their heads and wade in among wild ducks they pull them down one after another by their legs under water wring their necks and tie them to their girdle but in australia a swimmer binds grass and rushes or weeds round his head and takes a long fishingrod with a slip noose working over the pliant twig that forms the last joint of the rod when he comes near he gently raises the end and putting the noose over the head of the bird draws it under water to him he thus catches one after another and tucks the caught ones in his belt a windy day is generally chosen because the water is ruffled eyre  condors and vultures are caught by spreading a raw oxhide under which a man creeps with a piece of string in his hand while one or two other men are posted in ambush close by to give assistance at the proper moment when the bird flies down upon the bait his legs are seized by the man underneath the skin and are tied within it as in a bag all his flapping is then useless he cannot do mischief with his claws and he is easily overpowered  bolasthe bolas consists of three balls composed either of lead or stone two of them are heavy but the third is rather lighter they are fastened to long elastic strings made of twisted sinews and the ends of the strings are all tied

lets go the handball all the three balls whirl in a circle and twine round the object aimed at the aim is usually taken at the hindlegs of the animals and the cords twisted round them they become

our army and navy and used in many other countries as well are eminently suited to the wants of an expedition anything may be used for signalling that appears and disappears like a lantern or an opened and closed umbrella or that moves as a waved flag or a person walking to and fro on the crest of a hill against the sky sound also can be employed as long and short whistles their use can be thoroughly taught in two hours and however small the practice of the operators communication though slow is fairly accurate while in practised hands its rapidity is astonishing the proportion of time occupied by the flashes and intervals is as follows i extract all the rest of the article from the pamphlet published by the inventors of the system  flashing signals with flagssupposing the short flash to be half a second in duration the long flash should be fully a second and a half the interval between the flashes forming a figure should be equal to a short flash and the interval between two figures should be equal to a long flash after the last figure of the signal is finished there should be a pause equal to at least onethird of the time taken up by the figures after this pause the signal should be again repeated with the same measured flashes and intervals and so continued until answered by all to whom it is addressed  example of morse code  care must be taken never to commence a fresh signal before the answers to the last have ceased and signals are never to be answered until their repetitions have been observed a sufficient number of times to make an error impossible  fig 1 and fig 2sketch of signalling with flags as described below  the signalman may work from left to right or from right to left as shown in figs 1 and 2 according to convenience and the direction of the wind to make a short flash the flag is waved from a to b and back to the normal position a to make a long flash the flag is waved from a to c and back to the normal position a  the numerals 1 to 5 are therefore denoted by one to five waves of the flag from a to b recovering to a  the numeral 6 by a wave from a to c recovering to a the numeral 7 by a wave from a to b back to a and then to c recovering to the normal position a the numeral 8 is denoted by a wave from a to c back to a and then to b recovering to the normal position a the numeral 9 is denoted by two waves from a to b and one from a to c the numeral 0 by one wave from a to c recovering again to a and then two waves from a to b the other signs are made in the same manner so that a short motion shall always represent a short flash and a long motion a long flash  on the completion of the motions required for each sign the flag must always be brought to the position a when the word or group of figures is completed the flag may be lowered in front of the body  in receiving a message the flag should always be kept in the position a except when answering  in waving the flag the point of the staff should be made to describe a figure of 8 in the air to keep the flag clear  each signal party must consist of not less than two men whose duties will be as follows  in receiving messages no 1 works the flag for answering etc and refers to the code for the interpretation of the numbers received and calls out the words to no 2 no 2 fixes the telescope and reads from the distant station calling out the numbers as they are made for the information of no 1 and writes down the numbers and meaning thereof  suppose station a in communication with station bno 1 at a on being told by no 2 that b is about to send a message takes up his position at attention holding the flag over the left arm and under the right or vice versa across his body according to the wind with the code book in his hand no 2 fixes his eyes on the glass and on receiving the numbers from b calls them out to no 1 who ascertains their meaning from the code and gives the words to no 2 who writes them down in his book and then placing his eye to the glass tells no 1 to make the answer no 2 does not however direct the answer to be made until he is sure of the correctness of the signal received  flashing alphabet for use without a codethe following alphabet etc can be used under circumstances when it is not convenient or possible to have recourse to the signal book and forms in itself a perfect telegraphic system necessarily somewhat slow in its application but having the great advantage of requiring very little previous knowledge and practice to work with correctness the symbols and numbers expressing the alphabet are identical with those

a bit of lookingglass in the sun throwing its flash towards where you expect them to be it is quite astonishing at how great a distance the gleam of the glass will catch the sharp eyes of a bushman who has learnt to know what it is it is now a common signal in the north american prairies sullivan it should be recollected that a passing flash has far less briliancy than one that dwells for an appreciable time on the retina of the observer therefore the signaller should do all he can to steady his aim i find the steadiest way of holding the mirror is to rest the hand firmly against the forehead and to keep the eyes continually fixed upon the same distant object the glare of the sun that is reflected from each point of the surface of a mirror forms a cone of light whose vertical angle is constant and equal to that subtended by the sun hence when a flash is sent to a distant place the size of the mirror is of no appreciable importance in affecting the size of the area over which the flash is visible that area is the section of the fasciculus of cones that proceed from each point of the mirror which in the case we have supposed differs immaterially from the cone reflected from a single point hence if a man watches the play of the flash from his mirror upon a very near object it will appear to him of the shape and size of the mirror but as he retreats from the object the edges of the flash become rounded and very soon the flash appears a perfect circle of precisely the same apparent diameter as the disc of the sun it will in short look just like a very faint sun the signaller has to cause this disc of light to cover the person whose notice he wishes to attract i will proceed to show how he can do so but in the mean time it will be evident that a pretty careful aim is requisite or he will fail in his object the steadiness of his aim must be just twice as accurate neither more nor less as would suffice to point a rifle at the sun when it was sufficiently obscured by a cloud to bear being looked at for the object of the aim is of the same apparent size but a movement of a mirror causes the ray reflected from it to move through a double angle  the power of these sunsignals is extraordinarily great the result of several experiments that i made in england showed that the smallest mirror visible under atmospheric conditions such that the signallers station was discernible but dim subtended an angle of only onetenth of a second of a degree it is very important that the mirror should be of truly plane and parallel glass such as instrumentmakers procure the index glass of a fullsized sextant is very suitable for this purpose there is a loss of power when there is any imperfection in the glass a plane mirror only three inches across reflects as much of the sun as a globe of 120 feet diameter it looks like a dazzling star at ten miles distance  to direct the flash of the mirrorthere are makeshift ways of directing the flash of the mirror as by observing its play on an object some paces off nearly in line with the station it is wished to communicate with in doing this two cautions are requisite first the distance of the object must be so large compared to the diameter of the mirror that the play of the flash shall appear truly circular and exactly like a faint sun see preceding paragraph secondly be careful to bring the eye to the very edge of the mirror there should be as little dispart as possible as artillerymen would say unless these cautions be attended to very strictly the flash will never be seen at the distant station  sketch of arrangement as described below  an object in reality of a white colour but apparently dark owing to its being shaded shows the play of a mirrors flash better than any other the play of a flash sent through an open window on the walls of a room can be seen at upwards of 100 yards it is a good object by which to adjust my hand heliostat which i describe below two bits of paper and a couple of sticks arranged as in the drawing serve pretty well to direct a flash sight the distant object through the holes in the two bits of paper a and b at the ends of the horizontal stick and when you are satisfied that the stick is properly adjusted and quite steady take your mirror and throw the shadow of a upon b and further endeavour to throw the white speck in the shadow of a corresponding to its pinhole in it through the centre of the hole in b every now and then lay the mirror aside and bend down to see that a b continues to be properly adjusted  hand heliostatsome years ago i took great pains to contrive a convenient pocket instrument by which a traveller should be able to signal with the sun and direct his flash with certainty in whatever direction he desired i did so in the belief that a signalling power of extraordinary intensity could thus be made use of and i am glad to say i succeeded in my attempt i at last obtained a pretty pocket instrument the design of which i placed in the hands of messrs troughton and simms and upon the earlier models of which i read a paper before the british association in 1858 i called it a hand heliostat i always carry one when i travel for it is a continual source of amusement the instrument is shown in fig 1 p 280 and its principle is illustrated by fig 2 the scale is about 23  e is the eye of the signaller m the mirror and l s fig 2 a tube containing at one end l a lens and at the other s a screen of white porcelain or unpolished ivory placed at the exact solar focus of l a shade k with two holes in it is placed before l let r r be portions of a large pencil of parallel rays proceeding from any one point on the suns surface and reflected from the mirror as r r fig 2 r impinges upon the lens l through one of the holes in k and r goes free toward some distant point o those that impinge on the lens will be brought to a focus on s where a bright speck of light might be seen this speck radiates light in all direction some of the rays proceeding from it impinge on the lens at the other hole in the shade k as shown in fig 2 and are reduced by its agency to parallelism with r and r that is with the rays that originally left the mirror consequently e looking partly at the edge of the lens and partly into space sees a bright speck of light in the former coincident with the point o in the latter  fig 1 and fig 2 as described in the text  what is true for one point in the suns disc is true for every point in it accordingly the signaller sees an image of the sun and not a mere speck of light in the lens and the part of the landscape which that image appears to overlay is precisely that part of it over which the flash from his mirror extends or in other words it is that from any point of which a distant spectator may see some part or other of the suns disc reflected in the mirror there is no difficulty in signalling when the sun is far behind the back if the eyetubes are made to pull out to a total length of five inches otherwise the shadow of the head interferes for want of space the drawing represents the tubes as only partly drawn out the instrument is perfectly easy to manage and letters can be signalled by flashes its power is perfectly marvellous on a day so hazy that colours on the largest scalesuch as green fields and white housesare barely distinguishable at seven miles distance a lookingglass no larger than the fingernail transmits its signals clearly visible to the naked eye  i have made a makeshift arrangement on the principle of my heliostat using the object glass of an operaglass for the lens and an ordinary lookingglass the great size and short focus of the object glass is a great convenience when using a mirror with a wide frame  professor w h miller the foreign secretary of the royal society has since invented a yet more compact method of directing the flash which he has described in the proceedings of the royal society for 1865 it consists of a plate of silvered glass one of whose rectangular corners is accurately ground and polished on looking into the corner when the glass is properly held an image of the sun is seen which overlays the actual flash beautifully simple as this instrument is i do not like it so much as my own for the very fact of its requiring no setting is its drawback with mine when the image of the sun is lost it is immediately found again by simply rotating the instrument on its axis but with professor millers the image must be felt for wholly anew  fire signalsfirebeacons hanging up a lantern or setting fire to an old nest high up in a tree serve as nightsignals but they are never to be depended on without previous concert as bushes and undulations of the ground will often hide them entirely the sparks from a wellstruck flint and steel can be seen for much more than a mile  smoke signalsthe smoke of fires is seen very far by day and green wood and rotten wood make the most smoke it is best to make two fires 100 yards apart lest your signalling should be mistaken for an ordinary fire in the bush these double fires are a very common signal to vessels in the offing on the african coast  other signalsby sighta common signal for a distant scout is that he should ride or walk round and round in a circle from right to left or else in one from left to right  mr parkyns speaking of abyssinia describes the habits of a caste of robbers in the following wordsat other times they will lie concealed near a road with scouts in every direction on the lookout yet no one venturing to speak but only making known by signs what he may have to communicate to his companions or leader thus he will point to his ear and foot on hearing footsteps to his eyes on seeing persons approach or to his tongue if voices be audible and will also indicate on his fingers the numbers of those coming describing also many particulars as to how many porters beasts of burden or for riding there may be with the party  a kite has been suggested as a day signal and also a kite with some kind of squib let off by a slowlight and attached to its tail as one by night colonel jackson  soundwhistling through the fingers can be heard at considerable distances the accomplishment should be learnt cooing in the australian fashion or jvdling in that of the swiss are both of them heard a long way the united holloa of many voices is heard much further than separate cries the cracking of a whip has a very penetrating sound  smellsan abominable smell arrests the attention at night  letters carried by animalsin short reconnoitring expeditions made by a small detachment from a party the cattle or dogs are often wild and run home to their comrades on the first opportunity in the event of not being able to watch them owing to accident or other cause advantage may be taken of their restlessness by tying a note to one of their necks and letting them go and serve as postmen or rather as carrierpigeons    bearings by compass sun etc   pocket compassa pocket compass should not be too small if one of the little toy compasses be carried in the pocket it should be as a reserve and not for regular use a toy compass will of course tell n from nne and the like and that may be very useful information but the traveller will find that he constantly needs more precise directions he doubts the identity of some hill or the destination of some path and finds on referring to his map that the difference of bearing upon which he must base his conclusion is small he therefore requires a good sized compass to determine the bearing with certainty one from 1 12 to 2 inches in diameter is practically the best it should have plenty of depth so that the card may traverse freely even when the instrument is inclined it should be light in weight that it may not be easily jarred by a blow the catch that relieves the card when the instrument is closed should be selfacting and should act well lastly the movements of the needle should be quick one that makes slow oscillations should be peremptorily refused whatever its other merits may be the graduation of the degrees on the card should be from 0 degrees to 360 degrees north being 0 degrees and east 90 degrees i wish some optician would make aluminum cards the material can be procured as foil like tinfoil it can then be stamped and embossed in which case it retains its shape perfectly but i cannot satisfy myself as to a good pattern nor do i see how to make the north and south halves of the disc sufficiently different in appearance  compass for use at nightthe great majority of compasses are wellnigh useless in the dark that is when it is most important to be able to consult them they are rarely so constructed that the difference between the north and south sides is visible by moonlight or by the light of a cigar or piece of tinder the more modern contrivances are very effective in these the southern half of the compass card is painted black the northern being left white with a very faint light this difference can be appreciated in compasses consisting simply of a needle the north end of the needle should have a conspicuous arrowhead it is extraordinary how much the power of seeing a compass or a watch at night is increased by looking nearly at it through a magnifyingglass thus young people who can focus their vision through a wide range may be observed poring with their eyes close to their books when the light wanes so again at nighttime a placard even in large type is illegible at a short distance but easily read on approaching it it seems in order that a faint image on the retina should be appreciated by the nerves of sight that image must have considerable extent  moonlight or the light of a cigar may be condensed on the compass by a burning glass or other substitute for it see burning glass  true and magnetic bearingsthe confusion between true and magnetic bearings is a continual trouble even to the most experienced travellers sir thomas mitchells exploring party very nearly sustained a loss by mistaking the one for the other i recommend that the points of the compass viz north nne etc should be solely used for the traveller for his true bearings and the degrees as 25 degrees or n 25 degrees e for his magnetic there would then be no reason why the two nomenclatures should interfere with one another for a travellers recollection of the lay of a country depends entirely upon true bearingsor sunrise sunset and the starsand is expressed by north nne etc but his surveying data which find no place in his memory but are simply consigned to his notebook are necessarily registered in degrees to give every facility for carrying out this principle a round of paper should be pasted in the middle of the travellers pocketcompass card just large enough to hide the ordinary rhumbs but leaving uncovered the degrees round its rim on this disk of paper the points of the compass true bearings should be marked so as to be as exact as possible for the country about to be visited  errors in magnetic bearingsthe compassneedle is often found to be disturbed and sometimes apparently bewitched when laid upon hilltops even when they consist of bare masses of granite the disturbance is easily accounted for by the hornblende in the granite or by other ironbearing rocks explorers naturally select hills as their points of triangulation but compass observations on hilltops if unchecked by a sextant observation of the suns bearings are never so reliable as those taken on a plain  sketch of card as described on following pages  bearings by sun and starsit requires very great practice to steer well by stars for on an average they change their bearings even faster than they change their altitudes in tropical countries the zodiacal stars  as orion and antaresgive excellent east and west points the great bear is useful when the north pole cannot be seen for you may calculate by the eye whereabout it would be in the heavens when the pointers were vertical or due north and the southern cross is available in precisely the same way the true north pole is about 1 12 degree or 3 diameters of the full moon apart from the pole star and its place is on a line between the pole star and the great bear an almanac calculated to show the bearing and the times of moonrise and moonset for the country to be travelled over as well as those of sunrise and sunset would be a very great convenience it would be worth while for a traveller accustomed to such calculations to make one for himself  diagramthe diagram preceding page is intended to be traced in lines of different colours when it will be found to be far less confused than at present  its object is to enable a traveller to use the sun both as a rude watch and as a compass the diagram is calculated for the latitude of london but will do with more or less accuracy for the whole of england a traveller going to other countries may easily draw up one for himself and on a larger scale if he prefers it by using the azimuth tables and the horary tables of lynn  the diagram represents 1st circles of equal altitudes 2ndly the path of sun stars etc for each 10th degree of declination 3rdly the hour angles all projected down upon4thlythe level compass card  thus six circles are drawn round the centre of the compass card at equal distances apart each ring between them representing a space of 15 degrees in altitude  the following angles were then calculated for each 10th degree of declination in turns vizthe height of the sun etc when above the horizon at each point of the compass 2ndly the bearing of the sun at each consecutive hour these points were dotted out and by joining the several sets of them the drawing was made  the broken lines which diverge in curves from p are hour lines those which surround p in more or less complete ovals are the paths of the sun and stars for each 10th degree of declination the prominent line running from e round to w being its path when on the equator  the diagram when it is traced out for use should have the names of the months written in coloured ink on either side of the south line at places corresponding to the declination of the sun during those months viz  january        s  23 degrees  to          s     17 degrees february       s  17                     s     8 march          s   7                     n     4 april          n   5                     n    15 may            n  15                     n

afterwards be rubbed out corresponding to the date of travel and there will be no further confusion  then to know what oclock it is span out see spanning roughly the altitude of the sun the point in the diagram where the altitude so obtained crosses the pencil mark corresponds to the position of the sun the hour is then read off and the compass bearings on the diagram are adjusted by holding it level and turning it round until a line drawn from its centre through the point in question points towards the sun as to the moon or a star if its declination be unknown but its bearing and altitude being given its declination and path may be found and therefore the time since its rising or before its setting a most useful piece of information to a traveller watches break and compasses cannot be used on horseback without stopping and therefore a diagram of this description of which any number of copies can be traced out may be of use for rough purposes  other signs of directionbearings by the growth of treesin exposed situations and near the sea the growth of trees is rarely symmetrical they betray by their bent heads and stunted branches the direction of the prevalent influences most adverse to their growth this direction is constant over wide districts in a flat country but cannot be equally relied upon in a hilly one where the mountains and valleys affect the conditions of shade and shelter and deflect the course of the wind  moss grows best where there is continuous damp therefore it prefers that side of a tree which affords the most suitable combination of exposure to damp winds and shelter from the sun when the winds do not differ materially in dampness the north side of the forest trees are the most thickly covered with moss  bearings by the shape of anthillsthat most accurate observer pierre huber writes as follows concerning the nests of the yellow ants which are abundantly to be found in the swiss alps and in some other mountainous countries it must be recollected in reading his statement that the chief occupation of ants is to move their eggs and larvae from one part of the nest to another to ensure them a warm and equable temperature therefore it is reasonable to expect that the nests of ants should be built on a uniform principle as regards their shape and aspect huber says they serve as a compass to mountaineers when they are surrounded by thick mists or have lost their way during the night they do so in the following mannerthe anthills of the yellow ants which are by far more numerous and more high in the mountains than anywhere else are longer than they are broad and are of a similar pattern in other respects their direction is invariably from east to west their highest point and their steepest side are turned towards the point of sunrise in the wintertime au levant dhiver and they descend with a gradual slope in the opposite direction i have verified these experiences of the shepherds upon thousands of anthills and have found a very small number of exceptions these occurred only in the case where the anthills had been disturbed by men or animals the anthills do not maintain the constancy of their form in the lowlands where they are more exposed to such accidents  ripplemarks on snow or sandthe siberians travel guided by the ripples in the snow which run in a pretty fixed direction owing to the prevalence of a particular wind the ripples in a desert of sand are equally good as guides or the wind itself if it happens to be blowing especially to a person pushing through a tangled belt of forest before leaving a wellknown track and striking out at night into the broad open plain notice well which way the wind blows as regards the course you are about to pursue  flight of birdsi have read somewhere that in the old days coasting sailors occasionally took pigeons with them and when they had lost their bearings they let one fly which it did at once to the land  to follow a track at nightwhere the track is well marked showers of sparks ably struck with a flint and steel are sufficient to show it without taking the pains of making a flame  smell of an old trackthe earth of an old and welltrodden road has a perceptible smell from the dung and trampling of animals passing over it especially near to encampments it is usual at night when a guide doubts whether or no he is in the track to take up handfuls of dirt and smell it it is notorious that cattle can smell out a road    marks for the wayside   marks on treescutting marksa very excellent treeline is made by cutting deep notches in a line of trees starting from some conspicuous object so that the notches will face the men that are to be guided by it the trees must be so selected that three or at least two of them are in sight at once the notch or sliced bark of a tree is called a blaze in bush language these blazed trees are of much use as fingerposts on a dark night they are best made by two persons one chipping the trees on his right and the other those on his left if the axes are quite sharp they only need to be dropped against the tree in order to make the chip doing so hardly retards a person in his walking another way more suitable to some kinds of forests is to strike the knife into the left side of the tree to tear down a foot of bark and to leave the bark hanging for a double extent of white surface is shown in this way also to break down tops of saplings and leave them hanging the undersides of the leaves being paler than the upper and the different lines of the reversed foliage make a broken bush to look unnatural among health trees and it quickly arrests the attention if you want a tree to be wellscored or slashed so as to draw attention to it without fail fire bullets into it as into a mark and let the natives cut them out in their own way for the sake of the lead they will effect your purpose admirably without suspecting it  stamping marks on treesthe keepers of some of the communal forests in switzerland are provided with small axes having the back of the axehead worked into a large and sharp die the impression of the die being some letter or cipher indicating the commune when these foresters wish to mark a tree they give it first a slice with the edge of the axe and then turning the axe they deal it a heavy blow with the back of the axehead by the first operation they prepare a clean surface for their mark and by the second they stamp their cipher deeply into the wood  branding treessome explorers take branding irons and use them to mark each of their campingplaces with its number this is especially useful in australian travel where the country is monotonous and there are few natives to tell the names of places  faggot hung to a treea bundle of grass or twigs about 2 feet long slung by its middle athwart a small tree at the level of the eye by the side of a path is well calculated to catch the attention its lines are so different to those seen elsewhere in the forest that it would be scarcely possible to overlook it  boat or canoe routes through lakes well studded with islands can be well marked by trimming conspicuous trees until only a tuft of branches is left at the top this is called in the parlance of the far west a lopstick  wooden crossesa simple structure like fig 1 is put together with a single nail or any kind of lashing it catches the attention immediately  fig 1 sketch of cross as described  marks with stonesmarks cut on stonei have observed a very simple and conspicuous permanent mark used in forestroads as represented in fig 2 the stone is 8 inches above ground 3 12 wide 8 inches long the mark is black and deeply cut an arrowhead may be chiselled in the face of a rock and filled with melted lead with a small cold chisel 3 inches long and 14 inch wide a great deal of stone carving may be readily effected  sketch of stone with incised cross  piles of stonespiles of stones are used by the arabs in their deserts and in most mountaintracts an immense length of the road both in the government of the don cossacks and in that of tambov is marked out on a gigantic scale by heaps of stones varying from 4 to 6 feet high these are visible from a great distance and it is very striking to see the double row of them indicating the line of route over the great steppe  undulations which often present no other trace of the hand of man spottiswoode  sketch of piled stones  gipsy markswhen gipsies travel the party that goes in advance leaves marks at crossroads in order to guide those who follow these marks are called patterans there are three patterans in common use one is to pluck three large handfuls of grass and to throw them on the ground at a short distance from one another in the direction taken another is to draw a cross on the ground with one arm much longer than the rest as a pointera cross is better than any other simple mark for it catches many different lights in marking a road do not be content with marking the dustan hours breeze or a shower will efface it but take a tentpeg or sharpened stick and fairly break into the surface and your mark will be surprisingly durable the third of the gipsy patterans is of especial use in the dark a cleft stick is planted by the roadside close to the hedge and in the cleft is an arm like a signpost the gipsies feel for this at crossroads searching for it on the lefthand side borrows zincali a twig stripped bare with the exception of two or three leaves at its end is sometimes laid on the road with its bared end pointing forwards  other similar marks of direction and locality in use in various parts of the world are as followsknotting twigs breaking boughs and letting them dangle down a bit of white paper in a cleft stick spilling water or liquid of any kind on the pathway a litter made of paper torn into small shreds or of a stick cut into chips or of feathers of a bird a string with papers knotted to it like the tail of a boys kitetie

finding the way   recollection of a pathit is difficult to estimate by recollection only the true distances between different points in a road that has been once travelled over there are many circumstances which may mislead such as the accidental tedium of one part or the pleasure of another but besides these there is always the fact that in a long days journey a mans faculties of observation are more fresh and active on starting than later in the day when from the effect of weariness even peculiar objects will fail to arrest his attention now as a mans recollection of an interval of time is as we all know mainly derived from the number of impressions that his memory has received while it was passing it follows that so far as this cause alone is concerned the earlier part of his days journey will always seem to have been disproportionately long compared to the latter it is remarkable on taking a long halfdays walk and subsequently returning after resting some hours how long a time the earlier part of the return journey seems to occupy and how rapidly different wellremembered points seem to succeed each other as the traveller draws homewards in this case the same cause acts in opposite directions in the two journeys  to walk in a straight line through forestsevery man who has had frequent occasion to find his way from one place to another in a forest can do so without straining his attention thus in the account of lord miltons travels we read of some north american indians who were incapable of understanding the white mans difficulty in keeping a straight line but no man who has not had practice can walk through trees in a straight line even with the utmost circumspection  after making several experiments i think the explanation of the difficulty and the way of overcoming it are as followsif a man walks on a level surface guided by a single conspicuous mark he is almost sure not to travel towards it in a straight line his muscular sense is not delicate enough to guard him from making small deviations if therefore after walking some hundred yards towards a single mark on ground that preserves his track the traveller should turn round he will probably be astonished to see how sinuous his course has been however if he take note of a second mark and endeavour to keep it strictly in a line with the first he will easily keep a perfectly straight course but if he cannot find a second mark it will not be difficult for him to use the tufts of grass the stones or the other accidents of the soil in its place they need not be precisely in the same line with the mark but some may be on the right and some on the left of it in which case as he walks on the perspective of their change of position will be symmetrical lastly if he has not even one definite mark but is walking among a throng of forest trees he may learn to depend wholly on the symmetry of the changes of perspective of the trees as a guide to his path he will keep his point of sight unchanged and will walk in its direction and if he deviates from that direction the want of symmetry in the change of perspective on either side of the point on which he wishes to walk will warn him of his error the appreciation of this optical effect grows easily into a habit when the more distant view happens to be shut out the traveller must regain his line under guidance similar to that by which a sailor steers who only looks at his compass at intervalsi mean by the aspect of the sky the direction of the wind and the appearance of the forest when it has any peculiarity of growth dependent on direction the chance of his judgment being erroneous to a small extent is the same on the right hand as on the left consequently his errors tend to compensate each other i wish some scientific traveller would rigidly test the powers of good bushmen and find their probable angular deviation from the true course under different circumstances their line should be given to them and they should be told to make smokes at intervals the position of these smokes could be easily mapped out by the traveller  the art of walking in a straight line is possessed in an eminent degree by good ploughmen they always look ahead and let the plough take care of itself  to find the way down a hillsideif on arriving at the steep edge of a ridge you have to take the caravan down into the plain and it appears that a difficulty may arise in finding a good way for it descend first yourself as well as you can and seek for a road as you climb back again it is far more easy to succeed in doing this as you ascend than as you descend because when at the bottom of a hill its bold bluffs and precipices face you and you can at once see and avoid them whereas at the top these are precisely the parts that you overlook and cannot see  blind pathsfaintlymarked paths over grass blind paths are best seen from a distance  lost in a fognapoleon when riding with his staff across a shallow arm of the gulf of suez was caught in a fog he utterly lost his way and found himself in danger he thereupon ordered his staff to ride from him in radiating lines in all directions and that such of them as should find the water to become more shallow should shout out  miragewhen it is excessive it is most bewildering a man will often mistake a tuft of grass or a tree or other most dissimilar object for his companion or his horse or game an old traveller is rarely deceived by mirage if he doubts he can in many cases adopt the following hint given by dr kane refraction will baffle a novice on the ice but we have learned to baffle refraction by sighting the suspected object with your rifle at rest you soon detect motion  lost pathif you fairly lose your way in the dark do not go on blundering hither and thither till you are exhausted but make as comfortable bivouac as you can and start at daybreak fresh on your search  the bank of a watercourse which is the best of clues affords the worst of paths and is quite unfit to be followed at night the ground is always more broken in the neighbourhood of a river than far away from it and the vegatation is more tangled explorers travel most easily by keeping far away from the banks of streams because then they have fewer broad tributaries and deep ravines to cross  if in the daytime you find that you have quite lost your way set systematically to work to find it at all event do not make the matter doubly perplexing by wandering further mark the place very distinctly where you discover yourself at fault that it may be the centre of your search be careful to ride in such places as will preserve your tracks break twigs if you are lost in a woodland if in the open country drag a stick to make a clear trail marks scratched on the ground to tell the hour and day that you passed by will guide a relieving party a great smoke is useful for the same purpose and is visible for a long distance see signals  a man who loses himself especially in a desert is sadly apt to find his presence of mind forsake him the sense of desolation is so strange and overpowering but he may console himself with the statistics of his chance of safetyviz that travellers though constantly losing their party have hardly ever been known to perish unrelieved  when the lost traveller is dead beat with fatigue let him exert a strong control over himself for if he gives way to terror and wanders wildly about hither and thither he will do no good and exhaust his vital powers much sooner he should erect some signalas conspicuous a one as he canwith something fluttering upon it sit down in the shade and listening keenly for any sound of succour bear his fate like a man his ultimate safety is merely a question of time for he is sure to be searched for and if he can keep alive for two or three days he will in all probability be found and saved to relieve thirst p 223 hunger p 197  theorywhen you discover you are lost ask yourself the following three questions they comprise the abc of the art of pathfinding and i will therefore distinguish them by the letters a b and c respectivelya what is the least distance that i can with certainty specify within which the caravanpath the river or the seashore that i wish to regain lies b what is the direction in a vague general way towards which the path or river runs or the seacoast tends c when i last left the path did i turn to the left or to the right  as regards a calculate coolly how long you have been riding or walking and at what pace since you left your party subtract for stoppages and wellrecollected zigzags allow a mile and a half per hour for the pace when you have been loitering on foot and three and a half when you have been walking fast bear in mind that occasional running makes an almost inappreciable difference and that a man is always much nearer to the lost path than he is inclined to fear  as regards b if the man knows the course of the path to within eight points of the compass or onefourth of the whole horizon it is a great gain or even if he knows b to within twelve points say 120 degrees or onethird of the whole horizon his knowledge is available for instance let us suppose a mans general idea of the run of the path to be that it goes in a northerly and southerly direction then if he is also positive that the path does not deviate more than to the ne on the one side of that direction or to the nw on the other he knows the direction to within eight points similarly he is sure to twelve points if his limits on either hand are ene and wnw respectively  c requires no further explanation  now if a man can answer all three questions a b to within eight points of the compass and c he is four and a half times as well off as if he could only answer a as will be seen by the following considerations a knowledge of b in addition to a is of only onethird the use that it would be if c also were known  1 let p fig 1 be the point where the traveller finds himself at fault and let p d to be a distance within which the path certainly lies then the circle e d f somewhere cuts the path and the traveller starting from p must first go to d and then make the entire circuit d e h f d before he has exhausted his search this distance of p d  d e h f d  p d  6 p d nearly  7 p d altogether which gives the length of road that the man must be prepared to travel over who can answer no other than the question a of course p d may cut the path but i am speaking of the extreme distance which the lost man may have to travel  sketch as described above  supposing that question b can be answered as well as question a an that the direction of the line of road lies certainly within the points of the compass p s and p r draw the circumscribing parallelogram g l h e m whose sides are respectively parallel to p s and p r join l m by the conditions of this problem the path must somewhere cut the circle e d f and since l m cuts l h which is a tangent to it it is clear it must cut every pathsuch as a a parallel to l h or to p rthat cuts the circle similarly the same line l m must cut every path parallel to p s such as b b now if l m cuts every path that is parallel to either of the extreme directions p r or p s it is obvious that it must also cut every path that is parallel to an intermediate direction such as c c but  pl  phcos hpl  pdcos 12 rps  the consequence of which is that p l exceeds p d by onesixth onehalf as much again or twice as much again according as r p s  60 degrees 90 degrees degrees or 140 degrees  the traveller who can only answer the questions a and b but not c must be prepared to travel from p to l and back again through p to m a distance equal to 3 p l if however he can answer the question c he knows at once whether to travel towards l or towards m and he has no return journey to fear at the worst he has simply to travel the distance p l  the probable distance as distinguished from the utmost possible distance that a man may have to travel in the three cases can be calculated mathematically it would be out of place here to give the working of the little problem but i append the rough numerical results in a table  table as referred to above  the epitome of the whole is this1 if you can only answer the question a you must seek for the lost path by the tedious circle plan or what is the same and a more manageable way of setting to work by travelling in an octagon each side of which must be equal to fourfifths of p d see fig 2  fig 2  that is to say look at your compass and start in any direction you please we will say to the south as represented in the drawing travel for a distance p d then supposing you have not crossed the path turn at right angles and start afreshwe will suppose your present direction to be westtravel for a distance 410 of p d which will take you to 1 then turn to the nw and travel for a distance 810 of p d which will take you to 2 then to the n for a similar distance which will take you to 3 and so on till the octagon has been completed if you know b to eight points and not c adopt the l m system also if you know a and c and b to within thirteen points out of the sixteen that form the semicircle you may still adopt the l m system but not otherwise a rough diagram scratched on the ground with a stick would suffice to recall the above remarks to a travellers recollection    caches and depots   cachesit is easy enough to choose a spot which you yourself shall again recognise for digging a hole where stores of all kinds may be buried against your return neither is it difficult to choose one so that you may indicate its position to others or else leave it to a party who are travelling in concert to find it out for themselves but excessive caution in the mode of depositing the stores is in every case required as hungry and thieving natives keep watch on all the movements of a party they follow their tracks and hunt over their old campingplaces in search of anything there may be to pick up and hyenas wolves wild dogs and all kinds of prowling animals guided by their sharp scent will soon scratch up any provisions that are buried carelessly or in such a way as to taint the earth  the natives in ceylon when they wish to make a depot of game jerk it put the dry meat into the hollow of a tree fill up the reservoir with honey and plaster it over with clay  some dried plants of m bourgeau the botanist attached to captain pallisers expedition to the rocky mountains remained underground for ten months without injury  newly disturbed ground sinks when wettedif a cache be made in dry weather and the ground be simply levelled over it the first heavy rain will cause the earth to sink and will proclaim the hidden store to an observant eye soldiers in sacking a town find out hastilyburied treasures by throwing a pailful of water over any suspected spot if the ground sinks it has surely been recently disturbed  best place for a cachethe best position to choose for a cache is in a sandy or gravelly soil on account of its dryness and the facility of digging old burrows or the gigantic but abandoned hills of white ants may be thought of if the stores are enclosed in cases of painted tin also clefts in rocks some things can be conveniently buried under water the place must be chosen under circumstances that admit of your effacing all signs of the ground having been disturbed a good plan is to set up your tent and to dig a deep hole in the floor depositing what you have to bury wrapped in an oilcloth in an earthen jar or in a wooden vessel according to what you are able to get it must be secure against the attacks of the insects of the place avoid the use of skins for animals will smell and dig them out continue to inhabit the tent for at least a day well stamping and smoothing down the soil at leisure after this change the position of the tent shifting the tetheringplace or kraal of your cattle to where it stood they will speedily efface any marks that may be left travellers often make their fires over the holes where their stores are buried but natives are so accustomed to suspect fireplaces that this plan does not prove to be safe during summer travel in countries pestered with gnats a smoke fire for the horses that is a fire for keeping off flies made near the place will attract the horses and cause them to trample all about this is an excellent way of obliterating marks left about the cache  hiding small thingsit is easy to make a small cache by bending down a young tree tying your bundle to the top and letting it spring up again a sprucetree gives excellent shelter to anything placed in its branches see also what is said on burying letters p 303  hiding large thingslarge things as a wagon or boat must either be pushed into thick bushes or reeds and left to chance or they may be buried in a sand drift or in a sandy deposit by a river side a small reedy island is a convenient place for such caches  double cachessome persons when they know that their intentions are suspected make two caches the one with a few things buried in it and concealed with little care the other containing those that are really valuable and very artfully made thieves are sure to discover the first and are likely enough to omit a further search  to find your store again you should have ascertained the distance and bearing by compass of the hole from some marked placeas a treeabout which you are sure not to be mistaken or from the centre of the place where your fire was made which is a mark that years will not entirely efface if there be anything in the ground itself to indicate the position of the hole you have made a clumsy cache it is not a bad plan after the things are buried and before the tent is removed to scratch a furrow a couple of inches deep and three or four feet long and picking up any bits of stick reeds or straw that may be found at hand lying upon the ground to place them end to end in it these will be easy enough to find again by making a cross furrow and when found will lead you straight above the depot they would never excite suspicion even if a native got hold of them for they would appear to have been dropped or blown on the ground by chance not seen and trampled in mr atkinson mentions an ingenious way by which the boundaries of valuable mining property are marked in the ural a modification of which might serve for indicating caches a trench is dug and filled with charcoal beat small and then covered over the charcoal lasts for ever and cannot be tampered with without leaving an unmistakable mark  secreting jewelsbefore going to a rich but imperfectly civilised country travellers sometimes buy jewels and bury them in their flesh they make a gash put the jewels in and allow the flesh to grow over them as it would over a bullet the operation is more sure to succeed if the jewels are put into a silver tube with rounded ends for silver does not irritate if the jewels are buried without the tube they must have no sharp edges the best place for burying them is in the left arm at the spot chosen for vaccination a traveller who was thus provided would always have a small capital to fall back upon though robbed of everything he wore  a chain of gold is sometimes carried by arabs who sew it in dirty leather under their belt they cut off and sell a link at a time burton  the gunstock is a good receptacle for small valuables unscrew the heelplate and bore recesses insert what you desire after wrapping it tightly in cloth and plugging it in then replace the heelplate peal  depositing lettersto direct attention to the place of depositwhen you make a cache in an inhabited land for the use of a travelling party who are ignorant of your purpose there is of course some difficulty in ensuring that their attention should be directed to the place but that the natives should have no clue to it if you have means of gashing painting or burning characters something of this sort see fig they will explain themselves  sketch of direction plate  savages however take such pains to efface any mark they may find left by white men entertaining thoughts like those of morgiana in the arabian nights tale of the forty thieves that it would be most imprudent to trust to a single mark a relief party should therefore be provided with a brandingiron and moveable letters and with paints and they should mark the tree in many places a couple of hours spent in doing this would leave more marks than the desultory efforts of roving savages would be likely to efface a good sign to show that europeans have visited a spot is a saw mark no savages use saws it catches the eye directly  a system occasionally employed by arctic expeditions of making a cache 10 feet true north and not magnetic north from the cairn or mark deserves to be generally employed at least with modifications let me therefore suggest that persons who find a cairn built of a tree marked so as to attract notice and who are searching blindly in all directions for further clue should invariably dig out and examine that particular spot the notice deposited there may consist of no more than a single sentence to indicate some distant point as the place where the longer letter is buried i hope it will be understood that the precaution of always burying a notice 10 feet true north of the cairn mark is proposed as additional to and not in the place of other contrivances for giving information there will often arise some doubt as to the exact point in the circumference of the cairn or mark whence the 10 feet measurement should be made this is due to the irregularity of the bases of all such marks therefore when searching for letters a short trench running to the north will frequently have to be dug and not a mere hole i should propose that the short notice be punched or pricked on a thin sheet of lead made by pouring two or three melted bullets on a flat stone and that the plate so made and inscribed should be rolled up and pushed into a hole bored or burnt through the head of a large tent peg the peg could be driven deeply in the ground quite out of sight without disturbing the surrounding earth it might even suffice to pick up a common stone and to scratch or paint upon it what you had to say and to leave it on the ground with its written face downwards at the place in question  to secure buried letters from dampthey may be wrapped in waxed cloth or paper if there be no fear of the ravages of insects lead plate is far more safe it can be made easily enough by a traveller out of his bullets see lead a glass bottle with something that insects cannot eat such as leadplate sealingwax or clay put carefully over the cork or an earthen jar may be used the quill of a large feather will hold a long letter if it is written in very small handwriting and on thin paper and it will preserve it from the wet after the letter has been rolled up and inserted in the quill the open end of the latter may be squeezed flat between two stones heated sufficiently to soften the quill see horn but not so hot as to burn it and then for greater security against wet the end of the quill should be twisted tight wax affords another easy means of closing the quill  picturewritinga very many excellent bushrangers are unable to read rude picturewriting is often used by them especialy in america the figure of a man with a spear or bow drawn as a child would draw stands for a savage one with a hat or gun for a european horses oxen and sheep are equally to be drawn lines represent numbers and arrowheads direction even without more conventional symbols a vast deal may be expressed by rude picturewriting  reconnoitring barren countries by help of porters and cachesthe distance to which an explorer can attain in barren countries depends on the number of days provisions that he can carry with him half of his load supports him on his way out the other half on his way home but if he start in company with a laden porter he may reserve his own store and supply both himself and the porter from the pack carried by the latter when half of this is consumed the other half may be divided into two equal portions the one is retained by the porter who makes his way back to camp consuming it as he goes and the other is cached see caches for the sustenance of the traveller on his return journey this being arranged the traveller can start from the cache with his own load of provisions untouched just as he would have started from the camp if he had had no porter to assist him it is evident a process of this description might be frequently repeated that a large party of porters might start and by a system of successive subdivisions they could enable the traveller to reach a position many days journey distant from his camp with his own load of provisions and with other food placed in a succession of caches for the supply of his wants all the way home again the principle by which this may be effected without waste is to send back at each successive step the smallest detachment competent to travel alone and to do this as soon as one half of their load of food has been consumed by the whole party then the other half is to be divided into two portions one consisting of rations to supply the detachment back to the previous cache whence their journey home has been provided for the other portion to be buried to supply rations for the remainder of the party when they shall have returned either all together or else in separate and successive detachments back to the previous cache whence their journey home has also been provided for an inspection of the table which i annex p 307 makes details unnecessary the dotted lines show how the porters who first return may be dispatched afresh as relief parties i give in the table a schedule of the three most important cases in these the regular supply of two meals per diem and a morning and an afternoon journey are supposed i wrote a paper on this subject which is published in the royal geographical societys proceedings vol ii to which i refer those who care to inquire further into the matter cases where each man or horse carries a number of rations intermediate to those specified in the table are perhaps too complicated for use without much previous practice it would be easy for a leader to satisfy himself that he was making no mistake and to drill his men to any one of the tabulated cases by painting a row of sticks 50 yards apart to represent the successive haltingplaces of his intended journey and by making his men go through a sham rehearsal of what they would severally have to do then each mans duties could be written down in a schedule and all possibility of mistake be avoided  the table represents the proceedings of four men or horses and men who leave camp two turn back at p1 one more turns back at p2 and the remaining man pushes on to p3 food has been cached for him both at p2 and p1 but to make matters doubly sure a relief party as shown by the dotted line can be sent to meet him at p2  in case a each man             carries 1 12 days rations         b         or horse         3 12 days rations for                                          himself and drivers         c each man or horse  carries 5 12 days rations for                                          himself and drivers  we will take the case c as an example the figures that refer to it are in the lines adjacent to the letter c in the table they are those in the uppermost line and also those in the line up the lefthand side of the diagram and they stand for days journey and for days respectively p1 is reached after 1 12 days travel p2 after 3 days p3 after 6 days from camp the entire party might consist of 5 men 2 carts one a very light one and four horses together with one saddle and bridle the heavier cart and 2 men and 2 horses would turn back at p1 one of the two horses of the second cart would be saddled and ridden back by a third man from p2 and finally the remaining cart single horse and 2 men would turn back after 6 days from p3the relief party would originallyconsist of the first cart and 3 horses on arriving at p1 a horse and man would be sent back at p2 it would have more than enough spare rations to admit of its waiting two whole days for the exploring cart if it were necessary to do so  full page diagram as described above  it will be seen from the table that as 6 days journey is the limit to which c can explore so 4 days journey is the limit for b and 2 days for a but where abundance of provision is secured at p2 by means of a relief party the explorers might well make an effort and travel on half rations to a greater distance than the limits here assigned    management of savages   general remarksa frank joking but determined manner joined with an air of showing more confidence in the good faith of the natives than you really feel is the best it is observed that a seacaptain generally succeeds in making an excellent impression on savages they thoroughly appreciate common sense truth and uprightness and are not half such fools as strangers usually account them if a savage does mischief look on him as you would on a kicking mule or a wild animal whose nature is to be unruly and vicious and keep your temper quite unruffled evade the mischief if you can if you cannot endure it and do not trouble yourself overmuch about your dignity or about retaliating on the man except it be on the grounds of expediency there are even times when any assumption of dignity becomes ludicrous and the traveller must as mungo park had once to do lay it down as a rule to make himself as useless and as insignificant as possible as the only means of recovering his liberty  bush lawit is impossible but that a traveller must often take the law into his own hands some countries no doubt are governed with a strong arm by a savage despot to whom or to whose subordinates appeals must of course be made but for the most part the system of life among savages is  the simple rule the good old plan that they should take who have the power and they should keep who can  where there is no civil law or any kind of substitute for it each man is as it were a nation in himself and then the traveller ought to be guided in his actions by the motives that influence nations whether to make war or to abstain from it rather than by the criminal code of civilised countries the traveller must settle in his own mind what his scale of punishments should be and it will be found a convenient principle that a culprit should be punished in proportion to the quantity of harm that he has done rather than according to the presumed wickedness of the offence thus if two men were caught one of whom had stolen an ox and the other a sheep it would be best to flog the first much more heavily than the second it is a measure of punishment more intelligible to savages than ours the principle of double or treble restitution to which they are well used is of the same nature if all theft be punished your administration will be a reign of terror for every savage even your best friends will pilfer little things from you whenever they have a good opportunity be very severe if any of your own party steal trifles from natives order double or treble restitution if the man does not know better and if he does a flogging besides and not in place of it  seizing foodon arriving at an encampment the natives commonly run away in fright if you are hungry or in serious need of anything that they have go boldly into their huts take just what you want and leave fully adequate payment it is absurd to be overscrupulous in these cases  feastdaysinterrupt the monotony of travel by marked days on which you give extra tobacco and sugar to the servants avoid constant good feeding but rather have frequent slight fasts to ensure occasional good feasts and let those occasions when marked stages of your journey have been reached be great galadays recollect that a savage cannot endure the steady labour that we anglosaxons have been bred to support his nature is adapted to alternations of laziness and of severe exertion promote merriment singing fiddling and so forth with all your power autolycus says in a winters tale  jog on jog on the footpath way merrily bent the stilsa a merry heart goes all the day your sad tires in a milea  floggingdifferent tribes have very different customs in the matter of corporal punishment there are some who fancy it a disgrace and a serious insult a young traveller must therefore be discriminating and cautious in the licence he allows to his stick or he may fall into sad trouble  kindliness of womenwherever you go you will find kindheartedness amongst women mungo park is fond of recording his experiences of this but i must add that he seems to have been an especial favourite with the sex the gentler of the two sexes is a teterrima causa belli  when you wish a savage to keep count give him a string of beads the boxes and parcels that are sent by the overland route are or were counted in this way by an arab overseer he was described as having a cord with great beads strung on it and the end of the cord was thrown over his shoulder as each box passed him he jerked a bead from the fore part of the cord to the back part of it over his shoulder  drawing lotsit is often necessary to distribute things by lot do it by what children call soldiering one stands with his back to the rest another pointing to the portions in succession calls out who is to have this to which the first one replies by naming somebody who at once takes possession    hostilities   to fortify a campforts at opposite cornersexplorers have frequent occasion to form a depot either a few men are left in charge of the heavy luggage while the rest of the party ride on a distant reconnoitring expedition or else the whole party may encamp for weeks until the state of the season or other cause permits further travel in either case a little forethought and labour will vastly increase the security of the depot against hostile attempts for instance it should be placed at least 200 yards from any cover or commanding heights if the ground on which it stands have any features of strength about it as being near the side of a stream or being on a hill so much the better the neighbourhood of shingle prevents persons from stealing across unheard and finally the camp should be fortified now the principle of fortification best suited to a small party is to form the camp into a square and to have two projecting enclosures at opposite corners where all the men who have guns may place themselves to fire on the assailants it will be seen by the sketch how completely the guns in each enclosure can sweep the edges as well as the whole of the environs of the camp  sketch of camp with fortifications  a square is better than a round for the projecting enclosures as it allows more men to use their guns at the same time on the same point but it is so convenient to make the walls of the enclosure serve as sidings for the tents that it is perhaps best to allow the size and shape of the tent to determine those of the enclosures a square of nine or ten feet inside measurement is amply sufficient for three guns or archers the parapets can be built of large stones a travelling party rarely carries spades but when they have them the parapet may be formed of the earth thrown up by digging a trench outside it the common calculation is that with good tools a labourer can dig one cubic yard of earth an hour and can continue working for eight hours in the day the parapet should be raised four feet above the ground as that is the most convenient height to fire from when standing and it is high enough to shield a person kneeling down to load upon this parapet large stones should be laid having loopholes between them and above the stones the tent may be pitched its pole being lengthened by lashing apiece of wood to it or by cutting a fresh pole altogether it will make a high roof to the enclosure and will complete a comfortable abode we have thus a square enclosed camp for the cattle the wagons and the natives of the party and at opposite corners of it two fortified houses one of which would naturally be inhabited by the leaders of the party and the other either by the storekeeper or by the white servants generally  trous de loup are holes with sharp stake driven in the bottom of each of them see pitfalls p 264 with the pointed end upwards the south sea islanders use them in multitudes to prevent the possibility of an enemys approach at night otherwise than along the narrow paths that lead to their villages if a man deviates from a path he is sure to stumble into one of these contrivances and to be lamed the holes need not exceed one foot in diameter and the stake may be a stick no thicker than the little finger and yet it will suffice to maim an illshod man if its point be baked hard a traveller could only use these pitfalls where from the circumstances of the case there was no risk of his own men cattle or dogs falling into them  weapons to resist an attackunless your ammunition is so kept as to be accessible in the confusion of an attack the fortifications i have just described would be of little service if the guns are all or nearly all of the same bore it is simple enough to have small bags filled with cartridges and also papers with a dozen caps in each buckshot and slugs are better than bullets for the purposes of which we are speaking bows and arrows might render good service the chinese in their junks when they expect a piratical attack bring up baskets filled with stones from the ballast of the ship and put them on deck ready at hand they throw them with great force and precision the idea is not a bad one boiling water and hot sand if circumstances happened to permit their use are worth bearing in mind as they tell well on the bodies of naked assailants in close quarters thrust do not strike and recollect that it is not the slightest use to hit a negro on the head with a stick as it is a fact that his skull endures a blow better than any other part of his person in picking out the chiefs do not select the men that are the most showily ornamented for they are not the chiefs but the biggest and the busiest a good horseman will find a powerful weapon at hand by unhitching his stirrup leather and attached stirrup from the saddle i know of a case where this idea saved the rider  rocketsof all european inventions nothing so impresses and terrifies savages as fireworks especially rockets i cannot account for the remarkable effect they produce but in every land it appears to be the same a rocket judiciously sent up is very likely to frighten off an intended attack and save bloodshed if a traveller is supplied with any of these he should never make playthings of them but keep them for great emergencies  natives forbidden to throng the camphave a standing rule that many natives should never be allowed to go inside your camp at the same time for it is everywhere a common practice among them to collect quietly in a friendly way and at a signal to rise en masse and overpower their hosts even when they profess to have left their arms behind do not be too confident they are often deposited close at hand captain sturt says that he has known australian savages to trail their spears between their toes as they lounged towards him through the grass professedly unarmed  keeping watchhead near the groundwhen you think you hear anything astir lie down and lay your ear on the ground to see to the best advantage take the same position you thus bring low objects in bold relief against the sky besides this in a wooded country it is often easy to see far between the bare stems of the trees while their spreading tops shut out all objects more than a few yards off thus a dog or other small animal usually sees a mans legs long before he sees

dividing their watches by night but which is generally managed very correctly at each gate of a stockaded town is posted a sentry who is provided with a pile of stones the exact number of which has been previously ascertained the night is divided into four watches during each watch the sentry removes the pile of stones one by one at a measured pace from one gate to another calling out at each tenth removal when all are removed the watch is relievedforbes  setting a common gun as an alarmgunthe gun may be loaded with bullet or simply with powder or only with a cap even the click of the hammer may suffice to awaken attention for the ways of setting it see p 257  prairie set on firethis is often done as a means of offence but when the grass is short lower than the knee the strip of it on fire at the same moment does not exceed 12 feet in width therefore if a belt of grass of 12 feet in width be destroyed in advance of the line of fire the conflagration will be arrested as soon as it reaches that belt the fire will be incapable of traversing the interval narrow though it be where there is a total absence of fuel to feed it travellers avail themselves of this fact in a very happy manner when a fire in the prairie is advancing towards them by burning a strip of grass to the windward of their camp of 12 feet in breadth beating down the blaze with their blankets wherever it would otherwise extend too widely behind this easily constructed line of defence the camp rests in security and the adjacent grass remains uninjured for the use of the cattle if however the wind is high and sparks are drifted for some distance beyond the belt of fire this method is insufficient two lines of defence should then be constructed  tricks upon robbersit is perhaps just worth while to mention a trick that has been practised in most countries from england to peru a traveller is threatened by a robber with a gun and ordered to throw himself on the ground or he will be fired at the traveller taking a pistol from his belt shouts out if this were loaded you should not treat me thus and throws himself on the ground as the robber bids him there he lies till the robber in his triumph comes up for his booty when the intended victim takes a quick aim and shoots him deadthe pistol being really loaded all the time i have also heard of an incident in the days of shooters hill in england where a ruffian waylaid and sprang upon a traveller and holding a pistol to his breast summoned him for the contents of his pocket the traveller dived his hand into one of them and silently cocking a small pistol that lay in it shot the robber dead firing out through the side of the pocket  passing through a hostile countryhow to encampa small party has often occasion to try to steal through a belt of hostile country without being observed at such times it is a rule never to encamp until long after sundown in order that people on your track may be unable to pursue it with ease if you are pursuing a beaten path turn sharp out of it when you intend to encamp selecting a place for doing so where the ground is too hard to show footprints then travel away for a quarter of an hour at least lastly look out for a hollow place in the midst of an open flat never allow hammering of any kind in your camp nor loud talking but there is no danger in lighting a small fire if reasonable precautions be taken as a flame cannot be seen far through bushes keep a strict watch all night the watchers should be 100 yards out from camp and should relieve one another every two hours at least

man prisoner singlehanded threaten him with your gun and compel him to throw all his arms away then marching him before you some little distance make him lie flat on his face and put his hands behind him of course he will be in a dreadful fright and require reassuring next take your knife put it between your teeth and standing over him take the caps off your gun and lay it down by your side then handcuff him in whatever way you best can the reason of setting to work in this way is that a quick supple savage while you are fumbling with your strings and bothered with a loaded gun might easily spring round seize hold of it and quite turn the tables against you but if the gun had no caps on it would be of little use in his hands except as a club and also if you had a knife between your teeth it would be impossible for him to free himself by struggling without exposing himself to a thrust from it  cord to be well stretchedit is an imperfect security to tie an ingenious active man whose hands and feet are small unless the cord or whatever else you may use had been thoroughly well stretched many people have exhibited themselves for money who allowed themselves to be tied hand and foot and then to be put into a sack whence they emerged after a few minutes with the cords in a neat coil in their hands the brothers davenport were notorious for possessing this skill they did not show themselves for halfpence at country fairs but by implying that they were set free by supranatural agencies they held fashionable seances in london and created an immense sensation a few years ago two of these exhibitors were tied face to face in a cupboard respectively by two persons selected by the audience the latter inspected one anothers knots as well as they could and on their expressing themselves satisfied the doors of the cupboard were closed the lights of the room were kept low for 5 or 10 minutes until a signal was made by the exhibitors from within the cupboard then in a blaze of gas light the doors were opened from within and out walked the two men leaving the ropes behind them after this they tied themselves in their own knots and under those easy conditions a number of socalled spiritual manifestations took place which i need not here describe the real curiosity of the exhibition being that which i have just explained these exhibitions continued for months but at length two nautical gentlemen insisted on using their own cord which they had previously well stretched and this proceeding utterly baffled the davenports thenceforward wherever the davenports showed themselves the nautical gentlemen appeared also appealing to the audience to elect them to tie the hands of the exhibitors in this way they fairly exposed the pretensions of the davenports and drove them from england once i was proposed by an audience to tie the hands i did my best and i also scrutinised my colleagues knot as well as the confined place in which the exhibitors were tied permitted the cord we had to use was perhaps a little too thick but it was supple and strong and i was greatly surprised at the ease with which the davenports disembarrassed themselves they were not more than 10 minutes in getting free of course if either of the exhibitors could struggle loose he would assist his colleague it therefore struck me as an exceedingly ingenious idea of the davenports to have two persons and not one person to tie them i considered it was very improbable that a person taken at haphazard should be capable of tying his man securely and it was evident that the improbability would be increased in a duplicate ratio that both persons should be capable thus if it be 20 to 1 against any one persons having sufficient skill it is 20 by 20 or 400 to 1 against both the persons who might be selected to tie the davenports being able to do so effectively as i have already said the opportunity that was afforded to each of scrutinising the work of the other was worth very little because of the dark and confined space in which the exhibitors sat  tying the handsto tie a mans hands behind his back take a handkerchief it is the best thing failing that a thin cord it is necessary

 tying the thumbsto secure a prisoner with the least amount of string place his hands back to back behind him then tie the thumbs together and also the little fingers two bits of thin string each a

straitwaistcoat is the least inconvenient mode of confinement as the joints of the prisoner are not cut by cords a makeshift for one is soon stitched together by stitching a piece of canvas into the shape of a sleeve and sewing one end of this to one cuff of a strong jacket and the other end to the other cuff so that instead of the jacket having two sleeves it has but one long one the jacket is then put on in the usual way and buttoned and sewn in front in a proper straitwaistcoat the opening is behind and the sleeves in front it laces up behind  sketch of man in waistcoat  tying up a prisoner for the nightif a man has to be kept prisoner all night it is not sufficient to tie his hands as he will be sure to watch his time and run away it is therefore necessary to tie them round a standing tree or a heavy log of wood a convenient plan is to fell a large forked bough and to make the mans arms fast round one of the branches it is thus impossible for him to slip away as the fork on one side and the bushy top of the branch on the other prevent his doing so and notwithstanding his cramped position it is quite possible for him to get sleep  files of prisonerswhen several men have to be made fast and marched away the usual method of securing them is to tie them one behind another to a long pole or rope  in marching off a culprit make him walk between two of your men while

mass has to be moved and along which it may be dragged with the assistance of rollers and grease if the mass be too awkwardly shaped to admit of this burrow below it pass poles underneath it and raise the ends of the poles alternately mr williams the wellknown missionary of the south sea islands relates how his schooner of from seventy to eighty tons had been driven by a violent hurricane and rising of the sea on one of the islands near which she was anchored and was lodged several hundred yards inland and thus describes how he got her backthe method by which we contrived to raise the vessel was exceedingly simple and by it we were enabled to accomplish the task with great ease long levers were passed under her keel with the fulcrum so fixed as to give them an elevation of about fortyfive degrees the ends of these were then fastened together with several crossbeams upon which a quantity of stones were placed the weight of which gradually elevated one end of the vessel until the levers reached the ground propping up the bow thus raised we shifted our levers to the stern which was in like manner elevated and by repeating this process three or four times we lifted her in one day entirely out of the hole which she had worked for herself and which was about four feet deep the bog that lay between her and the sea was then filled up with stones logs of wood were laid across it rollers were placed under the vessel the chain cable passed round her and by the united strength of about 2000 people she was compelled to take a short voyage upon the land before she floated in her pride on the sea  in some cases the body of a cart may be taken down and deep ruts having been dug on each side of the mass the vehicle can be backed till the axletree comes across it then after lashing and making fast the sand can be shovelled from below the mass which will hang suspended from the axletree and may be carted away or a sledge may be built beneath the mass by burrowing below it and thrusting the poles beneath it then the remainder of the intervening sand can be shovelled away and the mass now resting directly upon the sledge can be dragged away by a team of cattle  a sarcophagus of immense weight was raised from out of a deep recess into which it had been fitted pretty closely at the end of a long narrow gallery in an egyptian tomb where there was no room for the application of tackle or other machinery by the simple expedient of slightly disturbing it in its place and sifting sand into the narrow interval between its sides and the recess this process was repeated continually the sand settled below the bottom of the sarcophagus which gradually rose out of the hole in which it had lain the principle of this piece of engineering was borrowed i suppose from observing that whenever a mass of sand and stones is shaken together the stones invariably rise out of the sand the biggest of them always forming the highest layer  expansive power of wetted seedsadmiral sir e belcher read a curious paper before the british association in 1866 showing the remarkable power to be obtained by filling tubes with peas or other seed allowing the weight to rest upon the surface of the peas through the medium of a rude piston when the peas were wetted they swelled upwards with considerable force a pint of peas placed in a tube of a diameter that was not expressed in the newspaper report from which i take this account lifted 60 lbs through a height of one inch in twentyfour hours the admiral proposed to fix a number of tubes side by side in a frame below the mass to be lifted preferring to use zinc tubes of from two or three inches in diameter and of about one foot high thus in the small space of a cubic foot a large number of tubes thirtysix in the one case sixteen in the other could be made to act simultaneously the force of the stroke could be increased by arranging a number of frames side by side or the length of the stroke could be increased by building the frames in a series one above the other i have elsewhere described how wetted seeds may be used to restore the shape of a battered flask either for holding water or gunpowder pp 230  parbucklinga round log or a barrel should be rolled not dragged and many irregularlyshaped objects may have bundles of faggots lashed round them by which they become barrelshaped and fit to be rolled in these cases parbuckling doubles the ease of rolling them one or more ropes have one of each of their ends made fast in the direction to which the log has to be rolled while the other is carried underneath the log round it and back again by pulling at these free ends the log will be rolled on an equivalent plan and in some cases a more practicable one is to make fast one end of the rope to the log itself then winding the rope two or three times round it like cotton on a reel to haul at the free end as before horses can be used as well as men for this work  sketch of man pulling log  accumulation of effortssouth american indians are said to avail themselves of their forest trees and of the creepers which stretch from branch to branch in moving very heavy weights as in lifting a log of timber up on a stage to be sawn in the following ingenious manner the labourer gets hold of one of these creepers that runs from the top boughs of a tree in the direction in which he wants to move his log and pulling this creeper home with all his force bending down the bough he attaches it to the log then he goes to another creeper and does the same with that and so on until he has accumulated strain of many bent boughs urging the log forward and of sufficient power to move it  short cords of indiarubber with a hook at either end are sold under the name of accumulators it is proposed that each of these should be stretched and hooked by one of its ends to a fixed ring and by the other to the body to be moved by applying a number of these in succession an immense

waterif the mass should lie below water a boat may be brought over it and sunk to its gunwales then after making fast to it the boat can be baled and the thing floated away a raft weighted with stones will serve the same purpose in some cases a raft may be built round the mass during low water then the returning tide or the next flush of the stream will float it away  although from its bulk several men might be puzzled to lift a cowfish from the water when dead yet one single indian will stow the largest in his montaria without assistance the boat is sunk under the body and rising the difficult feat is accomplished edwards amazon  the huge blocks of marble quarried at carrara are shipped in the small vessels of the country as followsat low water the vessel is buried bodily in the sand and a

wood cannot be employed in carpentry as it is very weak it also warps cracks and becomes rotten wood dried with too great a heat loses its toughness as well as its pliability it becomes hard and brittle green wood is seasoned by washing out the sap and then drying it thoroughly the travellers way of doing this by one rapid operation is to dig a long trench and make a roaring fire in it when the ground is burning hot sweep the ashes away deluge the trench with boiling water and in the middle of the clouds of steam that arise throw in the log of wood shovel hot earth over it and leave it to steam and bake a log thick enough to make an axletree may thus be somewhat seasoned in a single night the log would be seasoned more thoroughly if it were saturated with boiling water before putting it into the trench that can be done by laying it in a deep narrow puddle and shovelling hot stones into the water all crowbars wagonlifters etc should be roughly seasoned as green wood is far too weak for such uses the regular way of seasoning is to leave the timber to soak for a long time in water that the juices may be washed out fresh water is better for this purpose than salt but a mineral spring if it is warm is better than cold fresh water parties travelling with a wagon ought to fell a little timber on their outward journey and leave it to season against their return in readiness to replace strained axletrees broken poles and the like they might at all events cut a ring round through the bark and sapwood of the tree and leave it to discharge its juices die and become halfseasoned as it stands  to bend woodif it is wished to bend a rod of wood or to straighten it if originally crooked it must be steamed or at least be submitted to hot water thus a rod of green wood may be passed through the ashes of a smouldering fire and when hot bent and shaped with the hand but if the wood be dry it must first be thoroughly soaked in a pond or puddle if the puddle is made to boil by shovelling in hot stones as described in the last paragraph the stick will bend more easily the long straight spears of savages are often made of exceedingly crooked sticks straightened in the ashes of their camp fires a thick piece of wood may be well swabbed with hot water forcibly bent as far as can be safely done tied in position and steamed as if for the purpose of seasoning see last paragraph in a trench after a quarter of an hour it must be taken out damped afresh if necessary bent further and again returned to steamthe process being repeated till the wood has attained the shape required it should then be left in the trench to season thoroughly the heads of dogsledges and the pieces of wood used for the outsides of snowshoes are all bent by this process  carpenters toolstools of too hard steel should not be taken on a journey they splinter against the dense wood of tropical countries and they are very troublesome to sharpen the remedy for overhardness is to heat them redhot retempering them by quenching in grease a small iron axe with a file to sharpen it and a few awls are if nothing else can be taken a very useful outfit  as much carpentry as a traveller is likely to want can be effected by means of a small axe with a hammerhead a very small singlehanded adze a mortisechisel a strong gouge a couple of mediumsized gimlets a few awls a small turkeyhone and a whetstone if a saw be taken it should be of a sort intended for green wood in addition to these a small tin box full of tools all of which fit into a single handle is very valuable many travellers have found them extremely convenient there is a toolshop near the bottom of the haymarket and another in the strand near the lowthier arcade where they can be bought probably also at holtzapfels in trafalgar square the box that contains them is about six inches long by four broad and one deep the cost is from 20s to 30s lastly a saw for metals a few drills and small files may be added with advantage it is advisable to see that the tools are ground and set before starting a small hard chisel of the best steel three inches long a quarter of an inch wide and threeeighths thickwhich any blacksmith can makewill cut iron will chisel marks on rocks and be useful in numerous emergencies  sharpening toolsa man will get through most work with his tools if he stops from time to time to sharpen them up the son of sirach says speaking of a carpenterif the iron be blunt and he do not whet the edge then must he put to more strength but wisdom is profitable to directecclesiasticus a small fine file is very effectual in giving an edge to tools of soft steel it is a common error to suppose that the best edge is given by grinding the sides of the tool until they meet at an exceedingly acute angle such an edge would have no strength and would chip or bend directly the proper way of sharpening a tool is to grind it until it is sufficiently thin and then to give it an edge whose sides are inclined to one another about as much as those of the letter v the edge of a chisel is an obvious case in point so also is the edge of a butchers knife which is given by applying it to the steel at a considerable inclination a razor has only to cut hairs and will splinter if used to mend a pen yet even a razor is shaped like a wedge that it may not receive too fine an edge when stropped with its face flat upon the hone  nails substitutes forlashings of raw hide supersede nails for almost every purpose it is perfectly marvellous how a gunstock that has been shattered into splinters can be made as strong again as ever by means of raw hide sewn round it and left to dry or by drawing the skin of an oxs leg like a stocking over it it is well to treat your bit of skin as though parchment which see were to be made of it burying the skin and scraping off the hair before sewing it on that it may make no eyesore tendons or stout fishskin such as shagreen may also be used on the same principle an axletree cracked lengthwise can easily be mended with raw hide even a broken wheeltire may be replaced with rhinoceros or other thick hide if the country to be travelled over be dry  sketch of lathe as described below  lathes may be wanted by a traveller because the pulleys necessary for a large sailingboat and the screw of a carpenters bench cannot be made without one the sketch will recall to mind the original machine now almost forgotten in england but still in common use on the continent it is obvious that makeshift contrivances can be set up on this principle two steady points being the main things wanted a forked bough suffices for a treadle a very common indian lathe consists of two tentpegs two nails for the points a leather thong and some makeshift handrest neither pole nor treadle is used but an assistant takes one end of the thong in one hand and the other end in the other hand and hauls away in a seesaw fashion for turning hollows a long spike is used instead of a short point then a hole is bored into the wood to the depth of the intended hollow and the spike is pushed forward until it abuts against the bottom of the hole one form of lathe is simplicity itself two thick stakes are driven in the ground so far apart as to include the object to be turned a cross piece is lashed to them by a creeper cut out of the jungle for the double purpose of holding them together and of serving as a rest for the gouge the object is turned with a thong as already described  charcoal tar and pitchcharcoaldig a hole in the earth or choose some gigantic burrow or old well and fill it with piles of wood arranging them so as to leave a kind of chimney down the centre the top of the hole is now to be covered over with sods excepting the chimney down which a brand is dropped to set fire to the wood the burning should be governed by opening or shutting the chimneytop with a flat stone it should proceed very gradually for the wood ought to smoulder and never attain to a bright red heat the operation will require from two days to a week the tarry products of the wood drain to the bottom of the well  tar is made by burning larch fir or pine as though charcoal had to be made dead or withered trees and especially their roots yield tar most copiously a vast deal is easily obtained it collects at the bottom of the pit and a hole with smooth sides should be dug there into which it may drain for making tar on a smaller scaleram an iron pot full of pine wood reverse it and lay it upon a board pierced with a hole one inch in diameter then prop the board over another pot buried in the earth make all airtight with wet clay round the upper pot and board covering the board but exposing the bottom of the reversed pot make a grand fire above and round the latter and the tar will freely drop it will be thin and not very pure tar but clean and it will thicken on exposure to the air  pitch is tar boiled down  turpentine and resinturpentine is the juice secreted by the pine fir or larch tree in blisters under the bark the trees are tapped for the purpose of obtaining it resin is turpentine boiled down    metals   fuel for forgedry fuel gives out far more heat than that which is damp as a comparison of the heating powers of different sorts of fuel it may be reckoned that 1 lb of dry charcoal will raise 73 lbs of water from freezing to boiling 1 lb of pit coal about 60 lbs and 1 lb of peat about 30 lbs some kinds of manurefuel give intense heat and are excellent for blacksmiths purposes that of goats and sheep is the best camels dung is next best but is not nearly so good then that of oxen the dung of horses is of little use except as tinder in lighting a fire  bellowsit is of no use attempting to do blacksmiths work if you have not a pair of bellows these can be made of a single goatskin of sufficient power in skilful hands to raise small bars of iron to a welding heat the boats head is cut off close under the chin his legs at the kneejoint and a slit is made between the hind legs through which the carcase is entirely extractedafter dressing the hide two strongish pieces of wood are sewn along the slit one at each side just like the ironwork on each side of the mouth of a carpetbag and for the same purpose ie to strengthen it a nozzle is inserted at the neck to use this apparatus its mouth is opened and pulled out then it is suddenly shut by which means the bellows are made to enclose a bagful of air this by pushing the mouth flat home is ejected through the nozzle these bellows require no valve and are the simplest that can be made they are in use throughout india the nozzle or tube to convey the blast may be made of a plaster of clay or loam mixed with grass and moulded round a smooth pole  metals to workiron ore is more easily reduced than the ore of any other metal it is usually sufficient to throw the ore into a charcoalfire and keep it there for a day or more when the pure metal will begin to appear  welding composition for iron or steel is made of borax 10 parts sal ammoniac 1 part to be melted run out on an iron plate and when cold pounded for use  cast steela mixture of 100 parts of soft iron and two of lampsoot melts as easily as ordinary steelmore easily than iron this is a ready way of making caststeel where great heat cannot be obtained  casehardening is the name given to a simple process by which the outside of iron may be turned into steel small tools fishhooks and keys etc are usually made of iron they are fashioned first and casehardened afterwards there are good reasons for this first because it is the cheapest way of making them and secondly because while steel is hard iron is tough and anything made of iron and coated with steel combines some of the advantages of both metals the civilised method of casehardening is to brighten up the iron and to cover it with prussiate of potash either powdered or made into a paste the iron is then heated until the prussiate of potash has burned away this operation is repeated three or four times finally the iron now covered with a thin layer of steel is hardened by quenching it in water in default of prussiate of potash animal or even vegetable charcoal may be used but the latter is a very imperfect substitute to make animal charcoal take a scrap of leather hide hoof horn flesh bloodanything in fact that has animal matter in it dry it into hard chips like charcoal before a fire and powder it put the iron that is to be casehardened with some of this charcoal round it into the midst of a lump of loam this is first placed near the fire to harden and then quite into it where it should be allowed to slowly attain a bloodred heat but no higher then break open the lump take out the iron and drop it into water to harden  lead is very useful to a traveller for he always has bullets which furnish the supply of the metal and it is so fusible that he can readily melt and cast it into any required shape using wood or paper partly buried in the earth for his mould if a small portion of the lead remain unmelted in the ladle the fluid is sure not to burn the mould by attending to this a wooden mould may be used scores of times  sketches as described below  fig 1 shows how to cast a leaden plate which would be useful for inscriptions for notices to other parties if minced into squares it would make a substitute for slugs the figure represents two flat pieces of wood enclosing a folded piece of paper and partly buried in the earth the lead is to be poured into the paper  to make a mould for a pencil or a rod which may be cut into short lengths for slugs roll up a piece of paper as shown in fig 2 and bury it in the earth reeds when they are to be obtained make a stronger mould than paper  to cast a lamp a bottle or other hollow article use a cylinder of paper buried in the ground as in fig 3 and hold a stick fast in the middle while the lead is poured round  loose shaky articles often admit of being set to rights by warming the joints and pouring a little melted lead into the cracks  tinsolder for tin plates is made of one or two parts of tin and one of lead before soldering the surfaces must be quite bright and close together and the contact of air must be excluded during the operation else the heat will tarnish the surface and prevent the adhesion of the solder the borax and resin commonly in use effect this the best plan is to clean the surfaces with muriatic acid saturated with tin this method is invariably adopted by watchmakers and opticians who never use borax and resin the point of the solderingtool must be filed bright  copper to tinclean the copper well with sandstone heat it and rub it with salammoniac till it is quite clean and bright the tin with some powdered resin is now placed on the copper which is made so hot as to melt the tin and allow it to be spread over the surface with a bit of rag a very little tin is used in this way it is said that a piece as big as a pea would tin a large saucepan which is at the rate of twenty grains of tin to a square foot of copper    leather   raw hidesdressing hidesskins that have been dressed are essential to a traveller in an uncivilised country for they make his packingstraps his bags his clothes shoes nails and string therefore no hide should be wasted there is no clever secret in dressing skins it is hard work that they want either continual crumpling and stretching with the hands or working and trampling with the feet to dress a goatskin will occupy one person for a whole day to dress an oxhide will give hard labour to two persons for a day and a half or even for two days it is best to begin to operate upon the skin half an hour after it has been flayed if it has been allowed to dry during the process it must be resoftened by damping not with waterfor it will never end by being supple if water be usedbut with whatever the natives generally employ clotted milk and linseedmeal are used in abyssinia cowdung by the caffres and bushmen when a skin is put aside for the night it must be rolled up to prevent it from becoming dry by the morning it is generally necessary to slightly grease the skin when it is halfdressed to make it thoroughly supple  smoking hidesmr catlin speaking of the skins used by the n american indians says that the greater part of them go through still another operation afterwards besides dressing which gives them a greater value and renders them much more serviceablethat is the process of smoking for this a small hole is dug in the ground and a fire is built in it with rotten wood which will produce a great quantity of smoke without much blaze and several small poles of the proper length stuck in the ground around it and drawn and fastened together at the top making a cone around which a skin is wrapped in form of a tent and generally sewed together at the edges to secure the smoke within it within this the skins to be smoked are placed and in this condition the tent will stand a day or two enclosing the heated smoke and by some chemical process of other which i do not understand the skins thus acquire a quality which enables them after being ever so many times wet to dry soft and pliant as they were before which secret i have never seen practised in my own country and for the lack of which all our dressed skins when once wet are i think chiefly ruined a single skin may conveniently be smoked by sewing the edges together so as to make a tube of it the lower end is tied round an iron pot with rotten wood burning inside the upper end is kept open with a hoop and slung to a triangle as shown in the figure  sketch of hide smoking apparatus as described  tanning hidessteep them in a strong solution of alum and a little salt for a period dependent on the thickness of the hide the gradual change of the hide into tanned leather is visible and should be watched if desired thehair may be removed before the operation as described in parchment kid gloves are made of leather that has been prepared in this way  greasing leatherall leather articles should be occasionally well rubbed with fat when used in hot dry climates or when they are often wetted and dried again it makes a difference of many hundred per cent in their wear it is a great desideratum to be possessed of a supply of fat but it is not easy to obtain it from antelopes and other sinewy game the french troops adopt the following method which lord lucan copied from them when in the crimeathe marrowbones of the slaughtered animals are broken between stones they are then well boiled and the broth is skimmed when cold  to preserve hides in a dried stateafter the hide has been flayed from a beast if it is not intended to dress it it should be pegged out in the sun if it be also rubbed over with woodashes or better still with salt it will keep longer most small furs that reach the hands of english furriers have been merely sundried but large hides are usually salted before being shipped for europe to be tanned a hide that has been salted is injured for dressing by the hand but it is not entirely spoiled and therefore the following extract from mr danas two years before the mast may be of service to travellers who have shot many head of game in one place or to those who have lost a herd of goats by distemper  salting hidesthe first thing is to put the hides to soak this is done by carrying them down at low tide and making them fast in small piles by ropes and letting the tide come up and cover them every day we put 25 in soak for each man which with us make 150 there they lie 48 hours when they are taken out and rolled up in wheelbarrows and thrown into vats these vats contain brine made very strong being seawater with great quantities of salt thrown in this pickles the hides and in this they lie 48 hours the use of the seawater into which they are first put being merely to soften and clean them  from these vats they are taken to lie on a platform 24 hours and are then spread upon the ground and carefully stretched and staked out so that they may dry smooth after they were staked and while yet wet and soft we used to go upon them with our knives and carefully cut of all the bad parts the pieces of meat and fat which would otherwise corrupt and affect the whole if stowed away in a vessel for months the large flippers the ears and all other parts that prevent close stowage this was the most difficult part of our duty as it required much skill to take off everything necessary and not to cut or injure the hides it was also a long process as six of us had to clean 150 most of which required a great deal to be done to them as the spaniards are very careless in skinning their cattle then too as we cleaned them while they were staked out we were obliged to kneel down upon them which always gives beginners the backache the first day i was so slow and awkward that i only cleaned eight at the end of a few days i doubled my number and in a fortnight or three weeks could keep up with the others and clean my proportiontwentyfive

baker    membrane sinew horn   parchmentthe substance which is called parchment when made from sheep or goat skins and vellum when from those of calves kids or deadborn lambs can also be made from any other skin the raw hide is buried for one or two days till the hair comes off easily then it is taken out and well scraped next a skewer is run in and out along each of its four sides and strings being made fast to these skewers the skin is very tightly stretched it is carefully scraped over as it lies on the stretch by which means the water is squeezed out then it is rubbed with rough stones as pumice or sandstone after which it is allowed to dry the strings by which the skewers are secured being tightened from time to time if this parchment be used for writing it will be found rather greasy but washing it will oxgall will probably remedy this fault see oxgall p 331 in the regular preparation of parchment the skin is soaked for a short time in a limepit before taking off the hairs

sinews for threadany sinews will do for making thread if the fibres admit of being twisted or plaited together into pieces of sufficient length the sinews lying alongside the backbone are the most convenient on account of the length of their fibres after the sinew is dried straight strips are torn off it of the proper size they are wetted and scraped into evenness by being drawn through the mouth and teeth then by one or two rubs between the hand and the thigh they become twisted and their fibres are retained together a piece of dried sinew is usually kept in reserve for making thread or

a ball of wick for the purpose of making candles from time to time when fat happens to be abundant the most convenient mould is of the shape shown in the figure the tallow should be poured in when its heat is so reduced that it hardly feels warm to the finger that is just before setting if this be done overnight the candles will come out in the morning without difficulty but if you are obliged to make many at a time then after the tallow has been poured in the mould should be dipped in cold water to cool it and then when the tallow has set the mould should be dipped for a moment in hot water

distance down the barrel has been used for a mould pull the candle out by the wick after heating the barrel two wads might be used the one strongly rammed in to prevent the tallow from running too far the other merely as a support for the wick perhaps even paper moulds might be used they could be made by gumming or pasting paper in a roll  dip candlescandles that are made by dipping gutter and run much more than mould candles if they have to be used as soon as made the way of dipping them is to tie a number of wicks to the end of a wooden handle so shaped that the whole affair looks much like a gardenrakethe wicks being represented by the teeth of the rake then the wicks are dipped in the tallow and each is rubbed and messed by the hand till it stands stiff and straight after this they are dipped all together several times in succession allowing each fresh coat of tallow to dry before another dipping wax candles are always made by this process  substitute for candlesa strip of cotton 1

now there is a right and a wrong way of setting to work to make them the wrong way is to divide the paper into equal parts and to assign one of them to each letter in order the right way is to divide the paper into parts of a size proportionate to the number of words in the english language which begin with each particular letter in the first case the paper will be overcrowded in some parts and utterly blank in others in the second it will be equally overspread with writing and an ordinarysized sheet of paper if closely and clearly written will be sufficient for the drawing up of a very extended catalogue a convenient way of carrying out the principle i have indicated is to take an english dictionary and after having divided the paper into as many equal parts as there are leaves in the dictionary to adopt the first word of each leaf as headings to them it may save trouble to my reader if i give a list of headings appropriate to a small catalogue we will suppose the paper to be

and aneroid as they are all subject to changes in their indexerrors as soon as you have an opportunity compare them with a standard barometer compare also your ordinary thermometer and azimuthcompass with standard instruments and finally have them carefully reverified at the kew observatory on your return to england a vast deal of labour has been wholly thrown away by travellers owing to their neglecting to ascertain the indexerrors of these instruments at the close of their journey a careful observer ought to have eliminated the effects of instrumental errors from his sextant observations nevertheless it will be satisfactory to him and it may clear up some apparent anomalies to have his entire instrumental outfit reverified at kew  observations to recalculatesend by post to england a complete copy always preserve the originals of all your astronomical observations that they may be carefully recalculated before your return otherwise a long period may elapse before the longitudes are finally settled and your book may be delayed through the consequent impossibility of preparing a correct map the royal geographical society has frequently procured the recalculation of observations made on important journeys at the royal greenwich observatory and elsewhere i presume that a wellknown traveller would never find a difficulty in obtaining the calculations he might desire through the medium of that society if it was distinctly understood that they were to be made at his own cost  lithograph mapsit may add greatly to the interest which a traveller will take in drawing up a large and graphic routemap of his journey if he knows the extreme ease and cheapness with which copies of such a map may be multiplied to any extent by a wellknown process in lithography for these being distributed among persons interested in the country where he has travelled will prevent his painstaking from being lost to the world sketches and birdseye views may be multiplied in the same manner the method to which i refer is the socalled anastatic process the materials can be obtained with full instructions at any lithographers shop and consist of autographic ink and paper the paper has been prepared by being glazed over with a composition and the ink is in appearance something like indian ink and used in much the same way with an ordinary pen with this ink and upon this paper the traveller draws his map they are neither more nor less difficult to employ than common stationery and he may avail himself of tracingpaper without danger he has one single precaution to guard against which is not to touch the paper overmuch with his bare and but to keep a bit of loose paper between it and the map as he draws as soon as it is finished the map is taken to a lithographer who puts it face downwards on a stone and passes it under his press when every particle of ink leaves the surface of the paper and attaches itself to the surface of the stone precisely as though it had originally been written there the glaze on the paper which prevents the ink from soaking into it makes this transference more easy and complete the stone can now be worked with just as a stone that has been regularly lithographed in the usual manner that is to say printing ink may be rubbed over it and impressions may be taken off in any number it will be observed that the writing on the paper is reversed upon the stone and is rereversed or set right again in the impressions that are taken from it the lithographers charges for furnishing autographic ink and paper working the stone striking off fifty copies of a folio size and supplying the paper common white paper for the copiesin fact every expense includedneed not exceed ten shillings and may be much less if before drawing his map the traveller were to go to some working lithographer and witness the process and make two or three experiments in a small way he would naturally succeed all the better a map drawn on a large scale though without any pretension to artistic skill with abundance of profile views of prominent landmarks and copious information upon the routes that were explored written along their sides would be of the utmost value to future travellers and to geographers at home    index   accumulators  advantages of travel  agates for striking sparks  agreement with servants  alarm gun  alloy for bullets
