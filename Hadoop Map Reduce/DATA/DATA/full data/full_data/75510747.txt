with some confidence on many questions of mythology materials are abundant and practically undisputed because as to their myths savage races have spoken out with freedom myth represents now the early scientific now the early imaginative and humorous faculty playing freely round all objects of thought even round the superhuman beings of belief but as to his religion the savage by no means speaks out so freely religion represents his serious mood of trust dependence or apprehension  in certain cases the ideas about superhuman makers and judges are veiled in mysteries rude sketches of the mysteries of greece to which the white man is but seldom admitted in other cases the highest religious conceptions of the people are in a state of obsolescence are subordinated to the cult of accessible minor deities and are rarely mentioned while sacrifice or service again is done to the lower objects of faith ghosts or gods developed out of ghosts the supreme being in a surprising number of instances is wholly unpropitiated having all things he needs nothing at all events gets nothing at mens hands except obedience to his laws being good he is not feared or being obsolescent superseded as it seems by deities who can be bribed he has shrunk to the shadow of a name of the gods too good and great to need anything the ahone of the red men in virginia or the dendid of the african dinkas is an example of the obsolescent god now but a name the atahocan of the hurons was while the lord in heaven of the zulus is an instance among the relatively supreme beings revealed only in the mysteries the gods of many australian tribes are deserving of observation  for all these reasons mystery absence of sacrifice or idol and obsolescence the religion of savages is a subject much more obscure than their mythology the truth is that anthropological inquiry is not yet in a position to be dogmatic has not yet knowledge sufficient for a theory of the origins of religion and the evolution of belief from its lowest stages and earliest germs nevertheless such a theory has been framed and has been already stated  we formulated the objections to this current hypothesis and observed that its defenders must take refuge in denying the evidence as to low savage religions or if the facts be accepted must account for them by a theory of degradation or by a theory of borrowing from christian sources that the australians are not degenerate we demonstrated and we must now give reasons for holding that their religious conceptions are not borrowed from europeans  the australians when observed by dampier on the northwest coast in 1688 seemed the miserablest people in the world without houses agriculture metals or domesticated animals in this condition they still remain when not under european influence dampier we saw noted peculiarities be it little or much they get every one has his part as well the young and tender as the old and feeble who are not able to go abroad as the strong and lusty this kind of justice or generosity or unselfishness is still inculcated in the religious mysteries of some of the race generosity is certainly one of the natives leading features he is always accustomed to give a share of his food or of what he may possess to his fellows it may be of course objected to this that in doing so he is only following an oldestablished custom the breaking of which would expose him to harsh treatment and to being looked on as a churlish fellow it will however be hardly denied that as this custom expresses the idea that in this particular matter every one is supposed to act in a kindly way towards certain individuals the very existence of such a custom even if it be only carried out in the hope of securing at some time a quid pro quo shows that the native is alive to the fact that an action which benefits some one else is worthy to be performed        early voyages to australia pp 102111    hakluyt      society   it is with the native a fixed habit to give away part of what he has the authors of this statement do not say that the duty is inculcated in central australia under religious sanction in the tribal mysteries this however is the case among the kurnai and some tribes of victoria and new south wales since dampier found the duty practised as early as 1688 it will scarcely be argued that the natives adopted this course of what should be christian conduct from their observations of christian colonists  the second point which impressed dampier was that men and women old and young all lacked the two front upper teeth among many tribes of the natives of new south wales and victoria the boys still have their front teeth knocked out when initiated but the custom does not prevail in ritual where circumcision and another very painful rite are practised as in central australia and central queensland  dampiers evidence shows how little the natives have changed in two hundred years yet evidence of progress may be detected perhaps as we have already shown but one fact perhaps of an opposite bearing must be noted a singular painting in a cave of a person clothed in a robe of red reaching to the feet with sleeves and with a kind of halo or set of bandages round the head remains a mystery like similar figures with blue halos or bandages clothed and girdled none of the figures had mouths otherwise in sir george greys sketches they have a remote air of cimabues work these designs were by men familiar with clothing whether their own or that of strangers observed by them though in one case an unclothed figure carries a kangaroo at present the natives draw with much spirit when provided with european materials as may be seen in mrs langloh parkers two volumes of australian legendary tales their decorative patterns vary in character in different parts of the continent but nowhere do they now execute works like those in the caves discovered by sir george grey the reader must decide for himself how far these monuments alone warrant an inference of great degeneration in australia or are connected with religion        spencer and gillen natives of central australia p 48

pictures as perhaps      very ancient the natives chaffed him when he asked for      traditions on the subject  such are the australians men without kings or chiefs and what do we know of their beliefs  the most contradictory statements about their religion may be found in works of science mr huxley declared that their theology is a mere belief in the existence powers and dispositions usually malignant of ghostlike entities who may be propitiated or scared away but no cult can be properly said to exist and in this stage theology is wholly independent of ethics this he adds is theology in its simplest condition  in a similar sense sir john lubbock writes the australians have no idea of creation nor do they use prayers they have no religious forms ceremonies or worship they do not believe in the existence of a deity nor is morality in any way connected with their religion if it can be so called        lubbock origin of civilisation p 1581870 in 1889 for      a deity a true deity  this remark must be compared with another in the same work 1882 p 210 mr ridley indeed states that they have a traditional belief in one supreme creator called baiamai but he admits that most of the witnesses who were examined before the select committee appointed by the legislative council of victoria in 1858 to report on the aborigines gave it as their opinion that the natives had no religious ideas it appears moreover from a subsequent remark that baiamai only possessed traces of the three attributes of the god of the bible eternity omnipotence and goodness        cf j a i 1872 257271  mr ridley an accomplished linguist who had lived with wild blacks in 185458 in fact said long ago that the australian bora or mystery involves the idea of dedication to god  he asked old billy murri bundur whether men worshipped baiame at the bora of course they do said billy mr ridley to whose evidence we shall return was not the only affirmative witness archdeacon gunther had no doubt that baiame was equivalent to the supreme being a remnant of original traditions and it was mr günther not mr ridley who spoke of traces of baiames eternity omnipotence and goodness mr ridley gave similar reports from evidence collected by the committee of 1858 he found the higher creeds most prominent in the interior hundreds of miles from the coast  apparently the reply of gustav roskoff to sir john lubbock 1880 did not alter that writers opinion roskoff pointed out that waitzgerland while denying that australian beliefs were derived from any higher culture denounced the theory that they have no religion as entirely false belief in a good being is found in south australia new south wales and the centre of the southeastern continent the opinion of waitz is highly esteemed and that not merely because as mr max müller has pointed out he has edited greek classical works avec du grec on nepeut gâter rien mr oldfield in addition to bogles and a waterspirit found biam baiame and nambajundi who admits souls into his paradise while warnyura torments the bad under earth mr eyre publishing in 1845 gives baiame on the morrumbidgee biam on the murray biamvaitchy as a source of songs sung at dances and a cause of disease he is deformed sits crosslegged or paddles a canoe on the murray he found a creator noorele all powerful and of benevolent character with three unborn sons dwelling up among the clouds souls of dead natives join them in the skies nevertheless the natives as far as yet can be ascertained have no religious belief or ceremonies and though noorele is credited with the origin of creation he made the earth trees water etc a deity or great first cause can hardly be said to be acknowledged        waitzgerland anthropologic vi 794 et seq        oldfield translations of ethnol soc iii 208   on      this evidence i lay no stress        eyre journals ii pp 355358  such are the consistent statements of mr eyre roskoff also cites mr ridley braim cunningham dawson and other witnesses as opposed to sir john lubbock and he includes mr tylor mr tylor later found baiame or peiamei no earlier in literature than about 1840 in mr hales united states exploring expedition previous to that date baiame it seems was unknown to mr threlkeld whose early works are of 18311857 he only speaks of koin a kind of goblin and for lack of a native name for god mr threlkeld tried to introduce jehovakabiruê and eloi but failed mr tylor therefore appears to suppose that the name baiame and at all events his divine qualities were introduced by missionaries apparently between 1831 and 1840 to this it must be replied that mr hale about 1840 writes that when the missionaries first came to wellington mr threlkelds own district baiame was worshipped there with songs these songs or hymns according to mr threlkeld were passed on from a considerable distance it is notorious that songs and dances are thus passed on till they reach tribes who do not even know the meaning of the words        roskoff das religionstoesen der rohesten naturvolher pp      3741        ethnology and philology p 110    1846        tylor the limits of savage religion j a i vol      xxi    1892        roth natives of nw central queensland p 117  in this way baiame songs had reached wellington before the arrival of the missionaries and for this fact mr threlkeld who is supposed not to have known baiame is mr hales authority in mr tylors opinion as i understand it the word baiame was the missionary translation of our word creator and derived from baia to make now mr ridley says that mr greenway discovered this baia to be the root of baiame but what missionary introduced the word before 1840 not mr threlkeld for he according to mr tylor did not know the word and he tried eloi and jehovakabiru£ while immanueli was also tried and also failed baiame known in 1840 does not occur in a missionary primer before mr ridleys gurre kamilaroi 1856 so the missionary primer did not launch baiame before the missionaries came to wellington according to mr hale the baiame songs were brought by blacks from a distance we know how greek mysteries were also colportés to new centres and the yearly rite had in 1840 been for three years in abeyance moreover the etymology baia to make has a competitor in byamee  big man thus baiame as a divine being preceded the missionaries and is not a word of missionary manufacture while sacred words really of missionary manufacture do not find their way into native tradition mr hale admits that the ideas about baiame may possibly be of european origin though the great reluctance of the blacks to adopt any opinion from europeans makes against that theory         ridley speaking of 1855    langs queensland p 435        mrs langloh parker more australian legendary tales      1898 glossary        op cit p 110  it may be said that if baiame was premissionary his higher attributes date after mr ridleys labours abandoned for lack of encouragement in 1858 in 1840 mr hale found baiame located in an isle of the seas like circe living on fish which came to his call some native theologians attributed creation to his son burambin the demiurge a common savage form of gnosticism  on the nature of baiame we have however some curious early evidence of 184445 mr james manning in these years and earlier lived near the outside boundaries of settlers to the south a conversation with goethe when the poet was eightyfive induced him to study the native beliefs no missionaries he writes ever came to the southern district at any time and it was not till many years later that they landed in sydney on their way to moreton bay to attempt in vain to christianise the blacks of that locality before the queensland separation from this colony took place mr manning lost his notes of 1845 but recovered a copy from a set lent to lord audley and read them in november 1882 to the royal society of new south wales the notes are of an extraordinary character and mr manning perhaps unconsciously exaggerated their christian analogies by adopting christian terminology dean cowper however corroborated mr mannings general opinion by referring to evidence of archdeacon gunther who sent a grammar with remarks on bhaime or bhaiame from wellington to mr max müller he received his information he told me from some of the oldest blacks who he was satisfied could not have derived their ideas from white men as they had not then had intercourse with them old savages are not apt to be in a hurry to borrow european notions mr manning also averred that he obtained his information with the greatest difficulty they required such secrecy on my part and seemed so afraid of being heard even in the most secret places that in one or two cases i have seen them almost tremble in speaking one native after carefully examining doors and windows stood in a wooden fireplace and spoke in a tone little above a whisper and confirmed what i had before heard another stipulated that silence must be observed otherwise the european hands might question his wife in which case he would be obliged to kill her mr howitt also found that the name of darumulun in religion is too sacred to be spoken except almost in whispers while the total exclusion of women from mysteries and religious knowledge on pain of death is admitted to be universal among the tribes such secrecy so widely diffused is hardly compatible with humorous imposture by the natives  there is an element of humour in all things mr manning in 1882 appealed to his friend mr mann to give testimony to the excellency of black andy the native from whom he derived most of his notes which were corroborated by other black witnesses mr mann arose and replied that he had never met one aborigine who had any true belief in a supreme being on crossexamination they always said that they had got their information from a missionary or other resident black andy was not alluded to by mr mann who regarded all these native religious ideas as filtrations from european sources mr palmer on the other hand corroborated mr manning who repeated the expression of his convictions such then is the perplexed condition of the evidence        howitt7 a i xiii 193        mr mann told a story of native magic viewed by himself      which might rouse scepticism among persons not familiar with      what these conjurers can do  it may be urged that the secrecy and timidity of mr mannings informants corresponding with mr howitts experience makes for the affirmative side that in 1845 when mr manning made his notes missionaries were scarce and that a native crossexamined by the sceptical and jovial mr mann would probably not contradict lubbock o of c p 4 confidence is only won by sympathy and one inquirer will get authentic legends and folklore from a celt while another of the ordinary english type will totally fail on this point mr manning says sceptics should consider how easy it might be for intelligent men to pass almost a lifetime among the blacks in any quarter of this continent without securing the confidence even of the best of the natives around them through whom they might possibly become acquainted with their religious secrets secrets which they dare not reveal to their own women at all nor to their adult youths until the latter have been sworn to reticence under that terrifying ceremony which my notes describe in the same way mrs langloh parker found that an european neighbour would ask but have the blacks any legends and we have cited mr hartt on the difficulty of securing legends on the amazon while mr sproat had to live long among and become very intimate with the tribes of british columbia before he could get any information about their beliefs thus the present writer is disinclined to believe that the intelligence offered to mr manning with shy secrecy in 1845 was wholly a native copy of recently acquired hints on religion derived from europeans especially as mr howitt who had lived long among the kurnai and had written copiously on them knew nothing of their religion before about 1882 he was initiated and admitted to the knowledge like that of mr manning in 1845 the theory of borrowing is also checked by the closely analogous savage beliefs reported from north america before a single missionary had arrived and from africa for the australian african and american ideas have a common point of contact not easily to be explained as deduced from christianity according then to mr manning the natives believed in a being called boyma who dwells in heaven immovably fixed in a crystal rock with only the upper half of a supernatural body visible now about 1880 a native described baiame to mr howitt as a very great old man with a beard and with crystal pillars growing out of his shoulders which prop up a supernal sky this vision of baiame was seen by the native apparently as a result of the worldwide practice of crystalgazing mr tylor suspects the old man with the beard as derived from christian artistic representations but old men are notoriously the most venerated objects among the aborigines turning now to mrs langloh parkers more australian legendary tales p 90 we find byamee fixed to the crystal rock on which he sat in bullimah paradise are we to suppose that some savage caught at christian teaching added this feature of the crystal rock from the glassy sea of the apocalpyse or from the great white throne and succeeded in securing wide acceptance and long persistence for a notion borrowed from europeans is it likely that the chief opponents of christianity everywhere the wirreenuns or sorcerers would catch at the idea introduce it into the conservative ritual of the mysteries and conceal it from women and children who are as open as adults to missionary influence yet from native women and children the belief is certainly concealed        j a i xvi p 49 60  mr manning who prejudices his own case by speaking of boyma as the almighty next introduces us to a son of god equal to the father as touching his omniscience and otherwise but slightly inferior mr eyre had already reported on the unborn sons of noorele there is no mother the son of boymas name is grogoragally he watches over conduct and takes the good to ballima bullimah in mrs langloh parker the bad to oorooma the place of fire gumby mr eyre had attested similar ideas of future life of the souls with noorele eyre ii 357 in mrs langloh parkers book a messenger is called the allseeing spirit apparently identical with her wallahgooroonbooan whose voice is heard in the noise of the tundun or bullroarer used in the mysteries        more legendary tales p 86  grogoragally is unborn of any mother he is represented by mr manning as a mediator between boyma and the race of men here our belief is apt to break down and most people will think that black andy was a wellinstructed christian catechumen this occurred to mr manning who put it plainly to andy he replied that the existence of names in the native language for the sacred persons and places proved that they were not of european origin white fellow no call budgery place paradise ballima or other place oorooma nor god boyma nor son grogoragally only we black fellow think and call them that way in our own language before white fellow came into the country a son or deputy of the chief divine being is in fact found among the kurnai and in other tribes he directs the mysteries here then andy is backed by mr howitts aboriginal friends their deity sanctioned morality before the white men came to melbourne 1835 and was called our father at the same date several old men insisted on this as a matter of their own knowledge they were initiated before the arrival of europeans archdeacon gunther received the same statements from old aborigines and mr palmer speaking of other notions of tribes of the north is perfectly satisfied that none of their ideas were derived from the whites in any case black andys intelligence and logic are far beyond what most persons attribute to his race if we disbelieve him it must be on the score i think that he consciously added european ideas to names of native origin on the other hand analogous ideas not made so startling as in mr mannings christian terminology are found in many parts of australia        j a xiii p 192 193        op cit p 290  mr manning next cites moodgeegally the first man immortal a culture hero and a messenger of boymas there are a kind of rather mediaeval fiends waramolong who punish the wicked murderers liars and breakers of marriage laws in gumby women do not go to ballima boyma being celibate and women know nothing of all these mysteries certainly this secrecy is not an idea of christian origin if women get at the secret the whole race must be exterminated men going mad and slaying each other this notion we shall see is corroborated but if missionaries taught the ideas women must know all about them already mr mannings information was confirmed by a black from 300 miles away who called grogoragally by the name of boymagela there are no prayers except for the dead at burial corroborated by mrs langloh parkers beautiful legend of eerin byamee the mourners cry let in the spirit of eerin to bullimah save him from eleanbah wundah abode of the wicked for eerin was faithful on earth faithful to the laws you left us the creed is taught to boys when initiated with a hymn which mr mannings informant dared not to reveal he said angrily that mr manning already knew more than any other white man now to invent a hymn could not have been beyond the powers of this remarkable savage black andy the sons of baiame answer we have seen to those ascribed to noorele in mr eyres book they also correspond to daramulun where he is regarded as the son of baiame while the culture hero moodgeegally founder of the mysteries answers to tundun among the kurnai we have too in australia dawed a subordinate where mangarrah is the maker in the larrakeah tribe        more australian tales p 96        howitt j a  1885 p 313        j a i nov 1894 p 191  in some cases responsibility for evil pain and punishment are shifted from the good maker on to the shoulders of his subordinate this is the case in early virginia with okeus the subordinate of the creator the good ahone we have also in west africa the unpropitiated nyankupon with his active subordinate who has human sacrifices bobowissi and mulungu in central africa possesses many powerful servants but is himself kept a good deal behind the scenes of earthly affairs like the gods of epicurus the analogy as to the son interpreter of the divine will in apollo and zeus certainly not of christian origin is worth observing in the andaman islands mr mann after long and minute inquiry from the previously uncontaminated natives reports on an only son of puluga a sort of archangel who alone is permitted to live with his father whose orders it is his duty to make known to the morowin his sisters ministers of puluga the angels that is inferior ministers of pulugas will        william

this startling idea of the son is a natural result of a desire to preserve the remote and somewhat inaccessible and otiose dignity of the supreme being from the exertion of activity and how far it is a savage refraction of missionary teaching even where it seems to be anterior to missionary influences which with these races have been almost a complete failure the subject abounds in difficulty but the sceptic must account for the marvellously rapid acceptance of the european ideas by the most conservative savage class the doctors or sorcerers for the admission of the ideas into the most conservative of savage institutions the mysteries for the extreme reticence about the ideas in presence of the very europeans from whom they are said to have been derived and in some cases for the concealment of the ideas from the women who one presumes are as open as the men to missionary teaching it is very easy to talk of borrowing not so easy to explain these points on the borrowing theory above all when evidence is frequent that the ideas preceded the arrival of christian teachers  on this crucial point the question of borrowing i may cite mr mann as to the andamanese beliefs mr mann was for eleven years in the islands and for four years superintended our efforts to reclaim some natives he is well acquainted with the south andaman dialect and has made studies of the other forms of the language this excellent witness writes it is extremely improbable that their legends were the result of the teaching of missionaries or others they have no tradition of any foreign arrivals and their reputation undeserved as cannibals with their ferocity to invaders precludes the belief that any one ever settled there to convert or instruct them moreover to regard with suspicion as some have done the genuineness of such legends argues ignorance of the fact that numerous other tribes in equally remote or isolated localities have when first discovered been found to possess similar traditions on the subject under consideration further i have taken special care not only to obtain my information on each point from those who are considered by their fellow tribesmen as authorities but also from those who from having had little or no intercourse with other races were in entire ignorance regarding any save their own legends which they all agree in stating were handed down to them by their first parent tomo and his immediate descendants what mr mann says concerning the unborrowed character of andaman beliefs applies of course to the yet more remote and inaccessible natives of australia  in what has been and in what remains to be said it must be remembered that the higher religious ideas attributed to the australians are not their only ideas in this matter examples of their wild myths have already been offered they are totemists too and fear though they do not propitiate ghosts vague spirits unattached are also held in dread and inspire sorcerers and poets as also does the god bunjil        j a i xii pp 156 157        ibidy xvi pp 330 331 on bunjil        in folklore december 1898 will be found an essay      mr hartland on my account of australian gods instancing      many wild or comic myths some of them unknown to me when i      wrote the making of religion mr hartland seems to argue      that these destroy the sacredness of other coexisting native      beliefs of a higher kind but on this theory what religion      is sacred   all have contradictory myths    see      introduction  turning from early accounts of australian religion say from 1835 to 1845 we look at the more recent reports the best evidence is that of mr howitt who with mr fison laid the foundations of serious australian anthropology in kamilaroi and kurnai 1881 in 1881 mr howitt though long and intimately familiar with the tribes of gippsland the yarra the upper murray the murumbidgee and other districts had found no trace of belief in a moral supreme being he was afterwards however initiated or less formally let into the secret by two members of brajerak wild black fellows not of the same tribe as the kurnai the rites of these former aborigines are called kuringal their supreme being is daramulun believed in from the seacoast across to the northern boundary claimed by the wolgal about yass and gundagai and from omeo to at least as far as the shoalhaven river he was not as it seems to me everywhere thought to be a malevolent being but he was dreaded as one who could severely punish the trespasses committed against these tribal ordinances and customs whose first institution is ascribed to him it was taught also that daramulun himself watched the youths from the sky prompt to punish by sickness or death the breach of his ordinances these are often mere taboos an old man said i could not eat emus eggs he would be very angry and perhaps i should die it will hardly be argued that the savages have recently borrowed from missionaries this conception of daramulun as the originator and guardian of tribal taboos opponents must admit him as of native evolution in that character at least the creed of daramulun is not communicated to women and children it is said that the women among the ngarego and wolgal knew only that a great being lived beyond the sky and that he was spoken of by them as papang father this seemed to me when i first heard it to bear so suspicious a resemblance to a belief derived from the white men that i thought it necessary to make careful and repeated inquiries my ngarego and wolgal informants two of them old men strenuously maintained that it was so before the white men came they themselves only learned the doctrine when initiated as boys by the old men of that distant day the name daramulun was almost whispered to mr howitt and phrases were used such as he the man the name i told you of the same secrecy was preserved by a woiworung man about bunjil or pundjel though he did not show so much reluctance when repeating to me the folklore in which the great spirit of the kulin plays a part he was used or gesture signs were employed by this witness who told how his grandfather had warned him that bunjil watched his conduct from a star he can see you and all you do down herebefore the white men came to melbourne 1835        j a if xiii 1884 pp 192 193  are we to believe that this mystic secrecy is kept up as regards white men about a being first heard of from white men and is it credible that the old men the holders of tribal traditions and the most conservative of mortals would borrow a new divinity from the white devils conceal the doctrine from the women as accessible to missionary teaching as themselves adopt the new being as the founder of the antique mysteries and introduce him into the central rite and can the natives have done so steadily ever since about 1840 at least to believe all this is to illustrate the credulity of scepticism  mr howitt adds facts about tribes from twofold bay to sydney and as far west at least as hay here too daramulun instituted the rites his voice is heard in the noise of the whirling mudji bullroarer the muttering of thunder is said to be his voice calling to the rain to fall and make the grass grow up green such are the very words of umbara the minstrel of the tribe  at the rites respect for age for truth for unprotected women and married women and other details of sexual morality is inculcated partly in obscene dances a magic ceremony resembling mesmeric passes and accompanied by the word good nga is meant to make the boys acceptable to daramulun a temporary image of him is made on raised earth to be destroyed after the rites his attributes are then explained this is the master biamban who can go anywhere and do anything an old man is buried and rises again this ceremony is most impressive the opportunity is taken of impressing on the mind of youth in an indelible manner those rules of conduct which form the moral law of the tribe there is clearly a belief in a great spirit or rather an anthropomorphic supernatural being the master of all whose abode is above the sky and to whom are attributed powers of omnipotence and omnipresence or at any rate the power to do anything and go anywhere to his direct ordinance are attributed the social and moral laws of the community mr howitt ends i venture to assert that it can no longer be maintained that the australians have no belief which can be called religiousthat is in the sense of beliefs which govern tribal and individual morality under a supernatural sanction        j a i 1884 p 446        op cit p 453        j a i 1884 p 459  among the rites is one which is said to be intended to teach the boys to speak the straightforward truth and the kabos mystagogues thus explain it to them   it is perhaps unfortunate that mr howitt does not give a full account of what the morality thus sanctioned includes respect for age for truth for unprotected women and for nature as regards avoiding certain unnatural vices are alone spoken of in addition to taboos which have no relation to developed morality mr palmer in speaking of the morality inculcated in the mysteries of the northern australians adds to the elements of ethics mentioned by mr howitt in the south the lesson not to be quarrelsome to each lad is given by one of the elders advice so kindly fatherly and impressive as often to soften the heart and draw tears from the youth        j a 1 xiii 444        ibid xlii 296  so far the morality religiously sanctioned is such as men are likely to evolve and probably no one will maintain that it must have been borrowed from europeans it is argued that the morality is only such as the tribes would naturally develop mainly in the interests of the old the ruling class and of social order hartland op cit pp 316329 what else did any one ever suppose the mores of a people to be plus whatever may be allowed for the effects of kindliness or love which certainly exists i never hinted at morals divinely and supernormally revealed all morality had been denied to the australians yet in the religious rites they are taught to speak the straightforward truth as regards women there are parts of australia where disgusting laxity prevails except in cases prohibited by the extremely complex rules of forbidden degrees such parts are central australia and northwest central queensland  another point in mr howitts evidence deserves notice he at first wrote the supreme being who is believed in by all the tribes i refer to here either as a benevolent or more frequently as a malevolent being it seems to me represents the defunct headman  we have seen that mr howitt came to regard malevolence as merely the punitive aspect of the supreme being  as to the theory that such a being represents a dead headman no proof is anywhere given that ghosts of headmen are in any way propitiated even corpsefeeding was represented to mr dawson by intelligent old blacks as white fellows gammon mrs langloh parker writes to me that she when she began to study the blacks had i must allow a prejudice in favour of mr herbert spencers theoryit seemed so rational but accepting my savages evidence i must discard it as to offerings of food to the dead mrs langloh parker found that nothing was offered except food which happened to be in the possession of the corpse at his decease  for these reasons it is almost inconceivable that the supreme being should represent a dead headman as to dead men of any sort no tribute is paid mr howitt himself appears to have abandoned the hypothesis that daramulun represents a dead headman for he speaks of him as the great spirit or rather an anthropomorphic supernatural being        spencer and gillen and roth        dawson aborigines of australia        j a i 1884 p 458  a great spirit might conceivably be developed out of a little spirit even out of the ghost of a tribesman but to the conception of a supernatural anthropomorphic being the idea of spirit is not necessary men might imagine such an entity before they had ever dreamed of a ghost  having been initiated into the secrets of one set of tribes mr howitt was enabled to procure admission to those of another group of clans the kurnai for twentyfive years the jeraeil or mystery had been in abeyance for they are much in contact with europeans the old men however declared that they exactly reproduced with one confessed addition the ancestral ceremonies they were glad to do it for their lads now paid no attention either to the words of the old men or to those of the missionaries       j a i1885 p 304  this is just what usually occurs when we meet a savage tribe we destroy the old bases of its morality and substitute nothing new of our own they pay no attention to the words of the missionaries but loaf drink and gamble like station hands knocking down a cheque   consequently a rite unknown before the arrival of europeans is now introduced at the jeraeil swift would have been delighted by this ceremony it was thought that the boys having lived so much among the whites had become selfish and no longer willing to share that which they obtained by their own exertions or had given to them with their friends the boys were therefore placed in a row and the initiator or mystagogue stooped over the first boy and muttering some words which i could not catch he kneaded the lads stomach with his hands this he did to each one successively and by it the kurnai supposed the greediness  of the youth would be expelled         op cit pp 310 311  so far from unselfishness being a doctrine borrowed by the kurnai from christians and introduced into their rites it is as we saw in the case of the arunta of central australia part of the traditional moralitythe good old ancestral virtues says mr howittof the tribes a special ceremony is needed before unselfishness can be inspired among blacks who have lived much among adherents of the gospel  thus one satiric touch seems to demonstrate that the native ethics are not of missionary origin  after overcoming the scruples of the old men by proving that he really was initiated in the kuringal mr howitt was admitted to the central rite of the kurnai showing the grandfather the essence of it is that the mystae have their heads shrouded in blankets these are snatched off the initiator points solemnly to the sky with his throwing stick which propels the spears and then points to the tundun or bullroarer this object  was also used in the mysteries of ancient greece and is still familiar in the rites of savages in all quarters of the world  the ancestral beliefs are then solemnly revealed it seems desirable to quote freely the condensed version of mr howitt long ago there was a great being called munganngaur here a note adds that mungan means father and ngaur means our  he has no other name among the kurnai in other tribes the great supreme being besides being called father has a name for example bunjil baiame daramulun this being lived on the earth and taught the kurnai all the arts they know he also gave them the names they bear mungangnaur had a son the sonship doctrine already noticed by mr manning named tundun the bullroarer who was married and who is the direct ancestorthe weintwin or fathers fatherof the kurnai munganngaur instituted the jeraeil mysteries which was conducted by tundun who made the instruments a large and a small bullroarer as also in queensland which bear the name of himself and his wife  some tribal traitor impiously revealed the secrets of the jeraeil to women and thereby brought down the anger of mungan upon the kurnai he sent fire which filled the wide space between earth and sky men went mad and speared one another fathers killing their children husbands their wives and brethren each other this corroborates black andy then the sea rushed over the land and nearly all mankind were drowned those who survived became the ancestors of the kurnai tundun and his wife became porpoises as apollo in the homeric hymn became a dolphin mungan left the earth and ascended to the sky where he still remains        op cit pp 313 314  here the son is credited with none of the mediatorial attributes in mr mannings version but universal massacre as a consequence of revealing the esoteric doctrine is common to both accounts  morals are later inculcated  1 to listen to and obey the old men  2 to share everything they have with their friends  3 to live peaceably with their friends  4 not to interfere with girls or married women  5 to obey the food restrictions until they are released from them by the old men as at eleusis  these doctrines and the whole belief in munganngaur the kurnai carefully concealed from me says mr howitt until i learned them at the jeraeil mr howitt now admits in so many words that munganngaur is rather the beneficent father and the kindly though severe headman of the whole tribe than the malevolent wizard he considers it perhaps indicative of great antiquity that this identical belief forms part of the central mysteries of a tribe so isolated as the kurnai as well as of those of the tribes which had free communication one with another  as the morals sanctioned by munganngaur are simply the extant tribal morals of which unselfishness is a part as in central australia there seems no reason to attribute them to missionarieswho are quite unheeded this part of the evidence may close with a statement of mr howitts beyond the vaulted sky lies the mysterious home of that great and powerful being who is bunjil baiame or daramulun in different tribal languages but who in all is known by a name the equivalent of the only one used by the kurnai which is munganngaur our father        op cit 321 note 3        j a i xvi 64  other affirmative evidence might be adduced mr ridley who wrote primers in the kamilaroi language as early as in 1856 using baiame for god says in every part of australia where i have conversed with the aborigines they have a traditional belief in one supreme creator and he wonders as he well may at the statement to the contrary in the encyclopedia britannica which rests solely on the authority of dr lang in queensland of names for the supreme being mr ridley gives baiame anamba in queensland mumbal thunder and at twofold bay dhurumbulum which signifies in the namoi a sacred staff originally given by baiame and is used as the title of deity  by staff mr ridley appears to indicate the tundun or bullroarer this i venture to infer from mr matthews account of the wiradthuri new south wales with whom dhuramoolan is an extinct bugbear not answering to tundun among the kurnai who is subordinate as son to munganngaur and is associated with the mystic bullroarer as is gayandi the voice of the messenger of baiame among mrs langloh parkers informants in one tribe daramulun used to carry off and eat the initiated boys till he was stopped and destroyed by baiame this myth can hardly exist one may suppose among such tribes as consider daramulun to preside over the mysteries        j a i ii 1872 268 270        ibid xxv 298  living in contact with the baiameworshipping kamilaroi the wiradthuri appear to make a jest of the power of daramulun who we have learned is said to have died while his spirit dwells on high mr green way also finds turramulan to be subordinate to baiame who sees all and knows all if not directly through turramulan who presides at the bora turramulan is mediator in all the operations of baiame upon man and in all mans transactions with baiame turramulan means leg on one side only onelegged here the mediatorial aspect corroborates mr mannings information i would suggest periculo meo that there may have been some syncretism a baiameworshipping tribe adopting daramulun as a subordinate and mediator or baiame may have ousted daramulun as zeus did cronos  mr ridley goes on to observe that about eighteen years ago that is in 1854 he asked intelligent blacks if they knew baiame the answer was kamil zaia zummi baiame zaia winuzgulda i have not seen baiame i have heard or perceived him the same identical answer was given in 1872 by a man to whom i had never before spoken if asked who made the sky the earth the animals and man they always answer baiame varieties of opinion as to a future life exist all go to baiame or only the good the bad dying eternally or they change into birds        j a i xii 194        ibid vii 242        ibid ii 269  turning to northwest central queensland we find dr roth who knows the language and is partly initiated giving mulkari as a benevolent omnipresent supernatural being anything incomprehensible he offers a sentence mulkari tikkara ena  lord who dwellest among the sky again mulkari is the supernatural power who makes everything which the blacks cannot otherwise account for he is a good beneficent person and never kills any one he initiates medicine men his home is in the skies he once lived on earth and there was a culturehero inventing magic and spells that mulkari is an ancestral ghost as well as a beneficent maker i deem unlikely as no honours are paid to the dead not in any way to refer to the dead appears to be an universal rule among all these tribes mulkari has a malignant opposite or counterpart  nothing is said by dr roth as to inculcation of these doctrines at the mysteries nor do messrs spencer and gillen allude to any such being in their accounts of central australian rites if we except the selfexisting out of nothing ungambikula skydwellers  one rite is supposed to make the men who pass through it more kindly we are not told why we have also an allusion to the great spirit twangirika whose voice the women are told is heard in the noise of the bullroarer        roth pp 14 36 116 153158 165        spencer and gillen p 369        ibid p 246  the belief is fundamentally the same as that found in all australian tribes write the authors in a note citing tundun and daramulun but they do not tell us whether the arunta belief includes the sanction by twangirika of morality if it does not have the central australians never developed the idea or have they lost it they have had quite as much experience of white men or rather much more than the believers in baiame or bunjil before the white men came to melbourne and if one set of tribes borrowed ideas from whites why did not the other  the evidence here collected is not exhaustive we might refer to pirnmeheal a good being whom the blacks loved before they were taught by missionaries to fear him        dawson the australian aborigines  mr dawson took all conceivable pains to get authentic information and to ascertain whether the belief in pirnmeheal was preeuropean he thinks it was original the idea of godborrowing is repudiated by manning gunther ridley greenway palmer mrs langloh parker and others speaking for trained observers and in several cases for linguists studying the natives on the spot since 1845 it is thought highly improbable by mr hale 1840 it is rejected by waitzgerland speaking for studious science in europe mr howitt beginning with distrust seems now to regard the beliefs described as of native origin on the other hand we have mr mann who has been cited and the great authority of mr e b tylor who however has still to reply to the arguments in favour of the native origin of the beliefs which i have ventured to offer such arguments are the occurrence of baiame before the arrival of missionaries the secrecy as regards europeans about ideas derived mr tylor thinks from europeans the ignorance of the women on these heads the notorious conservatism of the doctors who promulgate the creed as to ritual and dogma and the other considerations which have been fully stated in the meanwhile i venture to think subject to correction that while black andy may have exaggerated or mr manning may have coloured his evidence by christian terminology and while mythical accretions on a religious belief are numerous yet the lowest known human race has attained a religious conception very far above what savages are usually credited with and has not done so by way of the ghosttheory of the anthropologists in this creed sacrifice and ghostworship are absent  it has seemed worth while to devote space and attention to the australian beliefs because the vast continent contains the most archaic and backward of existing races we may not yet have a sufficient collection of facts microscopically criticised but the evidence here presented seems deserving of attention about the still more archaic but extinct tasmanians and their religion evidence is too scanty too casual and too conflicting for

whatever view may be taken of the past history of the bushmen of south africa it is certain that at present they are a race on a very low level of development even the hottentots according to dr bleek exceed the bushmen in civilisation and political organisation        see waitz anthrop nat volk ii 323329  before investigating the religious myths of the bushmen it must be repeated that as usual their religion is on a far higher level than their mythology the conception of invisible or extranatural powers which they entertain and express in moments of earnest need is all unlike the tales which they tell about their own  our main authorities at present for bushman myths are contained in a brief account of bushman folklore bleek london 1875 and in a glimpse into the mythology of the maluti bushmen by mr orpen chief magistrate st johns territory cape monthly magazine july 1874 some information may also be gleaned from the south african folklore journal 187980 gods if gods such mythical beings may be called thus livingstone says on questioning intelligent men among the bakwains as to their former knowledge of good and evil of god and the future state they have scouted the idea of any of them ever having been without a tolerably clear conception on all these subjects their ideas of sin were the same as livingstones except about polygamy and apparently murder probably there were other trifling discrepancies but they spoke in the same way of the direct influence exercised by god in giving rain in answer to the prayers of the rainmakers and in granting deliverance in times of danger as they do now before they ever heard of white men  this was to be expected in short the religion of savages in its childlike and hopeful dependence on an invisible friend or friends in its hope of moving him or them by prayer in its belief that he or they make for righteousness is absolutely human on the other side as in the myths of greece or india stand the absurd and profane anecdotes of the gods        missionary travels p 158  we now turn to a bushmans account of the religious myths of his tribe shortly after the affair of langalibalele mr orpen had occasion to examine an unknown part of the maluti range the highest mountains in south africa he engaged a scout named qing son of a chief of an almost exterminated clan of hill bushmen he was now huntsman to king nqusha morosis son on the orange river and had never seen a white man except fighting thus qings evidence could not be much affected by european communications mr orpen secured the services of qing who was a young man and a mighty hunter by inviting him to explain the wallpictures in caves mr orpen led him on to give an account of cagn the chief mythical being in bushman religion cagn made all things and we pray to him said qing at first he was very good and nice but he got spoilt through fighting so many things the prayer uttered by qing in a low imploring voice ran thus o cagn o cagn are we not your children do you not see our hunger give us food where cagn is qing did not know but the elands know have you not hunted and heard his cry when the elands suddenly run to his call now comes in myth cagn has a wife called coti how came he into the world perhaps with those who brought the sun only the initiated men of that dance know these things        another bushman prayer a touching appeal is given in      alexanders expedition ii 125 and a khoikhoi hymn of      prayer is in hahn pp 56 57        cf custom and myth pp 41 42 it appears that the      bushmen like the egyptians and greeks hand down myths      through esoteric societies with dramatic mysteries  cagn had two sons cogaz and gcwi he and they were great chiefs but used stonepointed digging sticks to grub up edible roots cagns wife brought forth a fawn and like cronus when rhea presented him with a foal cagn was put to it to know the nature and future fortunes of this child of his to penetrate the future he employed the ordinary native charms and sorcery the remainder of the myth accounts for the origin of elands and for their inconvenient wildness a daughter of cagns married snakes who were also men the eternal confusion of savage thought these snakes became the people of cagn cagn had a tooth which was great medicine his force resided in it and he lent it to people whom he favoured the birds as in odins case were his messengers and brought him news of all that happened at a distance        compare with the separable vigour of cagn residing in his      tooth the european and egyptian examples of a similar      myththe lock of hair of minos the hair of samsonin      introduction to mrs hunts grimms household stories      p lxxv  he could turn his sandals and clubs into dogs and set them at his enemies the baboons were once men but they offended cagn and sang a song with the burden cagn thinks he is clever so he drove them into desolate places and they are accursed till this day his strong point was his collection of charms which like other bushmen and hottentots he kept in his belt he could and did assume animal shapes for example that of a bulleland the thorns were once people and killed cagn and the ants ate him but his bones were collected and he was revived it was formerly said that when men died they went to cagn but it has been denied by later bushmen sceptics  such is qings account of cagn and cagn in myth is plainly but a successful and idealised medicineman whose charms actually work dr bleek identifies his name with that of the mantis insect this insect is the chief mythological personage of the bushmen of the western province kággen his name is written dr bleek knew of no prayer to the mantis but was acquainted with addresses to the sun moon and stars if dr bleeks identification is correct the cagn of qing is at once human and a sort of grasshopper just as pundjel was half human half eaglehawk  the most prominent of the mythological figures says dr bleek speaking of the bushmen is the mantis his proper name is kaggen but if we call him cagn the interests of science will not seriously suffer his wife is the dasse hyrax their adopted daughter is the porcupine daughter of khwdi hemm the alldevourer like cronus and many other mythological persons the alldevourer has the knack of swallowing all and sundry and disgorging them alive dr bleek offers us but a wandering and disjointed account of the mantis or cagn who is frequently defeated by other animals such as the suricat cagn has one point at least in common with zeus as zeus was swallowed and disgorged by cronus so was cagn by khwái hemm as indra once entered into the body of a cow so did cagn enter into the body of an elephant dr bleek did not find that the mantis was prayed to as cagn was by qing the moon like sun and stars is however prayed to and the moon belongs to the mantis who indeed made it out of his old shoe the chameleon is prayed to for rain on occasion and successfully  the peculiarity of bushman mythology is the almost absolute predominance of animals except an old woman who appears now and then in these incoherent legends their myths have scarcely one human figure to show now whether the bushmen be deeply degenerate from a past civilisation or not it is certain that their myths are based on their actual condition of thought unless we prefer to say that their intellectual condition is derived from their myths we have already derived the constant presence and personal action of animals in myth from that savage condition of the mind in which all things animate or inanimate human animal vegetable or inorganic seem on the same level of life passion and reason chap iii now there can be no doubt that whether the bushman mind has descended to this stage or not in this stage it actually dwells at present as examples we may select the following from dr bleeks bushman folklore díalkwáin told how the death of his own wife was foretold by the springbok and the gemsbok again for examples of living belief in community of nature with animals dialkwain mentioned an old woman a relation and friend of his own who had the power of turning herself into a lioness another bushman kabbo retaining doubtless his wideawake mental condition in his sleep dreamed of lions which talked another informant explained that lions talk like men by putting their tails in their mouth  this would have pleased sydney smith who thought that if lions would meet and growl out their observations to each other they might sensibly improve in culture again all things that belong to the mantis can talk and most things do belong to that famous being in news from zululand in a myth of the battle of isandlwana a bluebuck turns into a young man and attacks the british        folklore journal of south africa i iv 83  these and other examples demonstrate that the belief in the personal and human character and attributes of animals still prevails in south africa from that living belief we derive the personal and human character and attributes of animals which remarkable in all mythologies is perhaps specially prominent in the myths of the bushmen  though bushman myth is only known to us in its outlines and is apparently gifted with even more than the due quantity of incoherence it is perhaps plain that animals are the chief figures in this african lore and that these bushmen gods if ever further developed will retain many traces of their animal ancestry  from the bushmen we may turn to their near neighbours the hottentots or khoikhoi their religious myths have been closely examined in dr hahns tsuni goam the supreme being of the khoikhoi though dr hahns conclusions as to the origin of hottentot myth differ entirely from our own his collection and critical study of materials of oral traditions and of the records left by old travellers are invaluable the early european settlers at the cape found the khoikhoi that is the men a yellowish race of people who possessed large herds of cattle sheep and goats the khoikhoi as nomad cattle and sheep farmers are on a much higher level of culture than the bushmen who are hunters        op cit i pp 1 32        ibid p 5  the languages of the two peoples leave no more doubt as to their primitive relationship p 7 the wealth of the khoikhoi was considerable and unequally distributed a respectable proof of nascent civilisation the rich man was called gou aob that is fat in the same way the early greeks called the wealthy  as the rich man could afford many wives which gives him a kind of commendation over men to whom he allots his daughters he gradually rose to the station of a chief in domestic relations khoikhoi society is matriarchal pp 1921         herodotus v 30        op cit p 16        but

among the arts pottery and matmaking metallurgy and toolmaking are of ancient date a past stone age is indicated by the use of quartz knives in sacrifice and circumcision in khoikhoi society seers and prophets were the greatest and most respected old men of the clan p 24 the khoikhoi of today have adopted a number of indoeuropean beliefs and customs and the christian ideas introduced by missionaries have amalgamated with the national religious ideas and mythologies for which reasons dr hahn omits many legends which though possibly genuine might seem imported pp 30 31  a brief historical abstract of what was known to old travellers of khoikhoi religion must now be compiled from the work of dr hahn  in 1655 corporal müller found adoration paid to great stones on the side of the paths the worshippers pointed upwards and said hette hie probably heitsi eibib the name of a khoikhoi extranatural being it appears p 37 that heitsi eibib has changed names in parts of south africa and what was his worship is now offered to garubeb or tsui goab in 1671 dapper found that the khoikhoi believe there is one who sends rain on earth they also believe that they themselves can make rain and prevent the wind from blowing worship of the moon and of erected stones is also noticed in 1691 nicolas witsen heard that the khoikhoi adored a god which dr hahn p 91 supposes to have been a peculiarshaped stonefetish such as the basutos worship and spit at witsen found that the god was daubed with red earth like the dionysi in greece about 1705 valentyn gathered that the people believed in a great chief who dwells on high and a devil but in carefully examining this it is nothing else but their somsomas and spectres p 38 we need not accept that opinion the worship of a great chief is mentioned again in 1868 in 1719 peter kolb the german magister published his account of the hottentots which has been done into english kolb gives gounja gounja or gounja ticqvoa as the divine name they say he is a good man who does nobody any hurt and that he dwells far above the moon  this corresponds to the australian pirnmeheal kolb also noted propitiation of an evil power he observed that the khoikhoi worship the mantis insect which as we have seen is the chief mythical character among the bushmen        second edition london 1788        engl transl 95        engl transl i 97 gives a picture of khoikhoi      adoring the mantis  dr hahn remarks strangely enough the namaquas also call it gaunab as they call the enemy of tsui goab in kolbs time as now the rites of the khoi except apparently their worship at dawn were performed beside cairns of stones if we may credit kolb the khoikhoi are not only most fanatical adorers of the mantis but pay a religious veneration to their saints and men of renown departed thunberg 1792 noticed cairnworship and heard of mantisworship in 1803 lichtenstein saw cairnworship with the beginning of the present century we find in appleyard ebner and others khoikhoi names for a god which are translated soreknee or woundedknee   this title is explained as originally the name of a doctor or sorcerer of repute invoked even after death and finally converted into a deity his enemy is gaunab an evil being and he is worshipped at the cairns below which he is believed to be buried about 1842 knudsen considered that the khoikhoi believed in a dead medicineman heitsi eibib who could make rivers roll back their waves and then walk over safely as in the märchen of most peoples he was also like odin a shapeshifter and he died several times and came to life again        page 42 compare pp 92 125        alexander expedition i  166  hahn op cit pp 69      50 where moffat is quoted        hahn p 66  thus the numerous graves of heitsi eibib are explained by his numerous deaths in egypt the numerous graves of osiris were explained by the story that he was mutilated and each limb buried in a different place probably both the hottentot and the egyptian legend were invented to account for the many worshipped cairns attributed to the same corpse  we now reach the myths of heitsi eibib and tsui goab collected by dr hahn himself according to the evidence of dr hahns own eyes the working religion of the khoikhoi is a firm belief in sorcery and the arts of living medicinemen on the one hand and on the other belief in and adoration of the powers of the dead pp 81 82 112 113 our author tells us that he met in the wilds a woman of the fat or wealthy class going to pray at the grave and to the manes of her own father we khoikhoi always if we are in trouble go and pray at the graves of our grandparents and ancestors they also sing rude epic verses accompanied by the dance in honour of men distinguished in the late namaqua and damara war now it is alleged by dr hahn that prayers are offered at the graves of heitsi eibib and tsui goab as at those of ancestors lately dead and heitsi eibib and tsui goab within living memory were honoured by song and dance exactly like the braves of the damara war  the obvious and natural inference is that heitsi eibib and tsui goab were and are regarded by their worshippers as departed but still helpful ancestral warriors or medicinemen we need not hold that they ever were actual living men they may be merely idealised figures of khoikhoi wisdom and valour here as elsewhere animism ghostworship is potent and in proportion theism declines  here dr hahn offers a different explanation founded on etymological conjecture and a philosophy of religion according to him the name of tsui goab originally meant not wounded knee but red dawn the dawn was worshipped as a symbol or suggestion of the infinite and only by forgetfulness and false interpretation of the original word did the khoikhoi fall from a kind of pure theosophy to adoration of a presumed dead medicineman as dr hahns ingenious hypothesis has been already examined by us it is unnecessary again to discuss the philological basis of his argument  dr hahn not only heard simple and affecting prayers addressed to tsui goab but learned from native informants that the god had been a chief a warrior wounded in his knee in battle with gaunab another chief and that he had prophetic powers he still watches the ways of men p 62 and punishes guilt universal testimony was given to the effect that heitsi eibib also had been a chief from the east a prophet and a warrior he apportioned by blessings and curses their present habits to many of the animals like odin he was a shapeshifter possessing the medicinemans invariable power of taking all manner of forms he was on one occasion born of a cow which reminds us of a myth of indra by another account he was born of a virgin who tasted a certain kind of grass this legend is of wonderfully wide diffusion among savage and semicivilised races        custom and myth pp 197211        le fits de la vierge h de charency havre 1879 a tale      of incest by heitsi eibib may be compared with another in      muirs sanskrit texts iv 39  the tales about tsui goab and heitsi eibib are chiefly narratives of combats with animals and with the evil power in a nascent dualism gaunab at first a ghost according to hahn p 85 or certainly nobody else but the night pp 125 126 here there is some inconsistency if we regard the good power tsui goab as the red dawn we are bound to think the evil power gaunab a name for the night but dr hahns other hypothesis that the evil power was originally a malevolent ghost seems no less plausible in either case we have here an example of the constant mythical dualism which gives the comparatively good being his perpetual antagonistthe loki to his odin the crow to his eaglehawk in brief hottentot myth is pretty plainly a reflection of hottentot general ideas about ancestor worship ghosts sorcerers and magicians while in their religious aspect heitsi eibib or tsui goab are guardians of life and of morality fathers and friends  a description of barbarous beliefs not less scholarly and careful than that compiled by dr hahn has been published by the rev r h codrington mr codrington has studied the

of tonga in the first decade of this century the tongan religious beliefs were nearly akin to the ideas of the samoans and of the solomon islanders in place of vuis they spoke of hotooas atuas and like the vuis those spiritual beings have either been purely spiritual from the beginning or have been incarnate in humanity and are now ghosts but ghosts enjoying many of the privileges of gods all men however have not souls capable of a separate existence only the egi or nobles possess a spiritual part which goes to bolotoo the land of gods and ghosts after death and enjoys power similar to that of the original gods but less  it is open to philosophers of mr herbert spencers school to argue that the original gods were once ghosts like the others but this was not the opinion of the tongans they have a supreme creator who alone receives no sacrifice both sorts of gods appear occasionally to mankindthe primitive deities particularly affect the forms of lizards porpoises and a species of watersnake hence those animals are much respected        mariner ii 205        mariners tonga islands edin 1827 ii 99101  whether each stock of tongans had its own animal incarnation of its special god does not appear from mariners narrative the gods took human morality under their special protection punishing the evil and rewarding the good in this life only not in the land of the dead when the comfortable doctrine of eternal punishment was expounded to the tongans by mariner the poor heathen merely remarked that it was very bad indeed for the papalangies or foreigners their untutored minds in their pagan darkness had dreamed of no such thing the tongans themselves are descended from some gods who set forth on a voyage of discovery out of bolotoo landing on tonga these adventurers were much pleased with the island and determined to stay there but in a few days certain of them died they had left the deathless coasts for a world where death is native and as they had eaten of the food of the new realm they would never escape the condition of mortality this has been remarked as a widespread belief persephone became enthralled to hades after tasting the mystic pomegranate of the underworld  in samoa siati may not eat of the gods meat nor wainamoinen in pohjola nor thomas the rhymer in fairyland the exploring gods from bolotoo were in the same way condemned to become mortal and people the world with mortal beings and all about them should be méa máma subject to decay and death it is remarkable if correctly reported that the secondary gods or ghosts of nobles cannot reappear as lizards porpoises and watersnakes this is the privilege of the original gods only and may be an assumption by them of a conceivably totemistic aspect the nearest approach to the idea of a permanent supreme deity is contained in the name of táli y toobowait there tooboa name which conveys the notion perhaps of permanence or eternity he is a great chief from the top of the sky to the bottom of the earth        mariner ii 115        ibid ii 205  he is invoked both in war and peace not locally but for the general good of the natives he is the patron not of any special stock or family but of the house in which the royal power is lodged for the time alone of gods he is unpropitiated by food or libation indicating that he is not evolved out of a hungry ghost another god toobo toty or toobo the mariner may be a kind of poseidon he preserves canoes from perils at sea on the death of the daughter of finow the king in mariners time that monarch was so indignant that he threatened to kill the priest of toobo toty as the god is believed to inspire the priest this was certainly a feasible way of getting at the god but toobo toty was beforehand with finow who died himself before he could carry the war into bolotoo this finow was a sceptic he allowed that there were gods because he himself had occasionally been inspired by them but what the priests tell us about their power over mankind i believe to be all false thus early did the conflict of church and state declare itself in tonga human sacrifices were a result of priestcraft in tonga as in greece even the man set to kill a child of toobo toas was moved by pity and exclaimed o iaooe chi vale poor little innocent the priest demanded this sacrifice to allay the wrath of the gods for the slaying of a man in consecrated ground such are the religious ideas of tonga of their mythology but little has reached us and that is under suspicion of being coloured by acquaintance with the stories of missionaries        mariner i 307 it 107        compare the ayos of the alcmænidæ  the maoris when first discovered by europeans were in a comparatively advanced stage of barbarism their society had definite ranks from that of the rangatira the chief with a long pedigree to the slave their religious hymns of great antiquity have been collected and translated by grey taylor bastian and others the mere possession of such hymns accurately preserved for an unknown number of years by oral tradition proves that the mythical notions of the maoris have passed through the minds of professed bards and early physical speculators the verses as bastian has observed die heilige sage der polynesier display a close parallel to the roughest part of the early greek cosmogonies as expounded by hesiod yet in the maori hymns there are metaphysical ideas and processes which remind one more of heraclitus than of hesiod and perhaps more of hegel than of either whether we are to regard the abstract conceptions or the rude personal myths of gods such as a the beyond all as representing the earlier development of maori thought whether one or the other element is borrowed not original are questions which theorists of different schools will settle in their own way to their own satisfaction some hymns represent the beginning of things from a condition of thought and socrates might have said of the maori poets as he did of anaxagoras that compared with other early thinkers they are like sober men among drunkards thus one hymn of the origins runs thus       from the conception the increase      from the increase

these extracts are obviously speculative rather than in any sense mythological the element of myth just shows itself when we are told that the sky dwelt with the earth and produced certain islands but myth of a familiar character is very fully represented among the maoris their mythical gods though mixed up with the spirits of ancestors are great natural powers first heaven and earth rangi and papa the parents of all these are conceived as having originally been united in such a close embrace the heaven lying on the earth that between their frames all was darkness and in darkness the younger

let us seek means whereby to destroy heaven and earth or to separate them from each other the counsel of tane mahuta prevailed let one go upwards and become a stranger to us let the other remain below

a still worse one after death again after maui came a host of gods each with his history and wonderful deeds these were ancestors who became deified by their respective tribesa statement which must be

that the planet mars is called after him maru there were also gods in human forms and others with those of reptiles at one period there seems to have been a mixed offspring from the same parents thus while tawaki was of the human form his brethren were taniwa and sharks there were likewise mixed marriages among them these legends are the natural result of that lack of distinction between man and the other things in the world which as we demonstrated prevails in early thought it appears that the great mythical gods of the maoris have not much concern with their morality the myths are but a magnified history of their chiefs their wars murders and lusts with the addition of some supernatural powerssuch as the chiefs are very apt to claim in the opinion of a competent observer the gods or atua who are feared in daily life are spirits of the dead and their attention is chiefly confined to the conduct of their living descendants and clansmen they inspire courage the leading virtue when converted the natives are said not to expel but merely to subordinate their atua believing christ to be a more powerful atua        op cit p 137        shortland trad and superst of new zealanders 1856      pp 8385  the maoris are perhaps the least elevated race in which a welldeveloped polytheism has obscured almost wholly that belief in a moral maker which we find among the lowest savages who have but a rudimentary polytheism when we advance to ancient civilised peoples like the greeks we shall find the archaic theism obscured or obliterated in a similar way  in the beliefs of samoa formerly called the navigators islands and discovered by a dutch expedition in 1722 may be observed a most interesting moment in the development of religion and myth in many regions it has been shown that animals are worshipped as totems and that the gods are invested with the shape of animals in the temples of higher civilisations will be found divine images still retaining in human form certain animal attributes and a minor worship of various beasts will be shown to have grouped itself in greece round the altars of zeus or apollo or demeter now in samoa we may perhaps trace the actual process of the transition as mr tylor says from the spirit inhabiting an individual body to the deity presiding over all individuals of a kind in other words whereas in australia or america each totemkindred reveres each animal supposed to be of its own lineagethe cranes revering all cranes the kangaroos all kangaroosin samoa the various clans exhibit the same faith but combine it with the belief that one spiritual deity reveals itself in each separate animal as in a kind of avatar for example the several australian totemkindreds do not conceive that pundjel incarnates himself in the emu for one stock in the crow for another in the cockatoo for a third and they do not by these but by other means attain a religious unity transcending the diversity caused by the totemic institutions in samoa this kind of spiritual unity is actually reached by various stocks  the samoans were originally spoken of by travellers as the godless samoans an example of a common error probably there is no people whose practices and opinions if duly investigated do not attest their faith in something of the nature of gods certainly the samoans far from being godless rather deserve the reproach of being in all things too superstitious the gods were supposed to appear in some visible incarnation and the particular thing in which his god was in the habit of appearing was to the samoanan object of veneration        turners samoa p 17  here we find that the religious sentiment has already become more or less selfconscious and has begun to reason on its own practices in pure totemism it is their kindred animal that men revere the samoans explain their worship of animals not on the ground of kinship and common blood or one flesh as in australia but by the comparatively advanced hypothesis that a spiritual power is in the animal one for instance saw his god in the eel another in the shark another in the turtle another in the dog another in the owl another in the lizard and so on even to shellfish the creed so far is exactly what garcilasso de la vega found among the remote and ruder neighbours of the incas and attributed to the preinca populations a man as in egypt and in totemic countries generally would eat freely of what was regarded as the incarnation of the god of another man but the incarnation of his own god he would consider it death to injure or eat the god was supposed to avenge the insult by taking up his abode in that persons body and causing to generate there the very thing which he had eaten until it produced death the god used to be heard within the man saying i am killing this man he ate my incarnation this class of tutelary deities they called aitu fale or gods of the house gods of the stock or kindred in totemistic countries the totem is respected per se in samoa the animal is worshipful because a god abides within him this appears to be a theory by which the reflective samoans have explained to themselves what was once pure totemism  not only the household but the village has its animal gods or god incarnate in an animal as some arab tribes piously bury dead gazelles as athenians piously buried wolves and egyptians cats so in samoa if a man found a dead owl by the roadside and if that happened to be the incarnation of his village god he would sit down and weep over it and beat his forehead with a stone till the blood came this was supposed to be pleasing to the deity then the bird would be wrapped up and buried with care and ceremony as if it were a human body this however was not the death of the god like the solemnly sacrificed buzzard in california like the bull in the attic dupolia he was supposed to be yet alive and incarnate in all the owls in existence  in addition to these minor and local divinities the samoans have gods of sky earth disease and other natural departments of their origin we only know that they fell from heaven and all were incarnated or embodied in birds beasts plants stones and fishes but they can change shapes and appear in the moon when she is not visible or in any other guise they choose if in samoa the skygod was once on the usual level of skygods elsewhere he seems now to be degenerate         porph de abstt ii 29 samoa p      21        i am careful not to call samoan sacred animals totems      to which mr tylor justly objects but i think the samoan      belief has

the subject is the more interesting as anything like systematic borrowing of myths from the old world is all but impossible as has already been argued in chapter xi america it is true may have been partially discovered many times there probably have been several points and moments of contact between the new and the old world yet at the time when the spaniards landed there and while the first conquests and discoveries were being pursued the land and the people were to europeans practically as novel as the races and territories of a strange planet but the new world only revealed the old

syllabary the mexican mss are but an advanced picturewriting more organised than that of the ojibbeways the peruvian quipus was scarcely better than the red indian wampum records mexicans and peruvians were settled in what deserved to be called cities they had developed a monumental and elaborately decorated architecture they were industrious in the arts known to them though ignorant of iron among the aztecs at least weapons and tools of bronze if rare were not unknown they were sedulous in agriculture disciplined in war capable of absorbing and amalgamating with conquered tribes  in peru the ruling family the incas enjoyed all the sway of a hierarchy and the chief inca occupied nearly as secure a position religious social and political as any rameses or thothmes in mexico doubtless the monarchs power was at least nominally limited in much the same way as that of the persian king the royal rule devolved on the elected member of an ancient family but once he became prince he was surrounded by imposing ceremony in both these two civilised peoples the priesthood enjoyed great power and in mexico though not so extensively if at all in peru practised an appalling ritual of cannibalism and human sacrifice it is extremely probable or rather certain that both of these civilisations were younger than the culture of other american peoples long passed away whose cities stand in colossal ruin among the forests whose hieroglyphs seem undecipherable and whose coppermines were worked at an unknown date on the shore of lake superior over the origin and date of

settled pueblo indians were the hunter tribes of north america generally they dwelt indeed in collections of wigwams which were partially settled and the long house of the iroquois looks like an approach to the communal system of the pueblos but while such races as iroquois mandans and ojibbeways cultivated the maize plant they depended for food more than did the pueblo peoples on success in the chase deer elk buffalo the wild turkey the bear with ducks and other birds supplied the big kettle with its contents their society was totemistic as has already been described kinship as a rule

inclined to deduce the peculiarly savage cruelty of american war and american religion sympathy was undeveloped possibly the lack of tame animals may have encouraged the prevalence of human sacrifice

whether originally of the same stock or not run many strands of religious and mythical beliefsthe very threads that are woven into the varied faiths of the old world the dread of ghosts the religious adoration paid to animals the belief in kindred and protecting beasts the worship of inanimate objects roughly styled fetishes a certain reverence for the great heavenly bodies sun moon and pleiades a tendency to regard the stars with all other things and phenomena as animated and personalwith a belief in a supreme creator these are the warp as it were of the fabric of american religion        the arguments against the borrowing of the creator from      missionaries have already been stated  in one stage of culture one set of those ideas may be more predominant than in another stage but they are present in all the zoomorphic or theriomorphic mythologies and creeds are nowhere more vivacious than in america not content with the tribal zoomorphic guardian and friend the totem each indian was in the habit of seeking for a special animal protector of his own this being which he called his manitou revealed itself to him in the long fasts of that savage sacrament which consecrates the entrance on full manhood even in the elaborate religions of the civilised races peruvians and aztecs the animal deities survive and sacred beasts gather in the shrine of pachacamac or a rudimentary remnant of ancestral beak or feather clings to the statue of huitzilopochtli but among the civilised peoples in which the division of labour found its place and human ranks were minutely discriminated the gods too had their divisions and departments an organised polytheism prevailed and in the temples of centeotl and tlazolteotl herodotus or pausanias would have readily recognised the demeter and the aphrodite of mexico  there were departmental gods and there was even an obvious tendency towards the worship of one spiritual deity the bretwalda of all the divine kings a god on his way to becoming single and supreme the religions and myths of america thus display like the myths and religions of the old world the long evolution of human thought in its seeking after god the rude first draughts of deity are there and they are by no means effaced in the fantastic priestly designs of departmental divinities  the question of a primitive american monotheism has been more debated than even that of the henotheism of the aryans in india on this point it must be said that in a certain sense probably any race of men may be called monotheistic just as in another sense christians who revere saints may be called polytheistic        gaidoz revue critique march 1887  it has been constantly set forth in this work that in moments of truly religious thought even the lowest tribes turn their minds towards a guardian a higher power something which watches and helps the race of men this mental approach towards the powerful friend is an aspiration and sometimes a dogma it is religious not mythological it is monotheistic not polytheistic the being appealed to by the savage in moments of need or despair may go by a name which denotes a hawk or a spider or a grasshopper but we may be pretty sure that little thought of such creatures is in the mind of the worshipper in his hour of need        there are exceptions as when the ojibbeway being in      danger appeals to his own private protecting manitou      perhaps a wild duck or when the zuni cries to ye animal      gods my fathers bureau of ethnol 188081 p 42 thus      we can scarcely agree entirely with m maurice vernes when      he says all men are monotheistic in the fervour of      adoration or in moments of deep thought lhistoire des      religions paris 1887 p 61 the tendency of adoration      and of speculation is however monotheistic  again the most ludicrous or infamous tales may be current about the adventures and misadventures of the grasshopper or the hawk he may be as mythically conceived only one out of a crowd of similar magnified nonnatural men or lower animals but neither his companions nor his legend are likely to distract the thoughts of the bushman who cries to cagn for food or of the murri who tells his boy that pundjel watches him from the heavens or of the solomon islander who appeals to qat as he crosses the line of reefs and foam thus it may be maintained that whenever man turns to a guardian not of this world not present to the senses man is for the moment a theist and often a monotheist but when we look from aspiration to doctrine from the solitary ejaculation to ritual from religion to myth it would probably be vain to suppose that an uncontaminated belief in one god only the maker and creator of all things has generally prevailed either in america or elsewhere such a belief rejecting all minor deities consciously stated in terms and declared in ritual is the result of long ages and efforts of the highest thought or if once and again the intuition of deity has flashed on some lonely shepherd or sage like an inspiration his creed has usually been at war with the popular opinions of men and has except in islam won its disciples from the learned and refined america seems no exception to so general a rule  an opposite opinion is very commonly entertained because the narratives of missionaries and even the novels of cooper and others have made readers familiar with such terms as the great spirit in the mouths of pawnees or mohicans on the one hand taking the view of borrowing mrs e a smith says the great spirit so popularly and poetically know as

the american peoples doubtless it may be maintained that the religious impulse or sentiment never wholly dies but after being submerged in a flood of fables reappears in the philosophic conception of a pure deity entertained by a few of the cultivated classes of mexico and peru but our business just now is with the flood of fables from north to south the more general beliefs are marked with an early dualism and everywhere are met the two opposed figures of a good and a bad extranatural being in the shape of a man or beast the eskimos for example call the better being torngarsuk they dont all agree about his form or aspect some say he has no form at all others describe him as a great bear or as a great man with one arm or as small as a finger he is immortal but might be killed by the

spirit is a nameless female the wife or mother of torngarsuk she dwells under the sea in a habitation guarded by a cerberus of her own a huge dog which may be surprised for he sleeps for one moment at a time torngarsuk is not the maker of all things but still is so much of a deity that many when they hear of god and his omnipotence are readily led to the supposition that probably we mean their torngarsuk  all spirits are called torngak and soak  great hence the good spirit of the eskimos in his limited power is the great spirit in addition to a host of other spirits some of whom reveal themselves affably to all while others are only accessible to angakut or medicinemen the eskimos have a pluto or hades or charos of their own he is meagre dark sullen and devours the bowels of the ghosts there are spirits of fire water mountains winds there are dogfaced demons and the souls of abortions become hideous spectres while the common ghost of civilised life is familiar the spirit of a boys dead mother appeared to him in open day and addressed him in touching language be not afraid i am thy mother and love thee for here too in this frozen and haunted world love is more strong than death  eskimo myth is practical and where speculative is concerned with the fortunes of men alive or dead as far as these depend on propitiating the gods or extranatural beings the eskimo myth of the

far as it has been investigated rather resembles that of the zulus märchen or romantic stories are very common tales about the making of things and the actions of the prehuman beings are singularly scarce except for some moon and star myths and the tale of the origin of death hardly any myths properly so called are reported only very scanty traces says rink have been found of any kind of ideas having been formed as to the origin and early history of the world and the ruling powers or deities        he adds that this seems sufficiently to show that such      mythological speculations have been in respect to other      nations also the product of a later stage of culture that      this position is erroneous is plain from the many myths here      collected from peoples lower in culture

say creator of all things though some special things are excepted quawteaht in the legend of the loon who was once an injured indian and still wails his wrongs is represented as conscious of the conduct of men and as prone to avenge misdeeds in person quawteaht was of short stature with very strong hairy arms and legs there is a touch of unconscious darwinism in this description of the first

fire it was stolen by the cuttlefish and in some legends quawteaht was the original proprietor like most gods he could assume the form of the beasts and it was in the shape of a great whale that he

miraculous birth his mother was a thlinkeet woman whose boys had all been slain as she wandered disconsolate by the seashore a dolphin or whale taking pity upon her bade her drink a little salt water and swallow a pebble she did so and in due time bore a child yehl the hero of the thlinkeets once in his youth yehl shot a supernatural crane skinned it and whenever he wished to fly clothed himself in the birds skin yet he is always known as a raven hence there is much the same confusion between yehl and the bird as between amun in egypt and the ram in whose skin he was once pleased to reveal himself to a mortal in yehls youth occurred the deluge produced by the curse of an unfriendly uncle of his own but the deluge was nothing to yehl who flew up to heaven and anchored himself to a cloud by his beak till the waters abated like most heroes of his kind yehl brought light to men the heavenly bodies in his time were kept in boxes by an old chief yehl by an ingenious stratagem got possession of the boxes to fly up to the firmament with the treasure to open the boxes and to stick stars sun and moon in their proper places in the sky was to the active yehl the work of a moment  fire he stole like prometheus carrying a brand in his beak till he reached the thlinkeet shore there the fire dropped on stones and sticks from which it is still obtained by striking the flints or rubbing together the bits of wood water like fire was a monopoly in those days and one khanukh kept all of it in his own well khanukh was the ancestor of the wolf family among the thlinkeets as yehl is the first father of the stock called ravens the wolf and raven thus answer to the mythic creative crow and cockatoo in australian mythology and take sides in the primitive dualism when yehl went to steal water from khanukh the pair had a discussion exactly like that between joukahainen and wainamoinen in the epic of the finns as to which of them had been longer in the world before the world stood in its place i was there says yehl and wainamoinen says when earth was made i was there when space was unrolled i launched the sun on his way similar boasts occur in the poems of empedocles and of taliesin khanukh however proved to be both older and more skilled in magic than yehl yet the accomplishment of flying once more stood yehl in good stead and he carried off the water as odin in the form of a bird stole suttungs mead by flying off with it in his beak yehl then went to his own place  in the myths of the other races on the northwest pacific coast nothing is more remarkable than the theriomorphic character of the heroes who are also to a certain extent gods and makers of things  the koniagas have their ancestral bird and dog demiurges makers of sea rivers hills yet subject to a

smallpox the indians story is of course coloured by what he knew of missionary teaching but the incident should be compared with the medicine dream of john tanner  the sky conceived as a person held a place rather in the religion than in the mythology of the indians he was approached with prayer and sacrifice and they implored the sky in all their necessities the sky hears us they would say in

messou who was probably in myth a hare sans phrase but who has been converted by philological processes into a personification of light or dawn it has already been seen that the wild north pacific peoples recognise in their hero and demiurge animals of various species dogs ravens muskrats and coyotes have been found in this lofty estimation and the utes believe in cinauav the ancient of wolves it would require some labour to derive all the ancient heroes and gods from misconceptions about the names of vast natural phenomena like light and dawn and it is probable that michabo or manibozho the great hare of the algonkins is only a successful apotheosised totem like the rest his legend and his dominion are very widely spread dr brinton himself p 153 allows that the great hare is a totem perhaps our earliest authority about the mythical great hare in america is william stracheys travaile into virginia        powell in bureau of ethnology 187980 p 43        circa 1612 reprinted by the

mighty great hare the other four have no visible shape but are indeed the four wynds an indian after hearing from the english the biblical account of the creation explained that our god who takes upon him the shape of a hare at length devised and made divers men and women he also drove away the cannibal manitous that godlike hare made the water and the fish and a great deare the other four gods in

feed on delicious fruits with that great hare who is clearly so far the virginian osiris dr brinton has written at some length on this chimerical beast whose myth prevails he says from the remotest wilds of the northwest to the coast of the atlantic from the southern boundary of carolina to the cheerless swamps of hudsons bay the totem totemkindred probably is meant clan which bore his name was

piece of clay brought him by an otter which succeeded after the failure of a raven sent out by messou he afterwards married a muskrat by whom he became the father of a flourishing family le brave reparateur de lunivers est le frere aisné de toutes les bestes says the mocking missionary messou has the usual powers of shapeshifting which are the common accomplishments of the medicineman or

these are examples of the legends of michabo or manibozho the great hare he appears in no way to differ from the other animals of magical renown who in so many scores of savage myths start the world on its way and instruct men in the arts his fame may be more widely spread but his deeds are those of eagle crow wolf coyote spider grasshopper and so forth in remote parts of the world his legend is the kind of legend whose origin we ascribe to the credulous fancy of early peoples taking no distinction between themselves and the beasts if the hare was indeed the totem of a successful and honoured kindred his elevation is perfectly natural and intelligible  dr brinton in his myths of the new world new york 1876 adopts a different line of explanation michabo he says was originally the highest divinity recognised by them powerful and beneficent beyond all others maker of the heavens and the world we gladly welcome him in that capacity in religion but it has already been shown that michabo is only in myth the reparateur de lunivers and that he has a sleeping partnera deity retired from business moreover dr brintons account of michabo powerful and beneficent beyond all others maker of the heavens and the world clashes with his own statement that of monotheism as displayed in the one personal definite god of the semitic races to whom dr brintons description of michabo applies there is not a single instance on the american continent the residences and birthplaces of michabo are as many as those of the gods of greece it is true that in some accounts as in stracheys his bright home is in the rising sun it does not follow that the hare had any original connection with the dawn but this connection dr brinton seeks to establish by philological arguments according to this writer the names manibozho nanibozhu missibizi michabo messou all seem compounded according to wellascertained laws of algonkin euphony from the words corresponding to great and hare or rabbit or the first two perhaps from spirit and hare but this seeming must not be trusted we must attentively examine the algonkin root wab when it will appear that in fact there are two roots having this sound one is the initial syllable of the word translated hare or rabbit but the other means white and from it is derived the words for the east the dawn the light the day and the morning beyond a doubt sic this is the compound in the names michabo and manibozho which therefore mean the great light the spirit of light of the dawn or the east        relations pp 63 176        op cit p 178  then the war of manibozho became the struggle of light and darkness finally michabo is recognised by dr brinton as the not unworthy personification of the purest conceptions they possessed concerning the father of all though according to dr brinton in an earlier passage they can hardly be said to have possessed such conceptions we are not responsible for these inconsistencies the degeneracy to the belief in a mighty great hare a chimerical beast was the result of a misunderstanding of the root wab in their own language by the algonkins a misunderstanding that not only affected the dialects in which the root wab occurred in the hares name but those in which it did not  on the whole the mythology of the great hunting and warrior tribes of north america is peopled by the figures of ideal cultureheroes partly

a tendency to become identified with the sun like osiris in egypt or with the moon they are adepts in all the arts of the medicineman and they are especially addicted to animal metamorphosis in the

pueblo indians of new mexico and arizona concerning the faith of the zunis we fortunately possess an elaborate account by mr frank cushing mr cushing was for long a dweller in the clay pueblos of the zuñis and is an initiated member of their sacred societies he found that they dealt at least as freely in metaphysics as the maoris and that like the australians they suppose sun moon and stars the sky earth and sea in all their phenomena and elements and all inanimate objects as well as plants animals and men to belong to one great system of all conscious and interrelated life in which the degrees of relationship seem to be determined largely if not wholly by the degrees of resemblance this of course is stated in terms of modern selfconscious speculation when much the same opinions are found among the kamilaroi and kurnai of australia they are stated thus some of the totems divide not mankind only but the whole universe into what may almost be called gentile divisions         report of bureau of ethnology washington 188081        kamilaroi and kurnai p 167p 170 mrs langloh      parker in a letter to me remarks that baiame alone is      outside of this conception and is common to all classes      and totems and class divisions  everything in nature is divided between the classes the wind belongs to one and the rain to another the sun is wutaroo and the moon is yungaroo the south australian savage looks upon the universe as the great tribe to one of whose divisions he himself belongs and all things animate or inanimate which belong to his class are parts of the body corporate whereof he himself is part they are almost parts of himself  manifestly this is the very condition of mind out of which mythology with all existing things acting as dramatis personæ must inevitably arise  the zuni philosophy then endows all the elements and phenomena of nature with personality and that personality is blended with the personality of the beast whose operations most resemble its manifestation thus lightning is figured as a serpent and the serpent holds a kind of mean position between lightning and man strangely enough flint arrowheads as in europe are regarded as the gift of thunder though the zunis have not yet lost the art of making nor entirely abandoned perhaps the habit of using them once more the supernatural beings of zuni religion are almost invariably in the shape of animals or in monstrous semitheriomorphic form there is no general name for the gods but the appropriate native terms mean creators and masters makers and finishers and immortals all the classes of these including the class that specially protects the animals necessary to men are believed to be related by blood  but among these essences the animals are nearest to man most accessible and therefore most worshipped sometimes as mediators but the zuni has mediators even between him and his animal mediators and these are fetishes usually of stone which accidentally resemble this or that beastgod in shape sometimes as in the egyptian sphinx the natural resemblance of a stone to a living form has been accentuated and increased by art the stones with a natural resemblance to animals are most valued when they are old and long in use and the orthodox or priestly theory is that they are petrifactions of this or that beast flint arrowheads and feathers are bound about them with string  all these beliefs and practices inspire the zuñi epic which is repeated at stated intervals by the initiated to the neophytes mr cushing heard a good deal of this archaic poem in his sacred capacity the epic contains a zuñi cosmogony men as in so many other myths originally lived in the dark places of earth in four caverns like the children of uranus and gæa they murmured at the darkness the holder of the paths of life the sun now made two beings out of his own substance they fell to the earth armed with rainbow and lightning a shield and a magical flint knife the newcomers cut the earth with a flintknife as qat cut the palpable dark with a blade of red obsidian in melanesia men were then lifted through the hole on the shield and began their existence in the sunlight passing gradually through the four caverns men emerged on a globe still very wet for as in the iroquois and other myths there had been a time when water was the world  the two benefactors dried the earth and changed the monstrous beasts into stones it is clear that this myth accounts at once for the fossil creatures found in the rocks and for the merely accidental resemblance to animals of stones now employed as fetishes in the stones is believed to survive the medicine or magic the spiritual force of the animals of old        report etc p 15  the zuñis have a culturehero as usual poshaiankia who founded the mysteries as demeter did in greece and established the sacred orders he appeared in human form taught men agriculture ritual and then departed he is still attentive to prayer he divided the world into regions and gave the animals their homes and functions much as heitsi eibib did in namaqualand these animals carry out the designs of the culturehero and punish initiated zuñis who are careless of their religious duties and ritual the myths of the sacred beasts are long and dismal chiefly aetiological or attempts to account by a fictitious narrative for the distribution and habits of the various creatures zuñi prayers are mainly for success in the chase they are directed to the divine beasts and are reinforced by magical ceremonies yet a prayer for sport may end with such a truly religious petition as this grant me thy light give me and my children a good trail across life  again we read this day my fathers ye animal gods although this country be filled with enemies render me precious oh give ye shelter of my heart from them yet in religious hymns the zuñis celebrate ahonawilona the maker and container of all the all father the uncreated the

zuñi practice combined with the atrocious cruelty of the warrior tribes of the north perhaps in no race is the extreme contrast between low myth and the highest speculation that of the eternal

into the cannibal sacrifices and orgies of bloodshed with which the aztec temples reeked the milder elements again the sense of sin which found relief in confession and prayer are assigned to the influence of mayas and especially of toltecs a shadowy and perhaps an imaginary people our ignorance of mexican history before the spanish conquest is too deep to make any such theory of the influence of race on religion in mexico more than merely plausible the facts of ritual and of myth are better known thanks to the observations of such an honest soldier as bernal diaz and such a learned missionary as sahagun the author of the historia general de las cosas de nueva españa was a spanish franciscan and one of the earliest missionaries 1529 in mexico he himself describes the method by which he collected his information about the native religion he summoned together the chief men of one of the provinces who in turn chose twelve old men well seen in knowledge of the mexican practices and antiquities several of them were also scholars in the european sense and had been taught latin the majority of the commission collected and presented pictures which were the writings formerly in use among them and the grammarians or latinlearned aztecs wrote in european characters and in aztec the explanations of these designs when sahagun changed his place of residence these documents were again compared reedited and enlarged by the assistance of the native gentlemen in his new district and finally the whole was passed through yet a third sieve as sahagun says in the city of mexico the completed manuscript had many ups and downs of fortune but sahaguns book remains a source of almost undisputed authenticity  probably no dead religion whose life was among a people ignorant of syllabaries or of the alphabet is presented to us in a more trustworthy form than the religion of mexico it is necessary however to discount the theories of sahagun and his converts who though they never heard of euhemerus habitually applied the euhemeristic doctrine to their facts they decided that the gods of the aztecs had once been living men and conjurors worshipped after their decease it is possible too that a strain of catholic piety has found its way into the long prayers of the heathen penitents as reported by sahagun sahagun gives us a full account of the mexican mythology what the gods as represented by idols and adored in ritual were like we learn from a gallant catholic soldier bernal diaz above the altars he writes were two shapes like giants wondrous for height and hugeness the first on the right was huichilobos huitzilopochtli their god of war he had a big head and trunk his eyes great and terrible and so inlaid with precious stones that all his head and body shone with stars thereof great snakes of gold and fine stones were girdled about his flanks in one hand he held a bow and arrows in the other and a little idol called his page stood by his side thereby also were braziers wherein burned the hearts of three indians torn from their bodies that very day and the smoke of them and the savour of incense were the sacrifice the walls of this oratory

aztec olympians in general sahagun observes that they were friends of disguise and changed themselves often into birds or savage beasts hence he or his informants infer that the gods have originally been necromancers or medicinemen now worshipped after death a natural inference as magical feats of shapeshifting are commonly ascribed everywhere to witches and warlocks as a matter of fact the aztec gods though bedizened with the attributes of mortal conjurors and with the fur and feathers of totems are for the most part the departmental deities of polytheism each ruling over some province of nature or of human activity combined with these are deities who in their origin were probably ideal cultureheroes like yehl or qat or prometheus the long and tedious myths of quetzalcoatl and tezcatlipoca appear to contain memories of a struggle between the gods or cultureheroes of rival races such struggles were natural and necessary perhaps before a kind of syncretism and a general tolerance could unite in peace the deities of a realm composed of many tribes originally hostile in a cultivated people made up out of various conquered and amalgamated tribes we must expect polytheism because their olympus is a kind of divine representative assembly anything like monotheism in such a state must be the result of philosophic reflection a laughable matter it is says bernal diaz that in each province the indians have their gods and the gods of one province or town are of no profit to the people of another thus have they an infinite number of idols to each of which they sacrifice        bernal diaz chap xcii  he might have described in the same words the local gods of the egyptian nomes for a similar state of things preceded and to some extent survived the syncretic

difficult to arrange the deities on any principle of order beginning with huitzilopochtli as perhaps the most famous it is to be observed that he indubitably became and was recognised as a god of battles and that he was also the guide and protector who according to the aztec painted scriptures led the wandering fathers through war and wilderness to the promised land of mexico his birth was one of those miraculous conceptions which we have seen so frequently in the myths and märchen of the lower and the higher races it was not by swallowing a berry as in finland but by cherishing in her bosom a flying ball of feathers that the devout woman coatlicue became the mother of huitzilopochtli all armed he sprang to the light like athene from the head of zeus and slew his brothers that had been born by natural generation from that day he received names of dread answering to deimos and phobos        clavigero staria ant del mexico ii 17 19 bancroft      iii 290  by another myth euhemeristic in character huitziton the name is connected with huitzilin the hummingbird was the leader of the aztecs in their wanderings on his death or translation his skull gave oracles like the head of bran in the welsh legend sahagun in the first page of his work also euhemerises huitzilopochtli and makes him out to have been a kind of hercules doublé with a medicineman but all this is mere conjecture the position of huitzilopochtli as a wargod guardian and guide through the wilderness is perfectly established and it is nearly as universally agreed that his name connects him with the hummingbird which his statue wore on its left foot he also carried a green bunch of plumage upon his head shaped like the bill of a small bird now as j g müller has pointed out the legend and characteristics of huitzilopochtli are reproduced by a coincidence startling even in mythology in the legend and characteristics of picus in latium just as huitzilopochtli wore the hummingbird indicated by his name on his foot so picus was represented with the woodpecker of his name on his head        j g muller uramerik rel p 595  on the subject of picus one may consult ovid metamorph xiv 314 here the story runs that circe loved picus whom she met in the woods he disdained her caresses and she turned him into the woodpecker with his garnet head et fulvo cervix pnecingitur auro  according to virgil j sn vii 187 the statue of this picus was settled in an old laurentian temple or palace of unusual sanctity surrounded by images of the earlier gods the woodpeckers pici are known martio cognomine says pliny 10 18 20 § 40 and so connected with the roman wargod picas martius  in his romische mythologie i 336 337 preller makes no use of these materials for comparison though the conduct and character of the other beast of war the wolf as guide and protector of the hirpi wolves and worshipped by them with wolfdances is an obvious survival of totemism the picini have their animal leader picus the woodpecker the hirpi have their animal leader the wolf just as the hummingbird was the leader of the aztecs  in these latin legends as in the legends of huitzilopochtli the basis as j g müller sees is the birdthe hummingbird in one case the woodpecker in the other the bird is then euhemerised or brought into anthropomorphic form it is fabled that he was originally a man like picus before circe enchanted him to a birds shape or in mexico a man named huitziton who during the aztec migrations heard and pursued a little bird that cried tinni that is follow follow now we are all familiar with classical legends of races that were guided by a bird or beast to their ultimate seats müller mentions battus and the raven the chalcidians and the dove the cretans and the dolphin which was apollo cadmus and the cow the hirpi or wolves who followed the wolf in the same way the picini followed the woodpecker picus from whom they derived their name and carried a woodpecker on their banners thus we may connect both the sabine wargods and the bird of the mexican wargods with the many guiding and protecting animals which occur in fable now a guiding and protecting animal is almost a synonym for a totem that the sabine woodpecker had been a totem may be pretty certainly established on the evidence of plutarch the people called by his name picini declined like totemists everywhere to eat their holy bird in this case the woodpecker        bancroft iii 69 note quoting torquemada        quoest rom xxi  the inference is that the hummingbird whose name enters into that of huitzilopochtli and whose feathers were worn on his heel had been the totem of an aztec kindred before huitzilopochtli like picus was anthropomorphised on the other hand if huitzilopochtli was once the baiame of the aztecs their guide in their wanderings he might in myth be mixed up with a totem or other worshipful animal before this god was represented in human form he was merely a little hummingbird huitziton but as the anthropomorphic processes advanced the bird became an attribute emblem or symbol of the deity if huitzilopochtli is said to have given the aztecs fire that boon is usually regarded by many races from normandy to australia as the present given to men by a bird for example the firecrested wren thus understood the ornithological element in huitzilopochtli is purely totemic while accepting the reduction of him to a hummingbird m reville ingeniously concludes that he was a derivative form of the sun and especially of the sun of the fair season if the bird was worshipped it was not as a totem but as the divine messenger of the spring like the plover among the latins attempts have been made with no great success to discover the

better latin example than the plover  the mexican calendar the aztec year as described at considerable length by sahagun was a succession of feasts marked by minute and elaborate rites of a magical character the gods of rain were frequently propitiated so was the goddess of maize the mountain god the mother of the gods and many other divinities the general theory of worship was the adoration of a deity first by innumerable human sacrifices next by the special sacrifice of a man for male gods of a woman for each goddess the latter victims were regarded as the living images or incarnations of the divinities in each case for no system of worship carried farther the identification of the god with the sacrifice and of both with the officiating priest the connection was emphasised by the priests wearing the newlyflayed skins of the victims just as in greece egypt and assyria the fawnskin or bullhide or goatskin or fishskin of the victims is worn by the celebrants finally an image of the god was made out of paste and this was divided into morsels and eaten in a hideous sacrament by those who communicated        copious details as to the sacraments human sacrifices      paste figures of gods and identity of god and victim will      be found in sahaguns second and third books the magical      character of the ritual deserves particular attention see      many examples of gods made of flour and eaten in liebrechts      zur volkskunde der aufgegessene gott p 436 it will      be noted that the feasts of the corn goddess like the rites      of demeter were celebrated with

god may have been originally a nature deity whose life and death were connected with the year this theory is based on the practice at the feast called panquetzaliztli his paste idol was shot through with an arrow says mr tylor and being thus killed was divided into morsels and eaten wherefore the ceremony was called teoqualo or godeating and this was associated with the winter solstice m reville says that this feast coincided with our month of december the beginning of the cold and dry season huitzilopochtli would die with the verdure the flowers and all the beauteous adornments of spring and summer but like adonis like osiris and so many other solar deities he only died to live and to return again before identifying him with the sun it may be remarked that the aztec feast of the return of the gods was celebrated in the twelfth month and the paste sacrifice of huitzilopochtli was in the fifteenth  there were eighteen months in the aztec year and the year began on the 2nd of february the return of the gods was therefore in september and the paste sacrifice of huitzilopochtli in december clearly the god who dies in the winter solstice cannot be thought to return late in september huitzilopochtli had another feast on the first day of the ninth month that is between june and july when much use was made of floral decorations and they offered him the first flowers of the year

with a legend which made huitzilopochtli to be the son of the goddess of vegetation j g müllers whole argument is learned and acute but errs probably in attempting to extract a consecutive symbolical sense out of the chaos of myth thus he writes when the myth makes the god the son of the mother of plants it divides his essence from that of his mother and thus huitzilopochtli however closely akin to the plant world is not the plant world itself  this is to consider more curiously than the mythmakers the name of the patron goddess of the flowerwearers in feasts was coatlicue or coatlan which is also the name of the mother of huitzilopochtli its meaning is serpent petticoated        uramerik rel v p 602        sahagun ii 8  when müller goes on to identify huitzilopochtli with the bunch of feathers that fell into his mothers breast before his birth and that again with the hummingbird and that again with the honeysucking bird as the means of fructifying the plants and finally with the männliche befrwchtende naturkraft we have left myth far behind and are in a region of symbolism and abstract thought where one conjecture is as good as another the hypothesis is that men feeling a sense of religious reverence for the germinal force in nature took the hummingbird for its emblem and so evolved the myth of the birth of huitzilopochtli who at once fructifies and is born from the bosom of vernal nature it would be rash and wrong to deny that such ideas are mixed in the medley of myth but as a rule the sacred animal as the hummingbird is sacred first in itself probably as a totem or as a guide and protector and the symbolical sense is a forced interpretation put later on the facts we can hardly go farther with safety than the recognition of mingled aspects and elements in huitzilopochtli as the totem the tribal god the departmental wargod and possibly he is the god of the years progress and renewal his legend and ritual are a conglomerate of all these things a mass

ritual it will become manifest that the worship was a worship on the whole of departmental gods of the elements of harvest of various human activities such as love and commerce and war and agriculture the nature of the worship again was highly practical the ceremonies when not mere offerings of human flesh were commonly representations on earth of desirable things which the gods were expected to produce in the heavenly sphere the common type of all such magical ceremonies whereby like is expected to produce like has been discussed in the remarks on magic chapter iv the black smoke of

represented the son of the goddess wore a mask of the skin from the thigh of the female victim who had personated the goddess herself the wearing of the skin established a kinship between the man and

assertion that tlaloc the raingod had but one eye which shows that he must be ultimately identified as an ancient personification of the rainy sky whose one eye is the sun a rainy sky has usually no eye at all and when it has in this respect it does not differ from a cloudless sky  a less lovely set of olympians than the aztec gods it is difficult to conceive yet making every allowance for catholic afterthoughts there can be no doubt that the prayers penances and confessions described at length by sahagun indicate a firm mexican belief that even these strange deities made for righteousness loved good and in this world and the next punished evil however it happened whatever accidents of history or of mixture of the races in the dim past caused it the aztecs carried to extremes the religious and the mythical ideas they were exceedingly pious in their attitude of penitence and prayer they were more fierce and cruel in ritual more fantastic in myth than the wildest of

guessed at in the conjectures of fable egypt presented to them as to us the spectacle of antique civilisation without a known beginning the spade of today reveals no more than the traditions of two

questions which we have to ask in dealing with the mythology of egypt come under two heads first what was the nature of egyptian religion and myth secondly how did that complex mass of beliefs and practices come into existence  the question what was the religion of egypt is far from simple in a complete treatise on the topic it would be necessary to ask in reply at what period in what place and among what classes of society did the religion exist which you wish to investigate the ancient egyptian religion had a lifetime so long that it almost requires to be meted by the vague measures of geological time it is historically known to us by the earliest monuments about the date at which archbishop usher fixed the creation even then be it noticed the religion of egypt was old and fullgrown there are no historical traces of its beginnings like the material civilisation it had been fashioned by the unrecorded sheshoa hor the servants of horus patriarchs dwelling with the blessed in the four or five thousand years of its later existence egyptian religion endured various modifications it was a conservative people and schooled by the wisdom of the sepulchre but invaders semitic ethiopian and greek brought in some of their own ideas priestly colleges developed novel dogmas and insensibly altered ritual the thought of hundreds of generations of men brooded not fruitlessly over the problems of the divine nature finally it is likely that in egypt as elsewhere the superstitions of the least educated and most backward classes and of subject peoples on a lower level of civilisation would again and again break up and win their way to the surface of religion thus a complete study of egyptian faiths would be chronologicalwould note the setting and rising of the stars of elder and later deities        professor lieblein maintaining this view opposes the      statement of mr le page renouf who writes the earliest      monuments which have been discovered present to us the very      same fully developed civilisation and the same religion as      the later monuments hib lectures 1880 p 81 but it      is superfluous to attack a position which mr le page renouf      does not appear really to hold he admits the existence of      development and evolution in egyptian religious thought i      believe therefore that after closely approaching the      point at which polytheism might have turned into monotheism      the religious thought of egypt turned aside into a wrong      track op cit p 236  the method of a systematic history of egyptian religion would not be regulated by chronology alone topographical and social conditions would also claim attention the favoured god or gods of one nome administrative district or of one town or of one sacred metropolis were not the gods of another metropolis or town or nome though some deities were common to the whole country the fundamental character might be much the same in each case but the titles and aspects and ritual and accounts of the divine genealogy varied in each locality once more the syncretic tendency kept fusing into one divine name and form or into a family triad of gods mother father and son the deities of different districts which beneath their local peculiarities theologians could recognise as practically the same  while political events and local circumstances were thus modifying egyptian religion it must never be forgotten that the different classes of society were probably by no means at one in their opinions the monuments show us what the kings believed or at least what the kings practised record the prayers they uttered and the sacrifices they offered the tombs and the papyri which contain the book of the dead and other kindred works reveal the nature of belief in a future life with the changes which it underwent at different times but the people the vast majority unlettered and silent cannot tell us what they believed or what were their favourite forms of adoration we are left to the evidence of amulets of books of magic of popular tales surviving on a papyrus here and there and to the late testimony of greek writersherodotus diodorus the author of the treatise de osiride et hide and others while the clergy of the twentieth dynasty were hymning the perfections of ammon raso high that man may not attain unto him dweller in the hidden place him whose

speaks somewhat      sympathetically of the very many eminent scholars who      with full knowledge of all that can be said to the contrary      maintain that the egyptian religion is essentially      monotheistic he himself says that a power without a name      or any mythological characteristic is constantly referred to      in the singular number and can only be regarded as the      object of that sensus numinis or immediate perception of      the infinite which is the result of an intuition as      irresistible as the impressions of our senses if this be      not primitive instinctive monotheism what is it yet mr      le page renouf says that egyptian polytheism after closely      approaching the point where it might have become monotheism      went off on a wrong track so the

egyptian religion      english translation 1882  after this preamble let us endeavour to form a general working idea of what egyptian religion was as a whole what kind of religion did the israelites see during the sojourn in egypt or what presented itself to the eyes of herodotus unluckily we have no such eyewitnesses of the earlier egyptian as bernal diaz was of the aztec temples the bible says little that is definite about the theological wisdom of the egyptians when confronted with the sacred beasts herodotus might have used with double truth the greek saw a great ox has trod upon my tongue but what herodotus hinted at or left unsaid is gathered from the evidence of tombs and temple walls and illuminated papyri  one point is certain whatever else the religion of egypt may at any time have been it struck every foreign observer as polytheism moreover it was a polytheism like another the greeks had no difficulty for example in recognising amongst these beastheaded monsters gods analogous to their own this is demonstrated by the fact that to almost every deity of egypt they readily and unanimously assigned a greek divine name seizing on a certain aspect of osiris and of his mysteryplay they made him dionysus hor became apollo ptah hephaestus ammon ra zeus thoth hermes and so on with the rest the egyptian deities were recognised as divine beings with certain generally illdefined departments of nature and of human activity under their care some of them like seb earth and nut heaven were esteemed elemental forces or phenomena and were identified with the same personal phenomena or forces uranus and gæa in the greek system where heaven and earth were also parents of many of the gods        Æschylus agamemnon 37          maspero musée de boulaq p 150 le page renouf hib      led pp 8586  thus it is indisputably clear that egyptian religion had a polytheistic aspect or rather as maspero says was a wellmarked polytheism that in this regard it coincided with other polytheisms and that this element must be explained in the egyptian as it is explained in the greek or the aztec or the peruvian or the maori religion now an explanation has already been offered in the mythologies previously examined some gods have been recognised like rangi and papa the maori heaven and earth nut and seb as representatives of the old personal earth and heaven which commend themselves to the barbaric fancy other gods are the informing and indwelling spirits of other phenomena of winds or sea or woods others again whatever their origin preside over death over the dead over the vital functions such as love or over the arts of life such as agriculture and these last gods of departments of human activity were probably in the beginning cultureheroes real or more likely ideal the first teachers of men        it is certainly erroneous to consider egyptian religion      as a polytheistic corruption of a prehistoric monotheism it      is more correct to say that while polytheistic in      principle the religion developed in two absolutely opposite      directions on one side the constant introduction of new      gods local or foreign on the other a groping after a      monotheism never absolutely reached the learned explained      the crowd of gods as so many incarnations of the one hidden      uncreated deitytiele manuel de lhistoire des      religions p 46  in polytheisms of long standing all these attributes and functions have been combined and reallotted and the result we see in that confusion which is of the very essence of myth each god has many birthplaces one has many sepulchres all have conflicting genealogies if these ideas about other polytheisms be correct then it is probable that they explain to a great extent the first principles of the polytheism of egypt they explain at least the factors in egyptian religion which the greeks recognised as analogous with their own and which are found among polytheists of every degree of culture from new zealand to hellas if ever ptah or any other name represented our father as he is known to the most backward races he was buried into the background by gods evolved from ghosts by departmental gods and by the gods of races amalgamated in the course of conquest and settlement  leaving on one side then for the moment the vast system of ancestorworship and of rites undertaken for the benefit of the dead and leaving aside the divinity of the king polytheism was the most remarkable feature of egyptian religion the foreign traveller in the time of the pyramidbuilders as in the time of ramses ii or of the ptolemies or of the roman domination would have found a crowd of gods in receipt of honour and of sacrifice he would have learned that one god was most adored in one locality another in another that ammon ra was predominant in thebes ra the sungod in heliopolis osiris in abydos and so forth he would also have observed that certain animals were sacred to certain gods and that in places where each beast was revered his species was not eaten though it might blamelessly be cooked and devoured in the neighbouring nome or district where another animal was dominant everywhere in all nomes and towns the adoration of osiris chiefly as the god and redeemer of the dead was practised        on the different religions of different nomes and      especially the animal worship see pietschmann der      Ægyptische fetischdienst und götterglaube zeitschrtft für      ethnologie 1878 p 168  while these are the general characteristics of egyptian religion there were inevitably many modifications in the course of five thousand years if one might imagine a traveller endowed like the wandering jew with endless life and visiting egypt every thousand or every five hundred years we can fancy some of the changes in religion which he would observe on the whole from the first dynasty and the earliest monuments to the time when hor came to wear a dress like that of a roman centurion the traveller would find the chief figures of the pantheon recognisably the same but there would be novelties in the manner of worshipping and of naming or representing them in the oldest tombs where the oldest writings are found there are not many gods mentionedthere are osiris horus thot seb nut hathor anubis apheru and a couple more here was a stock of gods who remained in credit till the dog anubis fled from the star of bethlehem most of these deities bore birthmarks of the sky and of the tomb if osiris was the sungod of abydos he was also the murdered and mutilated culturehero if hor or horus was the sun at his height he too had suffered despiteful usage from his enemies seb and nut named on the coffin of mycerinus of the fourth dynasty in the british museum were our old friends the personal heaven and earth anubis the jackal was the lord of the grave and dead kings are worshipped no less than gods who were thought to have been dead kings while certain gods who retained permanent power appear in the oldest monuments sacred animals are also present from the first        lieblein egyptian religion p 7  the gods in fact of the earliest monuments were beasts here is one of the points in which a great alteration developed itself in the midst of egyptian religion till the twelfth dynasty when a god is mentioned and in those very ancient remains gods are not mentioned often he is represented by his animal or with the name spelled out in hieroglyphs often beside the bird or beast the jackal stands for anup anubis the frog for hekt the baboon for tahuti thoth it is not till after semitic influence had begun to work in the country that any figures of gods are found by figures of gods are meant the later manshaped or semimanshaped images the hawkheaded jackalheaded and similar representations with which we are familiar in the museums the change begins with the twelfth dynasty but becomes most marked under the eighteenth during the ancient empire says m maspero i only find monuments at four pointsat memphis at abydos in some parts of middle egypt at sinai and in the valley of hammamat the divine names appear but occasionally in certain unvaried formulæ under the eleventh and twelfth dynasties lower egypt comes on the scene the formulæ are more explicit but the religious monuments rare from the eighteenth dynasty onwards we have representations of all the deities accompanied by legends more or less developed and we begin to discover books of ritual hymns amulets and other objects there are also sacred texts in the pyramids        flinders petrie arts of ancient egypt p 8        revue de lhistoire des religions i 124  other changes less important than that which turned the beastgod into a divine man or woman often beastheaded are traced in the very earliest ages the ritual of the holy bulls hapi apis makes its official appearance under the fourth king of the first and the first king of the second dynasties mr le page renouf admitting this thinks the great development of bullworship later in the third dynasty the name of ra sun comes to be added to the royal names of kings as nebkara noferkara and so forth osiris becomes more important than the jackalgod as the guardian of the dead sokar another god of death shows a tendency to merge himself in osiris with the successes of the eighteenth dynasty in thebes the process of syncretism by which various godnames and godnatures are mingled so as to unite the creeds of different nomes and provinces and blend all in the worship of the theban ammon ra is most notable now arise schools of theology pantheism and an approach to monotheism in the theban god become probable results of religious speculations and imperial success these tendencies are baffled by the breakup of the theban supremacy but the monotheistic idea remains in the esoteric dogmas of priesthoods and survives into neoplatonism special changes are introducednow as in the case of worship of the solar disk by a heretic king earlier as in the prevalence of setworship perhaps by semitic invaders        brugsch history of egypt english transl i 59 60        hib lect pp 237 238        op cit i p 56        for

osirian circle and      is thus a genuine egyptian deity  it is impossible here to do more than indicate the kind of modification which egyptian religion underwent throughout it remained constant in certain features namely the local character of its gods their usefulness to the dead their chthonian aspect their tendency to be merged into the sun ra the great type and symbol and source of life and finally their inability to shake off the fur and feathers of the beasts the earliest form of their own development thus life death sky sun bird beast and man are all blended in the religious conceptions of egypt here follow two hymns to osiris hymns of the nineteenth and twentieth dynasties which illustrate the confusion of lofty and almost savage ideas the coexistence of notions from every stage of thought that make the puzzle of egyptian mythology  hail to thee osiris eldest son of seb greatest of the six deities born of nut chief favourite of thy father ra the father of fathers

what he calls monotheism is chiefly      presented to us in a large number of hymns beginning with      the earliest days of the eighteenth dynasty it is certainly      much more ancient but none of the hymns of that time      have come down to us see a very remarkable pantheistic      hymn to osiris lord of holy transformations in a passage      cited hib lect p 218 and the hymns to amnion ra      closely approaching the language of monotheism pp 225      226 excellent examples of pantheistic litanies of ra are      translated from originals of the nineteenth dynasty in      records of the past viii 105128 the royal osiris is      identified with ra here too it is told how ra smote apap      the serpent of evil the egyptian ahi  here the noblest moral sentiments are blended with oriental salutations in the worship of a god who for the moment is recognised as lord of lords but who is also a ram at mendes this apparent confusion of ideas and this assertion of supremacy for a god who in the next hymn is subjected to another god mark civilised polytheism but the confusion was increased by the extreme age of the egyptian faith and by the doubt that prevailed as to the meaning of tradition the seventeenth chapter of the book of the dead which seems to contain a statement of the system of the universe as understood at heliopolis under the first dynasties is known to us by several examples of the eleventh and twelfth dynasties each of the verses had already been interpreted in three or four different ways so different that according to one school the creator râshow was the solar fire according to another school not the fire but the waters the book of the dead in fact is no book but collections of pamphlets so to speak of very different dates plan or unity cannot be expected and glosses only some four thousand years old have become imbedded in really ancient texts fifteen centuries later the number of interpretations had considerably increased  where the egyptians themselves were in helpless doubt it would be vain to offer complete explanations of their opinions and practices in detail but it is possible perhaps to account for certain large elements of their beliefs and even to untie some of the knots of the osirian myth  the strangest feature in the rites of egypt was animalworship which appeared in various phases there was the local adoration of a beast a bird or fish to which the neighbours of other districts were indifferent or hostile there was the presence of the animal in the most sacred penetralia of the temple and there was the god conceived of on the whole as anthropomorphic but often represented in art after the twelfth dynasty as a man or woman with the head of a bird or beast        cf tiele hist egypt rel pp 2629 and notes         maspero musee de boulaq p 149        as to the animals which were sacred and might not be      eaten in various nomes an account will be found in      wilkinsons ancient egyptians ii 467 the english reader      will find many beastheaded gods in the illustrations to      vol iii the edition referred to is birchs london 1878      a more scientific authority is lanzoni dizion mit  these points in egyptian religion have been the great puzzle both of antiquity and of modern mythology the common priestly explanations varied sometimes it was said that the gods had concealed themselves in the guise of beasts during the revolutionary wars of set against horus often again animalworship was interpreted as symbolical it was not the beast but the qualities which he personified that were adored thus anubis really a jackal is a dog in the explanations of plutarch and is said to be worshipped for his fidelity or because he can see in the night or because he is the image of time as he brought forth all things out of himself and contains all things within himself he gets the title of dog once more and by a nearer approach to what is probably the truth the beastgods were said to be survivals of the badges representing animals of various tribal companies in the forces of osiris such were the ideas current in graecoroman speculation nor perhaps is there any earlier evidence as to the character of native interpretation of animalworship the opinion has also been broached that beastworship in egypt is a refraction from the use of hieroglyphs if the picture of a beast was one of the signs in the writing of a gods name adoration might be transferred to the beast from the god it is by no means improbable that this process had its share in producing the results some of the explanations of animalworship which were popular of old are still in some favour        de is et os lxxii        op cit xi        ibid xliv        pietschmann op cit p 163 contends that the      animalworship is older than these egyptian modes of writing      the divine names say of amnion ra or hathor moreover the      signs were used in writing the names because the gods were      conceived of in these animal shapes  mr le page renouf appears to hold that there was something respectably mythical in the worship of the inhabitants of zoological and botanical gardens something holy apparent at least to the devout he quotes the opinion attributed to apollonius of tyana that the beasts were symbols of deity not deities and this was the view of a grave opponent mr le page renouf also mentions porphyrys theory that under the semblance of animals the egyptians worship the universal power which the gods have revealed in the various forms of living nature it is evident of course that all of these theories may have been held by the learned in egypt especially after the christian era in the times of apollonius and porphyry but that throws little light on the motives and beliefs of the pyramidbuilders many thousands of years before or of the contemporary peasants with their worship of cats and alligators in short the systems of symbolism were probably made after the facts to account for practices whose origin was obscure yet another hypothesis is offered by mr le page renouf and in the case of set and the hippopotamus is shared by m maspero tiele also remarks that some beasts were promoted to godhead comparatively late because their names resembled names of gods        hibbert lectures pp 6 7        de abst iv c 9        theolog tidjsch 12th year p 261  the gods in certain cases received their animal characteristics by virtue of certain unconscious puns or mistakes in the double senses of words seb is the earth seb is also the egyptian name for a certain species of goose and in accordance with the homonymous tendency of the mythological period of all nations the god and the bird were identified seb was called the great cackler again the god thoth was usually represented with the head of an ibis a mummied ibis in the human form is made to represent the god thoth this connection between thoth and the ibis mr le page renouf explains at some length as the result of an etymological confusion thus metaphorical language reacted upon thought and as in other religions obtained the mastery  while these are the views of a distinguished modern egyptologist another egyptologist not less distinguished is of an entirely opposite opinion as to the question on the whole it is possible nay certain writes m maspero that during the second theban empire the learned priests may have thought it well to attribute a symbolical sense to certain bestial deities but whatever they may have worshipped in thothibis it was a bird and not a hieroglyph that the first worshippers of the ibis adored m meyer is of the same opinion and so are professor tiele and m perrot        for a statement of the theory of homonymous tendency

and adopted it from an african population      professor tiele does not appear when he wrote this chapter      to have observed the worldwide diffusion of animalworship      in totem ism for he says nowhere else does the worship      of animals prevail so extensively as among african peoples   while the learned have advanced at various periods these conflicting theories of the origin of egyptian animalworship a novel view was introduced by mr mlennan in his essays on plant and animal worship he regarded egyptian animalworship as only a consecrated and elaborate survival of totemism mr le page renouf has ridiculed the schoolboy authorities on which mr mlennan relied nevertheless mr mlennans views are akin to those to which m maspero and mm perrot and chipiez are attached and they have also the support of professor sayce  these animal forms in which a later myth saw the shapes assumed by the affrighted gods during the great war between horus and typhon take us back to a remote prehistoric age when the religious creed of egypt was still totemism they are survivals from a longforgotten past and prove that egyptian civilisation was of slow and independent growth the latest stage only of which is revealed to us by the monuments apis of memphis mnevis of heliopolis and pachis of hermonthis are all links that bind together the egypt of the pharaohs and the egypt of the stone age these were the sacred animals of the clans which first settled in these localities and their identification with the deities of the official religion must have been a slow process never fully carried out in fact in the minds of the lower classes        hibbert lectures pp 6 30        herodotus p 344  thus it appears that after all even on philological showing the religions and myths of a civilised people may be illustrated by the religions and myths of savages it is in the study of savage totemism that we too seek a partial explanation of the singular egyptian practices that puzzled the greeks and romans and the egyptians themselves to some extent the egyptian religious facts were purely totemistic in the strict sense  some examples of the local practices and rites which justify this opinion may be offered it has been shown that the totem of each totemkindred among the lower races is sacred and that there is a strict rule against eating or even making other uses of the sacred animal or plant at the same time one totemkindred has no scruple about slaying or eating the totem of any other kindred now similar rules prevailed in egypt and it is not easy for the school which regards the holy beasts as emblems or as the results of misunderstood language to explain why an emblem was adored in one village and persecuted and eaten in the next but if these usages be survivals of totemism the practice at once ceases to be isolated and becomes part of a familiar if somewhat obscure body of customs found all over the world the same animal which was revered and forbidden to be slaughtered for the altar or the table in one part of the country was sacrificed and eaten in another        this must be taken generally   see spencer and gillen in      the natives of central australia where each kin helps the      others to kill its own totem        wilkinson ancient egyptians ii 467  herodotus bears testimony to this habit in an important passage he remarks that the people of the theban nome whose god ammon ra or khnum was ramheaded abstain from sheep and sacrifice goats but the people of mendes whose god was goatheaded abstain from goats sacrifice sheep and hold all goats in reverence  these local rites at least in roman times caused civil brawls for the customs of one town naturally seemed blasphemous to neighbours with a different sacred animal thus when the people of dogtown were feasting on the fish called oxyrrhyncus the citizens of the town which revered the oxyrrhyncus began to eat dogs to which there is no temptation hence arose a riot        herodotus ii 4246 the goatheaded mendesian god pan      as herodotus calls him is recognised by dr birch as the      goatheaded baentattu    wilkinson ii 512 note 2        de is et os 71 72  the most singular detail in juvenals famous account of the war between the towns of ombi and tentyra does not appear to be a mere invention they fought because each place loathes the gods of its neighbours the turmoil began at a sacred feast and the victors devoured one of the vanquished now if the religion were really totemistic the worshippers would be of the same blood as the animal they worshipped and in eating an adorer of the crocodile his enemies would be avenging the eating of their own sacred beast when that beast was a crocodile probably nothing but starvation or religious zeal could induce people to taste his unpalatable flesh yet in the city apollinopolis it is the custom that every one must by all means eat a bit of crocodile and on one day they catch and kill as many crocodiles as they can and lay them out in front of the temple  the mythic reason was that typhon in his flight from horus took the shape of a crocodile yet he was adored at various places where it was dangerous to bathe on account of the numbers and audacity of the creatures mummies of crocodiles are found in various towns where the animal was revered  it were tedious to draw up a list of the local sacred beasts of egypt but it seems manifest that the explanation of their worship as totems at once colligates it with a familiar set of phenomena the symbolic explanations on the other hand are clearly fanciful mere jeux desprit for example the sacred shrewmouse was locally adored was carried to butis on its death and its mummy buried with care but the explanation that it received divine honours because it is blind and darkness is more ancient than light by no means accounts for the mainly local respect paid to the little beast        wilkinson iii 329 compare aelian x 24 on the enmity      between worshippers of crocodiles and hawks and strabo      xvii 558 the hawkworshippers averred that the hawk was a      symbol of fire the crocodile people said that their beast      was an emblem of water but why one city should be so      attached to waterworship and its neighbour to tireworship      does not appear        a good deal of information will be found in wilkinsons      third volume but must be accepted with caution        wilkinson iii 33 plutarch sympos iv quaest 5      herodot ii 67  if this explanation of the local worship of sacred beasts be admitted as plausible the beastheaded gods or many of them may be accounted for in the same way it is always in a town where a certain animal is locally revered that the humanshaped god wearing the head of the same animal finds the centre and chief holy place of his worship the cat is great in bubastis and there is bast and also the catheaded sekhet of memphis the sheep was great in thebes and there was the sacred city of the ramheaded khnum or ammon ra if the crocodile was held in supreme regard at ombos there too was the sacred town of the crocodileheaded god sebak        wilkinson iii 286 but the cat though bubastis was her      centre and metropolis was sacred all over the land nor was      puss only in this proud position   some animals were      universally worshipped        the inconsistencies of statement about this ramheaded      deity in wilkinson are most confusing ammon is an adjective       hidden and is connected with the ramheaded khnum and      with the hawkheaded ra the sun  while greek writers like porphyry and plutarch and jamblichus repeat the various and inconsistent egyptian allegorical accounts of the origin of those beastheaded gods the facts of their worship and chosen residence show that the gods are only semianthropomorphic refinements or successors of the animals it has been said that these representations are later in time and it is probable that they are later in evolution than the representations of the deities as mere animals nor perhaps is it impossible to conjecture how the change in art was made it is a common ritual custom for the sacrificer to cover himself with the skin and head of the animal sacrificed in mexico we know that the aztec priests wore the flayed skins of their human victims herodotus mentions that on the one awful day when a sheep was yearly sacrificed in thebes the statue of zeus as he calls him was draped in the hide of the beast in the same way certain californian tribes which worship the buzzard sacrifice him himself to himself once a year and use his skin as a covering in the ritual lucian gives an instance in his treatise de deâ syriâ 55 when a man means to go on pilgrimage to hierapolis he sacrifices a sheep and eats of its flesh he then kneels down and draws the head over his own head praying at the same time to the god chaldean works of art often represent the priest in the skin of the god sometimes in that of a fish  it is a conjecture not unworthy of consideration that the human gods with bestial heads are derived from the aspect of the celebrant clad in the pelt of the beast whom he sacrifices in egyptian art the heads of the gods are usually like masks or flayed skins superimposed on the head of a man if it be asked why the celebrant thus disguises himself in the sacrifice it is only possible to reply by guesswork but the hypothesis may be hazarded that this rite was one of the many ways in which the sacred animal has been propitiated in his death by many peoples it is a kind of legal fiction to persuade him that like the bear in the finnish kalewala and in the red indian and australian legend he does not die his skin is still capering about on other shoulders        robinson life

gaidoz  while egyptian myth religion and ritual is thus connected with the beliefs of the lower races the animalworship presents yet another point of contact not only were beasts locally adored but gods were thought of and represented in the shape of various different beasts how did the evolution work its way what is the connection between a lofty spiritual conception as of ammon ra the lord of righteousness and osiris judge of the dead and bulls rams wolves cranes hawks and so forth osiris especially had quite a collection of bestial heads and appeared in divers bestial forms the bull hapi was a fair and beautiful image of the soul of osiris in late ritual we have read a hymn in which he is saluted as a ram he also taketh the character of the god bennu with the head of a crane and as sokar osiris has the head of a hawk these phenomena could not but occur in the long course of time when political expediency in egypt urged the recognition of the identity of various local deities in the same way ammon ra like most of the gods frequently took the character of other deities as khem ra and chnumis and even the attributes of osiris         cf wilkinson iii 86 87        de is et os 29       wilkinson iii 82       op cit iii 9  there was a constant come and go of attributes and gods adopted each others symbols as kings and emperors wear the uniform of regiments in each others service moreover it is probable that the process so amply illustrated in samoan religion had its course in egypt and that different holy animals might be recognised as aspects of the same deity finally the intricate connection of gods and beasts is no singular or isolated phenomenon from australia upwards a god perhaps originally conceived of as human and moral in character is also recognised in a totem as pundjel in the eaglehawk thus the confusion of egyptian religion is what was inevitable in a land where new and old did not succeed and supersede each other but coexisted on good terms had religion not been thus confused it would have been a solitary exception among the institutions of the country  the peculiarity of egypt in religion and myth as in every other institution is the retention of the very rudest and most barbarous things side by side with the last refinements of civilisation tiele manuel p 44 the existence of this conservatism by which we profess to explain the egyptian myths and worship is illustrated in another field by the arts of everyday life and by the testimony of the sepulchres of thebes m passalacqua in some excavations at

the world in places where the metals had never penetrated again a razorshaped knife of flint has been unearthed it is inscribed in hieroglyphics with the words the great sam son of ptah chief of artists  the sams were members of the priestly class who fulfilled certain mystic duties at funerals it is reported by herodotus that the embalmers opened the bodies of the dead with a knife of stone and the discovery of such a knife though it had not belonged to an embalmer proves that in egypt the stone age did not disappear but coexisted throughout with the arts of metalworking it is alleged that flint chisels and stone hammers were used by the workers of the mines in sinai even under dynasties xii xix the soil of egypt when excavated constantly shows that the egyptians who in the remote age of the pyramidbuilders were already acquainted with bronze and even with iron did not therefore relinquish the use of flint knives and arrowheads when such implements became cheaper than tools of metal or when they were associated with religion precisely in the same way did the egyptians who in the remotest known times had imposing religious ideas decline to relinquish the totems and beastgods and absurd or blasphemous myths which like flint axes and arrowheads are everywhere characteristic of savages the fact is that the egyptian mind when turned to divine matters was constantly working on and working over the primeval stuff of all mythologies and of all religions first there is the belief in a moral guardian and father of men this is expressed in the sacred hymns next there is the belief in a strange and powerful race supposed to have been busy on earth before the making or the evolution or the emergence of man this is expressed in the mythical legends the egyptians inherited a number of legends of extranatural heroes not unlike the savage qat cagn yehl pundjel ioskeha and quahteaht the maori tutenganahau and the south sea tangaroa some of these were elemental forces personified in human or bestial guise some were merely idealised medicinemen their wanderings rapes and manslaughters and mutilations as plutarch says remained permanently in legend when these beings in the advance of thought had obtained divine attributes and when the conception of abstract divinity returning perhaps to its first form had become pure and lofty the old legends became so many stumblingblocks to the faithful they were explained away as allegories every student having his own allegorical system or the extranatural beings were taken as by plutarch to be demons not gods   a brief and summary account of the chief figures in the egyptian pantheon will make it sufficiently plain that this is a plausible theory of the gods of egypt and a probable interpretation of their adventures  accepting the classification proposed by m maspero and remembering the limitations under which it holds good we find that  1 the gods of death and the dead were sokari isis and osiris the young horus and nephthys  2 the elemental gods were seb and nut of whom seb is the earth and nut the heavens these two like heaven and earth in almost all mythologies are represented as the parents of many of the gods the other elemental deities are but obscurely known  3 among solar deities are at once recognised ra and others but there was a strong tendency to identify each of the gods with the

different local gods in which case the names were often combined as in ammonra sabekra sokarosiris and so forth  athwart all these classes and compounds of gods and athwart the theological attempt at constructing a monotheism out of contradictory materials came that ancient idea of dualism which exists in the myths of the most backward peoples as pundjel in australia had his enemy the crow as in america yehl had his khanukh as ioskeha had his tawiscara so the gods of egypt and specially osiris have their set or typhon the spirit who constantly resists and destroys  with these premises we

given by the author of de iside et osiride and is confirmed both by the egyptian texts and by the mysterious hints of the pious herodotus here we follow the myth as reported in the greek tract and illustrated by the monuments  the reader must for the moment clear his mind of all the many theories of the meaning of the myth and must forget the lofty divine and mystical functions attributed by egyptian theologians and egyptian sacred usage to osiris he must read the story simply as a story and he will be struck with its amazing resemblances to the legends about their cultureheroes which are

describes the conduct of osiris as a culturehero he instituted laws taught agriculture instructed the egyptians in the ritual of worship and won them from their destitute and bestial mode of living after civilising egypt he travelled over the world like the greek dionysus whom he so closely resembles in some portions of his legend that herodotus supposed the dionysiac myth to have been imported from egypt in the absence of osiris his evil brother typhon kept quiet but on the heros return typhon laid an ambush against him like Ægisthus against agamemnon he had a decorated coffer mummycase made of the exact length of osiris and offered this as a present to any one whom it would fit at a banquet all the guests tried it but when osiris lay down in it the lid was closed and fastened with nails and melted lead the coffer osiris and all was then thrown into the nile isis arrayed in mourning robes like the wandering demeter sought osiris everywhere lamenting and found the chest at last in an erica tree that entirely covered it after an adventure like that of demeter with triptolemus isis obtained the chest during her absence typhon lighted on it as he was hunting by moonlight he tore the corpse of osiris into fourteen pieces and scattered them abroad isis sought for the mangled remnants and whenever she found one buried it each tomb being thenceforth recognised as a grave of

cairns of heitsi eibib are in namaqualand today the existence of many tombs of one being might be explained as tombs of his scattered members and the myth of the dismembering may have no other foundation on the other hand it must be noticed that a swine was sacrificed to osiris at the full moon and it was in the form of a black swine that typhon assailed horus the son of osiris whose myth is a doublure or replica in some respects of the osirian myth itself1 we may conjecture then that the fourteen portions into which the body of osiris was rent may stand for the fourteen days of the waning moon it is well known that the phases of the moon and lunar eclipses are almost invariably accounted for in savage science by the attacks of a beastdog pig dragon or what noton the heavenly body either of these hypothesis the egyptians adopted the latter is consistent with the character of early myth but both are merely tentative suggestions        in the edfou monuments set is slain and

triumphant but the bloodfeud was handed on to horus son of isis and osiris to spur horus on to battle osiris returned from the dead like hamlets father but as is usual with the ghosts of savage myth osiris returned not in human but in bestial form as a wolf horus was victorious in the war which followed and handed typhon over bound in chains to isis unluckily isis let him go free whereon horus pushed off her crown and placed a bulls skull on her head  there the greek narrator ends but he expressly declines to tell the more blasphemous parts of the story such as the dismemberment of horus and the beheading of isis why these myths should be considered more blasphemous than the rest does not appear  it will probably be admitted that nothing in this sacred story would seem out of place if we found it in the legends of pundjel or cagn or yehl among australians bushmen or utes whose own culturehero like the ghost of osiris was a wolf this dismembering of osiris in particular resembles the dismembering of many other heroes in american myth for example of chokanipok out of whom were made vines and flintstones objects in the mineral and vegetable world were explained in egypt as

transformed into stars and the priests could tell which star was osiris which was isis and which was typhon such are the wild inconsistencies which egyptian religion shares with the fables of the lowest races in view of these facts it is difficult to agree with brugsch that from the root and trunk of a pure conception of deity spring the boughs and twigs of a tree of myth whose leaves spread into a rank impenetrable luxuriance  stories like the osiris mythstories found all over the whole worldspring from no pure religious source but embody the delusions and fantastic dreams of the lowest and least developed human fancy and human speculation and these flourish like mistletoe on the oak over the sturdier growth of a religious conception of another root  the references to the myth in

dynasty osiris is addressed as the joy and glory of his parents seb and nut who overcomes his enemy his sister isis accords to him due funeral rites after his death and routs his foes without ceasing without resting she sought his dead body and wailing did she wander round the world nor stopped till she found him light flashed from her feathers horus her son is king of the world  such is a precis of the mythical part of the hymn the rest regards osiris in his religious capacity as a sovereign of nature and as the guide and protector of the dead the hymn corroborates as far as it goes the narrative of the greek two thousand years later similar confirmation is given by the lamentations of isis and nephthys a papyrus found within a statue of osiris in thebes the sisters wail for the dead hero and implore him to come to his own abode the theory of the birth of horus here is that he was formed out of the scattered members of osiris an hypothesis of course inconsistent with the other myths especially with the myth that he dived for the members of osiris in the shape of a crocodile and therefore all the more mythical        de is et os 211        rev archeol may 1857        the

pierces the red hippopotamus or pig in some designs who is set but exercising reprisals cuts him into pieces as set cut osiris isis instructs osiris as to the portion which properly falls to each of

brahmanas told them to account for peculiar parts of the ritual and to explain strange local names thus the names of many places are explained by myths setting forth that they commemorate some event in the campaign of horus against set in precisely the same way the local superstitions originally totemic about various animals were explained by myths attaching these animals to the legends of the gods  explanations of the osiris myth thus handed down to us were common among the ancient students of religion many of them are reported in the familiar tract de iside et osiride they are all the interpretations of civilised men whose method is to ask themselves now if i had told such a tale as this or invented such a mysteryplay of divine misadventures what meaning could i have intended to convey in what is apparently blasphemous nonsense there were moral solar lunar cosmical tellurian and other methods of accounting for a myth which in its origin appears to be one of the worldwide early legends of the strife between a fabulous good being and his brother a fabulous evil being most probably some incidents from a moonmyth have also crept into or from the first made part of the tale of osiris the enmity of typhon to the eyes of horus which he extinguishes and which are restored has much the air of an early mythical attempt to explain the phenomena of eclipses or even of sunset we can plainly see how local and tribal superstitions according to which this or that beast fish or tree was held sacred came to be tagged to the general body of the myth this or that fish was not eaten this or that tree was holy and men who had lost the true explanation of these superstitions explained them by saying that the fish had tasted or the tree had sheltered        livre des moris pp 112 118  this view of the myth while it does not pretend to account for every detail refers it to a large class of similar narratives to the barbarous dualistic legends about the original good and bad extranatural beings which are still found current among contemporary savages these tales are the natural expression of the savage fancy and we presume that the myth of the mutilated osiris survived in egypt just as the use of flintheaded arrows and flint knives survived during millenniums in which bronze and iron were perfectly familiar the cause assigned is adequate and the process of survival is verified   whether this be the correct theory of the fundamental facts of the myth or not it is certain that the myth received vast practical and religious developments orisis did not remain the mere culturehero of whom we have read the story wounded in the house of his friends dismembered restored and buried reappearing as a wolf or bull or translated to a star his worship

all forces all powers were finally recognised in him he was sun and moon and the maker of all things he was the truth and the life in him all men were justified  on the origin of the myth philology throws no light m lefebure recognises in the name osiris the meaning of the infernal abode or the nocturnal residence of the sacred eye for in the duel of set and horus he sees a mythical account of the daily setting of the sun osiris himself the sun at his setting became a centre round which the other incidents of the war of the gods gradually crystallised osiris is also the earth it would be difficult either to prove or disprove this contention and the usual divergency of opinion as to the meaning and etymology of the word osiris has always prevailed the greek identifies osiris with hades both says m lefebure originally meant the dwellingsand came to mean the godof the dead in the same spirit anubis the jackal a beast still dreaded as a ghost by the egyptians is explained as the circle of the horizon or the portals of the land of darkness the gate kept as homer would say by hades the mighty warden whether it is more natural that men should represent the circle of the horizon or the

vegetation myths held that osiris was the sun  the conclusions to be drawn from so slight a treatment of so vast a subject are that in egypt as elsewhere a mythical and a religious a rational and an irrational stream of thought flowed together and even to some extent mingled their waters the rational tendency declared in prayers and hymns amplifies the early human belief in a protecting and friendly personal power making for righteousness the irrational tendency declared in myth and ritual retains and elaborates the early human confusions of thought between man and beast and god things animate and inanimate on the one hand we have almost a recognition of supreme divinity on the other savage rites and beliefs shared by australians and bushmen it is not safe or scientific to call one of those tendencies earlier than the other perhaps we know no race so backward that it is not influenced by forms of both nor is it safe or scientific to look on ruder practices as corruptions of the purer beliefs perhaps it may never be possible to trace both streams to the same fountainhead probably they well up from separate springs in the nature of man we do but recognise and contrast them the sources of both are lost in the distance where history can find no record of actual experience egyptian religion and myth are thus no isolated things they are but the common stuff of human thought

can never have been clear savage legends philosophic conjectures individual predilections are all blended into the collection of hymns called the rig veda who can bring order into such a chaos  an attempt to unravel the tangled threads of indian faith must be made the gods of the vedas are on the whole of the usual polytheistic type though their forms mix into each other like shadows cast by a flickering fire the ideas which may be gathered about them from the ancient hymns have as usual no consistency and no strict orthodoxy as each bard of each bardic family celebrates a god he is apt to make him for the occasion the preeminent deity of all this way of conceiving of the gods leads naturally as thought advances in the direction of a pantheistic monotheism a hospitable theology which accepts each divine being as a form or manifestation of the supreme universal spirit it is easy however to detect certain attributes more or less peculiar to each god as among races far less forward in civilisation each of the greater powers has his own special department however much his worshippers may be inclined to regard him as really supreme sovereign thus indra is mainly concerned with thunder and other atmospheric phenomena these are his department but vayu is the wind or the god of the wind and agni as fire or the god of fire is necessarily not unconnected with the lightning the maruts again are the stormwinds or gods of the stormwinds mitra and varuna preside over day and night ushas is the dawn or the goddess of dawn and tvashtri is the mechanic among the deities

to be interested not only in the worldly but in the moral welfare of mankind and are imagined to make for righteousness  it is true that the myths by no means always agree in representing the gods as themselves moral incest and other hideous offences are imputed to them and it is common to explain these myths as the result of the forgotten meanings of sayings which originally were only intended to describe processes of nature especially of the atmosphere supposing for the sake of argument that this explanation is correct we can scarcely be expected to think highly of the national taste which preferred to describe pure phenomena like dawn and sunset in language which is appropriate to the worst crimes in the human calendar it is certain that the indians when they came to reflect and philosophise on their own religion and they had reached this point before the veda was compiled were themselves horrified by the immoralities of some of their gods yet in vedic times these gods were already acknowledged as beings endowed with strong moral attributes and interested in the conduct of men as an example of this high ethical view we may quote mr max mullers translation of part of a hymn addressed to varuna        rigveda ii 28 hibbert lectures p 284  take from me my sin like a fetter and we shall increase o varuna the spring of thy law let not the thread be cut while i weave my

    max müller hibbert lectures p 228  though the subject might be dwelt on at very great length it is perhaps already apparent that the gods of the vedic poetry are not only potent over regions of the natural world but are also conceived of at times as being powers with ethical tendencies and punishers of mortal guilt it would be difficult to overstate the ethical nobility of certain vedic hymns which even now affect us with a sense of the hunger and thirst after righteousness so passionately felt by the hebrew psalmists how this emotion which seems naturally directed to a single god came to be distributed among a score it is hard to conjecture but all this aspect of the vedic deities is essentially the province of the science of religion rather than of mythology mans consciousness of sin his sense of being imperfect in the sight of larger other eyes than ours is a topic of the deepest interest but it comes but by accident into the realm of mythological science that science asks not with what feelings of awe and gratitude the worshipper approaches his gods but what myths what stories are told to or told by the worshipper concerning the origin personal characteristics and personal adventures of his deities as a rule these stories are a mere chronique scandaleuse full of the most absurd and offensive anecdotes and of the crudest fictions the deities of the vedic poems so imposing when regarded as vast natural forces or as the spiritual beings that master vast natural forces so sympathetic when looked on as merciful gods conscious of yet lenient towards the sins of perishing mortals have also their mythological aspect and their chronique scandaleuse        here we must remind the reader that the vedas do not offer      us all these tales nor the worst of them as m barth says      le sentiment religieux a ecarte la plupart de ces mythes      ainsi que beaucoup dautres qui le choquaient mais il ne      les a pas ecartes tous religions de

small or young you are all great as to the immortality and the origin of the gods opinions are equally divided among the vedic poets and in the traditions collected in the brahmanas several myths of the origin of the gods have already been discussed in the chapter on aryan myths of the creation of the world and of man it was there demonstrated that many of the aryan myths were on a level with those current among contemporary savages all over the world and it was inferred that they originally sprang from the same source the savage imagination  in this place while examining the wilder divine myths we need only repeat that in one legend heaven and earth conceived of as two sentient living beings of human parts and passions produced the aryan gods as they did the gods of the new zealanders and of other races again the gods were represented in the children of aditi and this might be taken either in a high and refined sense as if aditi were the infinite region from which the solar deities rise or we may hold that aditi is the eternal which sustains and is sustained by the gods or the indian imagination could sink to the vulgar and halfmagical conception of aditi as a female who being desirous of sons cooked a brahmandana oblation for the gods the sadhyas        rigveda i 2713        ibid viii 30 muir v 12        max müller hibbert lectures p 230        roth in muir iv 56        taittirya brahmana i 1 9 1 muir v 55 1 27  various other gods and supernatural beings are credited with having created or generated the gods indras father and mother are constantly spoken of and both he and other gods are often said to have been originally mortal and to have reached the heavens by dint of that austere fervour that magical asceticism which could do much more than move mountains the gods are thus by no means always credited in aryan mythology with inherent immortality like most of the other deities whose history we have been studying they had struggles for preeminence with powers of a titanic character the asuras asura living was originally an epithet of certain powers of nature particularly of the sky says mr max müller as the gods also are recognised as powers of nature particularly of the sky there does not seem to be much original difference between devas and asuras the opposition between them may be secondary as mr max müller says but in any case it too strongly resembles the other wars in heaven of other mythologies to be quite omitted unluckily the most consecutive account of the strife is to be found not in the hymns of the vedas but in the collected body of mythical and other traditions called the brahmanas        hibbert lectures p 318        in the atharva veda it is said that a female asura      once drew indra from among the gods muir v 82 thus gods      and asuras are capable of amorous relations        satapatha br  the story in the brahmana begins by saying that throughout see the oxford translation prajapati the producer of things whose acquaintance we have made in the chapter on cosmogonic myths was half mortal and half immortal after creating things endowed with life he created death the devourer with that part of him which was mortal he was afraid of death and the gods were also afraid of this ender death the gods in this tradition are regarded as mortals compare the black yajur veda the gods were formerly just like men they desired to overcome want misery death and to go to the divine assembly they saw took and sacrificed with this chaturvimsatiratra and in consequence overcame want misery and death and reached the divine assembly in the same veda we are told that the gods and asuras contended together the gods were less numerous but as politicians make men peers they added to their number by placing some bricks in the proper position to receive the sacrificial fire they then used incantations thou art a multiplier and so the bricks became animated and joined the party of the gods and made numbers more equal        taittirya sanhita muir v 15 note 22        according to a later legend or a legend which we have      received in a later form the gods derived immortality from      drinking of the churned ocean of milk they churned it with      mount mandara for a staff and the serpent hasuki for a cord      the ramayana and mahabharata ascribe this churning to the      desire of the gods to become immortal according to the      mahabharata a daitya named rahu insinuated himself among      the gods and drank some of the draught of immortality      vishnu beheaded him before the draught reached lower than      his throat his head was thus immortal and is now a      constellation he pursues the sun and moon who had spied      him among the gods and causes their eclipses by his      ferocity all this is on a level with australian mythology  to return to the gods in the satapatha brahmana and their dread of death they overcame him by certain sacrifices suggested by prajapati death resented this and complained that men would now become immortal and his occupation would be gone to console him the gods promised that no man in future should become immortal with his body but only through knowledge after parting with his body this legend at least in its present form is necessarily later than the establishment of minute sacrificial rules it is only quoted here as an example of the opinion that the gods were once mortal and just like men it may be urged and probably with truth that this belief is the figment of religious decadence as to the victory of the gods over the asuras that is ascribed by the satapatha brahmana to the fact that at a time when neither gods nor asuras were scrupulously veracious the gods invented the idea of speaking the truth the asuras stuck to lying the first results not unnaturally were that the gods became weak and poor the asuras mighty and rich the gods at last overcame the asuras not by veracity but by the success of a magical sacrifice earlier dynasties of gods to which the generation of indra succeeded are not unfrequently mentioned in the rig veda        muir iv 6a        ibid v 16  on the whole the accounts of the gods and of their nature present in aryan mythology the inconsistent anthropomorphism and the mixture of incongruous and often magical and childish ideas which mark all other mythological systems this will become still more manifest when we examine the legends of the various gods separately as they have been disentangled by dr muir and m bergaigne from the vedas and from the later documents which contain traditions of different dates  the vedas contain no such orderly statements of the divine genealogies as we find in hesoid and homer all is confusion all is contradiction in many passages heaven and earth dyaus and prithivi are spoken of as parents of the other gods dyaus is commonly identified as is well known with zeus by the philologists but his legend has none of the fulness and richness which makes that of zeus so remarkable before the story of dyaus could become that of zeus the old aryan sky or heaven god had to attract into his cycle that vast collection of miscellaneous adventures from a thousand sources which fill the legend of the chief hellenic deity in the veda dyaus appears now as with prithivi the parent of all both men and gods now as a created thing or being fashioned by indra or by tvashtri he is essentially beneficent but has no marked individuality and can only have become the greek zeus by inheriting attributes from other deities   another very early divine person is aditi the mother of the great and popular gods called adityas nothing is less certain than the derivation of the name of aditi says m paul regnaud        certain myths of the beginnings of things will be found in      the chapter on cosmogonic traditions        muir v 2124        ibid v 30        bergaigne iii 112        revue de lhistoire des religions xii 1 40  m regnaud finds the root of aditi in ad to shine mr max müller looks for the origin of the word in a privative and da to bind thus aditi will mean the boundless the infinite a theory rejected by m regnaud the expansion of this idea with all its important consequences is worked out by mr max müller in his hibbert lectures the dawn came and went but there remained always behind the dawn that heaving sea of light or fire from which she springs was not this the invisible infinite and what better name could be given than that which the vedic poets gave to it aditi the boundless the yonder the beyond all and everything this very abstract idea may have been one of the earliest intuitions and creations of the hindu mind p 229 m darmesteter and mr whitney on the other hand explain aditi just as welcker and mr max müller explain cronion there was no such thing as a goddess named aditi till men asked themselves the meaning of the title of their own gods the adityas that name might be interpreted children of aditi and so a goddess called aditi was invented to fit the name thus philologically extracted from adityas  m bergaigne finds that aditi means free untrammelled and is used both as an adjective and as a name        the brahmanic legend of the birth of the adityas aitareya      brahmana iii 33 is too disgusting to be quoted        religion vedique iii 88  this vague and floating term was well suited to convey the pantheistic ideas natural to the indian mind and already notable in the vedic hymns aditi cries a poet is heaven aditi is air aditi is the father the mother and the son aditi is all the gods aditi is that which is born and which awaits the birth nothing can be more advanced and metaphysical meanwhile though aditi is a personage so floating and nebulous she figures in fairly definite form in a certain myth the rigveda x 72 8 tells us the tale of the birth of her sons the adityas eight sons were there of aditi born of her womb to the gods went she with seven martanda threw she away the satapatha brahmana throws a good deal of light on her conduct aditi had eight sons but there are only seven gods whom men call adityas the eighth she bore a shapeless lump of the dimensions of a man as broad as long say some the adityas then trimmed this ugly duckling of the family into human shape and an elephant sprang from the waste pieces which they threw away therefore an elephant partakes of the nature of man the shapen eighth son was called vivasvat the sun        rig veda i 89 10        muir iv 15  it is not to be expected that many if any remains of a theriomorphic character should cling to a goddess so abstract as aditi when therefore we find her spoken of as a cow it is at least as likely that this is only part of the pleasant unconscious poetry of the veda as that it is a survival of some earlier zoomorphic belief gubernatis offers the following lucid account of the metamorphosis of the infinite for so he understands aditi into the humble domestic animal the inexhaustible soon comes to mean that which can be milked without end it would be more plausible to say that what can be milked without end soon comes to mean the inexhaustible and hence also a celestial cow an inoffensive cow which we must not offend the whole heavens being thus represented as an infinite cow it was natural that the principal and most visible phenomena of the sky should become in their turn children of the cow aditi then is the great spotted cow thus did the vedic poets according to gubernatis descend from the unconditioned to the byre  from aditi however she is to be interpreted we turn to her famous children the adityas the high gods  there is no kind of consistency as we have so often said in vedic mythical opinion the adityas for example are now represented as three now as seven for three and seven are sacred numbers to the triad a fourth is sometimes added to the seven an eighth aditya the adityas are a brotherhood or college of gods but some of the members of the fraternity have more individual character than for example the maruts who are simply a company with a tendency to become confused with the adityas considered as a triad the adityas are varuna mitra aryaman the name of varuna is commonly derived from vri or var to cover according to the commentator sayana because he envelops the wicked in his snares the nets which he carries to capture the guilty as god of the midnight sky varuna is also the covering deity with his universal pall of darkness varunas name has frequently been compared to that of uranus  the greek god of heaven who was mutilated by his son cronos        max müller select essays i 871  supposing varuna to mean the heaven we are not much advanced for dyu also lias the same meaning yet dyaus and varuna have little in common the interpreters of the vedas attempted to distinguish mitra from varuna by making the former the god of the daylight the latter the god of the midnight vault of heaven the distinction like other vedic attempts at drawing a line among the floating phantasms of belief is not kept up with much persistency  of all vedic deities varuna has the most spiritual and ethical character the grandest cosmical functions are ascribed to varuna his ordinances are fixed and unassailable he who should flee far beyond the sky would not escape varuna the king he is gracious even to him who has committed sin to be brief the moral sentiments which we have shown to be often present in a pure form even in the religion of savages find a lofty and passionate expression in the vedic psalms to varuna but even varuna has not shaken off all remains of the ruder mythopoeic fancy a tale of the grossest and most material obscenity is told of mitra and varuna in the rig veda itselfthe tale of the birth of vasistha  in the aitareya brahmana ii 460 varuna takes a sufficiently personal form he has somehow fallen heir to a role familiar to us from the russian tale of tsar morskoi the gaelic battle of the birds and the scotch nicht nought nothing varuna in short becomes the giant or demon who demands from the king the gift of his yet unborn son        muir v 66        rig veda vii 33 2        see custom and myth a fartravelled tale and our      chapter postea on romantic myths  harischandra is childless and is instructed to pray to varuna promising to offer the babe as a human sacrifice when the boy is born harischandra tries to evade the fulfilment of his promise finally a young brahman is purchased and is to be sacrificed to varuna as a substitute for the kings son the young brahman is supernaturally released  thus even in vedic still more in brahmanic myth the vague and spiritual form of varuna is brought to shame or confused with some demon of lower earlier legends  there are believed on somewhat shadowy evidence to be traces of a conflict between varuna and indra the fourth aditya sometimes added to the triad a conflict analogous to that between uranus and cronos the hymn as m bergaigne holds proves that indra was victorious over varuna and thereby obtained possession of fire and of the soma juice but these births and battles of gods who sometimes are progenitors of their own fathers and who seem to change shapes with demons are no more to be fixed and scientifically examined than the torn plumes and standards of the mist as they roll up a pass among the mountain pines        rig veda x 124        bergaigne iii 147  we next approach a somewhat better defined and more personal figure that of the famous god indra who is the nearest vedic analogue of the greek zeus before dealing with the subject more systematically it may be interesting to give one singular example of the parallelisms between aryan and savage mythology  in his disquisition on the indian gods dr muir has been observing that some passages of the rig veda imply that the reigning deities were successors of others who had previously existed he quotes in proof of this a passage from rig veda iv 18 12 who o indra made thy mother a widow who sought to kill thee lying or moving what god was present in the fray when thou didst slay thy father seizing him by the foot according to m bergaigne indra slew his father tvashtri for the purpose of stealing and drinking the soma to which he was very partial this is rather a damaging passage as it appears that the vedic poet looked on indra as a parricide and a drunkard to explain this hint however sayana the ancient commentator quotes a passage from the black yajur veda which is no explanation at all but it has some interest for us as showing how the myths of aryans and hottentots coincide even in very strange details yajna sacrifice desired dakshina largesse he consorted with her indra was apprehensive of this he reflected whoever is born of her will be this he entered into her indra himself was born of her he reflected whoever is born of her besides me will be this having considered he cut open her womb she produced a cow here we have a high aryan god passing into and being born from the womb of a being who also bore a cow the hottentot legend of the birth of their god heitsi eibib is scarcely so repulsive        sanskrit texts v 1617        religion vedique iii 99        tsuni goam hahn p  there was grass growing and a cow came and ate of that grass and she became pregnant as hera of ares in greek myth and she brought forth a young bull and this bull became a very large bull and the people came together one day in order to slaughter him but he ran away down hill and they followed him to turn him back and catch him but when they came to the spot where he had disappeared they found a man making milk tubs they asked this man where is the bull that passed down here he said i do not know has he then passed here and all the while it was he himself who had again become heitsi eibib thus the birth of heitsi eibib resembled that of indra as described in rigveda iv 18 10 his mother a cow bore indra an unlicked calf whatever view we may take of this myth and of the explanation in the brahmana which has rather the air of being an invention to account for the vedic cowmother of indra it is certain that the god is not regarded as an uncreated being   ludwig die farse hat den groszen starken nicht zu venoundenden stier den tosenden indra geboren   as to the etymological derivation and original significance of the name of indra the greatest differences exist among philologists yaska gives thirteen guesses of old and there are nearly as many modern conjectures in 1846 roth described indra as the god of the bright clear vault of heaven zellers theologisches jahrbuch 1846 p 352 compare for this and the following conjectures e d perry journal of american oriental society

different derivation benfey or und occ 1862 p 48 made indra god not of the radiant but of the rainy sky mr max müller lectures on science of language ii 470 made indra another conception of the bright blue sky but p 473 note 35 he derives indra from the same root as in sanskrit gives indu drop or sap that is apparently rainy sky the reverse of blue it means originally the giver of rain and beufey is quoted ut supra in chips ii 91 indra becomes the chief solar deity of india  muir texts v 77 identifies the character of indra with that of jupiter pluvius the rainy jove of rome grassman dictionary s v calls indra the god of the bright firmament mr perry takes a distinction and regards indra as a god not of sky but of air a midgarth between earth and sky who inherited the skyey functions of dyu in the veda mr perry finds him the personification of the thunderstorm and so on it seems incontestable that in vedic mythology tvashtri is regarded as the father of indra thus ii 17 6 indras thunderbolts are said to have been fashioned by his father other proofs are found in the account of the combat between father and son thus iii 48 4 we read powerful victorious he gives his body what shape he pleases thus indra having vanquished tvashtri even at his birth stole and drank the soma these anecdotes do not quite correspond with the version of indras guilt given in the brahmanas there it is stated that tvashtri had a threeheaded son akin to the asuras named vairupa this vairupa was suspected of betraying to the asuras the secret of soma indra therefore cut off his three heads        on the parentage of indra bergaigne writes iii 58        iii 61 bergaigne identifies tvashtri and vritra      cf aitareya brahmana ii 483 note 5        aitareya brahmana it 483 note 6  now vairupa was a brahman and indra was only purified of his awful guilt brahmanicide when earth trees and women accepted each their share of the iniquity tvashtri the father of vairupa still excluded indra from a share of the soma which however indra seized by force tvashtri threw what remained of indras share into the fire with imprecations and from the fire sprang vritra the enemy of indra indra is represented at various times and in various texts as having sprung from the mouth of purusha or as being a child of heaven and earth whom he thrust asunder as tutenganahau thrust asunder rangi and papa in the new zealand myth in a passage of the black yajur veda once already quoted indra sheep and the kshattriya caste were said to have sprung from the breast and arms of prajapati in yet another hymn in the rig veda he is said to have conquered heaven by magical austerity leaving the brahmanas aside mr perry distinguishes four sorts of vedic texts on the origin of indra  1 purely physical  2 anthropomorphic  3 vague references to indras parents  4 philosophical speculations  of the first class it does not appear to us that the purely physical element is so very pure after all heaven earth indra the cow are all thought of as personal entities however gigantic and vague  in the second or anthropomorphic myths we have the dialogue already referred to in which indra like set in egypt and malsumis or chokanipok in america insists on breaking his way through his mothers side        muir i 16        op cit p 124        rig veda iv 17 4  2 12 iv 22 4 i 63 1 viii      59 4 viii 6 2830        ibid iv 181        cf egyptian divine myths  in verse 5 his mother exposes indra as maui and the youngest son of aditi were exposed indra soon after as precocious as heitsi eibib immediately on his birth kills his father he also kills vritra as apollo when newborn slew the python in iii 48 2 3 he takes early to somadrinking in x 153 1 women cradle him as the nymphs nursed zeus in the cretan cave  in the third class we have the odd myth while an immature boy he mounted the new waggon and roasted for father and mother a fierce bull   in the fourth class a speculative person tries to account for the statement that indra was born from a horse or the verse means that agni was a horses son finally sayana explains nothing but happens to mention that the goddess aditi swallowed her rival nisti a very primitive performance and much like the feat of cronos when he dined on his family or of zeus when he swallowed his wife        why do indra and his family behave in this bloodthirsty      way hillebrandt says that the father is the heaven which      indra kills by covering it with clouds but again indra      kills his father by concealing the sun he is abandoned by      his mother when the clear sky from which he is born      disappears behind the veil of cloud is the father sun or      heaven is the mother clear sky or as elsewhere the      imperishability of the daylight perry op cit p 149        rig veda viii 68 15        ibid x 73 10         ibid x 101 12 for sayana see mr perrys essay      journal a 0 s 1882 p 180  thus a fixed tradition of indras birth is lacking in the veda and the fluctuating traditions are not very creditable to the purity of the aryan fancy in personal appearance indra was handsome and ruddy as the sun but like odin and heitsi eibib and other gods and wizards he could assume any shape at will he was a great charioteer and wielded the thunderbolt forged for him by tvashtri the indian hephaestus his love of the intoxicating soma juice was notorious and with sacrifices of this liquor his adorers were accustomed to inspire and invigorate him he is even said to have drunk at one draught thirty bowls of soma dr haug has tasted it but could only manage one teaspoonful indras belly is compared by his admirers to a lake and there seems to be no doubt that they believed the god really drank their soma as heitsi eibib really enjoys the honey left by the hottentots on his grave i have verily resolved to bestow cows and horses i have quaffed the soma the draughts which i have drunk impel me as violent blasts i have quaffed the soma i surpass in greatness the heaven and the vast earth i have quaffed the soma i am majestic elevated to the heavens i have quaffed the soma so sings the drunken and bemused indra in the manner of the cyclops in euripides after receiving the wine the treacherous gift of odysseus  according to the old commentator sayana indra got at the soma which inspired him with his drinkingsong by assuming the shape of a quail  the great feats of indra which are constantly referred to are his slaughter of the serpent vritra who had taken possession of all the waters and his recovery of the sun which had also been stolen        rig veda x 119        ibid 139 4 iii 39 6 viii 85 7  these myths are usually regarded as allegorical ways of stating that the lightning opens the dark thundercloud and makes it disgorge the rain and reveal the sun whether this theory be correct or not it is important for our purpose to show that the feats thus attributed to indra are really identical in idea with though more elevated in conception and style than certain australian iroquois and thlinkeet legends in the iroquois myth as in the australian a great frog swallowed all the waters and was destroyed by ioskeha or some other animal in thlinkeet legends yehl the ravengod carried off to men the hidden sun and the waters among these lower races the waterstealer was thought of as a real reptile of some sort and it is probable that a similar theory once prevailed among the ancestors of the aryans vritra and ahi the mysterious foes whom indra slays when he recovers the sun and the waters were probably once as real to the early fancy as the australian or iroquois frog the extraordinary myth of the origin of vritra only found in the brahmanas indicates the wild imagination of an earlier period indra murdered a brahman a threeheaded one it is true but still a brahman for this he was excluded from the banquet and was deprived of his favourite soma he stole a cup of it and the dregs thrown into the fire with a magical imprecation became vritra whom indra had such difficulty in killing before attacking vritra indra supplied himself with dutch courage a copious draught of soma provided him with the necessary courage and strength the terror of the other gods was abject after slaying him he so lost selfpossession that in his flight he behaved like odin when he flew off in terror with the head of suttung        brinton myths of new world pp 184 185   see also      chapter i        perry op cit p 137 rigveda v 29 3 7 iii      43 7 iv 18 11 viii 85 7        rigveda i 3214 tells of a flight as headlong as      that of apollo after killing the python mr perry explains      the flight as the rapid journey of the thunderstorm  if our opinion be correct the elemental myths which abound in the veda are not myths in the making as is usually held but rather myths gradually dissolving into poetry and metaphor as an example of the persistence in civilised myth of the old direct savage theory that animals of a semisupernatural sort really cause the heavenly phenomena we may quote mr darmesteters remark in the introduction to the zendavesta the storm floods that cleanse the sky of the dark fiends in it were described in a class of myths as the urine of a gigantic animal in the heavens a more savage and theriomorphic hypothesis it would be hard to discover among bushmen or nootkas probably the serpent vritra is another beast out of the same menagerie  if our theory of the evolution of gods is correct we may expect to find in the myths of indra traces of a theriomorphic character as the point in the ear of man is thought or fabled to be a relic of his arboreal ancestry so in the shape of indra there should if gods were developed out of divine beasts be traces of fur and feather they are not very numerous nor very distinct but we give them for what they may be worth  the myth of yehl the thlinkeet ravengod will not have been forgotten in his raven gear yehl stole the sacred water as odin also in bird form stole the mead of suttung we find a similar feat connected with indra gubernatis says        sacred books of the east vol iv p lxxxviii        the etymology of vritra is usually derived from vn to      cover hinder restrain then what is to be      hindered then enemy fiend        zoological mythology ii 182  in the rigveda indra often appears as a hawk while the hawk carries the ambrosia through the air he trembles for fear of the archer kricanus who in fact shot off one of his claws of which the hedgehog was born according to the aitareya brahmana and according to the vedic hymn one of his feathers which falling on the earth afterwards became a tree indras very peculiar relations with rams are also referred to by gubernatis they resemble a certain repulsive myth of zeus demeter and the ram referred to by the early christian fathers in the satapatha brahmana indra is called ram of medhatithi wife of vrishanasva indra like loki had taken the part of a woman in the shape of a ram he carried off medhatithi an exploit like that of zeus with ganymede  in the vedas however all the passages which connect indra with animals will doubtless be explained away as metaphorical though it is admitted that like zeus he could assume whatever form he pleased vedic poets probably of a late period made indra as anthropomorphic as the homeric zeus his domestic life in the society of his consort indrani is described when he is starting for the war indrani calls him back and gives him a stirrupcup of soma he and she quarrel very naturally about his pet monkey  in this brief sketch which is not even a summary we have shown how much of the irrational element how much too of the humorous element there is in the myths about indra he is a drunkard who gulps down cask spigot and all        compare rigveda iv 271        zool myth i 414        ii 81        rig veda i 51 13        ibid viii 2 40

sheep from the breast of a vast nonnatural being like ymir in scandinavian myth he metamorphoses himself into a ram or a woman he rends asunder his father and mother heaven and earth he kills his father immediately after his birth or he is mortal but has attained heaven by dint of magic by austere fervour now our argument is that these and such as these incongruous and irrational parts of indras legend have no necessary or natural connection with the worship of him as a naturegod an elemental deity a power of sky and storm as civilised men conceive storm and sky on the other hand these legends of which plenty of savage parallels have been adduced are obviously enough survivals from the savage intellectual myths in which sorcerers with their absurd powers are almost on a level with gods and our theory is that the irrational part of indras legend became attached to the figure of an elemental divinity a naturegod at the period when savage men mythically attributed to their gods the qualities which were claimed by the most illustrious among themselves by their sorcerers and chiefs in the vedas the naturegod has not quite disengaged himself from these old savage attributes which to civilised men seem so irrational trailing clouds of anything but glory does indra come from heaven which is his home if the irrational element in the legend of indra was neither a survival of nor a loan from savage fancy why does it tally with the myths of savages  the other adityas strictly so called for most gods are styled adityas now and then by way of compliment need not detain us we go on to consider the celebrated soma  soma is one of the most singular deities of the indoaryans originally soma is the intoxicating juice of a certain plant the wonderful personifying power of the early imagination can hardly be better illustrated than by the deification of the soma juice we are accustomed to hear in the märchen or peasant myths of scotch russian zulu and other races of drops of blood or spittle which possess human faculties and intelligence and which can reply for example to questions the personification of the soma juice is an instance of the same exercise of fancy on a much grander scale all the hymns in the ninth book of the rig veda and many others in other places are addressed to the milklike juice of this plant which when personified holds a place almost as high as that of indra in the indoaryan olympus the sacred plant was brought to men from the sky or from a mountain by a hawk or by indra in guise of a hawk just as fire was brought to other races by a benevolent bird a raven or a cow according to the aitareya brahmana ii 59 the gods bought some from the gandharvas in exchange for one of their own number who was metamorphosed into a woman a big naked woman of easy virtue in the satapatha brahmana the gods while still they lived on earth desired to obtain soma which was then in the sky        as to the true nature and home of the soma plant see a      discussion in the academy 1885        muir v 263  a gandharva robbed the divine being who had flown up and seized the soma and as in the aitareya brahmana the gods won the plant back by the aid of vach a womanenvoy to the amorous gandharvas the black yajur veda has some ridiculous legends about soma personified and his thirtythree wives their jealousies and so forth soma in the rig veda is not only the beverage that inspires indra but is also an anthropomorphic god who created and lighted up the sun and who drives about in a chariot he is sometimes addressed as a kind of atlas who keeps heaven and earth asunder he is prayed to forgive the violations of his law soma in short as a personified power wants little of the attributes of a supreme deity  another and to modern ideas much more poetical personified power often mentioned in the vedas is ushas or the dawn as among the australians the dawn is a woman but a very different being from the immodest girl dressed in red kangarooskins of the murri myth she is an active maiden who advances cherishing all things she hastens on arousing footed creatures and makes the birds fly aloft the flying birds no longer rest after thy dawning o bringer of food  she has yoked her horses from the remote risingplace of the sun resplendent on thy massive car hear our invocations ushas is like a fair girl adorned by her mother she

away the life of mortals she is the sister of night and the bright sun is her child there is no more pure poetry in the vedic collections than that which celebrates the dawn though even here the rishis are not oblivious of the rewards paid to the sacrificial priests dawn is somewhat akin to the homeric eos the goddess of the golden throne she who loved a mortal and bore him away for his beautys sake to dwell with the immortals once indra acting with the brutality of the homeric ares charged against the car of ushas and overthrew it        rig veda i 48 4        ibid i 4810        ibid iv 30 8 ait br iv 9  in her legend however we find little but pure poetry and we do not know that ushas like eos ever chose a mortal lover such is the vedic ushas but the brahmanas as usual manage either to retain or to revive and introduce the old crude element of myth we have seen that the australians account to themselves for the ruddy glow of the morning sky by the hypothesis that dawn is a girl of easy virtue dressed in the red opossumskins she has received from her lovers in a similar spirit the aitareya brahmana iv 9 offers brief and childish ætiological myths to account for a number of natural phenomena thus it explains the sterility of mules by saying that the gods once competed in a race that agni fire drove in a chariot drawn by mules and scorched them so that they do not conceive but in this race ushas was drawn by red cows hence after the coming of dawn there is a reddish colour the red cows of the brahmana may pair off with the red opossums of the australian imagination  we now approach a couple of deities whose character as far as such shadowy things can be said to have any character at all is pleasing and friendly the asvins correspond in vedic mythology to the dioscuri the castor and polydeuces of greece they like the dioscuri are twins are horsemen and their legend represents them as kindly and helpful to men in distress but while the dioscuri stand forth in greek legend as clearly and fairly fashioned as two young knights of the panathenaic procession the asvins show as bright and formless as melting wreaths of mist  the origin of their name has been investigated by the commentator yaska who quotes sundry verses to prove that the two asvins belong together sic the etymology of the name is the subject as usual of various conjectures it has been derived from asva a horse from the root as to pervade and explained as a patronymic from asva the sun the nature of the asvins puzzled the indian commentators no less than their name who then are these asvins heaven and earth say some        max müller lectures on language ii 536         yaska in the nirukta xii 1   see muir v 234  the some who held this opinion relied on an etymological guess the derivation from as to pervade  others inclined to explain the asvins as day and night others as the sun and moon othersindian euhemeristsas two real kings now dead and gone professor roth thinks the asvins contain an historical element and are the earliest bringers of light in the morning sky mr max müller seems in favour of the two twilights as to these and allied modes of explaining the two gods in connection with physical phenomena muir writes thus this allegorical method of interpretation seems unlikely to be correct as it is difficult to suppose that the phenomena in question should have been alluded to under such a variety of names and circumstances it appears therefore to be more probable that the rishis merely refer to certain legends which were popularly current of interventions of the asvins in behalf of the persons whose names are mentioned in the veda the asvins are represented as living in fraternal polyandry with but one wife surya the daughter of the sun between them they are thought to have won her as the prize in a chariotrace according to the commentator sayana the time of their appearance is properly the early dawn when they receive the offerings of their votaries when the dark night stands among the tawny cows i invoke you asvins sons of the sky they are addressed as young beautiful fleet and the foes of evil spirits        rig veda i 119 2 i 119 5 x 39 11         muir v 238        rigveda x 61 4  there can be no doubt that when the vedas were composed the asvins shone and wavered and were eclipsed among the bright and cloudy throng of gods then contemplated by the rishis or sacred singers whether they had from the beginning an elemental origin and what that origin exactly was or whether they were merely endowed by the fancy of poets with various elemental and solar attributes and functions it may be impossible to ascertain their legend meanwhile is replete with features familiar in other mythologies as to their birth the rig veda has the following singular anecdote which reminds one of the cloudbride of ixion and of the woman of clouds and shadows that was substituted for helen of troy tvashtri makes a wedding for his daughter hearing this the whole world assembled the mother of yama the wedded wife of the great vivasvat disappeared they concealed the immortal bride from mortals making another of like appearance they gave her to vivasvat saranyu bore the two asvins and when she had done so deserted the twins the old commentators explain by a legend in which the daughter of tvashtri saranyu took on the shape of a mare vivasvat followed her in the form of a horse and she became the mother of the asvins sons of the horse who more or less correspond to castor and pollux sons of the swan the greeks were well acquainted with local myths of the same sort according to which poseidon in the form of a horse had become the parent of a horse by demeter erinnys saranyu then in the shape of a mare the phigaleians among whom this tale was current worshipped a statue of demeter in a womans shape with a mares head the same tale was told of cronus and philyra this myth of the birth of gods who are lauded as asvins sprung from a horse may be the result of a mere volks etymologie        rigveda x 17 12 bergaigne ii 806 318        pausanias viii 25 virgil georgia iii 91 muir v      128   see chapter on greek divine myths demeter        muirv 228  some one may have asked himself what the word asvins meant may have rendered it sprung from a horse and may either have invented by way of explanation a story like that of cronus and philyra or may have adapted such a story already current in folklore to his purpose or the myth may be early and a mere example of the prevalent mythical fashion which draws no line between gods and beasts and men it will probably be admitted that this and similar tales prove the existence of the savage element of mythology among the aryans of india whether it be borrowed or a survival or an imitative revival  the asvins were usually benefactors of men in every sort of strait and trouble a quail even invoked them mr max müller thinks this quail was the dawn but the asvins were something like the dawn already and they rescued her from the jaws of a wolf in this respect and in their beauty and youth they answer to castor and pollux as described by theocritus succourers are they of men in the very thick of peril and of horses maddened in the bloody press of battle and of ships that defying the setting and the rising of the stars in heaven have encountered the perilous breath of storms        theoc idyll xxii i 17  a few examples of the friendliness of the asvins may be selected from the long list given by muir they renewed the youth of kali after the leg of vispala had been cut off in battle the asvins substituted an iron leg they restored sight to rijrasva whom his father had blinded because in an access of altruism he had given one hundred and one sheep to a hungry shewolf the shewolf herself prayed to the asvins to succour her benefactor they drew the rishi rebha out of a well they made wine and liquors flow from the hoof of their own horse most of the persons rescued quail and all are interpreted of course as semblances of the dawn and the twilight goldstucker says they are among the deities forced by professor müller to support his dawntheory m bergaigne also leans to the theory of physical phenomena when the asvins restore sight to the blind kanva he sees no reason to doubt that the blind kanva is the sun during the night or agni or soma is concealment a proof of this he finds in the statement that kanva is dark to which we might reply that dark is still a synonym for blind among the poor        rig veda i 116 16        ibid i 116 7        bergaigne rel ved ii 460 465  m bergaignes final hypothesis is that the asvins may be assimilated to the two celebrants who in the beginning seemed to represent the terrestrial and celestial fires but this origin he says even if correctly conjectured had long been forgotten  beyond the certainty that the asvins represent the element of kindly and healing powers as commonly conceived of in popular mythologyfor example in the legends of the saintsthere is really nothing certain or definite about their original meaning  a god with a better defined and more recognisable department is tvashtri who is in a vague kind of way the counterpart of the greek hephaestus he sharpens the axe of brahmanaspiti and forges the bolts of indra he also bestows offspring is a kind of male aphrodite and is the shaper of all forms human and animal saranyu is his daughter professor kuhn connects her with the stormcloud mr max müller with the dawn her wedding in the form of a mare to vivasvat in the guise of a horse has already been spoken of and discussed tvashtris relations with indra as we have shown are occasionally hostile there is a bloodfeud between them as indra slew tvashtris threeheaded son from whose blood sprang two partridges and a sparrow  the maruts are said to be gods of the tempest of lightning of wind and of rain their names as usual are tortured on various by the etymologists mr max müller connects maruts with the roots mar to pound and with the roman wargod mars others think the root is mar to shine benfey says that the maruts their name being derived from mar to die are personfications of the souls of the departed        max müller lectures on language ii 530        muir v 224 233        ibid v 147  their numbers are variously estimated they are the sons of rudra and prisni rudra as a bull according to a tale told by sayana begat the maruts on the earth which took the shape of a cow as in similar cases we may suppose this either to be a survival or revival of a savage myth or a merely symbolical statement there are traces of rivalry between indra and the maruts it is beyond question that the rishis regard them as elementary and mainly as stormgods whether they were originally ghosts like the australian mrarts where the name tempts the wilder kind of etymologists or whether they are personified winds or again winds conceived as persons which is not quite the same thing it is difficult and perhaps impossible to determine  though divers of the vedic gods have acquired solar characteristics there is a regular special sundeity in the veda named surya or savitri he answers to the helios of the homeric hymn to the sun conceived as a personal being a form which he still retains in the fancy of the greek islanders surya is sometimes spoken of as a child of aditis or of dyaus and ushas is his wife though she also lives in spartan polyandry with the asvin twins like helios hyperion he beholds all things the good and evil deeds of mortals he is often involved in language of religious fervour the english reader is apt to confuse surya with the female being surya surya is regarded by grassmann and roth as a feminine personification of the sun m bergaigne looks on surya as the daughter of the sun or daughter of savitri and thus as the dawn savitri is the sun goldenhaired and goldenhanded from the satapatha brahmana it appears that people were apt to identify savitri with prajapati        bents cyclades        rig veda vii 75 5        muir v 155162        bergaigne ii 486        xiii 3 5 1        the very strange and important personage of prajapati      is discussed in the chapter on indian cosmogonic myths  these blendings of various conceptions and of philosophic systems with early traditions have now been illustrated as far as our space will permit the natural conclusion after a rapid view of vedic deities seems to be that they are extremely composite characters visible only in the shifting rays of the indian fancy at a period when the peculiar qualities of indian thought were already sufficiently declared the lights of ritualistic dogma and of pantheistic and mystic and poetic emotion fall in turn like the changeful hues of sunset on figures as melting and shifting as the clouds of evening yet even to these vague shapes of the divine there clings as we think has been shown somewhat of their oldest raiment something of the early fancy from which we suppose them to have floated up ages before the vedas were compiled in their present form if this view be correct vedic mythology does by no means represent what is primitive and early but what in order of development is late is peculiar and is marked with the mark of a religious tendency as strongly national and characteristic as the purest semitic monotheism thus the veda is not a fair startingpoint for a science of religion but is rather in spite of its antiquity a temporary though advanced restingplace in the development of indian religious speculation and devotional sentiment        in the chapters on india the translation of the veda      used is herr ludwigs prag 1876 much is owed to mr      perrys

legendsconclusions  in the gods of greece when represented in ideal art and in the best religious sentiment as revealed by poets and philosophers from homer to plato from plato to porphyry there is something truly human and truly divine it cannot be doubted that the religion of apollo athene artemis and hermes was in many respects an adoration directed to the moral and physical qualities that are best and noblest again even in the oldest greek literature in homer and in all that follows the name of the chief god zeus might in many places be translated by our word god        postea zeus  it is god that takes from man half his virtue on the day of slavery it is god that gives to each his lot in life and ensures that as his day is so shall his strength be this spiritual conception of deity undifferentiated by shape or attributes or even by name declares itself in the homeric terms  and in the  of herodotus these are spiritual forces or tendencies ruling the world and these conceptions are present to the mind even of homer whose pictures of the gods are so essentially anthropomorphic even of herodotus in all things so cautiously reverent in his acceptation of the popular creeds and rituals when socrates therefore was doomed to death for his theories of religion he was not condemned so much for holding a pure belief in a spiritual divinity as for bringing that opinion itself no new thing into the marketplace and thereby shocking the popular religion on which depended the rites that were believed to preserve the fortune of the state  it is difficult or impossible quite to unravel the tangled threads of mythical legend of sacerdotal ritual of local religion and of refined religious sentiment in greece even in the earliest documents the homeric poems religious sentiment deserts in moments of deep and serious thought the brilliant assembly of the olympians and takes refuge in that fatherhood of the divine after which all men yearn        odyssey iii 48  yet even in pausanias in the second century of the christian era and still more in plutarch and porphyry there remains an awful acquiescence in such wild dogmas and sacred traditions as antiquity handed down we can hardly determine whether even homer actually believed in his own turbulent cowardly ares in his own amorous and capricious zeus did homer did any educated greek turn in his thoughts when pain or sorrow or fear fell on him to a hope in the help of hermes or athene he was ready to perform all their rites and offer all the sacrifices due but it may be questioned whether even in such a godfearing man as nicias this ritualism meant more than a desire to fulfil all righteousness and to gratify a religious sentiment in the old traditional forms  in examining greek myths then it must be remembered that like all myths they have far less concern with religion in its true guisewith the yearning after the divine which is not far from any one of us after the god in whom we live and move and have our beingthan with the religio which is a tissue of old barbarous fears misgivings misapprehensions the religion which retained most of the myths was that ancient superstition which is afraid of changing the luck and which therefore keeps up acts of ritual that have lost their significance in their passage from a dark and dateless past it was the local priesthoods of demes and remote rural places that maintained the old usages of the ancient tribes and kindredsusages out of keeping with the mental condition of the splendid city state or with the national sentiment of hellenism but many of the old tales connected with and explanatory of these ritual practices after winning their way to the mythical as thucydides says won their way into literature and meet us in the odes of pindar the plays of Æschylus and sophocles the notes of commentators and the apologetic efforts of plutarch and porphyry it is with these antique stories that the mythologist is concerned but even here he need not loose his reverence for the nobler aspects of the gods of greece like the archaeologist and excavator he must touch with careful hand these       strange clouded fragments of the ancient glory      late lingerers of the company divine      for even in ruin of their marble limbs      they breathe of that far world wherefrom they came      of liquid light and harmonies serene      lost halls of heaven and far olympian air  homer and hesiod named the gods for the greeks so herodotus thought and constructed the divine genealogies though the gods were infinitely older than homer though a few of them probably date from before the separation of the indoaryan and hellenic stocks it is certain that homer and hesiod stereotyped to some extent the opinions about the deities which were current in their time        ernest myers hermes in the judgment of prometheus        as a proof of the prehomeric antiquity of zeus it has      often been noticed that homer makes achilles pray to zeus of      dodona the zeus according to thrasybulus who aided      deucalion after the deluge as the pelasgian zeus iliad      xvi 233 pelasgian may be regarded as equivalent to       prehistoric greek  sophocles trach 65 see scholiast      still speaks of the selli the priests of dodonean zeus as      mountaindwelling and couching on the earth  they      retained it seems very primitive habits be it observed      that achilles has been praying for confusion and ruin to the      achaeans and so invokes the deity of an older perhaps      hostile race probably the oakoracle at dodona the      message given by the sound of a going in the treetops or      by the doves was even more ancient than zeus who on that      theory fell heir to the rites of a peasant oracle connected      with treeworship zeus according to hesiod dwelt in the      trunk of the oak tree cited by preller i 98 much as an      indian forestgod dwells in the peepul or any other tree it      is rather curious that according to eustathius iliad      xvi 233 pelargicus connected with storks was      sometimes written for pelasgicus that there was a dodona in      thessaly and that storks were sacred to the thessalians  hesiod codified certain priestly and delphian theories about their origin and genealogies homer minutely described their politics and society his description however must inevitably have tended to develop a later scepticism while men lived in city states under heroic kings acknowledging more or less the common sway of one king at argos or mycenæ it was natural that the gods whether in the dark backward of time greece knew a moral creative being or not should be conceived as dwelling in a similar society with zeus for their agamemnon a ruler supreme but not absolute not safe from attempts at resistance and rebellion but when greek politics and society developed into a crowd of republics with nothing answering to a certain imperial sway then men must have perceived that the old divine order was a mere survival from the time when human society was similarly ordained thus xenophanes very early proclaimed that men had made the gods in their own likeness as a horse could he draw would design his deity in equine semblance but the detection by xenophanes of the anthropomorphic tendency in religion could not account for the instinct which made greeks like other peoples as aristotle noticed figure their gods not only in human shape but in the guise of the lower animals for that zoomorphic element in myth an explanation as before will be sought in the early mental condition which takes no great distinction between man and the beasts the same method will explain in many cases the other peculiarly unhellenic elements in greek divine myth yet here too allowance must be made for the actual borrowing of rites and legends from contiguous peoples  the greeks were an assimilative race the alphabet of their art they obtained as they obtained their written alphabet from the kingdoms of the east like the romans they readily recognised their own gods even under the barbarous and brutal disguises of egyptian popular religion and while recognising their god under an alien shape they may have taken over legends alien to their own national character again we must allow as in india for myths which are really late the inventions perhaps of priests or oraclemongers but in making these deductions we must remember that the later myths would be moulded in many cases on the ancient models these ancient models there is reason to suppose were often themselves of the irrational and savage character which has so frequently been illustrated from the traditions of the lower races  the elder dynasties of greek gods uranus and cronos with their adventures and their fall have already been

the samoyed num deposed by cronus originally perhaps one of the deputygods active where their chief is otiose whom we find in barbaric theology but this is mere guesswork we may now turn to the deity who was the acknowledged sovereign of the greek olympus during all the classical period from the date of homer and hesiod to the establishment of christianity we have to consider the legend of zeus  it is necessary first to remind the reader that all the legends in the epic poems date after the time when an official and national olympus had been arranged probably many tribal gods who had originally no connection with gods of other tribes had by homers age thus accepted places and relationships in the olympic family even rude lowborn pelasgian deities may have been adopted into the highest circles and fitted out with a divine pedigree in perfect order  to return to zeus his birth whether as the eldest or the youngest of the children of cronus has already been studied now we have to deal with his exploits and his character  about the meaning of the name of zeus the philologists seem more than commonly harmonious they regard the greek zeus as the equivalent of the sanskrit dyaus the bright one a term for the sky        max müller selected essays ii 419 preller gr      myth i 92  he was especially worshipped on hilltops like the aztec raingod for example on ithome parnes cithgeron and the lycaean hill of arcadia on the arcadian mountain a centre of the strangest and oldest rites the priest of zeus acted as what the african races call a rainmaker there was on the hill the sacred well of the nymph hagno one of the nurses of the child zeus in time of drought the priest of zeus offered sacrifice and prayer to the water according to ritual law and it would be interesting to know what it was that he sacrificed he then gently stirred the well with a bough from the oak the holy tree of the god and when the water was stirred a cloud arose like mist which attracted other clouds and caused rain as the priest on a mountain practically occupied a meteorological observatory he probably did not perform these rites till he knew that a depression might be expected from one quarter or another        see similar examples of popular magic in gervase of      tilbury otia imperiidia liebrecht ii 146   the citation      is due to freller i 102  wonderful feats of rainprophecy are done by australian seers according to mrs langloh parker and others as soon as we meet zeus in homer we find that he is looked on not as the sky but as the deity who dwells in the heights of air and who exercises supreme sway over all things including storm and wind and cloud he casts the lightning forth  he thunders on high  he has dark clouds for his covering  all these imposing aspects he is religiously regarded by people who approach him in prayer these aspects would be readily explained by the theory that zeus after having been the personal sky came to be thought a powerful being who dwelt in the sky if we did not find such beings worshipped where the sky is not yet adored as in australia much the same occurred if as m maspero points out in egypt the animals were worshipped first and then later the gods supposed to be present in the animals so the sky a personal sky was first adored later a god dwelling in the sky but it is less easy to show how this important change in opinion took place if it really occurred a philological theory of the causes which produced the change is set forth by mr keary in his book primitive belief in his opinion the sky was first worshipped as a vast nonpersonal phenomenon the bright thingdyaus but to adopt the language of mr max müller who appears to hold the same views dyaus ceased to be an expressive predicate it became a traditional name it lost its radical meaning thus where a man had originally said it thunders or rather he thunders he came to say dyaus that is the sky thunders        select essays ii 419  next dyaus or rather the greek form zeus almost lost its meaning of the sky and the true sense being partially obscured became a name supposed to indicate a person lastly the expression became zeus thunders zeus being regarded as a person because the old meaning of his name the sky was forgotten or almost forgotten the nomen name has become a numen god as mr keary puts it the god stands out as clear and thinkable in virtue of this name as any living friend can be the whole doctrine resolves itself into this a phenomenon originally according to the theory considered impersonal came to be looked on as personal because a word survived in colloquial expressions after it had lost or all but lost its original meaning as a result all the changes and processes of the impersonal sky came to be spoken of as personal actions performed by a personal being zeus the record of these atmospheric processes on this theory is the legend of zeus whatever is irrational and abominable in the conduct of the god is explained as originally a simple statement of meteorological phenomena zeus weds his mother that must mean the rain descends on the earth from which it previously arose in vapour zeus weds his daughter that is the rain falls on the crop which grew up from the rainy embrace of sky and earth  here then we have the philological theory of the personality and conduct of zeus to ourselves and those who have followed us the system will appear to reverse the known conditions of the working of the human mind among early peoples on the philological theory man first regards phenomena in our modern way as impersonal he then gives them personality as the result of a disease of language of a forgetfulness of the sense of words thus mr keary writes the idea of personality as apart from matter must have been growing more distinct when men could attribute personality to such an abstract phenomenon as the sky  where is the distinctness in a conception which produces such confusion we have seen that as the idea of personality becomes more distinct the range of its application becomes narrower not wider the savage it has been thought attributes personality to everything without exception as the idea of personality grows more distinct it necessarily becomes less extensive till we withdraw it from all but intelligent human beings thus we must look for some other explanation of the personality of zeus supposing his name to mean the sky this explanation we find in a survival of the savage mental habit of regarding all phenomena even the most abstract as persons our theory will receive confirmation from the character of the personality of zeus in his myth not only is he a person but in myth as distinct from religion he is a very savage person with all the powers of the medicineman and all the passions of the barbarian why should this be so on the philological theory when we examine the legend of zeus we shall see which explanation best meets the difficulties of the problem but the reader must again be reminded that the zeus of myth in homer and elsewhere is a very different being from the zeus of religion of achilless prayer from the zeus whom the athenians implored to rain on their fields and from the zeus who was the supreme being of the tragedians of the philosophers and of later greece  the early career la jeunesse orageuse of zeus has been studied already the child of cronus and rhea countless places asserted their claim to be the scene of his birth though the cretan claim was most popular        hesiod theog 468 paus iv 33 2  in crete too was the grave of zeus a scandal to pious heathendom the euhemerists made this tomb a proof that zeus was a deified man preller takes it for an allegory of winter and the death of the god of storm who in winter is especially active zeus narrowly escaped being swallowed by his father and after expelling and mediatising that deity he changed his own wife metis into a fly swallowed her and was delivered out of his own head of athene of whom his wife had been pregnant he now became ruler of the world with his brother poseidon for viceroy so to speak of the waters and his brother hades for lord of the world of the dead like the earlier years of louis xiv the earlier centuries of the existence of zeus were given up to a series of amours by which he like charles ii became the father of many noble families his legitimate wife was his sister hera whom he seduced before wedlock without the knowledge of their dear parents says homer who neglects the myth that one of the dear parents ate his own progeny like him who makes his generation messes to gorge his appetite hera was a jealous wife and with good cause the christian fathers calculated that he sowed his wild oats and persecuted mortal women with his affections through seventeen generations of men his amours with his mother and daughters with deo and persephone are the great scandals of clemens alexandrinus and arnobius zeus seldom made love in propria persona in all his meteorological pomp when he thus gratified semele she was burned to a cinder        it is probable that this myth of the seduction of hera

openly yet another myth      iliad xiv 295 scholiast accounts for the hatred which      zeus displayed to prometheus by the fable that before her      wedding with zeus hera became the mother of

certain repulsive performances with serpents in the      mysteries are additional testimony        apollodorus iii 4 3   the amour with danae when zeus became a shower of gold might be interpreted as a myth of the yellow sunshine the amours of zeus under the disguise of various animal forms were much more usual and are familiar to all as cronus when in love metamorphosed himself into a stallion as prajapati pursued his own daughter in the shape of a roebuck so zeus became a serpent a bull a swan an eagle a dove and to woo the daughter of cletor an ant similar disguises are adopted by the sorcerers among the algonkins for similar purposes when pundjel in the australian myth of the pleiades was in love with a native girl he changed himself into one of those grubs in the bark of trees which the blacks think edible and succeeded as well as zeus did when he became an ant        the mythologists as a rule like the heathen opponents of      arnobius clemens and eusebius explain the amours of zeus      as allegories of the fruitful union of heaven and earth of      rain and grain preller also allows for the effects of human      vanity noble families insisting on tracing

avatar of zeus would be an example of the process of gravitation or attraction whereby a great mythical name and personality attracts to itself floating fables the remark of clemens on this last extraordinary intrigue is suggestive the thessalians he says are reputed to worship ants because zeus took the semblance of an ant when he made the daughter of cletor mother of myrmidon where people worship any animal from whom they claim descent in this case through myrmidon the ancestor of the famed myrmidons we have an example of stiraight forward totemism to account for the adoration of the animal on the hypothesis that it was the incarnation of a god is the device which has been observed in egyptian as in samoan religion and in that of aboriginal indian tribes whose animal gods become saints when the brahmans get a turn at them  the most natural way of explaining such tales about the amours and animal metamorphoses of so great a god is to suggest that zeus inherited as it were legends of a lower character long current among separate families and in different localities in the same way where a stone had been worshipped the stone was in at least one instance dubbed with the name of zeus        clemens p 84        see mr h h risley on primitive marriage in bengal      in astatic quarterly review june 1886        in pausaniass opinion cecrops first introduced the

establishment of a higher faith in a national deity these traditions it is presumed would not wholly disappear but would be absorbed into the local legend of the god the various beasts would become sacred to him as the sheep was sacred to hera in samos according to mandrobulus and images of the animals would congregate in his temple the amours of zeus then are probably traceable to the common habit of deriving noble descents from a god and in the genealogical narrative older totemistic and other local myths found a place apart from his intrigues the youth of zeus was like that of some masquerading and wandering king such as james v in scotland though plato in the republic is unwilling that the young should be taught how the gods go about disguised as strangers this was their conduct in the myths thus we read of       lycaon and his fifty sons whom zeus      in their own house spied on and unawares      watching at hand from his disguise arose      and overset the table where they sat      around their impious feast and slew them all  clemens of alexandria contrasts the human festival of zeus among the ethiopians with the inhuman banquet offered to him by lycaon in

sacrifice has already been alluded to and it is confirmed by the superstition that whoever tasted the human portion in the mess sacrificed to zeus became a werewolf resuming his original shape if for ten years he abstained from the flesh of men  a very quaint story of the domestic troubles of zeus was current in plataea where it was related at the festival named dædala it was said that hera indignant at the amours of her lord retired to euboæ zeus wishing to be reconciled to her sought the advice of cithæron at that time king of platæa by his counsel the god celebrated a sham marriage with a wooden image dressed up to personate plataea daughter of asopus hera flew to the scene and tore the bridal veil when discovering the trick she laughed and was reconciled to her husband probably this legend was told to explain some incident of ritual or custom in the feast of the dædala and it is certainly a more innocent myth than most that were commemorated in local mysteryplays        the wolves connected with the worship of zeus like his      rams goats and other animals are commonly explained as      mythical names for elemental phenomena clouds and storms      thus the rams fleece  used in certain expiatory      rites hesych s v lobeck p 183 is presumed by      preller to be a symbol of the cloud in the same way his      regis or goatskin is the stormwind or the thundercloud

is set forth by decharme mythologie de la      grece antique paris 1879 p 16 for the stormwolf      see preller i 101 it seems a little curious that the      wolf which on the solar hypothesis was a brilliant beast      connected with the worship of the sungod apollo lycaeus      becomes a cloud or stormwolf when connected with zeus on      the whole subject of the use of the skins of animals as      clothing of the god or the ministrant see lobeck      aglaoph pp 188186 and robertson smith op cit        paus ix 3 1  it was not only when he was en bonne fortune that zeus adopted the guise of a bird or beast in the very ancient temple of hera near mycenae there was a great statue of the goddess of gold and ivory the work of polycletus and therefore comparatively modern in one hand the goddess held a pomegranate in the other a sceptre on which was perched a cuckoo like the latin woodpecker picus on his wooden post about the pomegranate there was a myth which pausanias declines to tell but he does record the myth of the cuckoo they say that when zeus loved the yet virgin hera he changed himself into a cuckoo which she pursued and caught to be her playmate pausanias admits that he did not believe this legend probably it was invented to account for the companionship of the cuckoo which like the cow was one of the sacred animals of hera myths of this class are probably later than the period in which we presume the divine relationships of gods and animals to have passed out of the totemistic into the samoan condition of belief the more general explanation is that the cuckoo as a symbol of the vernal season represents the heaven in its wooing of the earth on the whole as we have tried to show the symbolic element in myth is late and was meant to be explanatory of rites and usages whose original significance was forgotten it would be unfair to assume that a god was disrespectfully viewed by his earliest worshippers because ætiological genealogical and other myths crystallised into his legend  an extremely wild legend of zeus was current among the galatæ where pausanias expressly calls it a local myth differing from the lydian variant zeus in his sleep became by the earth father of attes va being both male and female in his nature agdistis was the local name of this enigmatic character whom the gods feared and mutilated from the blood grew up as in so many myths an almond tree the daughter of sangarius nana placed some of the fruit in her bosom and thereby became pregnant like the girl in the kalewala by the berry or the mother of huitzilopochtli in mexico by the floating feather the same set of ideas recurs in grimms märchen machandelhoom if we may suppose that in an older form the juniper tree and its berries aided the miraculous birth it is customary to see in these wild myths a reflection of the phrygian religious tradition which leads up to the birth of atys who again is identified with adonis as a hero of the spring and the reviving year but the story has been introduced in this place as an example of the manner in which floating myths from all sources gravitate towards one great name and personality like that of zeus it would probably be erroneous to interpret these and many other myths in the vast legend of zeus as if they had originally and intentionally described the phenomena of the heavens they are more probably mere accretions round the figure of zeus conceived as a personal god a magnified nonnatural man         mrs hunts translation i 187         for parallels to this myth in chinese

m de charency writes after      quoting forms of the tale from all parts of the world      this resemblance between different shapes of the same      legend among nations separated by such expanses of land and      sea may be brought forward as an important proof of the      antiquity of the myth as well as of the distant date at      which it began to be diffused  another example of local accretion is the fable that zeus after carrying off ganymede to be his cupbearer made atonement to the royal family of troy by the present of a vine of gold fashioned by hephaestus the whole of the myth of callisto again whom zeus loved and who bore areas and later was changed into a bear and again into a star is clearly of local arcadian origin if the arcadians in very remote times traced their descent from a shebear and if they also like other races recognised a bear in the constellation they would naturally mix up those fables later with the legend of the allpowerful zeus        scholia on

pausaniaa i      25 1 viii 35 7  so far we have studied some of the details in the legend of zeus which did not conspicuously win their way into the national literature the object has been to notice a few of the myths which appear the most ancient and the most truly native and original these are the traditions preserved in mysteryplays tribal genealogies and temple legends the traditions surviving from the far off period of the village greeks it has already been argued in conformity with the opinion of c o müller that these myths are most antique and thoroughly local any attempt to explain these myths in order such for instance as we now find them in the collection of apollodorus as a system of thought and knowledge must prove a fruitless task equally useless is it to account for them all as stories originally told to describe consciously or unconsciously or to explain any atmospheric and meteorological phenomena zeus is the bright sky granted but the men who told how he became an ant or a cuckoo or celebrated a sham wedding with a wooden image or offered troy a golden vine the work of hephaestus like other articles of jewellery were not thinking of the bright sky when they repeated the story they were merely strengthening some ancient family or tribal tradition by attaching it to the name of a great powerful personal being an immortal this being not the elemental force that was zeus not the power making for righteousness that is zeus not the pure spiritual ruler of the world the zeus of philosophy is the hero of the myths that have been investigated  in the tales that actually won their way into national literature beginning with homer there is observable the singular tendency to combine in one figure the highest religious ideas with the fables of a capricious and often unjust and lustful supernatural being taking the myths first their contrast with the religious conception of zeus will be the more remarkable  zeus is the king of all gods and father of some but he cannot keep his subjects and family always in order in the first book of the iliad achilles reminds his mother the seanymph thetis how she once rescued the son of cronus lord of the stormclouds from shameful wreck when all other olympians would have bound him even hera and poseidon and pallas athene  thetis brought the hundredhanded briareus to the help of the outnumbered and overmastered zeus then zeus according to the scholiast hung hera out of heaven in chains and gave apollo and poseidon for slaves to laomedon king of troy so lively was the recollection of this coup detat in olympus that hephaestus implores hera his mother in homer not to anger zeus lest i behold thee that art so dear chastised before mine eyes and then shall i not be able to save thee for all my sorrow he then reminds hera how zeus once tossed him out of heaven as the master of life tossed ataentsic in the iroquois myth and how he fell in lemnos and little life was left in me the passage is often interpreted as if the fall of hephaestus the firegod were a myth of lightning but in homer assuredly the incident has become thoroughly personal and is told with much humour the offence of hera was the raising of a magic storm which she could do as well as any lapland witch and the wrecking of heracles on cos for this she was chained and hung out of heaven as on the occasion already described        iliad i 587        ibid   590    scholia   xiv   255     the   myth      is   derived   from pherecydes  the constant bickerings between hera and zeus in the iliad are merely the reflection in the upper olympian world of the wars and jealousies of men below ilios is at war with argos and mycenae therefore the chief protecting gods of each city take part in the strife this conception is connected with the heroic genealogies noble and royal families as in most countries feigned a descent from the gods it followed that zeus was a partisan of his children that is of the royal houses in the towns where he was the most favoured deity thus hera when she sided with mycenæ had a double cause of anger and there is an easy answer to the question quo numine læso she had her own townsmens quarrel to abet and she had her jealousy to incite her the more for to become father of the human families zeus must have been faithless to her indeed in a passage possibly interpolated of the fourteenth iliad he acts as his own leporello and recites the list of his conquests the perseidæ the heraclidæ the pirithoidæ with dionysus apollo and artemis spring from the amours there recounted moved by such passions hera urges on the ruin of troy and zeus accuses her of a cannibal hatred perchance wert thou to enter within the gates and long walls and devour priam raw and priams sons and all the trojans then mightest thou assuage thine anger that great stumblingblock of greek piety the battle in which the gods take part was explained as a physical allegory by the neoplatonists it is in reality only a refraction of the wars of men a battle produced among the heavenly folk by mens battles as the earthly imitations of rain in the vedic ritual beget rain from the firmament the favouritism which zeus throughout shows to athene is explained by that rude and ancient myth of her birth from his brain after he had swallowed her pregnant mother        pherecydes is the authority

far beneath hades as heaven is high above earth here the supremacy of zeus is attested and he proposes to prove it by the sport called the tug of war he says fasten ye a chain of gold from heaven and all ye gods lay hold thereof and all goddesses yet could ye not drag from heaven to earth zeus the supreme counsellor not though ye strove sore but if once i were minded to drag with all my heart then i could hang gods and earth and sea to a pinnacle of olympus the supremacy claimed here on the score of strength by so much i am beyond gods and men is elsewhere based on primogeniture though in hesiod zeus is the youngest of the sons of cronos but there is as usual in myth no consistent view and zeus cannot be called omnipotent not only is he subject to fate but his son heracles would have perished when he went to seek the hound of hell but for the aid of athene gratitude for his relief does not prevent zeus from threatening athene as well as hera with tartarus when they would thwart him in the interest of the achæans hera is therefore obliged to subdue him by the aid of love and sleep in that famous and beautiful passage which is so frankly anthropomorphic and was such a scandal to religious minds        iliad viii ad init        m decharme regards this challenge to the tug of war as a      very noble and sublime assertion of supreme sovereignty      myth de la greece p 19

in that remote age homer has left us no doubt in eumæus the swineherd of odysseus a man of noble birth stolen into slavery when a child homer has left a picture of true religion and undefiled eumæus attributes everything that occurs to the will of the gods with the resignation of a child of islam or a scot of the solemn league and covenant from zeus are all strangers and beggars he says and believes that hospitality and charity are well pleasing in the sight of the olympian when he flourishes it is god that increaseth this work of mine whereat i abide he neither says zeus nor the gods but in this passage simply god verily the blessed gods love not froward deeds but they reverence justice and the righteous acts of men yet it is zeus that granteth a prey to the searobbers it is the gods that rear telemachus like a young sapling yet is it the gods who mar his wits within him when he sets forth on a perilous adventure it is to zeus cronion that the swineherd chiefly prays but he

only sets aside a seventh portion for hermes and the nymphs who haunt the lonely uplands yet his offering has no magical intent of constraining the immortals one thing god will give and another withhold even as he will for with him all things are possible  such is a homeric ideal of piety and it would only gain force from contrast with the blasphemy of aias who said that in the gods despite he had escaped the great deep of the sea         ibid xiv 435        ibid 444 445        ibid iv 504  the epics sufficiently prove that a noble religion may coexist with a wild and lawless mythology that ancient sentiment of the human heart which makes men listen to a human voice in the thunder and yearn for immortal friends and helpers lives its life little disturbed by the other impulse which inspires men when they come to tell stories and romances about the same transcendent beings  as to the actual original form of the faith in zeus we can only make guesses to some it will appear that zeus was originally the clear bright expanse which was taken for an image or symbol of the infinite others will regard zeus as the bright sky but the bright sky conceived of in savage fashion as a being with human parts and passions a being with all the magical accomplishments of metamorphosis rainmaking and the rest with which the medicineman is credited a third set of mythologists remembering how gods and medicinemen have often interchangeable names and how for example the australian biraark who is thought to command the west wind is himself styled west wind will derive zeus from the ghost of some ancestral sorcerer named sky this euhemerism seems an exceedingly inadequate explanation of the origin of zeus in his moral aspect zeus again inherits the quality of that supernatural and moral watcher of mans deeds who is recognised as we have seen even by the most backward races and who for all we can tell is older than any beastgod or god of the natural elements thus whatever zeus was in his earliest origin he had become by the time we can study him in ritual poem or sacred chapter a complex of qualities and attributes spiritual moral elemental animal and human  it is curious that on our theory the mythical zeus must have morally degenerated at a certain period as the zeus of religion more and more approached the rank of a pure and almost supreme deity on our hypothesis it was while greece was reaching a general national consciousness and becoming more than an aggregate of small local tribes that zeus attracted the worst elements of his myth in deposing or relegating to a lower rank a crowd of totems and fetishes and ancestral ghosts he inherited the legends of their exploits these were attached to him still more by the love of genealogies derived from the gods for each such pedigree an amour was inevitably invented and where totems had existed the god in this amour borrowed the old bestial form for example if a thessalian stock had believed in descent from an ant and wished to trace their pedigree to zeus they had merely to say zeus was that ant once more as zeus became supreme among the other deities of men in the patriarchal family condition those gods were grouped round him as members of his family his father mother brothers sisters wife mistresses and children here was a noble field in which the mythical fancy might run riot hence came stories of usurpations rebellions conjugal skirmishes and jealousies a whole world of incidents in which humour had free play nor would foreign influences be wanting a wandering greek recognising his zeus in a deity of phoenicia or babylon might bring home some alien myth which would take its place in the general legend with other myths imported along with foreign objects of art silver bowls and inlaid swords thus in all probability grew the legend of the zeus of myth certainly a deplorable legend while all the time the greek intellect was purifying itself and approaching the poetical moral and philosophical conception of the zeus of religion at last in the minds of the philosophically religious zeus became pure deity and the details of the legend were explained away by this or that system of allegory while in the minds of the sceptical zeus yielded his throne to the vortex of the aristophanic comedy thus zeus may have begun as a kindly supreme being then ætiological and totemistic myths may have accrued to his legend and finally philosophic and pious thought introduced a rational conception of his nature but myth lived on ritual lived on and human victims were slain on the altars of zeus till christianity was the established religion solet it be says pausanias as it hath been from the beginning  the gods who fill the court of zeus and surround his throne are so numerous that a complete account of each would exceed the limits of our space the legend of zeus is typical on the whole of the manner in which the several mythical chapters grew about the figures of each of the deities some of these were originally it is probable natural forces or elemental phenomena conceived of at first as personal beings while later the personal earth or sun shaded off into the informing genius of the sun or earth and still later was almost freed from all connection with the primal elemental phenomenon or force in these processes of evolution it seems to have happened occasionally that the god shed like a shell or chrysalis his original form which continued to exist however as a deity of older family and inferior power by such processes at least it would not be difficult to explain the obvious fact that several gods have understudies of their parts in the divine comedy it may be well to begin a review of the gods by examining those who were or may be supposed to have been originally forces or phenomena of nature     apollo  this claim has been made for almost all the olympians but in some cases appears more plausible than in others for example apollo is regarded as a solar divinity and the modes in which he attained his detached and independent position as a brilliant anthropomorphic deity patron of art the lover of the nymphs the inspirer of prophecy may have been something in this fashion first the sun may have been regarded in the manner familiar to savage races as a personal being in homer he is still the god who sees and hears all things and who beholds and reveals the loves of ares and aphrodite this personal character of the sun is well illustrated in the homeric hymn to hyperion the sun that dwells on high where as mr max müller says the words would seem to imply that the poet looked upon helios as a halfgod almost as a hero who had once lived upon earth it has already been shown that this mythical theory of the origin of the sun is met with among the aztecs and the bushmen in homer the sun helios hyperion though he sees and hears all things needs to be informed by one of the nymphs that the companions of odysseus have devoured his sacred cattle in the same way the supreme baiame of australia needs to ask questions of mortals apollo then speaks in the olympian assembly and threatens that if he is not avenged he will go down to hades and shine among the dead the sun is capable of marriage as in the bulgarian volkslied where he marries a peasant girl and by perse he is the father of circe and Æetes

the sun sails over ocean in a golden cup or bowl then helios hyperionides went down into his golden cup to cross oceanstream and come to the deeps of dark and sacred night to his mother and his wedded wife and his children dear this belief in more barbaric shape still survives in the greek islands the sun is still to them a giant like hyperion bloodthirsty when tinged with gold the common saying is that the sun when he seeks his kingdom expects to find forty loaves prepared for him by his mother woe to her if the loaves be not ready the sun eats his brothers sisters father and mother in his wrath a wellknown amour of helios was his intrigue with rhode by whom he had phaethon and his sisters the tragedians told how phaethon drove the chariot of the sun and upset it while his sisters were turned into poplar trees and their tears became amber        bents cyclades p 57        stesichorus poetæ lyrici græci pomtow vol i p      148 qf also mimnermus op citi 78        odyssey xvii 208 scholiast the story is ridiculed      by lucian de electro  such were the myths about the personal sun the hero or demigod helios hyperion if we are to believe that apollo also is a solar deity it appears probable that he is a more advanced conception not of the sun as a person but of a being who represents the sun in the spiritual world and who exercises by an act of will the same influence as the actual sun possesses by virtue of his rays thus he brings pestilence on the achæans in the first book of the iliad and his viewless shafts slay men suddenly as sunstroke does it is a pretty coincidence that a german scholar otfried müller who had always opposed apollos claim to be a sungod was killed by a sunstroke at delphi the god avenged himself in his ancient home but if this deity was once merely the sun it may be said in the beautiful phrase of paul de st victor pareil a une statue qui surgit des flammes de son moule apollo se degage vite du soleil he becomes a god of manifold functions and attributes and it is necessary to exercise extreme caution in explaining any one myth of his legend as originally a myth of the sun phoibos certainly means the brilliant or shining it is

purified of the guilt of the slaying a ceremony unknown to homer at tempe according to the myth the python was a snake which forbade access to the chasm whence rose the mysterious fumes of divination apollo slew the snake and usurped the oracle his murder of the serpent was more or less resented by the delphians of the time        i ix 10 4        plutarch depa el delph 9        roscher op cit p

connected with the fable of the birth of the monster typhoeus son of hera without a father the homeric hymn derives pythius the name of the god from  rot the disdainful speech of apollo to the dead monster for there the pest rotted away beneath the beams of the sun the derivation is a volksetymologie it is not clear whether the poet connected in his mind the sun and the god the local legend of the dragonslaying was kept alive in mens minds at delphi by a mysteryplay in which the encounter was represented in action in one version of the myth the slavery of apollo in the house of admetus was an expiation of the dragons death through many of the versions runs the idea that the slaying of the serpent was a deed which required purification and almost apology if the serpent was really the deity of an elder faith this would be intelligible or if he had kinsfolk a serpenttribe in the district we could understand it apollos next act was to open a new spring of water as the local nymph was hostile and grudged him her own this was an inexplicable deed in a sun god whose business it is to dry up rather than to open watersprings he gave oracles out of the laurel of delphi as zeus out of the oaks of dodona presently apollo changed himself into a huge dolphin and in this guise approached a ship of the cretan mariners he guided in his dolphin shape the vessel to crisa the port of delphi

beasts and men are mixed in archaic fashion it is open to students to regard the dolphin as only one of the many animals whose earlier worship is concentrated in apollo or to take the creature for the symbol of spring when seafaring becomes easier to mortals or to interpret the dolphin as the result of a volksetymologie in which the name delphi meaning originally a hollow in the hills was connected with delphis the dolphin  on the whole it seems impossible to get a clear view of apollo as a sungod from a legend built out of so many varied materials of different dates as the myth of the slaying of the python and the founding of the delphic oracle nor does the tale of the birth of the godles enfances apollonyield much more certain information the most accessible and the oldest form of the birthmyth is preserved in the homeric hymn to the delian apollo a hymn intended for recital at the delian festival of the ionian people  the hymn begins without any account of the amours of zeus and leto it is merely said that many lands refused to allow leto a place wherein to bring forth her offspring but barren delos listened to her prayer and for nine days leto was in labour surrounded by all the goddesses save jealous hera and eilithyia who presides over childbirth to her iris went with the promise of a golden necklet set with amber studs and eilithyia came down to the isle and leto grasping the trunk of a palm tree brought forth apollo and artemis  such is the narrative of the hymn in which some interpreters such as m decharme find a rich allegory of the birth of light leto is regarded as night or darkness though it is now admitted that this meaning cannot be found in the etymology of her name        roscher lexikon preller i 208 schol ad lycophr v      208        compare theognis 510        preller i 190 note 4 curtius gr Æ 120  m decharme presumes that the palm tree  originally meant the morning red by aid of which night gives birth to the sun and if the poet says the young god loves the mountain tops why so does the star of day the moon however does not usually arise simultaneously with the dawn as artemis was born with apollo it is vain in fact to look for minute touches of solar myth in the tale which rests on the womanly jealousy of hera and explains the existence of a great fane and feast of apollo not in one of the rich countries that refused his mother sanctuary but in a small barren and remote island  among the wilder myths which grouped themselves round the figure of apollo was the fable that his mother leto was changed into a wolf the fable ran that leto in the shape of a wolf came in twelve days from the hyperboreans to delos this may be explained as a volksetymologie from the gods name lycegenes which is generally held to mean born of light but the presence of very many animals in the apollo legend and in his temples corresponding as it does to similar facts already observed in the religion of the lower races can scarcely be due to popular etymologies alone the dolphinapollo has already been remarked        the french excavators in delos found the original unhewn      stone on which in later days the statue of the

lyceum of apollo lukios wolfapollo which tradition connected with the primeval strife wherein Ægeus goatman defeated lukios wolfman the lukian apollo was the deity of the defeated side as athene of the Ægis goatskin was the deity of the victors the argives had an apollo of the same kind and the wolf was stamped on their coins according to pausanias when danaus came seeking the kingship of argos the people hesitated between him and gelanor while they were in doubt a wolf attacked a bull and the argives determined that the bull should stand for gelanor the wolf for danaus the wolf won danaus was made king and in gratitude raised an altar to apollo lukios wolfapollo that is as friends of the totemic system would argue a man of the wolfstock dedicated a shrine to the wolfgod in delphi the presence of a bronze image of a wolf was explained by the story that a wolf once revealed the place where stolen temple treasures were concealed the gods beast looked after the gods interest in many myths the children of apollo by mortal girls were exposed but fostered by wolves in direct contradiction with pausanias but in accordance with a common rule of mythical interpretation sophocles calls

happened that when animals were found closely connected with a god the ancients explained the fact indifferently by calling the deity the protector or the destroyer of the beasts in question thus in the case of apollo mice were held sacred and were fed in his temples in the troad and elsewhere the people of hamaxitus especially worshipping mice the gods name smintheus was understood to mean apollo of the mouse or mouseapollo  but while apollo was thus at some places regarded as the patron of mice other narratives declared that he was adored as sminthian because from mice he had freed the country this would be a perfectly natural explanation if the vermin which had once been sacred became a pest in the eyes of later generations  flies were in this manner connected with the services of apollo it has already been remarked that an ox was sacrificed to flies near the temple of apollo in leucas the sacrifice was explained as a device for inducing flies to settle in one spot and leave the rest of the coast clear this was an expensive and would prove a futile arrangement there was a statue of the locustapollo parnopios in athena the story ran that it was dedicated after the god had

interesting view of the way in which pious heathens of a late age regarded apollos menagerie may be got from plutarchs essay on the delphic responses it is the description of a visit to delphi in the hall of the corinthians the writer and his friends examine the sacred palm tree of bronze and the snakes and frogs in relief round the root of the tree why said they the palm tree is not a marsh plant and frogs are not a corinthian crest and indeed one would think ravens and swans and hawks and wolves and anything else than these reptiles would be agreeable to the god then one of the visitors serapion very learnedly showed that apollo was the sun and that the sun arises from water still slipping into the story your lightings up and your exhalations cried plutarch and chaffed him as one might chaff kuhn or schwartz or decharme about his elemental interpretations in fact the classical writers knew rather less than we do about the origin of many of their religious peculiarities  in connection with sheep again apollo was worshipped as the ram apollo at the festival of the carneia a ram was his victim these facts are commonly interpreted as significant of the gods care for shepherds and the pastoral life a memory of the days when apollo kept a mortals sheep and was the hind of admetus of thessaly he had animal names derived from sheep and goats such as maloeis tragios the tale which made apollo the serf and shepherd of mortal men is as old as the iliad and is not easy to interpret whether as a naturemyth or a local legend laomedon one of apollos masters not only refused him his wage but threatened to put him in chains and sell him to foreign folk across the sea and to crop his ears with the blade of bronze these legends may have brought some consolation to the hearts of free men enslaved a god had borne like calamities and could feel for their affliction        karneios from heyschius sv a ram        theocritus idyll v 8a        preller i 215 note 1

crows vultures all of which are by mythologists regarded as symbols of the sungod in one or other capacity or function in the iliad apollo puts on the gear of a hawk and flits on hawks wings down ida as the thlinkeet yehl does on the feathers of a crane or a raven        xv 287  the loves of apollo make up a long and romantic chapter in his legend they cannot all be so readily explained as are many of the loves of zeus by the desire to trace genealogical pedigrees to a god it is on this principle however that the birth of ion for example is to be interpreted the ideal eponymous hero of the ionian race was naturally feigned to be the son of the deity by whose fatherhood all ionians became brethren in apollo once more when a profession like that of medicine was in the hands of a clan conceiving themselves to be of one blood and when their common business was under the protection of apollo they inevitably traced their genealogy to the god thus the medical clan of the asclepiadæ of which aristotle was a member derived their origin from asclepius or as the romans called him Æsculapius  so far everything in this myth appears natural and rational granting the belief in the amours of an anthropomorphic god but the details of the story are full of that irrational element which is said to make mythology mythological in the third pythian ode pindar sings how apollo was the lover of coronis how she was faithless to him with a stranger pindar does not tell how the crow or the raven flew to apollo with the news and how the god cursed the crow which had previously been white that it should for ever be black then he called his sister artemis to slay the false nymph but snatched from her funeral pyre the babe asclepius his own begotten this myth which explains the colour of the crow as the result of an event and a divine curse is an example of the stage of thought already illustrated in the namaqua myth of heitsi eibib and the peculiarities which his curse attached to various animals there is also a bushman myth according to which certain blackbirds have white breasts because some women once tied pieces of white fat round their necks it is instructive to observe as the scholiast on pindar quotes artemon that pindar omits the incident of the crow as foolish and unworthy apollo according to the ode was himself aware in his omniscience of the frailty of coronis but hesiod a much earlier poet tells the story in the usual way with the curse of the crow and his consequent change of colour the whole story in its most ancient shape and with the omissions suggested by the piety of a later age is an excellent example of the irrational element in greek myth of its resemblance to savage myth and of the tendency of more advanced thought to veil or leave out features

apollo succeeds to the paternal honours of a totem the telmissians in lycia claimed descent from telmessus who was the child of an amour in which apollo assumed the form of a dog in this guise he lay

   june 1886  the other loves of apollo are numerous but it may be sufficient to have examined one such story in detail where the tale of the amour was not a necessary consequence of the genealogical tendency to connect clans with gods it was probably as roscher observes in the case of daphne an Ætiological myth many flowers and trees for example were nearly connected with the worship and ritual of apollo among these were notably the laurel cypress and hyacinth it is no longer possible to do more than conjecture why each of these plants was thus favoured though it is a plausible guess that the god attracted into his service various local treeworships and plantworships people would ask why the deity was associated with the flowers and boughs and the answer would be readily developed on the familiar lines of naturemyth the laurel is dear to the god because the laurel was once a girl whom he pursued with his love and who to escape his embraces became a tree the hyacinth and cypress were beautiful youths dear to apollo and accidentally slain by him in sport after their death they became flowers such myths of metamorphoses as has been shown are an universal growth of savage fancy and spring from the want of a sense of difference between men and things  the legend of apollo has only been slightly sketched but it is obvious that many elements from many quarters enter into the sum of his myths and rites if apollo was originally the sungod it is certain that his influence on human life and society was as wide and beneficent as that of the sun itself he presides over health and medicine and over purity of body and soul he is the god of song and the hexameter which first resounded in his temples uttered its latest word in the melancholy music of the last oracle from

any connection with the moon in the development of artemis may most clearly be distinguished says claus the progress of the human intellect from the early rude and as it were natural ideas to the fair and brilliant fancies of poets and sculptors        de dianæ antiguisstma apud græcos natura vratialaviæ      1881  there is no goddess more beautiful pure and maidenly in the poetry of greece there

present even if unseen with the pure of heart she is like miltons lady in the revel route of the comus and among the riot of olympian lovers she alone with athene satisfies the ascetic longing for a proud remoteness and reserve but though it is thus that the poets dream of her from the author of the odyssey to euripides yet the local traditions and cults of artemis in many widely separated districts combine her worship and her legend with hideous cruelties with almost cannibal rites with relics of the wild worship of the beasts whom in her character as the goddess of the chase she preserves rather than protects to her human victims are sacrificed for her bears deer doves wolves all the tameless herds of the hills and forests are driven through the fire in achaea she is adored with beardances by the attic girls there is a gloomy chthonian or sepulchral element in her worship and she is even blended in ritual with a monstrous manybreasted divinity of oriental religion perhaps it is scarcely possible to separate now all the tangled skeins in the mixed conception of artemis or to lay the finger on the germinal conception of her nature dark says schreiber is the

examines the names dione diana concluding that artemis dione and diana are essentially one and that diana is the feminine of janus djanus corresponding to the greek as to the etymology of artemis curtis wisely professes himself uncertain a crowd of hypotheses have been framed by more sanguine and less cautious etymologists artemis has been derived from safe unharmed the stainless maiden  goebel3 suggests the root arpar or par to shake and makes artemis mean the thrower of the dart or the shooter but this is confessedly conjectural the persian language has also been searched for the root of artemis which is compared with the first syllables in artaphernes artaxerxes artaxata and so forth it is concluded that artemis would simply mean the great goddess  claus again returning to

to deduce all the many properties myths and attributes of artemis from lunar aspects and attributes the smallest grain of ingenuity will always suffice as the essential element in this mythological alchemy this transmutation of the facts of legend into so many presumed statements about any given natural force or phenomenon  from all these general theories and vague hypotheses it is time to descend to facts and to the various local or tribal cults and myths of artemis her place in the artistic poetry which wrought on and purified those tales will then be considered this process is the converse of the method for example of m decharme he first accepts the queen and huntress chaste and fair of poetry and then explains her local myths and rituals as accidental corruptions of and foreign additions to that ideal  the attic and arcadian legends of artemis are confessedly among the oldest        welcker oriechische gotterlehre i 561 gottingen 1867      preller i 239        roscher lexikon 580  both in arcadia and attica the goddess is strangely connected with that animal worship and those tales of bestial metamorphosis which are the characteristic elements of myths and beliefs among the most backward races  the arcadian myth of artemis and the shebear is variously narrated according to pausanias lycaon king of arcadia had a daughter callisto who was loved by zeus hera in jealous wrath changed callisto into a shebear and artemis to please hera shot the beast at this time the shebear was pregnant with a child by zeus who sent hermes to save the babe areas just as dionysus was saved at the burning of semele and asclepius at the death of his mother whom apollo slew zeus then transformed callisto into a constellation the bear no more straightforward myth of descent from a beast for the arcadians claimed descent from areas the shebears son and of starry or bestial metamorphosis was ever told by cahrocs or kamilaroi another story ran that artemis herself in anger at the unchastity of callisto caused her to become a bear so the legend ran in a hesiodic poem according to the extract in eratosthenes        paus viii 3 5        o müller engl transl p 15 catast i apollodor      iii 82 hyginus 176 177 a number of less important      references are given in bachofens der bar in den religionen      des alterthums  such is the ancient myth which otfried müller endeavours to explain by the light of his lucid common sense without the assistance which we can now derive from anthropological research the nymph callisto in his opinion is a mere refraction from artemis herself under her arcadian and poetic name of calliste the most beautiful hard by the tumulus known as the grave of callisto was a shrine pausanias tells us of artemis calliste pamphos he adds was the first poet known to him who praised artemis by this title and he learned it from the arcadians müller next remarks on the attributes of artemis in athens the artemis known as brauronia now says he we set out from this that the circumstance of the goddess who is served at brauron by shebears having a friend and companion changed into a bear cannot possibly be a freak of chance but that this metamorphosis has its foundation in the fact that the animal was sacred to the goddess  it will become probable that the animal actually was mythically identified with the goddess at an extremely remote period or at all events that the goddess succeeded to and threw her protection over an ancient worship of the animal  passing then from arcadia where the friend of the goddess becomes a shebear to brauron and munychia in attica we find that the local artemis there an artemis connected by legend with the fierce taurian goddess is served by young girls who imitate in dances the gait of bears who are called little bears apktoi and whose ministry is named aptcreia that is a playing the bear some have held that the girls once wore bearskins        paus viii 3        claus op cit p 76 suchier de dian brauron p      33 the bearskin seems later to have been exchanged for a      saffron raiment compare harpokration aristophanes      lysistrata 646 the scholiast on that passage

lore in his work on the cults of the greek states  familiar examples in ancient and classical times of this religious service by men in bestial guise are the wolfdances of the hirpi or wolves and the use of the ramskin in egypt and greece these brauronian rites point to a period when the goddess was herself a bear or when a bearmyth accrued to her legend and this inference is confirmed by the singular tradition that she was not only a bear but a bear who craved for human blood        servius jen i xi 785 for a singular parallel in modern      french folklore to the dance of the hirpi see

quoted by o müller cf      welcker i 573  the connection between the arcadian artemis the artemis of brauron and the common rituals and creeds of totemistic worship is now perhaps undeniably apparent perhaps in all the legend and all the cult of the goddess there is no more archaic element than this the speech of the women in the lysistrata recalling the days of their childhood when they were bears takes us back to a remote past when the tribes settled at brauron were bearworshippers and in all probability claimed to be of the bear stock or kindred their distant descendants still imitated the creatures movements in a sacred dance and the girls of periclean athens acted at that moment like the young men of the mandans or nootkas in their wolfdance or buffalodance two questions remain unanswered how did a goddess of the name of artemis and with her wide and beneficent functions succeed to a cult so barbarous or how on the other hand did the cult of a ravening shebear develop into the humane and pure religion of artemis  here is a moment in mythical and religious evolution which almost escapes our inquiry we find in actual historical processes nothing more akin to it than the relation borne by the samoan gods to the various animals in which they are supposed to be manifest how did the complex theory of the nature of artemis arise what was its growth at what precise hour did it emancipate itself on the whole from the lower savage creeds or how was it developed out of their unpromising materials the science of mythology may perhaps never find a key to these obscure problems        the symbolic explanation of bachofen claus and others is      to the effect that the shebear to take that case is a      beast in which the maternal instinct is very strong and      apparently that the shebear deprived of her whelps is a      fit symbol of a goddess notoriously virginal and without      offspring  the goddess of brauron succeeding probably to the cult of a shebear called for human blood with human blood the artemis orthia of sparta was propitiated of this goddess and her rights pausanias tells a very remarkable story the image of the goddess he declares is barbarous which probably means that even among the archaic wooden idols of greece it seemed peculiarly savage in style astrabacus and alopecus the ass and the fox sons of agis are said to have found the idol in a bush and to have been struck mad at the sight of it those who sacrificed to the goddess fell to blows and slew each other a pestilence followed and it became clear that the goddess demanded human victims her altar must be drenched in the blood of men the victim being chosen by lot lycurgus got the credit of substituting the rite in which boys were flogged before the goddess to the effusion of blood for the older human sacrifices the taurian artemis adored with human sacrifice and her priestess iphigenia perhaps a form of the goddess are familiar examples of this sanguinary ritual suchier is probably correct in denying that these sacrifices are of foreign origin they are closely interwoven with the oldest idols and oldest myths of the districts least open to foreign influence an achaean example is given by pausanias artemis was adored with the offering of a beautiful girl and boy not far from brauron at halae was a very ancient temple of artemis tauropolos in which blood was drawn from a mans throat by the edge of the sword clearly a modified survival of human sacrifice the whole connection of artemis with taurian rites has been examined by müller in his orchomenos horns grow from the shoulders of artemis tauropolos on the coins of amphipolis and on macedonian coins she rides on a bull according to decharme the taurian artemis with her hideous rites was confused by an accidental resemblance of names with this artemis tauropolos whose symbol was a bull and who whatever we may think of the symbolic hypothesis used bulls as her vehicle and wore bulls horns        paus iii 816 cf müller dorians book ii chap 9      6 pausanias viii 23 1 mentions a similar custom      ordained by the delphian oracle the flogging of women at      the feast of

568        mythol de la grece p 137  müller on the other hand believes the greeks found in tauria ie lemnos a goddess with bloody rites whom they identified by reason of those very human sacrifices with their own artemis iphigenia their own worship of that deity bore so many marks of ancient barbarism that they were willing to consider the northern barbarians as its authors yet it is possible that the tauric artemis was no more derived from the taurians than artemis Æthiopia from the Æthiopians  the nature of the famous diana of the ephesians or artemis of ephesus is probably quite distinct in origin from either the artemis of arcadia and attica or the deity of literary creeds as late as the time of tacitus the ephesians maintained that letos twins had been born in their territory the first which showed themselves in the senate were the ephesians declaring that diana and apollo were not born in the island delos as the common people did believe and there was in their country a river called cenchrius and a wood called ortegia where latona being great with child and leaning against an olive tree which is yet in that place brought forth these two gods and that by the commandment of the gods the wood was made sacred        mythol de la grece ii 9 7        annals iii 61        greenweys tacitus 1622   this was a mere adaptation of the delian legend the olive in athens sacred to athene taking the place of the delian palmtree the real artemis of ephesus the image that fell from heaven was an oriental survival nothing can be less greek in taste than her manybreasted idol which may be compared with the manybreasted goddess of the beerproducing maguey plant in mexico  the wilder elements in the local rites and myths of diana are little if at all concerned with the goddess in her olympian aspect as the daughter of leto and sister of apollo    it is from this lofty rank that she  descends in the national epic to combat on the ilian plain among warring gods and men claus has attempted from a comparison of the epithets applied to artemis to show that the poets of the iliad and the odyssey take different views of her character in the iliad she is a goddess of tumult and passion in the odyssey a holy maiden with the gentle darts that deal sudden and painless death but in both poems she is a huntress and the deathdealing shafts are hers both in iliad and odyssey perhaps the apparent difference is due to nothing but the necessity for allotting her a part in that battle of the olympians which rages in the iliad thus hera in the iliad addresses her thus how now art thou mad bold vixen to match thyself against me hard were it for thee to match my might bowbearer though thou art since against women zeus made thee a lion and giveth thee to slay whomso of them thou wilt truly it is better on the mountains to slay wild beasts and deer than to fight with one that is mightier than thou        for an alabaster statuette of the goddess see roschers      lexikon p 588        iliad xxi 481  these taunts of hera who always detests the illegitimate children of zeus doubtless refer to the character of artemis as the goddess of childbirth here she becomes confused with ilithyia and with hecate but it is unnecessary to pursue the inquiry into these details  like most of the olympians artemis was connected not only with beastworship but with plantworship she was known by the names daphnæa and cedreatis at ephesus not only the olive but the oak was sacred to her at delos she had her palm tree her idol was placed in or hung from the branches of these trees and it is not improbable that she succeeded to the honours either of a tree worshipped in itself and for itself or of the spirit or genius which was presumed to dwell in and inform it similar examples of one creed inheriting the holy things of its predecessor are common enough where either missionaries as in mexico and china or the early preachers of the gospel in brittany or scandinavia appropriated to christ the holy days of pagan deities and consecrated fetish stones with the mark of the cross unluckily we have no historical evidence as to the moment in which the ancient tribal totems and fetishes and sacrifices were placed under the protection of the various olympians in whose cult they survive like flies in amber but that this process did take place is the most obvious explanation of the rude factors in the religion of artemis as of apollo zeus or dionysus        cf preller i 256 257 bacchylides make hecate the      daughter of deepbosomed night 40 the scholiast on the      second idyll of theocritus in which the sorceress appeals      to the magic of the moon makes her a daughter of zeus and      demeter and identified with artemis here more clearly      than elsewhere the artemis appears sub luce maligna      under the wan uncertain light of the moon  it was ever the tendency of greek thought to turn from the contemplation of dark and inscrutable things in the character of the gods and to endow them with the fairest attributes the primitive formless zoana give place to the ideal statues of gold and ivory the artemis to whom a fawn in a maidens dress is sacrificed does not haunt the memory of euripides his artemis is fair and honourable pure and maidenly a goddess wandering in lonely places unbeholden of man it is thus if one may rhyme the speech of hippolytus that her votary addresses her       for thee soft crowns in thine untrampled mead      i weave my lady and to thee i bear      thither no shepherd drives his flocks to feed      nor scythe of steel has ever laboured there      nay through the spring among the blossoms fair      the brown bee comes and goes and with good heed      thy maiden reverence sweet streams doth lead      about the grassy close that is her care      souls only that are gracious and serene      by gift of god in human lore unread      may pluck these holy blooms and grasses green      that now i wreathe for thine immortal head      i who may walk with thee thyself unseen      and by thy whispered voice am comforted  in passages like this we find the truly natural religion the religion to which mans nature tends groaning and travailing till the goal is won but it is long in the winning the paths are rough humanity is led by a way that it knew not     dionysus  among deities whose origin has been sought in the personification if not of the phenomena at least of the forces of nature dionysus is prominent he is regarded by many mythologists as the spiritual form of the new vernal life the sap and pulse of vegetation and of the newborn year especially as manifest in the vine and the juice of the grape thus preller looks on his mother semele as a personification of the pregnant soil in spring the name of semele is explained with the familiar diversity of conjecture whether the human intellect at the time of the first development of myth was capable of such abstract thought as is employed in the recognition of a deity presiding over the revival of earthlife or not and whether having attained to this abstraction men would go on to clothe it in all manner of animal and other symbolisms are questions which mythologists seem to take for granted the popular story of the birth of dionysus is well known        it is needless to occupy space with the etymological      guesses at the sense of the name dionysus greek sanskrit      and assyrian have been tortured by the philologists but      refuse to give up their secret and curtis does not even      offer a conjecture or etym 609        preller i 544        i 546        the birth of dionysus is recorded iliad xiv 323      hesiod theog 940 without the story of the death of      semele which occurs in Æschylus frg 217218 eurip      bacchæ i 3  his mother semele desired to see zeus in all his glory as he appeared when he made love to hera having promised to grant all the nymphs requests zeus was constrained to approach her in thunder and lightning she was burned to death but the god rescued her unborn child and sowed him up in his own thigh in this wild narrative preller finds the wedlock of heaven and earth the first day that it thunders in march the thigh of zeus is to be interpreted as the cool moist clouds if on the other hand we may take dionysus himself to be the rain as kuhn does and explain the thigh of zeus by comparison with certain details in the soma sacrifice and the right thigh of indra as described in one of the brahmanas why then of course prellers explanation cannot be admitted        kuhn herabkunft pp 166 167 where it appears that the      gods buy soma and place it on the right thigh of indra  these examples show the difficulty or rather indicate the error of attempting to interpret all the details in any myth as so many statements about natural phenomena and natural forces such interpretations are necessarily conjectural certainly dionysus the god of orgies of wine of poetry became in later greek thought something very like the spiritual form of the vine and the patron of natures moods of revelry but that he was originally conceived of thus or that this conception may be minutely traced through each incident of his legend cannot be scientifically established each mythologist as has been said before is in fact asking himself what meaning would i have had if i told this or that story of the god of the vine or the god of the years renewal the imaginations in which the tale of the double birth of dionysus arose were so unlike the imagination of an erudite modern german that these guesses are absolutely baseless nay when we are told that the child was sheltered in his fathers body and was actually brought to birth by the father we may be reminded like bachofen of that widespread savage custom the couvade  from brazil to the basque country it has been common for the father to pretend to liein while the mother is in childbed the husband undergoes medical treatment in many cases being put to bed for days this custom worldwide as mr tylor calls it has been used by bachofen as the source of the myth of the double birth of dionysus though other explanations of the couvade have been given the most plausible theory represents it as a recognition of paternity by the father bachofen compares the ceremony by which when hera became reconciled to herakles she adopted him as her own through the legal fiction of his second birth the custom by which in old french marriage rites illegitimate children were legitimised by being brought to the altar under the veil of the bride is also in point diodorus says that barbarians still practise the rite of adoption by a fictitious birth men who returned home safely after they were believed to be dead had to undergo a similar ceremony bachofen therefore explains the names and myths of the doublemothered dionysus as relics of the custom of the couvade and of the legal recognition of children by the father after a period of kinship through women only        tylor prim oult i 94 early history of mankind p      293         bachofen das

father and mother of the child  naturally and now i must go and make him comfortable        dial deor xi  we need not necessarily accept bachofens view this learned author employed indeed a widely comparative method but he saw everything through certain mystic speculations of his own it may be deemed however that the authors of the myth of the double birth of dionysus were rather in the condition of men who practise the couvade than capable of such vast abstract ideas and such complicated symbolism as are required in the system of preller it is probable enough that the struggle between the two systems of kindredmaternal and paternalhas left its mark in greek mythology undeniably it is present in the eumenides of Æschylus and perhaps it inspires the tales which represent hera and zeus as emulously producing offspring athene and hephaestus without the aid of the opposite sex  in any case dionysus semeles son the patron of the vine the conqueror of india is an enigmatic figure of dubious origin but less repulsive than dionysus zagreus  even among the adventures of zeus the amour which resulted in the birth of dionysus zagreus was conspicuous jupiter ipse filiam incestavit natum hinc zagreum persephone fleeing her hateful lover took the shape of a serpent and zeus became the male dragon the story is on a footing with the brahmanic myth of prajapati and his daughter as buck and doe the platonists explained the legend as usual by their absurd symbolism   the child of two serpents zagreus was born curious as it may seem with horns on his head zeus brought him up in secret but hera sent the titans to kill him according to clemens alexandrinus and other authorities the titans won his heart with toys including the bullroarer or turndun of the australians his enemies also in australian fashion daubed themselves over with pipeclay by these hideous foes the child was torn to pieces though according to nonnus he changed himself into as many beasts as

titans here we are naturally reminded of the dismemberment of osiris ymir purusha chokanipok and so many other gods and beasts in egypt india scandinavia and america this point must not be lost sight of in the controversy as to the origin and date of the story of dionysus zagreus nothing can be much more repulsive than these hideous incidents to the genius for example of homer he rarely tells anything worse about the gods than the tale of ares imprisonment in the large bronze pot an event undignified indeed but not in the ferocious taste of the zagreus legend but it need not therefore be decided that the story of dionysus and the titans is later than homer because it is inconsistent with the tone of homeric mythology and because it is found in more recent authorities details like the use of the turndun in the dionysiac mysteries and the bodies of the celebrants daubed with clay have a primitive or at least savage appearance it was the opinion of lobeck that the orphic poems in which the legend first comes into literature were the work of onomacritus  on the other hand müller argued that the myth was really archaic although it had passed through the hands of onomacritus on the strength of the boast of the delphian priests that they possessed the grave in which the fragments of the god were buried müller believed that onomacritus received the story from delphi        proclus in crat p 115        aglaoph p 616    onomacritum architectum istius      mythi        müllers proleg english transl p 319  müller writes  the way in which these orphics went to work with ancient myths can be most distinctly seen in the mythus of the tearing asunder of bacchus which at all events passed through the hands of onomacritus an organiser of dionysian orgies according to pausanias an author of orphean poems also and therefore in all probability an orphic  the words of pausanias are viii 37 3 onomacritus taking from homer the name of the titans established dionysiac orgies and represented the titans as the authors of the sorrows of the god  now it is perhaps impossible to decide with certainty whether as lobeck held onomacritus adapted the myth and the delphians received it into their religion with rites purposely meant to resemble those of osiris in egypt or whether müller more correctly maintains that onomacritus on the other hand brought an old temple mystery and sacred chapter into the light of literature but it may very plausibly be maintained that a myth so wild and so analogous in its most brutal details to the myths of many widely scattered races is more probably ancient than a fresh invention of a poet of the sixth century it is much more likely that greece whether at delphi or elsewhere possessed a legend common to races in distant continents than that onomacritus either invented the tale or borrowed it from egypt and settled it at delphi o müller could not appeal to the crowd of tales of divine dismemberment in savage and civilised lands because with some he was unacquainted and others like the sacrifice of purusha the cutting up of omorca the rending of ymir do not seem to have occurred to his memory though the majority of these legends of divine dismemberment are connected with the making of the world yet in essentials they do resemble the tale of dionysus and the titans thus the balance of probability is in favour of the theory that the myth is really old and was borrowed not invented by onomacritus that very shifty person may have made his own alterations in the narrative but it cannot be rash to say with o müller if it has been supposed that he was the inventor of the entire fable which pausanias by no means asserts i must confess that i cannot bring myself to think so according to the notions of the ancients it must have been an unholy an accursed man who could from a mere caprice of his own represent the everyoung dionysus the god of joy as having been torn to pieces by the titans a reply to this might no doubt be sought in the passages describing the influx of new superstitions which are cited by lobeck the greek comic poets especially derided these religious novelties which corresponded very closely to our esoteric buddhism and similar impostures but these new mysteries and trumpery cults of the decayed civilisation were things very different from the worship of dionysus zagreus and his established sacrifices of oxen in the secret penetralia of delphi        lobeck aglaoph p 671        aglaoph 625630        lycophron 206 and the scholiast  it may be determined therefore that the tale and the mysteryplay of dionysus and the titans are in essentials as old as the savage state of religion in which their analogues abound whether at delphi they were or were not of foreign origin and introduced in times comparatively recent the fables wherever they are found are accompanied by savage rites in which as in some african tribes when the chief is about to declare war living animals were torn asunder and eaten raw these horrors were a kind of representation of the sufferings of the god o müller may well observe we can scarcely take these rites to be new usages and the offspring of a posthomeric civilisation these remarks apply to the custom of nebrismus or tearing fawns to pieces and dancing about draped in the fawnskins such rites were part of the bacchic worship and even broke out during a pagan revival in the time of valens when dogs were torn in shreds by the worshippers  whether the antiquity of the zagrean ritual and legend be admitted or not the problem as to their original significance remains although the majority of heathen rites of this kind were mysteryplays setting forth in action some story of divine adventure or misadventure yet lobeck imagines the story of zagreus and the titans to have been invented or adapted from the osiris legend as an account of the mystic performances themselves what the myth meant or what the furious actions of the celebrants intended it is only possible to conjecture        lycophrony p 322        theodoretus ap lobeck p 653 observe the number of      examples of daubing with clay in the mysteries here adduced      by lobeck and compare the mandan tribes described by catlin      in okeepa londou 1867 and by theal in kaffir folklore        lactantius v 1915 ovid fasti iv 211  commonly it is alleged that the sufferings of dionysus are the ruin of the summer year at the hands of storm and winter while the revival of the child typifies the vernal resurrection or again the slain dionysus is the vintage the old english song tells how john barleycorn must die and how potently he came back to life and mastered his oppressors this notion too may be at the root of the passion of dionysus for the grapes suffer at least as many processes of torture as john barleycorn before they declare themselves in the shape of strong drink while preller talks about the tiefste erdund naturschmerz typified in the zagrean ritual lobeck remarks that plato would be surprised if he could hear these drunken mens freaks decoratively described as ein erhabene naturdienst        decharme mythologie de la grece p 437 compare preller      i 572 on tiefste naturschmerz and so forth  lobeck looks on the wild acts the tearing of fawns and dogs the halfnaked dances the gnawing of raw bleeding flesh as the natural expression of fierce untutored folk revelling in freedom leaping and shouting but the odd thing is that the most civilised of peoples should so long have retained the manners of ingenia inculta et indomita whatever the original significance of the dionysiac revels that significance was certainly expressed in a ferocious and barbaric fashion more worthy of australians than athenians  on this view of the case it might perhaps be maintained that the germ of the myth is merely the sacrifice itself the barbaric and cruel dismembering of an animal victim which came to be identified with the god the sufferings of the victim would thus finally be transmuted into a legend about the passion of the deity the old greek explanation that the ritual was designed in imitation of what befel the god would need to be reversed the truth would be that the myth of what befel the god was borrowed from the actual torture of the victim with which the god was identified examples of this mystic habit of mind in which the slain beast the god and even the officiating celebrant were confused in thought with each other are sufficiently common in ritual        as to the torchdances of the maenads compare roscher      lexikon p 1041 and mannhardt wald und feki kultits i      534 for parallels in european folklore  the sacrifices in the ritual of dionysus have a very marked character and here more commonly than in other hellenic cults the god and the victim are recognised as essentially the same the sacrifice in fact is a sacrament and in partaking of the victim the communicants eat their god this detail is so prominent that it has not escaped the notice even of mythologists who prefer to take an ideal view of myths and customs to regard them as symbols in a natureworship originally pure thus m decharme says of the bullfeast in the dionysiac cult comme le taureau est un des formes de dionysos cetait le corps du dieu dont se repaissaient les inities cetait son sang dont ils sabreuvaient dans ce banquet mystique now it was the peculiarity of the bacchici who maintained these rites that as a rule they abstained from the flesh of animals altogether or at least their conduct took this shape when adopted into the orphic discipline this ritual therefore has points in common with the usages which appear also to have survived into the cult of the ramgod in egypt the conclusion suggested is that where dionysus was adored with this sacrament of bulls flesh he had either been developed out of or had succeeded to the worship of a bulltotem and had inherited his characteristic ritual mr frazer however proposes quite a different solution ours is rendered plausible by the famous elean chant in which the god was thus addressed come hero dionysus come with the graces to thy holy house by the shores of the sea hasten with thy bullfoot then the chorus repeated goodly bull goodly bull m decharme publishes a cameo in which the god is represented as a bull with the three graces standing on his neck and seven stars in the field m decharme decides that the stars are the pleiades the graces the rays of the vernal sun and dionysus as a bull the symbol of the vernal sun itself but all such symbolical explanations are apt to be mere private conjectures and they are of no avail in face of the ritual which on the other hypothesis is to be expected and is actually found in connection with the bull dionysus where dionysus is not absolutely called a bull he is addressed as the horned deity the bullhorned the horned child        lobeck aglaoph i 244 plato

431        clemens alex adhort ii 1518 nonnus vi 264      diodorus iv 4 3 64  a still more curious incident of the dionysiac worship was the sacrifice of a booted calf a calf with cothurns on its feet the people of tenedos says Ælian used to tend their goodliest cow with great care to treat it when it calved like a woman in labour to put the calf in boots and sacrifice it and then to stone the sacrificer and drive him into the sea to expiate his crime in this ceremony as in the diipolia at athens the slain bull is as it were a member of the bloodkindred of the man who immolates him and who has to expiate the deed as if it were a murder in this connection it is worth remarking that dionysus zagreus when according to the myth he was attacked by the titans tried to escape his enemies by assuming various forms it was in the guise of a bull that he was finally captured and rent asunder the custom of rending the living victims of his cult was carried so far that when pentheus disturbed his mysteries the king was torn piecemeal by the women of his own family the pious acquiescence of the author of the socalled theocritean idyll in this butchery is a curious example of the conservatism of religious sentiment the connection of dionysus with the bull in particular is attested by various ritual epithets such as the bull bullborn bullhorned and bullbrowed he was also worshipped with sacrifice of hegoats according to the popular explanation because the goat gnaws the vine and therefore is odious to the god        Ælian h at xii 34        o müller proleg engl transl

animals as the old commentator on virgil remarks were sacrificed to the various gods aut per similitudinem aut per contrarietatem either because there was a community of nature between the deity and the beast or because the beast had once been sacred in a hostile clan or tribe the god derived some of his ritual names from the goat as well as from the bull according to one myth dionysus was changed into a kid by zeus to enable him to escape the jealousy of hera it is a peculiarity says voigt of the dionysus ritual that the god is one of his offering but though the identity of the god and the victim is manifest the phenomenon is too common in religion to be called peculiar plutarch especially mentions that many of the greeks make statues of dionysus in the form of a bull  dionysus was not only an animalgod or a god who absorbed in his rights and titles various elder forms of beastworship trees also stood in the same relation to him as dendrites he is like artemis a treegod and probably succeeded to the cult of certain sacred trees just as for example st bridget in ireland succeeded to the cult of the firegoddess and to her ceremonial        cf roscher lexikon p 1059

which in india dwell in the peepul or the bo tree thus pausanias tells us that when pentheus went to spy on the dionysiac mysteries the women found him hidden in a tree and there and then tore him piecemeal according to a corinthian legend the delphic oracle bade them seek this tree and worship it with no less honour than the god dionysus himself hence the wooden images of dionysus were made of that tree the fig tree non ex quovis ligno and the god had a ritual name the figtree dionysus in the idols the community of nature between the god and the fig tree was expressed and commemorated an unhewn stump of wood was the dionysus idol of the rustic people        hesychius        cf roscher p 1062        ii 25        max tyr 8 1  certain antique elements in the dionysus cult have now been sketched we have seen the god in singularly close relations with animal and plant worship and have noted the very archaic character of certain features in his mysteries doubtless these things are older than the bright anthropomorphic dionysus of the poetsthe beautiful young deity vinecrowned who rises from the sea to comfort ariadne in tintorettos immortal picture at his highest at his best dionysus is the spirit not only of bacchic revel and of dramatic poetry but of youth health and gaiety even in this form he retains something tricksy and enigmatic the survival perhaps of earlier ideas or again it may be the result of a more or less conscious symbolism the god of the vine and of the juice of the vine maketh glad the heart of man but he also inspires the kind of metamorphosis which the popular speech alludes to when a person is said to be disguised in drink for this reason perhaps he is now represented in art as a grave and bearded man now as a manly youth and again as an effeminate lad of girlish loveliness the bearded type of the god is apparently the earlier the girlish type may possibly be the result merely of decadent art and its tendency to a sexless or bisexual prettiness  turning from the ritual and local cults of the god which as has been shown probably retain the earlier elements in his composite nature and looking at his legend in the national literature of greece we find little that throws any light on the origin and primal conception of his character in the iliad dionysus is not one of the great gods whose politics sways olympus and whose diplomatic or martial interference is exercised in the leaguer of the achæans or in the citadel of ilios the longest passage in which he is mentioned is iliad vi 130 a passage which clearly enough declares that the worship of dionysus or at least that certain of his rites were brought in from without and that his worshippers endured persecution diomedes encountering glaucus in battle refuses to fight him if

identify him with the deity of orgiastic frenzy as to nysa volumes might be written to little or no purpose on the learning connected with this obscure placename so popular in the legend of dionysus it has been identified as a mountain in thrace in boeotia in arabia india libya and naxos as a town in caria or the caucasus and as an island in the nile the flight of dionysus into the sea may possibly recall the similar flight of agni in indian myth  the odyssey only mentions dionysus in connection with ariadne whom artemis is said to have slain by reason of the witness of dionysus and where the great golden urn of thetis is said to have been a present from the god the famous and beautiful hymn proves as indeed may be learned from hesiod that the god was already looked on as the

the rigging leaving aside the orphic poems which contain most of the facts in the legend of dionysus zagreus the bacchæ of euripides is the chief classical record of ideas about the god dionysus was the patron of the drama which itself was an artistic development of the old rural songs and dances of his athenian festival in the bacchæ then euripides had to honour the very patron of his art it must be said that his praise is but halfhearted a certain ironical spirit breaking out here and there as when old cadmus dances and shakes a grey head and a stiff knee into actual burlesque pervades the play tradition and myth doubtless retained some historical truth when they averred that the orgies of the god had been accepted with reluctance into state religion the tales about lycurgus and pentheus who persecuted the bacchæ in thebes and was dismembered by his own mother in a divine madness are survivals of this old distrust of dionysus it was impossible for euripides a sceptic even in a sceptical age to approve sincerely of the god whom he was obliged to celebrate he falls back on queer etymological explanations of the birth of dionysus from the thigh of zeus this myth as cadmus very learnedly sets forth was the result of forgetfulness of the meaning of words was born of a volksetymologie zeus gave a hostage to hera says cadmus and in process of time a very short time men forgot what they meant when they said this and supposed that dionysus had been sewnup in the thigh of his father the explanation is absurd but it shows how euripides could transfer the doubt and distrust of his own age and its attempt at a philological interpretation of myth to the remote heroic tunes throughout the play the character and conduct of the god and his hideous revenge on the people who reject his wild and cruel rites can only be justified because they are articles of faith the chorus may singah blessed he who dwelleth in happiness expert in the rites of the gods and so hallows his life fulfilling his soul with the spirit of dionysus revelling on the hills with charms of holy purity  this was the interpretation which the religious mind thrust upon rites which in themselves were so barbarously obscene that they were feigned to have been brought by dionysus from the barbaric east and to be the invention of rhea an alien and orgiastic goddess the bullhorned snakewreathed god the god who when bound turns into a bull 618 who manifests himself as a bull to pentheus 920 and is implored by the chorus to appear as bull or burning lion or manyheaded snake

greek religion the greek reverence accepts hallows and adorns an older faith which it feels to be repugnant and even alien but none the less recognises as human and inevitable from modern human nature the ancient orgiastic impulse of savage revelry has almost died away in greece it was dying but before it expired it sanctified and perpetuated itself by assuming a religious form by draping its naked limbs in the fawnskin or the bullskin of dionysus in precisely the same spirit christianity among the negroes of the southern states has been constrained to throw its mantle over what the race cannot discard the orgies have become campmeetings the voodoodance is consecrated as the jerusalem jump in england the primitive impulse is but occasionally recognised at revivals this orgiastic impulse the impulse of australian corroboree and cherokee fetishdances and of the dancing dervishes themselves occasionally seizes girls in modern greece they dance themselves to death on the hills and are said by the peasants to be victims of the nereids in the old classic world they would have been saluted as the nurses and companions of dionysus and their disease would have been hallowed by religion of that religion the bullhorned bulleating cannibal dionysus was the deity and he was refined away into the youth with yellowclustered curls and sleepy eyes and smiling lips the girlish youth of the art of praxiteles so we see him in surviving statues and seeing him forget his ghastly rites and his succession to the rites of goats and deer and bulls     athene  among deities for whom an origin has been sought in the personification of elemental phenomena athene is remarkable perhaps no divine figure has caused more diverse speculations the study of her legend is rather valuable for the varieties of opinion which it illustrates than for any real contribution to actual knowledge which it supplies we can discover little if anything about the rise and development of the conception of athene her local myths and local sacra seem on the whole less barbaric than those of many other olympians but in comparing the conjectures of the learned one lesson comes out with astonishing clearness it is most perilous as this comparison demonstrates to guess at an origin of any god in natural phenomena and then to explain the details of the gods legend with exclusive reference to that fancied elemental origin  as usual the oldest literary references to athene are found in the iliad and odyssey it were superfluous to collect and compare texts so numerous and so familiar athene appears in the iliad as a martial maiden daughter of zeus and apparently of zeus alone without female mate        iliad v 875 880 this is stated explicitly in the      homeric hymn to apollo where athene is said to have been      born from the head of zeus pindar olympic odes vii  she is the patron of valour and the inspirer of counsel she arrests the hand of achilles when his sword is half drawn from the sheath in his quarrel with agamemnon she is the constant companion and protector of odysseus and though she is worshipped in the citadel of troy she is constant to the cause of the achæans occasionally it is recorded of her that she assumed the shape of various birds a seabird and a swallow are among her metamorphoses and she could put on the form of any man she pleased for example of deiphobus it has often been observed that among the lower races the gods habitually appear in the form of animals entre ces facultes qui possedent les immortels lune des plus frappantes est celle de se metamorphoser de prendre des apparences non seulement animales mais encore de se transformer en objets inanimes of this faculty inherited from the savage stage of thought athene has her due share even in homer but in almost every other respect she is free from the heritage of barbarism and might very well be regarded as the ideal representative of wisdom valour and manfulness in man of purity courage and nobility in woman as in the phæacian maid nausicæ        iliad xxii 227 xvii 351 od iii 372 v 353      iliad vii 59         maury religion de la grece i 256  in hesiod as has already been shown the myth of the birth of athene retains the old barbaric stamp it is the peculiarity of the hesiodic poems to preserve the very features of religious narrative which homer disregards according to hesiod zeus the youngest child of childswallowing cronus married metis after he had conquered and expelled his father now metis like other gods and goddesses had the power of transforming herself into any shape she pleased her husband learned that her childfor she was pregnantwould be greater than its father as in the case of the child of thetis zeus therefore persuaded metis to transform herself into a fly no sooner was the metamorphosis complete than he swallowed the fly and himself produced the child of metis out of his head the later philosophers explained this myth by a variety of metaphysical interpretations in which the god is said to contain the all in himself and again to reproduce it any such ideas must have been alien to the inventors of a tale which as we have shown possesses many counterparts among the lowest and least platonic races c o müller remarks plausibly that the figure of the swallowing is employed in imitation of still older legends such as those of africa and australia this leaves him free to imagine a philosophic explanation of the myth based on the word metis we may agree with müller that the swallowmyth is extremely archaic in character as it is so common among the backward races as to the precise amount however of philosophic reflection and allegory which was present to the cosmogonic poets mind when he used metis as the name of the being who could become a fly and so be swallowed by her husband it is impossible to speak with confidence very probably the poet meant to read a moral and speculative meaning into a barbaric märchen surviving in religious tradition  to the birth of athene from her fathers head savage parallels are not lacking in the legends of the south pacific especially of mangaia tangaroa is

mythical birth for a startingpoint and relying on their private interpretations of the cognomina of the goddess of her sacra and of her actions in other parts of her legend the modern mythologists have built up their various theories athene is now the personification of wisdom now the dawn now the air or aether now the lightning as it leaps from the thundercloud and if she has not been recognised as the moon it is not for lack of opportunity these explanations rest on the habit of twisting each detail of a divine legend into conformity with aspects of certain natural and elemental forces or they rely on etymological conjecture for example welcker maintains that athene is a feminine personification of the upper air daughter of zeus the dweller in æther her name tritogenia is derived from an ancient word for water which like fire has its source in æther welcker presses the title of the goddess glaucopis the greygreeneyed into the service the heaven in attica oft ebenfalls

so forth moreover the olive tree is one of the sacred plants of athene now why should this be clearly thinks welcker because oliveoil gives light from a lamp and light also comes from æther athene

belief that athene  ahana which mr max müller regards as a sanskrit word for dawn phonetically there is not one word to be said against ahana  athene and that the morning light offers the best startingpoint for the later growth of athene has been proved i believe beyond the reach of doubt or even of cavil mr müller adds that nothing really important could be brought forward against my equation ahana  athene  it is no part of our province here to decide between the conjectures of rival etymologists nor to pronounce on their relative merits but the world cannot be expected to be convinced by philological scholars before they have convinced each other mr max müller had not convinced benfey who offered another etymology of athene as the feminine of the zend thrætana athwyana an etymology of which mr müller remarks that whoever will take the trouble to examine its phonetic foundation will be obliged in common honesty to confess that it is untenable meanwhile curtius is neither for ahana and sanskrit and mr max müller nor for benfey and zend he derives athene from the root aio whence perhaps comes athene the blooming one  the maiden preller again finds the source of the name athene in aio whence aion the air or a flower he does not regard these etymologies as certain though he agrees with welcker that athene is the clear height of æther  manifestly no one can be expected to accept as matter of faith an etymological solution which is rejected by philologists the more fashionable theory for the moment is that maintained some time since by lauer and schwartz and now by furtwangler in roschers lexikon that athene is the cloudgoddess or the goddess of the lightning as it springs from the clouds as the lightning in mythology is often a serpent and as athene had her sacred serpent which might be erichthonios        nineteenth century october 1885 pp 636 639        gr et engl transl i 300        preller i 161        cf lauer system der oriesch myth berlin 1853

identifying athene with the lightning and the thundercloud has been compiled by furtwangler and deserves some attention the passage excellently illustrates the error of taking poetic details in authors as late as pindar for survivals of the absolute original form of an elemental myth  furtwangler finds the proof of his opinion that athene is originally the goddess of the thundercloud and the lightning that leaps from it in the olympic ode by hephaistos handicraft beneath the bronzewrought axe from the crown of her fathers head athene leapt to light and cried aloud an exceeding cry and heaven trembled at her coming and earth the mother the cry she gave is the thunderpeal the spear she carried is the lightning the ægis or goatskin she wore is the cloud again though the cloud has just been the head of zeus another proof of athenes connection with storm is the miracle she works when she sets a flame to fly from the head of diomede or of achilles or fleets from the sky like a meteor her possession on certain coins of the thunderbolts of zeus is another argument again as the trumpetathene she is connected with the thunderpeal though it seems more rational to account for her supposed invention of a military instrument by the mere fact that she is a warlike goddess but furtwangler explains her martial attributes as those of a thundergoddess while preller finds it just as easy to explain her moral character as goddess of wisdom by her elemental character as goddess not at all of the cloud but of the clear sky        ode vii 35 myers        cf schwartz ursprung etc pp 68 83         iliad v 718203        ibid iv 74        preller i 183  lastly as goddess of the heavenly clearness she is also goddess of spiritual clearness again as goddess of the cloudless heaven she is also goddess of health there could be no more instructive examples of the levity of conjecture than these in which two scholars interpret a myth with equal ease and freedom though they start from diametrically opposite conceptions let athene be lightning and cloud and all is plain to furtwangler let athene be cloudless sky and preller finds no difficulties athene as the goddess of womans work as well as of mans athene ergane becomes clear to furtwangler as he thinks of the fleecy clouds probably the stormgoddess when she is not thundering is regarded as weaving the fleeces of the upper air hence the myth that arachne was once a woman changed by athene into a spider because she contended with her in spinning        preller i 179        ovid metamorph vi 5146  the metamorphosis of arachne is merely one of the halfplayful aetiological myths of which we have seen examples all over the world the spider like the swallow the nightingale the dolphin the frog was once a human being metamorphosed by an angry deity as preller makes athene goddess of wisdom because she is goddess of clearness in the sky so furtwangler derives her intellectual attributes from her skill in weaving clouds it is tedious and unprofitable to examine these and similar exercises of facile ingenuity there is no proof that athene was ever a naturegoddess at all and if she was there is nothing to show what was her department of nature when we meet her in homer she is patroness of moral and physical excellence in man and woman manly virtue she typifies in her martial aspect the armed and warlike maid of zeus womanly excellence she protects in her capacity of ergane the toiler she is the companion and guardian of perseus no less than of odysseus  the sacred animals of athene were the owl the snake which accompanies her effigy in athens and is a form of her fosterchild erechtheus the cock and the crow probably she had some connection with the goat which might not be sacrificed in her fane on the acropolis where she was settled by Ægeus goatman  she wears the goatskin ægis in art but this is usually regarded as another type of the stormcloud        pindar olymp x ad jin        paus vi

 encycl brit aphrodite  athenes maiden character is stainless in story despite the brutal love of hephaestus this characteristic perhaps is another proof that she neither was in her origin nor became in mens minds one of the amorous deities of natural phenomena in any case it is well to maintain a sceptical attitude towards explanations of her myth which only agree in the determination to make athene a nature power at all costs and which differ destructively from each other as to whether she was dawn storm or clear heaven where opinions are so radically divided and so slenderly supported suspension of belief is natural and necessary  no polytheism is likely to be without a goddess of love and love is the chief if not the original department of aphrodite in the greek olympus in the iliad and odyssey and the homeric hymn she is already the queen of desire with the beauty and the softness of the laughterloving dame her cestus or girdle holds all the magic of passion and is borrowed even by hera when she wishes to win her fickle lord she disturbs the society of the gods by her famous amours with ares deceiving her husband hephaestus the lord of fire and she even stoops to the embraces of mortals as of anchises in the homeric poems the charm of golden aphrodite does not prevent the singer from hinting a quiet contempt for her softness and luxury but in this oldest greek literature the goddess is already thoroughly greek nor did later ages make any essential changes in her character concerning her birth homer and hesiod are not in the same tale for while homer makes her a daughter of zeus hesiod prefers as usual the more repulsive and probably older story which tells how she sprang from the seafoam and the mutilated portions of cronus        iliad v 312 theog 188206  but even in the hesiodic myth it is remarkable that the foamborn goddess first landed at cythera or again was born in wavewashed cyprus her ancient namesthe cyprian and the cythereanwith her favoured seats in paphos idalia and the phoenician settlement of eryx in sicily combine with historical traditions to show that the greek aphrodite was to some extent of oriental character and origin it is probable or rather certain that even without foreign influence the polytheism of greece must have developed a deity of love as did the mexican and scandinavian polytheisms but it is equally certain that portions of the worship and elements in the myth of aphrodite are derived from the ritual and the legends of the oriental queen of heaven adored from old babylon to cyprus and on many other coasts and isles of the grecian seas the greeks themselves recognised asiatic influence pausanias speaks of the temple of heavenly aphrodite in cythera as the holiest and most ancient of all her shrines among the hellenes herodotus again calls the fane of the goddess in askalon of the philistines the oldest of all and the place whence her worship travelled to cyprus as the cyprians say and the phoenicians planted it in cythera being themselves emigrants from syria the semitic element in this greek goddess and her cult first demand attention  among the semitic races with whose goddess of love aphrodite was thus connected the deity had many names she was regarded as at once the patroness of the moon and of fertility in plants beasts and women among the phoenicians her title is astarte among the assyrians she was istar among the syrians aschera in babylon mylitta common practices in the ritual of the eastern and western goddesses were the licence of the templegirls the sacrifices of animals supposed to be peculiarly amorous sparrows doves hegoats and above all the festivals and fasts for adonis        paus hi 28 1        so roscher ausfuhr lexik pp 391 647   see also      astarte p 656  there can scarcely be a doubt that adonisthe young hunter beloved by aphrodite slain by the boar and mourned by his mistressis a symbol of the young season the renouveau and of the spring vegetation ruined by the extreme heats and passing the rest of the year in the underworld adonis was already known to hesiod who called him with obvious meaning the son of phoenix and alphesiboea while pausanias attributed to him with equal significance assyrian descent the name of adonis is manifestly a form of the phoenician adon lord the nature of his worship among the greeks is most familiar from the fifteenth idyll of theocritus with its lively picture of dead adonis lying in state of the wailing for him by aphrodite of the little gardens of quicklygrowing flowers which personified him and with the beautiful nuptial hymn for his resurrection and reunion to aphrodite similar rites were customary at athens mannhardt gives the main points in the ritual of the adonisfeast thus the fresh vegetation is personified as a fair young man who in ritual is represented by a kind of idol and also by the plants of the adonisgardens the youth comes in spring the bridegroom to the bride the vernal year is their honeymoon in the heat of summer the bridegroom perishes for the nonce and passes the winter in the land of the dead his burial is bewailed his resurrection is rejoiced in the occasions of the rite are spring and midsummer the idol and the plants are finally cast into the sea or into wellwater        apollod bibliothec iii 14 4        aristoph lysistrata 389 mannhardt feld und wold      kultus ii 276  the union of the divine lovers is represented by pairing of men and maidens in bonds of a kindly sentimental sortthe flowery bonds of valentines  the oriental influence in all these rites has now been recognised it is perfectly attested both by the phoenican settlements whence aphroditeworship spread and by the very name of her lover the spring but all this may probably be regarded as little more than the semitic colouring of a ritual and a belief which exist among indoeuropean peoples quite apart from phoenican influence mannhardt traces the various points in the aphrodite cult already enumerated through the folklore of the german peasants the young lover the spring is the maikonig or laubmann his effigy is a clothed and crowned idol or puppet or the maibaum the figure is thrown into the water and bewailed in russia or buried or burned with lamentations he is wakened and kissed by a maiden who acts as the bride finally we have the maypairs a kind of valentines united in a nominal troth        i 418 ii 287        i 436 the probable conclusion seems to be that the adonis ritual expresses certain natural human ways of regarding the vernal year it is not unlikely that the ancestors of the greeks possessed these forms of folklore previous to their contact with the semitic races and their borrowing of the very marked semitic features in the festivals  for the rest the concern of aphrodite with the passion of love in men and with general productiveness in nature is a commonplace of greek literature   it would be waste of space to recount the numerous and familiar fables in which she inspires a happy or an illfated affection in gods or mortals like most other mythical figures aphrodite has been recognised by mr max müller as the dawn but the suggestion has not been generally accepted if aphrodite retains any traces of an elemental origin they show chiefly in that part of her legend which is peculiarly semitic in colour for the rest though she like hermes gives good luck in general she is a recognised personification of passion and the queen of love        roscher lexikon p 406     hermes

cyllene where hermes was a great resident god artemidorus saw a representation of hermes which was merely a large phallus and pausanias beheld the same sacred object which was adored with peculiar reverence such was hermes in the elean region whence he derived his name cyllenian he was a god of the liberal shepherds conceived of in the rudest aspect perhaps as the patron of fruitfulness in their flocks manifestly he was most unlike the graceful swift messenger of the gods and guide of the ghosts of men outworn the giver of good fortune the lord of the crowded marketplace the teacher of eloquence and of poetry who appears in the literary mythology of greece nor is there much in his pelasgian or his cyllenian form to suggest the elemental deity either of gloaming or of twilight or of the storm        can the obscene story of cicero de nat deor iii 22      56 be a repetition of the sacred chapter by which herodotus      says the pelasgians explained the attribute of the image        artem i 45        paus vi 26 3        homeric hymns iii 2        but see welcker i 343 for connection between his      name and his pastoral functions  but whether the pastoral hermes of the pelasgians was refined into the messengergod of homer or whether the name and honours of that god were given to the rude priapean patron of the shepherds by way of bringing him into the olympic circle it seems impossible to ascertain these combinations lie far behind the ages of greece known to us in poetry and history the province of the god as a deity of flocks is thought to be attested by his favourite companion animal the ram which often stood beside him in works of art in one case where he is represented with a ram on his shoulder the legend explained that by carrying a ram round the walls he saved the city of tanagra from a pestilence the arcadians also represented him carrying a ram under his arm as to the phallic hermæ it is only certain that the athenian taste agreed with that of the admiralty islanders in selecting such unseemly images to stand beside every door but the connection of hermes with music he was the inventor of the lyre as the homeric hymn sets forth may be explained by the musical and poetical character of old greek shepherd life  if we could set aside the various elemental theories of hermes as the stormwind the twilight the child of dawn and the rest it would not be difficult to show that one moral conception is common to his character in many of its varied aspects he is the god of luck of prosperity of success of fortunate adventure this department of his activity is already recognised in homer he is giver of good luck he is hermes who giveth grace and glory to all the works of men hence comes his homeric name the luckbringer the last cup at a feast is drunk to his honour for luck        pausanias ii 8 4         for hermes god of herds and flocks see preller i      322325        pausanias v 27 5        iliad xiv 491 od 15 319  where we cry shares in a lucky find the greek cried hermes in common a godsend was  thus among rough shepherd folk the luckbringing god displayed his activity chiefly in making fruitful the flocks but among city people he presided over the mart and the public assembly where he gave good fortune and over musical contests it is as the lucky god that hermes holds his fair wand of wealth and riches threeleafed and golden which wardeth off all evil hermes has thus among his varied departments none better marked out than the department of luck a very wide and important province in early thought but while he stands in this relation to men to the gods he is the herald and messenger and in some undignified myths even the pander and accomplice in the homeric hymn this child of zeus and maia shows his versatile character by stealing the oxen of apollo and fashioning the lyre on the day of his birth the theft is sometimes explained as a solar myth the twilight steals the bright days of the sungod but he could only steal them day by day whereas hermes lifts the cattle in an hour the surname of hermes is usually connected with the slaying of argus a supernatural being with many eyes set

swiftwinged messenger who in the odyssey crosses the great gulf of the sea and scarce brushes the brine with his feathers hermes might be explained by any one so minded either as lightning or wind

easy is it to interpret all the functions of a god as reflections of elemental phenomena the origin of hermes remains obscure but he is in his poetical shape one of the most beautiful and human of the deities he has little commerce with the beasts we do not find him with many animal companions like apollo nor adored like dionysus with a ritual in which are remnants of animalworship the darker

element appears and it often declares itself in her legend and in her ritual  a scientific study of demeter must endeavour to disentangle the two main factors in her myth and cult and to hold them apart for this purpose it is necessary to examine the development of the cult as far as it can be traced  as to the name of the goddess for once there is agreement and even certainty it seems hardly

chaff now the name of the god of wind and weather rain harvest and vegetation in general in the tongan islands is aloalo literally to fan one is reminded of joachim du bellays poem to the winnowers of corn thus from all these widely diffused examples it is manifest that the idea of a divinity of earth considered as the mother of fruits and as powerful for good or harm in harvesttime is anything but peculiar to greece or to aryan peoples in her character as potent over this department of agriculture the greek goddess was named she of the rich threshingfloors of the corn heaps of the corn in the

of adoration in these mysteries demeter was doubtless worshipped in her chthonian character as a goddess of earth powerful over those who are buried in her bosom over death and the dead in these hidden mysteries of her cult moreover survived ancient legends of the usual ugly sort tales of the amours of the goddess in bestial guise among such rites pausanias mentions at hermione of dryopian argolis the fete of chthonian demeter a summer festival the procession of men women boys and priests dragged a struggling heifer to the doors of the temple and thrust her in unbound within the fane

scriptures these were read aloud once a year to the initiated by a priest who covered his face with a mask of demeter at the same time he smote the earth with rods and called on the folk below the earth precisely the same practice smiting the earth with rods is employed by those who consult diviners among the zulus the zulu woman having a spirit of divination says strike the ground for them the

fell on the phigalians onatas was then employed to make a bronze statue like the old idol wherof the fashion was revealed to him in a dream this restoration was made about the time of the persian war the sacrifices offered to this demeter were fruits grapes honey and uncarded wool whence it is clear that the black goddess was a true earthmother and received the fruits of the earth and the flock the image by onatas had somewhat mysteriously disappeared before the days of pausanias        paus viii 42 compare viii 25 4 for the horse arion      whom demeter bore to poseidon  even in her rude arcadian shape demeter is a goddess of the fruits of earth it is probable that her most archaic form survived from the pelasgian clays in remote mountainous regions indeed herodotus observing the resemblance between the osirian mysteries in egypt and the thesmophoria of demeter in greece boldly asserts that the thesmophoria were egyptian and were brought to the pelasgians from egypt ii 171 the pelasgians were driven out of peloponnesus by the dorians and the arcadians who were not expelled retained the rites as pelasgians also lingered long in attica herodotus recognised the thesmophoria as in origin egyptian in modern language this theory means that the thesmophoria were thought to be a rite of prehistoric antiquity older than the dorian invasion herodotus naturally explained resemblances in the myth and ritual of distant peoples as the result of borrowing usually from egypt an idea revived by m foucart these analogies however are more frequently produced by the working out of similar thoughts presenting themselves to minds similarly situated in a similar way the mysteries of demeter offer an excellent specimen of the process while the greeks not yet collected into cities lived in village settlements each village would possess its own feasts mysteries and medicinedances as the red indians say appropriate to seedtime and harvest for various reasons certain of these local rites attained high importance in the development of greek civilisation the eleusinian performances for instance were adopted into the state ritual of a famous city athens and finally acquired a national status being open to all not disqualified hellenes in this development the old local ritual for the propitiation of demeter for the fertility of the seed sown and for the gratification of the dead ancestors was caught up into the religion of the state and was modified by advancing ideas of religion and morality but the local athenian mystery of the thesmophoria probably retained more of its primitive shape and purpose  the thesmophoria was the feast of seedtime and demeter was adored by the women as the patroness of human as well as of universal fertility thus a certain jocund and licentious element was imparted to the rites which were not to be witnessed by men  the demeter of the thesmophoria was she who introduced and patronised the  of marriage as homer says of odysseus and penelope what was done at the thesmophoria herodotus did not think fit to tell a scholiast on lucians dialogues of courtesans let out the secret in a much later age he repeats the story of the swineherd eubuleus whose pigs were swallowed up by the earth when it opened to receive hades and persephone in honour and in memory of eubuleus pigs were thrown into the cavernof demeter then certain women brought up the decaying flesh of the dead pigs and placed it on the altar it was believed that to mix this flesh with the seedcorn secured abundance of harvest though the rite is magical in character perhaps the decaying flesh might act as manure and be of real service to the farmer afterwards images of pigs such as mr newton found in a hole in the holy plot of demeter at cnidos were restored to the place whence the flesh had been taken the practice was believed to make marriage fruitful its virtues were for the husband as well as for the husbandman however the athenians got the rite whether they evolved it or adapted it from some pelasgian or other prehistoric people similar practices occur among the khonds in india and the pawnees in america the khonds sacrifice a pig and a human victim the pawnees a girl of a foreign tribe        odyssey xxiii 295        newton hulicarn plate iv pp 331 371391  the fragments of flesh are not mixed with the seedcorn but buried on the borders of the fields the ancient perhaps pelasgian ritual of demeter had thus its savage features and its savage analogues more remarkable still is the pawnee version as we may call it of the eleusinia curiously the red indian myth which resembles that of demeter and persephone is not told about mesukkummikokwi the red indian mother earth to whom offerings are made valuable objects being buried for her in brass kettles the american tale is attached to the legend of manabozho and his brother chibiabos not to that of the earth mother and her daughter if in america she had a daughter  the account of the pawnee mysteries and their origin is worth quoting in full as it is among the most remarkable of mythical coincidences if we decline to believe that pere de smet invented the tale for the mere purpose of mystifying mythologists we must apparently suppose that the coincidences are due to the similar workings of the human mind in the prairies as at eleusis we shall first give the red indian version it was confided to de smet as part of the general tradition of the pawnees by an old chief and was first published by de smet in his oregon mission tanner speaks of the legend as one that the indians chant in their medicinesongs which record the sacred beliefs of the race        de smet oregon missions p 359 mr russells report      in major campbells

peculiar to the indians on birchbark or small flat pieces of wood the ideas being conveyed by emblematical figures when it is remembered that the luck of the tribe depends on these songs and rites it will be admitted that they are probably of considerable antiquity and that the indians probably did not borrow the story about the origin of their ritual from some european conversant with the homeric hymn to demeter  here follows the myth as borrowed without acknowledgment by schoolcraft from de smet  the manitos powers or spirits were jealous of manabozho and chibiabos manabozho warned his brother never to be alone but one day he ventured on the frozen lake and was drowned by the manitos manabozho wailed along the shores he waged a war against all the manitos he called on the dead body of his brother he put the whole country in dread by his lamentations he then besmeared his face with black and sat down six years to lament uttering the name of chibiabos the manitos consulted what to do to assuage his melancholy and his wrath the oldest and wisest of them who had had no hand in the death of chibiabos offered to undertake the task of reconciliation they built a sacred lodge close to that of manabozho and prepared a sumptuous feast they then assembled in order one behind the other each carrying under his arm a sack of the skin of some favourite animal as a beaver an otter or a lynx and filled with precious and curious medicines culled from all plants these they exhibited and invited him to the feast with pleasing words and ceremonies he immediately raised his head uncovered it and washed off his besmearments and mourning colours and then followed them they offered him a cup of liquor prepared from the choicest medicines at once as a propitiation and an initiatory rite he drank it at a single draught and found his melancholy departed they then commenced their dances and songs united with various ceremonies all danced all sang all acted with the utmost gravity with exactness of time motion and voice manabozho was cured he ate danced sang and smoked the sacred pipe        schoolcraft l 318  in this manner the mysteries of the great medicinedance were introduced  the manitos now united their powers to bring chibiabos to life they did so and brought him to life but it was forbidden to enter the lodge they gave him through a chink a burning coal and told him to go and preside over the country of souls and reign over the land of the dead  manabozho now retired from men commits the care of medicinal plants to misukumigakwa or the mother of the earth to whom he makes offerings  in all this the resemblance to the legend of the homeric hymn to demeter is undeniable the hymn is too familiar to require a long analysis we read how demeter had a fair daughter persephone how the lord of the dead carried her off as she was gathering flowers how demeter sought her with burning torches and how the goddess came to eleusis and the house of celeus in the guise of an old wife there she dwelt in sorrow neither eating nor drinking till she tasted of a mixture of barley and water cyceon and was moved to smile by the mirth of iambe yet she still held apart in wrath from the society of the gods and still the earth bore not her fruits till the gods bade hermes restore persephone but persephone had tasted one pomegranateseed in hades and therefore according to a worldwide belief she was under bonds to hades for only half the year does she return to earth yet by this demeter was comforted the soil bore fruits again and demeter showed forth to the chiefs of eleusis her sacred mysteries and the ritual of their performance  the persephone myth is not in homer though in homer persephone is lady of the dead hesiod alludes to it in the theogony 912914 but the chief authority is the homeric hymn which matthaeus found 1777 in a farmyard at moscow inter pullos et porcos latueratthe pigs of demeter had guarded the poem of her mysteries as to the date and authorship of the hymn the learned differ in opinion probably most readers will regard it as a piece of poetry like the hymn to aphrodite rather than as a mystic chain of verse meant solely for hieratic purposes it is impossible to argue with safety that the eleusinian mysteries and legend were later than homer because homer does not allude to them        the superstition about the food of the dead is found in      new zealand melanesia scotland finland and among the      ojibbeways compare wandering willies tale in      redgaunttet        ruhnken ap hignard les hymnes homeriques p 292      paris 1864  he has no occasion to speak of them possibly the mysteries were in his time but the rites of a village or little town they attained celebrity owing to their adoption by athens and they ended by becoming the most famous national festival the meaning of the legend in its origin was probably no more than a propitiation of earth and a ceremony that imitated and so secured the return of spring and vegetation this early conception which we have found in america was easily combined with doctrines of the death and revival not of the year not of the seed sown but of the human soul these ideas were capable of endless illustration and amplification by priests and the mysteries by platos time and even by pindars were certainly understood to have a purifying influence on conduct and a favourable effect on the fortunes of the soul in the next world  happy whosoever of mortal men has looked on these things but whoso hath had no part nor lot in this sacrament hath no equal fate when once he hath perished and passed within the pall of darkness of such rites we may believe that plato was thinking when he spoke of beholding apparitions innocent and simple and calm and happy as in a mystery nor is it strange that when greeks were seeking for a sign and especially for some creed that might resist the new worship of christ plutarch and the neoplatonic philosophers tried to cling to the promise of the mysteries of demeter         homeric hymn 480482        phaedrus 260  they regarded her secret things as a dreamy shadow of that spectacle and that rite the spectacle and rite of the harmonious order of the universe some time to be revealed to the souls of the blessed it may not have been a drawback to the consolations of the hidden services that they made no appeal to the weary and wandering reason of the later heathens tired out with endless discourse on fate and free will gods and demons allegory and explanation they could repose on mere spectacles and ceremonies and pious ejaculations without any evidence or proof offered for the statements  indeed writers like plutarch show almost the temper of pascal trying to secure rest for their souls by a wise passiveness and pious contemplation and participation in sacraments not understood  as to the origin of these sacraments we may believe with lobeck that it was no priestly system of mystic and esoteric teaching moral or physical it was but the medicinedance of a very old greek tribal settlement perhaps from the first with an ethical element but from this thanks to the genius of hellas sprang all the beauty of the eleusinian ritual and all the consolation it offered the bereaved all the comfort it yielded to the weary and heavy laden that the popular religious excitement caused by the mysteries and favoured by the darkness often produced scenes of lustful revelry may be probable enough revivals everywhere have this among other consequences but we may share lobecks scepticism as to the wholesale charges of iniquity brought by the fathers        plutarch de def orac xxii        lobeck aglaoph 133  in spite of survivals and slanders the religion of demeter was among the most natural beautiful and touching of greek beliefs the wild element was not lacking but a pious contemporary of plato when he bathed in the sea with his pig before beholding the mysteryplay probably made up his mind to blink the barbaric and licentious part of the performances     conclusion  this brief review of greek divine myths does not of course aim at exhausting the subject we do not pretend to examine the legends of all the olympians but enough has been said to illustrate the method of interpretation and to give specimens of the method at work it has been seen that there is only agreement among philologists as to the origin and meaning of two out of nearly a dozen divine names zeus is admitted to be connected with dyaus and to have originally meant sky demeter is accepted as greek with the significance of mother earth but the meaning and the roots of athene apollo artemis hermes cronus aphrodite dionysuswe might add poseidon and hephaestusare very far from being known nor is there much more general agreement as to the original elemental phenomena or elemental province held by all of these gods and goddesses the moon the wind the twilight the sun the growth and force of vegetation the dark the night the atmosphere have been shuffled and dealt most variously to the various deities by learned students of myth this complete diversity of opinion must be accepted as a part in the study  the learned as a rule only agree in believing 1 that the names hold the secret of the original meaning of the gods and 2 that the gods are generally personifications of elements or of phenomena or have been evolved out of such personifications beyond this almost all is confusion doubt the twilight of the gods  in this darkness there is nothing to surprise we are not wandering in a magical mist poured around us by the gods but in a fog which has natural causes first there is the untrustworthiness of attempts to analyse proper names with every proper name the etymological operation is by one degree more difficult than with an appellative we have to deal with two unknown quantities origin and meaning whereas in appellatives we know the meaning and have only to hunt for the origin and of all proper names mythological names are the most difficult to interpret curtius has shown how many paths may be taken in the analysis of the name achilles the second part may be of the stem people or the stem stone does the first part of the word mean water cf aqua or is it equivalent to bulwark or the people or is it akin to one who causes pain or is the prothetic and is it the root and does it mean clearshining or is the word related to  and does it mean dark  all these and other explanations are offered by the learned and are chosen by curtius to show the uncertainty and difficulty of the etymological process as applied to names in myth cornutus remarked long ago that the great antiquity of the name of athene made its etymology difficult difficult it remains whatever the science of language may accomplish in the future it is baffled for the present by the divine names of greece or by most of them and these the most important        cf curtius greek etym engl transl i 137139

the names of the high gods  there is another reason for the obscurity of the topic besides the darkness in which the origin of the names has been wrapped by time the myths had been very long in circulation before we first meet them in homer and hesiod we know not whence the gods came perhaps some of them were the chief divine conceptions of various hellenic clans before the union of clans into states however this may be when we first encounter the gods in homer and hesiod they have been organised into a family with regular genealogies and relationships functions have been assigned to them and departments was hermes always the herald was hephaestus always the artisan was athene from the first the wellbeloved daughter of zeus was apollo from the beginning the mediator with men by oracles who can reply we only know that the divine ministry has been thoroughly organised and departments assigned as in a cabinet before we meet the gods on olympus what they were in the ages before this organisation we can only conjecture some may have been adopted from clans whose chief deity they were if any one took all the samoan gods he could combine them into a family with due functions and gradations no one man did this we may believe for greece though herodotus thought it was done by homer and hesiod the process went on through centuries we know not of still less do we know what or where the gods were before the process began  thus the obscurity in which the divine origins are hidden is natural and inevitable our attempt has been to examine certain birthmarks which the gods bear from that hidden antiquity relics of fur and fin and feather inherited from ancestral beasts like those which ruled egyptian american and australian religions we have also remarked the brilliant divinity of beautiful form which the gods at last attained in marble in gold in ivory and in the fancy of poets and sculptors here is the truly hellenic element here is the idealathene arming hera with the girdle of aphrodite hermes with his wand apollo with the silver bowto this the hellenic intellect attained this ideal it made more imperishable than bronze finally the lovely shapes of gods defecate to a pure transparency in the religion of aristotle and plutarch but the gods remain beautiful in their statues beautiful in the hymns of pindar and the plays of sophocles hideous often in temple myth and ancient xoanon and secret rite till they are all good and evil cast out by christianity the most brilliant civilisation of the world never expelled the old savage from its myth and its ritual the lowest savagery scarcely ever if ever wholly loses sight of a heavenly father  in conclusion we may deprecate the charge of exclusivism the savage element is something nay is much in greek myth and ritual but it is not everything the truth grace and beauty of the myths are given by the clear spirit of hellas nor is all that may be deplored necessarily native we may well believe in borrowing from phoenicians who in turn may have borrowed from babylon examples of this process have occasionally been noted it will be urged by some students that the wild element was adopted from the religion of prehistoric races whom the greeks found in possession when first they seized the shores of the country this may be true in certain cases but historical evidence is not to be obtained we lose ourselves in theories of pelasgians and prepelasgians and la grece avant les grecs in any case the argument that the more puzzling part of greek myth is a survival would not be affected borrowed or inherited or imitated certain of the stories and rites are savage in origin and the argument insists on no more as to that portion of greek mythology     chapter xix heroic and romantic myths

all of them obviously aim at satisfying curiosity about the causes of things at supplying gaps in human knowledge the naturemyths account for various aspects of nature from the reed by the riverside that once was a fair maiden pursued by pan to the remotest star that was a mistress of zeus from the reason why the crow is black to the reason why the sun is darkened in eclipse the divine myths again are for the more part essays in the same direction they try to answer these questions who made things how did this world begin what are the powers felt to be greater than ourselves which regulate the order of events and control the destinies of men myths reply to all these questionings and the answers are always in accordance with that early nebulous condition of thought and reason where observation lapses into superstition religion into science science into fancy knowledge into fable in the same manner the myths which we do not treat of herethe myths of the origin of death of mans first possession of fire and of the nature of his home among the deadare all tentative contributions to knowledge all seek to satisfy the eternal human desire to know whence came death man asks and the myths answer him with a story of pandora of maui of the moon and the hare or the bat and the tree how came fire to be a servant of ours the myths tell of prometheus the firestealer or of the firestealing wren or frog or coyote or cuttlefish what manner of life shall men live after death in what manner of home the myth answers with tales of pohjola of hades of amenti of all that in the

the flood we may return some other day for the present it must suffice to repeat that all these myths except perhaps the traditions of the deluge fill up gaps in early human knowledge and convey information as to matters outside of practical experience  but there are classes of tales or märchen or myths which as far as can be discovered have but little of the explanatory element though they have been interpreted as brokendown naturemyths the variety of the interpretations put upon them proves that at least their elemental meaning is dim and uncertain and makes it very dubious whether they ever had any such significance at all it is not denied here that some of these myths and tales may have been suggested by elemental and meteorological phenomena for example when we find almost everywhere among european peasants and among samoyeds and zulus as in greek heroicmyths of the jason cycle the story of the children who run away from a cannibal or murderous mother or stepmother we are reminded of certain naturemyths the stars are often said to be the children of the sun and to flee away at dawn lest he or their mother the moon should devour them this early observation may have started the story of flight from the cannibal parents and the legend may have been brought down from heaven to earth yet this were perhaps a farfetched hypothesis of the origin of a tale which may readily have been born wherever human beings have a tendency as in north america and south africa to revert to cannibalism        naturemyths vol i p 130 the story is asterinos und      pulja in von hahns griech und alban marchen compare      samojedische marchen castren varies uber die alt volk      p 164 callaway uzembeni  the peculiarity then of the myths which we propose to call heroic and romantic tales märchen contes populaires is the absence as a rule of any obvious explanatory purpose they are romances or novels and if they do explain anything it is rather the origin or sanction of some human law or custom than the cause of any natural phenomenon that they expound  the kind of traditional fictions here described as heroic and romantic may be divided into three main categories  1 first we have the popular tales of the lower and more backward races with whom may be reckoned for our present purpose the more remote and obscure peoples of america we find popular tales among the bushmen kaffirs zulus samoans maoris hurons samoyeds eskimos crees blackfeet and other socalled savage races we also find tales practically identical in character and often in plot and incident among such a people as the huarochiris a civilised race brought under the inca empire some three generations before the spanish conquest the characteristics of these tales are the presence of talking and magically helpful beasts the human powers and personal existence of even inanimate objects the miraculous accomplishments of the actors the introduction of beings of another race usually hostile the power of going to and returning from hadesalways described in much the same imaginative manner the persons are sometimes anonymous sometimes are named while the name is not celebrated more frequently the tribal culturehero demiurge or god is the leading character in these stories in accordance with the habits of savage fancy the chief person is often a beast such as ananzi the west african spider cagn the bushman grasshopper or michabo the algonkin whitehare animals frequently take parts assigned to men and women in european märchen  2 in the second place we have the märchen or contes or household tales of the modern european asiatic and indian peasantry the tales collected by the grimms by afanasief by von hahn by miss frere by miss maive stokes by m sebillot by campbell of islay and by so many others every reader of these delightful collections knows that the characteristics the machinery all that excites wonder are the same as in the savage heroic tales just described but it is a peculiarity of the popular tales of the peasantry that the places are seldom named the story is not localised and the characters are anonymous occasionally our lord and his saints appear and satan is pretty frequently present always to be defeated and disgraced but as a rule the hero is a boy a poor man a fiddler a soldier and so forth no names being given  3 thirdly we have in epic poetry and legend the romantic and heroic tales of the great civilised races or races which have proved capable of civilisation these are the indians the greeks romans celts scandinavians and germans these have won their way into the national literatures and the region of epic we find them in the odyssey the edda the celtic poems the ramayana and they even appear in the veda they occur in the legends and pedigrees of the royal heroes of greece and germany they attach themselves to the dim beginnings of actual history and to real personages like charlemagne they even invade the legends of the saints the characters are national heroes such as perseus jason Ædipus and olympian gods and holy men and women dear to the church and primal heroes of the north sigurd and signy their paths and places are not in dim fairyland but in the fields and on the shores we knowat rolands pass in the pyrenees on the enchanted colchian coast or among the blameless ethiopians or in thessaly or in argos now in all these three classes of romance savage fables rural märchen greek or german epics the ideas and incidents are analogous and the very conduct of the plot is sometimes recognisably the same the moral ideas on which many of the märchen sagas or epic myths turn are often identical everywhere we find doors or vessels which are not to be opened regulations for the conduct of husband and wife which are not to be broken everywhere we find helpful beasts birds and fishes everywhere we find legends proving that one cannot outwit his fate or evade the destiny prophesied for him  the chief problems raised by these sagas and stories are1 how do they come to resemble each other so closely in all parts of the world 2 were they invented once for all and transmitted all across the world from some centre 3 what was that centre and what was the period and the process of transmission  before examining the solutions of those problems certain considerations may be advanced  the supernatural stuff of the stories the threads of the texture the belief in the life and personality of all thingsin talking beasts and trees in magical powers in the possibility of visiting the diadmust on our theory as already set forth be found wherever men have either passed through savagery and retainedsurvivals of that intellectual condition or wherever they have borrowed or imitated such survivals  by this means without further research we may account for the similarity of the stuff of heroic myths and marchen the stuff is the same as in nature myths and divine myths but how is the similarity of the arrangement of the incidents and ideas into plots to be accounted for the sagas epic myths and marchen do not appear to resemble each other everywhere as the naturemyths do because they are the same ideas applied to the explanation of the same set of natural facts the sagas epics and marchen seem to explain nothing but to be told in the first instance either to illustrate and enforce a moral or for the mere pleasure of imaginative narration  we are thus left provisionally with the notion that occasionally the resemblance of plot and arrangement may be accidental in shaking the mental kaleidoscope which contains a given assortment of ideas analogous combinations may not impossibly be now and then produced everywhere or the story may have been invented once for all in one centre but at a period so incalculably remote that it has filtered in the exchanges and contacts of prehistoric life all over the world even to or from the western pacific and the lonely oceanic islands or once more the story may have had a centre in the old world say in india may have been carried to europe by oral tradition or in literary vehicles like the pantschatantra or the hitopadesa or by gypsies may have reached the sailors and trappers and miners of civilisation and may have been communicated by them in times subsequent to the discovery of america by columbus to the backward races of the world  these are preliminary statements of possibilities and theories more or less based on those ideas are now to be examined  the best plan may be to trace briefly the history of the study of popular tales as early as charles perraults time 1696 popular traditional tales had attracted some curiosity more or less scientific mademoiselle lheritier the abbe villiers and even the writer of the dedication of perraults contes to mademoiselle had expressed opinions as to the purposes for which they were first told and the time and place where they probably arose the troubadours the arabs and the fanciful invention of peasant nurses were vaguely talked of as possible first authors of the popular tales about the same time huet bishop of avranches had remarked that the hurons in north america amused their winter leisure with narratives in which beasts endowed with speech and reason were the chief characters  little was done to secure the scientific satisfaction of curiosity about traditional folktales contes or marchen till the time when the brothers grimm collected the stories of hesse the grimms became aware that the stories were common to the peasant class in most european lands and that they were also known in india and the east as they went on collecting they learned that african and north american tribes also had their marchen not differing greatly in character from the stories familiar to german firesides  already sir walter scott had observed in a note to the lady of the lake that a work of great interest might be compiled upon the origin of popular fiction and the transmission of similar tales from age to age and from country to country the mythology of one period would then appear to pass into the romance of the next and that into the nursery tales of subsequent ages this opinion has long been almost universal thus if the story of jason is found in greek myths and also with a difference in popular modern marchen the notion has been that the marchen is the last and youngest form the detritus of the myth now as the myth is only known from literary sources homer mimnermus apollonius rhodius euripides and so on it must follow on this theory that the people had borrowed from the literature of the more cultivated classes as a matter of fact literature has borrowed far more from the people than the people have borrowed from literature though both processes have been at work in the course of history but the question of the relations of marchen to myths and of both to romance may be left unanswered for the moment more pressing questions are what is the origin and where the original home of the marchen or popular tales and how have they been so widely diffused all over the world  the answers given to these questions have naturally been modified by the widening knowledge of the subject one answer seemed plausible when only the common character of european contes was known another was needed when the aryan peoples of the east were found to have the same stories another or a modification of the second was called for when marchen like those of europe were found among the negroes the indians of brazil the ancient huarochiri of peru the people of madagascar the samoyeds the samoans the dene hareskins of the extreme american northwest the zulus and kaffirs the bushmen the finns the japanese the arabs and the swahilis  the grimms in the appendix to their household tales give a list of the stories with which they were acquainted out of europe they note first the literary collections of the east the thousand and one nights and the hitopadesa which with the book of sindabad and the pantschatantra and the katharit sagara contain almost all of the oriental tales that filtered into western literature through written translations the grimms had not our store of folktales recently collected from the lips of the aryan and nonaryan natives of hindostan such as the works of miss maive stokes of miss frere of captain steel of mr lai behar day and the few santal stories but the grimms had some kalmuck stories         mrs hunts translation london 1884         the relations of ssidi kur in bergmanns nomadische      stretfereien vol i  one or two chinese and japanese examples had fallen into their hands and all this as early as 1822 in later years they picked up a malay story some bechuana tales koelles kanuri or bornu stories schoolcrafts and james athearn joness north american legends finnish esthonian and mongolian narratives and an increasing store of european contes the grimms were thus not unaware that the märchen with their surprising resemblances of plot and incident had a circulation far beyond the limits of the ayran peoples they were specially struck as was natural by the reappearance of incidents analogous to those of the german contes such as machandelboom and the singing bone 47 28 among the remote bechuanas of south africa they found too that in sierra leone beasts and birds play the chief parts in märchen they have a much closer connection with humanity nay they have even priests as the animals in guiana have peays or sorcerers of their own only the beasts of the country itself appear in the märchen among these bornu legends they found several tales analogous to faithful john 6 and to one in straparolas piacevoli notti venice 1550 a story by the way which recurs among the santals an aboriginal tribe of india it is the tale of the man who knows the language of animals and is warned by them against telling secrets to women among the indians of north america grimm found the analogue of his tale 182 of the elves gifts which by the way also illustrates a proverb in japan finnish tartar and indian analogues were discovered in plenty  such were grimms materials much less abundant than ours indeed but sufficient to show him that the resemblance existing between the stories not only of nations widely removed from each other by time and distance but also between those which lie near together consists partly in the underlying idea and the delineation of particular characters and partly in the weaving together and unravelling of incidents how are these resemblances to be explained that is the question grimms answer was as ours must still be only a suggestion there are situations so simple and natural that they reappear everywhere just like the isolated words which are produced in a nearly or entirely identical form in languages which have no connection with each other by the mere imitation of natural sounds thus to a certain but in grimms opinion to a very limited extent the existence of similar situations in the marchen of the most widely separated peoples is the result of the common facts of human thought and sentiment  to repeat a convenient illustration if we find talking and rational beasts and inanimate objects and the occurrence of metamorphosis and of magic and of cannibals and of ghosts as we do in the marchen as in the higher myths of all the world and if we also find certain curious human customs in the contes these resemblances may be explained as born of the same early condition of human fancy which regards all known things as personal and animated which believes in ghosts and magic while men also behave in accordance with customs now obsolete and forgotten in civilisation these common facts are the threads as we have said in the cloth of myth and marchen they were supplied by the universal early conditions of the prescientific human intellect thus the stuff of marchen is everywhere the same but why are the patternsthe situations and the arrangements and sequence of incidentsalso remarkably similar in the contes of unrelated and unconnected tribes and races everywhere  here the difficulty begins in earnest  it is clearly not enough to force the analogy and reply that the patterns of early fabrics and the decorations of early weapons of pottery tattooing marks and so forth are also things universally human        see custom and myth the art of savages p 288  the close resemblances of undeveloped greek and mexican and other early artistic work are interesting but may be accounted for by similarity of materials of instruments of suggestions from natural objects and of inexperience in design the selections of similar situations and of similar patterns into which these are interwoven in märchen by greeks huarochiris of peru and samoans or eskimos is much more puzzling to account for  grimm gives some examples in which he thinks that the ideas and their collocations in the story can only have originally occurred to one mind once for all how is the wide distribution of such a story to be accounted for grimm first admits as rare exceptions the probability of a storys passing from one people to another and firmly rooting itself in foreign soil but such cases he says are one or two solitary exceptions whereas the diffusion of stories which in his opinion could only have been invented once for all is an extensive phenomenon he goes on to say we shall be asked where the outermost lines of common property in stories begin and how the lines of affinity are gradated his answer was not satisfactory even to himself and the additions to our knowledge have deprived it of any value the outermost lines are coterminous with those of the great race which is called indogermanic outside of the indogermanic or aryan race that is to say are found none of the märchen which are discovered within the borders of that race but grimm knew very well himself that this was an erroneous belief we see with amazement in such of the stories of the negroes of bornu and the bechuanas a wandering tribe in south africa as we have become acquainted with an undeniable connection with the german ones while at the same time their peculiar composition distinguishes them from these so grimm though he found no decided resemblance in north american stories admitted that the boundaries of common property in marchen did include more than the indogermanic race bechuanas and negroes and finns as he adds and as sir george dasent saw are certainly within the fold        popular tales from the norse 1859 pp liv lv  there william grimm left the question in 1856 his tendency apparently was to explain the community of the marchen on the hypothesis that they were the original common store of the undivided aryan people carried abroad in the long wanderings of the race but he felt that the presence of the marchen among bechuanas negroes and finns was not thus to be explained at the same time he closed the doors against a theory of borrowing except in solitary exceptions and against the belief in frequent separate and independent evolution of the same story in various unconnected regions thus grimm states the question but does not pretend to have supplied its answer  the solutions offered on the hypothesis that the marchen are exclusively aryan and that they are the detritus or youngest and latest forms of myths while these myths are concerned with the elemental phenomena of nature and arose out of the decay of language have been so frequently criticised that they need not long detain us the most recent review of the system is by m cosquin in place of repeating objections which have been frequently urged by the present writer an abstract of m cosquins reasons for differing from the aryan theory of von hahn may be given voh hahn was the collector and editor of stories from the modern greek and his work is scholarly and accomplished he drew up comparative tables showing the correspondence between greek and german märchen on the one side and greek and teutonic epics and higher legends or sagas on the other he also attempted to classify the stories in a certain number of recurring formula or plots lin von hahns opinion the stories were originally the myths of the undivided aryan people in its central asian home as the different branches scattered and separated they carried with them their common store of myths which were gradually worn down into the detritus of popular stories the youngest form of the myth the same theory appeared in 1859 in mr max mullers chips from a german workshop the undivided aryan people possessed in its mythological and proverbial phraseology the seeds or germs more or less developed which would nourish under any sky into very similar plantsthat is the popular stories        see our introduction to mrs hunts translation of grimms      household tales        contes populaire de lorraine paris 1886 pp i xv         grieschische und albanesische marchen 1864        vol ii p 226  against these ideas m cosquin argues that if the aryan people before its division preserved the myths only in their earliest germinal form it is incredible that when the separated branches had lost touch of each other the final shape of their myths the märchen should have so closely resembled each other as they do the aryan theory as it may be called for the sake of brevity rejects as a rule the idea that tales can as a rule have been borrowed even by one aryan people from another nursery tales are generally the last things to be borrowed by one nation from another then says m cosquin as the undivided aryan people had only the myths in their least developed state and as the existing peasantry have only the detritus of these mythsthe märchenand as you say borrowing is out of the question how do you account for a coincidence like this in the punjaub among the bretons the albanians the modern greeks and the russians we find a conte in which a young man gets possession of a magical ring this ring is stolen from him and recovered by the aid of certain grateful beasts whom the young man has benefited his foe keeps the ring in his mouth but the grateful mouse insinuating his tail into the nose of the thief makes him sneeze and out comes the magical ring        cox mythol of aryan nations i 109        max müller chips ii 216  common sense insists says m cosquin that this detail was invented once for all it must have first occurred not in a myth but in a conte or märchen from which all the others alike proceed therefore if you wish the idea of the mouse and the ring and the sneeze to be a part of the store of the undivided aryans you must admit that they had contes märchen popular stories what you call the detritus of myths as well as myths themselves before they left their cradle in central asia nos ancetres les peres des nations europeennes auraient de cette facon emporte dans leurs fourgons la collection complete de contes ibleus actuels in short if there was no borrowing myths have been reduced on the aryan theory to the condition of detritus to the diamond dust of marchen before the aryan people divided but this is contrary to the hypothesis  m cosquin does not pause here the märchenmouse ring sneeze and allis found among nonaryan tribes the inhabitants of mardin in mesopotamia and the kariaines of birmanie well if there was no borrowing how did the nonaryan peoples get the story        cosquin i xi xii with his authorities in note 1  m cosquin concludes that the theory he attacks is untenable and determines that after having been invented in this place or that which we must discover if we can the popular tales of the various european nations to mention these alone have spread all over the world from people to people by way of borrowing in arriving at this opinion m cosquin admits as is fair that the grimms not having our knowledge of nonaryan märchen mongol syrian arab kabyle swahili annamitehe might have added very many more could not foresee all the objections to the theory of a store common to aryans alone  were we constructing an elaborate treatise on  märchen it would be well in this place to discuss the aryan theory at greater length that theory turns on the belief that popular stories are the detritus of aryan myths it would be necessary then to discuss the philological hypothesis of the origin and nature of these original aryan myths themselves but to do so would lead us far from the study of mere popular tales  leaving the aryan theory we turn to that supported by m cosquin himselfthe theory as he says of benfey  inspired by benfey m cosquin says the method must be to take each type of story successively and to follow it if we can from age to age from people to people and see where this voyage of discovery will lead us now travelling thus from point to point often by different routes we always arrive at the same centre namely at india not the india of fabulous times but the india of actual history  the theory of m cosquin is then that the popular stories of the world or rather the vast majority of them were invented in india and that they were carried from india during the historical period by various routes till they were scattered over all the races among whom they are found  this is a venturesome theory and is admitted apparently to have its exceptions for example we possess ancient egyptian popular tales corresponding to those of the rest of the world but older by far than historical india from which according to m cosquin the stories set forth on their travels        it has already been attempted in our custom and myth      introduction to mrs hunts grimm la mythologie and      elsewhere        for m benfeys notions see bulletin de i academie de      saint petersburg september 416 1859 and pantschatantra      leipzig 1859        see m masperos collection contes populaires de      legypte ancienne paris 1882  one of these egyptian tales the two brothers was actually written down on the existing manuscript in the time of rameses ii some 1400 years before our era and many centuries before india had any known history no man can tell moreover how long it had existed before it was copied out by the scribe ennana now this tale according to m cosquin himself has points in common with märchen from hesse hungary russia modern greece france norway lithuania hungary servia annam modern india and we may add with samoyed märchen with hottentot marchen and with märchen from an aboriginal people of india the santals  we ask no more than this one märchen of ancient egypt to upset the whole theory that india was the original home of the contes and that from historic india they have been carried by oral transmission and in literary vehicles all over the world first let us tell the story briefly and then examine its incidents each separately and set forth the consequences of that examination  according to the story of the two brothers  once upon a time there were two brothers anapou was the elder the younger was called bitiou anapou was married and bitiou lived with him as his servant when he drove the cattle to feed he heard what they said to each other and drove them where they told him the pasture was best one day his brothers wife saw him carrying a very heavy burden of grain and she fell in love with his force and said come and lie with me and i will make thee goodly raiment  but he answered art thou not as my mother and my brother as a father to me speak to me thus no more and never will i tell any man what a word thou hast said  then she cast dust on her head and went to her husband saying thy brother would have lain with me slay him or i die  then the elder brother was like a panther of the south and he sharpened his knife and lay in wait behind the door and when the sun set bitiou came driving his cattle but the cow that walked before them all said to him there stands thine elder brother with his knife drawn to slay thee  then he saw the feet of his brother under the door and he fled his brother following him and he cried to ra and ra heard him and between him and his brother made a great water flow full of crocodiles  now in the morning the younger brother told the elder all the truth and he mutilated himself and cast it into the water and the calmar fish devoured it and he said i go to the valley of acacias possibly a mystic name for the next world and in an acacia tree i shall place my heart and if men cut the tree and my heart falls thou shalt seek it for seven years and lay it in a vessel of water then shall i live again and requite the evil that hath been done unto me and the sign that evil hath befallen me shall be when the cup of beer in thy hand is suddenly turbid and troubled  then the elder brother cast dust on his head and besmeared his face and went home and slew his wicked wife  now the younger brother dwelt in the valley of acacias and all the gods came by that way and they pitied his loneliness and chnum made for him a wife and the seven hathors came and prophesied saying she shall die an ill death and a violent and bitiou loved her and told her the secret of his life and that he should die when his heart fell from the acacia tree        chnum is the artificer among the gods  now a lock of the womans hair fell into the river and it floated to the place where pharaohs washermen were at work and the sweet lock perfumed all the raiment of pharaoh and the washermen knew not wherefore and they were rebuked then pharaohs chief washerman went to the water and found the hair of the wife of bitiou and pharaohs magicians went to him and said our lord thou must marry the woman from whose head this tress of hair hath floated hither and pharaoh hearkened unto them and he sent messengers even to the valley of acacias and they came unto the wife of bitiou and she said first you must slay my husband and she showed them the acacia tree and they out the flower that held the heart of bitiou and he died  then it so befel that the brother of bitiou held in his hand a cup of beer and lo the beer was troubled and he said alas my brother and he sought his brothers heart and he found it in the berry of the acacia then he laid it in a cup of fresh water and bitiou drank of it and his heart went into his own place and lived again  then said bitiou lo i shall become the bull even apis hapi and they led him to the king and all men rejoiced that apis was found but the bull went into the chamber of the kings women and he spake to the woman that had been the wife of bitiou and she was afraid and said to pharaoh wilt thou swear to give me my hearts desire and he swore it with an oath and she said slay that bull that i may eat his liver then felt pharaoh sick for sorrow yet for his oaths sake he let slay the bull and there fell of his blood two quarts on either side of the son of pharaoh and thence grew two persea trees great and fair and offerings were made to the trees as they had been gods  then the wife of pharaoh went forth in her chariot and the tree spake to her saying i am bitiou and she let cut down that tree and a chip leaped into her mouth and she conceived and bare a son and that child was bitiou and when he came to full age and was prince of that land he called together the councillors of the king and accused the woman and they slew her and he sent for his elder brother and made him a prince in the land of egypt  we now propose to show not only that the incidents of this talefar more ancient than historic india as it isare common in the märchen of many countries but that they are inextricably entangled and intertwisted with the chief plots of popular tales there are few of the main cycles of popular tales which do not contain as essential parts of their machinery one or more of the ideas and situations of this legend there is thus at least a presumption that these cycles of story may have been in existence in the reign of rameses ii and for an indefinite period earlier while if they were not and if they are made of borrowed materials it may have been from the egypt of an unknown antiquity not from much later indian sources that they were adapted  the incidents will now be analysed and compared with those of märchen in general  to this end let us examine the incidents in the ancient egyptian tale of the two brothers these incidents are  1 the spretæ injuria formæ of the wedded woman who having offered herself in vain to a man her brotherinlaw accuses him of being her assailant this incident of course occurs in homer in the tale of bellerophon before we know anything of historic india this moreover seems one of the notions m cosquin admits with benfey that there are such notions which are universally human and might be invented anywhere  2 the egyptian hippolytus is warned of his danger by his cow which speaks with human voice every one will recognise the ram which warns phrixus and helle in the jason legend in the albanian märchen a dog not a cow nor a ram gives warning of the danger animals in short often warn of danger by spoken messages as the fish does in the brahmanic delugemyth and the dog in a delugemyth from north america        the authority cited by the scholiast apoll rhod      argon i 256 is hecatseus   scholiast on iliad vii 86      quotes philostephanus         von hahn i 65  3 the accused brother is pursued by his kinsman and about to be slain when ra at his prayer casts between him and the avenger a stream full of crocodiles this incident is at least not very unlike one of the most widely diffused of all incidents of storythe flight in which the runaways cause magical rivers or lakes suddenly to cut off the pursuer this narrative of the flight and the obstacles is found in scotch gaelic japanese no water obstacle zulu russian samoan and in the red horse of the delawares a story from dacotah as well as in india and elsewhere the difference is that in the egyptian conte as it has reached us in literary form the fugitive appeals to ra to help him instead of magically making a river by throwing water or a bottle behind him as is customary it may be conjectured that the substitution of divine intervention in response to prayer for magical selfhelp is the change made by a priestly scribe in the traditional version        see folklore journal april 1886 review of houstons      popular stories for examples of the magic used in the      flight        maspero contes p 13 note 1  4 next morning the brothers parley across the stream the younger first mutilates himself atys then says he is going to the vale of the acacia according to m maspero probably a name for the other world meanwhile the younger brother will put his heart in a high acacia tree if the tree is cut down the elder brother must search for the heart and place it in a jar of water when the younger brother will revive here we have the idea which recurs in the samoyed marchen where the men lay aside their hearts in which are their separable lives as mr  ralston says this heartbreaking episode occurs in the tales of many lands in the russian the story is koschchei the deathless whose death or life lies in an egg in a duck on a log in the ice as mr ralston well remarks a very singular parallel to the revival of the egyptian brothers heart in water is the hottentot tale of a girl eaten by a lion her heart is extracted from the lion is placed in a calabash of milk and the girl comes to life again  5 the younger brother gives the elder a sign magical whereby he shall know how it fares with the heart when a cup of beer suddenly grows turbid then evil has befallen the heart this is merely one of the old sympathetic signs of storythe opal that darkens the comb of lemminkainen in the kalewala that drops blood when its owner is in danger the stick that the hero erects as he leaves home and which will fall when he is imperilled in australia the natives practise this magic with a stick round which they bind the hair of the distant person about whose condition they want to be informed this incident turning on the belief in sympathies might perhaps be regarded as universally human and capable of being invented anywhere        russian folktales 109        in norse asbjornsen and moe 36

life of bitiou he becomes an apis bull and his faithless wife desires his death and wishes to eat his liver but his life goes on in other forms this is merely the familiar situation of the ass in peau

by an enemy yet potent after death this beast takes the part given by perrault to the fairy godmother the idea is also familiar in grimms machandelboom 47 and was found by casalis among the bechuanas

of blood turning into trees from hesse wolf p 394 and from russian we may add the ancient lydian myth when the gods slew agdistis a drop of his blood became an almond tree the fruit of which made women pregnant        pausanias vii 17  13 the persea tree is also cut down by the wicked wife of bitiou a chip from its boughs is swallowed by the wicked wife who conceives like margata in the kalewala and bears a son  the story of agdistis just quoted is in point but the topic is of enormous range and the curious may consult le fils de vierge by m h de charencey compare also surya bay in

one of the fruits falls into a calabash of milk and out of the calabash like the hottentot girl comes surya  14 the son of the persea tree was bitiou born of his own faithless wife and when he grew up he had her put to death  even a hasty examination of these incidents from old egypt proves that before india was heard of in history the people of the pharaohs possessed a large store of incidents perfectly familiar in modern marchen now if one single egyptian tale yields this rich supply it is an obvious presumption that the collection of an egyptian grimm might and probably would have furnished us with the majority of the situations common in popular tales m cosquin himself remarks that these ideas cannot be invented more than once i lxvii the other egyptian contes as that of le prince predestine twentieth dynasty and the noted master thief of herodotus ii 121 are merely familiar marchen of the common type and have numerous wellknown analogues  from all these facts m cosquin draws no certain conclusions he asks did egypt borrow these tales from india or india from egypt and were there aryans in india in the time of rameses ii  these questions are beyond conjecture we know nothing of egyptian relations with prehistoric india we know not how many aeons the tale of the two brothers may have existed in egypt before ennana the head librarian wrote it out for pharaohs treasurer qagabou  what we do know is that if we find a large share of the whole stock of incident of popular tale fully developed in one single story long before india was historic it is perfectly vain to argue that all stories were imported from historic india it is impossible to maintain that the single centre whence the stories spread was not the india of fable but the india of history when we discover such abundance of story material in egypt before as far as is known india \ had even become the india of fable  the topic is altogether too obscure for satisfactory argument certainly the märchen were at home in egypt before we have even reason to believe that egypt and india were conscious of each others existence  the antiquity of märchen by the nileside touches geological time if we agree with m maspero that bitiou is a form of osiris that is that the osiris myth may have been developed out of the bitiou märchen        maspero op cit p 17 note 1  the osiris myth is as old as the egypt we know and the story of bitiou may be either the detritus or the germ of the myth this gives it a dateless antiquity and with this märchen the kindred and allied märchen establish a claim to enormous age but it is quite impossible to say when these tales were first invented we cannot argue that the cradle of a story is the place where it first received literary form we know not whence the egyptians came to nileside we know not whether they brought the story with them or found it among some nameless earlier people fugitives from kor perhaps or anywhere else we know not whether the remote ancestors of modern peoples african or european or asiatic who now possess forms of the tale borrowed it from a people more ancient than egypt or from egypt herself these questions are at present insoluble we only know for certain that when we find anywhere any one of the numerous incidents of the story of the two brothers we can be certain that their original home was not historic india there is also the presumption that if we knew more of the tales of ancient egypt we could as definitely refuse to regard historic india as the cradle of many other märchen  thus in opposition to the hypothesis of borrowing from india we reach some distinct and assured though negative truths  1 so far as the ideas in the two brothers are representative of märchen and these ideas are inextricably interwoven with some of the most typical legends historic india is certainly and demonstrably not the cradle of popular tales these are found far earlier already in the written literature of egypt  2 as far as these ideas are representative of märchen there is absolutely no evidence to show that märchen sprang from india whether historical or prehistoric nor is any connection proved between ancient egypt and prehistoric india  3 as far as märchen are represented by the ideas in the two brothers and the predestined prince there is absolutely no evidence to show in what region or where they were originally invented  the bellerophon story rests on a donnee in the two brothers the flight rests on another cinderella reposes on a third the giant with no heart in his body depends on a fourth the milkwhite dove on the same and these incidents occur in hottentot bechuana samoyed samoan as well as in greek scotch german gaelia now as all these incidents existed in egyptian marchen fourteen hundred years before christ they may have been dispersed without indian intervention one of the white raiders from the northern sea may have been made captive like the pseudodysseus in egypt may have heard the tales may have been ransomed and carried the story to greece or libya whence a greek got it southwards it may have passed up the nile to the great lakes and down the congo and zambesi and southward ever with the hordes of tchakas ancestors all these processes are possible and even probable but absolutely nothing is known for certain on the subject it is only as manifest as facts can be that all this might have occurred if the indian peninsula did not exist another objection to the hypothesis of distribution from historic india is the existence of sagas or epic legends corresponding to marchen in prehomeric greece the story of jason for example is in its essential features perhaps the most widely diffused of all the story of the return of the husband and of his difficult recognition by his wife the central idea of the odyssey is of wide distribution and the odyssey as fenelon makes the ghost of achilles tell homer in hades is un amas de contes de vieilles the cyclops the siren scylla and the rest these tales did not reach greece from historic india at least and we have no reason for supposing that india before the dawn of history was their source        custom and myth a fartravelled tale         gerland alt griechische marchen in der odyssee  the reasons for which india has been regarded as a great centre and fountainhead of popular stories are on the other hand excellent if the theory is sufficiently limited the cause is vera causa marchen certainly did set out from mediaeval india and reached mediaeval europe and asia in abundance not to speak of oral communications in the great movements missions and migrations tartar crusading gypsy commercial and buddhisticin all of which there must have been swopping of storiesit is certain that western literature was actually invaded by the contes which had won away into the literature of india these are facts beyond doubt but these facts must not be made the basis of too wide an inference though so many stories have demonstrably been borrowed from india in the historical period it is no less certain that many existed in europe before their introduction again as has been ably argued by a writer in the athenaeum april 23 1887 the literary versions of the tales probably had but a limited influence on the popular narrators the village gossips and grandmothers thus no collection of published tales has ever been more popular than that of charles perrault which for many years has been published not only in cheap books but in cheaper broadsheets        cosquin op cit i xv xxiv max müller the      migrations of fables selected essays vol ii appendix      benfey pantschatantra comparetti introduction to book of      sindibad english translation of the folklore society  yet m sebillot and other french collectors gather from the lips of peasants versions of cinderella for example quite unaffected by perraults version and rich in archaic features such as the presence of a miracleworking beast instead of a fairy godmother that detail is found in kaffir and santhal and finnish as well as in celtic and portuguese and scottish variants and has been preserved in popular french traditions despite the influence of perrault in the same way m carnoy finds only the faintest traces of the influence of a collection so popular as the arabian nights the peasantry regard tales which they read in books as quite apart from their inherited store of legend        sebillots popular cendrillon is le taureau bleu in contes      de la haute bretagne   see also m carnoys contes      francais 1885 p 9  if printed literature has still so little power over popular tradition the manuscript literature of the middle ages must have had much less though sometimes contes from india were used as parables by preachers thus we must beware of overestimating the effect of importation from india even where it distinctly existed even the versions that were brought in the middle ages by oral tradition must have encountered versions long settled in europeversions which may have been current before any scribe of egypt perpetuated a legend on papyrus  once more the indian theory has to account for the presence of tales in africa and america among populations which are not known to have had any contact with india at all where such examples are urged it is usual to say that the stories either do not really resemble our märchen or are quite recent importations by europeans dutch french english and others here we are on ground where proof is difficult if not impossible assuredly french influence declares itself in certain narratives collected from the native tribes of north america on the other hand when the märchen is interwoven with the national traditions and poetry of a remote people and with the myths by which they account to themselves for the natural features of their own country the hypothesis of recent borrowing from europeans appears insufficient a striking example is the song of siati a form of the jason myth among the people of samoa even more remarkable is the presence of a crowd of familiar märchen in the national traditions of the huarochiri a preinca civilised race of southern peru these were published or at least collected and written down by francisco de avila a spanish priest about 1608 he remarks that these traditions are deeply rooted in the hearts of the people of this province these traditions refer to certain prehistoric works of engineering or accidents of soil whereby the country was drained the huarochiri explained them by a series of märchen about huthiacuri pariaca cultureheroes and about friendly animals which aided them in the familiar way in the same manner exactly the people of the marais of poitou have to account for the drainage of the country a work of the twelfth century        cosquin op cit 1 xix        turners samoa p 102        rites of the incas hakluyt society the third document      in the book the märchen have been examined by me in the      marriage of cupid and psyche p lxxii  they attribute the old works to the local hero gargantua who drank up all the water no one supposes that this legend is borrowed from rabelais and it seems even more improbable that the huarochiri hastily borrowed märchen from the spaniards and converted them before 1600 into national myths        revue des traditions populaires april 251887 p 186  we have few opportunities of finding examples of remote american märchen recorded so early as this and generally the hypothesis of recent borrowing from europeans or from negroes influenced by europeans is at least possible and it would be hard to prove a negative but the case of the huarochiri throws doubt on the hypothesis of recent borrowing as the invariable cause of the diffusion of märchen in places beyond the reach of historic india  the only way outside of direct evidence to prove borrowing would be to show that ideas and customs peculiarly indian for example occur in the märchen of people destitute of these ideas but it would be hard to ask believers in the indian theory to exhibit such survivals in the first place if contes have been borrowed it seems that a new local colour was given to them almost at the moment of transference the zulu and kaffir märchen are steeped in zulu and kaffir colour and the life they describe is rich in examples of rather peculiar native rites and ceremonies seldom if ever essential to the conduct of the tale thus if stories are adapted like french plays in the moment of borrowing it will be cruel to ask supporters of the indian theory for traces of indian traits and ideas in european märchen again apart from special yet nonessential matters of etiquette such as the ceremonies with which certain kinsfolk are treated or the initiation of girls at the marriageable age the ideas and customs found in marchen are practically universal as has been shown the supernatural stuffmetamorphosis equality of man beasts and things magic and the likeis universal thus little remains that could be fixed on as especially the custom or idea of any one given people for instance in certain variants of puss in boots swahili avar neapolitan the beasthero makes it a great point that when he dies he is to be honourably buried now what peoples give beasts honourable burial we know the cases of ancient egyptians samoans arabs and athenians in the case at least of the wolf and probably there are many more thus even so peculiar an idea or incident as this cannot be proved to belong to a definite region or to come from any one original centre        see deulin gontes de ma mire loye and reinhold kohler      in gonzenbachs siclianische marchen no 65  by the very nature of the case therefore it is difficult for m cosquin and other supporters of the indian theory to prove the existence of indian ideas in european marchen nor do they establish this point they urge that charity to beasts and the gratitude of beasts as contrasted with human lack of gratitude are indian and perhaps buddhist ideas thus the buddha gave his own living body to a famished tigress but so according to garcilasso were the subjects of the incas wont to do and they were not buddhists the beasts in marchen again are just as often or even more frequently helpful to men without any motive of gratitude nor would it be fair to argue that the notion of gratitude has dropped out because we find friendly beasts all the world over totems and manitous who have never been benefited by man the favours are all on the side of the totems it is needless to adduce again the evidence on this topic m cosquin adds that the belief in the equality and interchangeability of attributes and aspect between man and beast is une idee bien indienne and derived from the doctrine of metempsychosis qui efface la distinction entre lhomme et lanimal et qui en tout vivant voit un frere but it has been demonstrated that this belief in the equality and kinship not only of all animate but all inanimate nature is the very basis of australian zuni and all other philosophies of the backward races no idea can be less peculiar to india it is universal once more the belief that shapeshifting metamorphosis can be achieved by skinshifting by donning or doffing the hide of a beast is no more peculiarly indian than the other conceptions benfey to be sure laid stress on this point but it is easy to produce examples of skinshifting and consequent metamorphosis from roman north american old scandinavian thlinkeet slav and vogul ritual and myths there remains only a trace of polygamy in european marchen to speak of specially indian influence but polygamy is not peculiar to india nor is monogamy a recent institution in europe        pantschatantra i 265        marriage of cupid and psyche pp lx lxiv where      examples and authorities are given        cosquin op cit i xxx  thus each peculiarly indian idea supposed to be found in marchen proves to be practically universal so the whole indian hypothesis is attacked on every side contes are far older than historic india nothing raises even a presumption that they first arose in prehistoric india they are found in places where they could hardly have travelled from historic india their ideas are not peculiarly indian and though many reached europe and asia in literary form derived from india during the middle ages and were even used as parables in sermons yet the majority of european folktales have few traces of indian influence some examples of this influence as when the framework of an oriental collection has acquired popular circulation will be found in professor cranes interesting book italian popular tales pp 168 359 but to admit this is very different from asserting that german hausmarchen are all derived from indian and arabian originals with necessary changes of costume and manners which is apparently the opinion of some students  what remains to do is to confess ignorance of the original centre of the märchen and inability to decide dogmatically which stories must have been invented only once for all and which may have come together by the mere blending of the universal elements of imagination it is only certain that no limit can be put to a storys power of flight per ora virum it may wander wherever merchants wander wherever captives are dragged wherever slaves are sold wherever the custom of exogamy commands the choice of alien wives thus the story flits through the who let race and over the whole world wherever human communication is or has been possible there the story may go and the space of time during which the courses of the sea and the paths of the land have been open to story is dateless and unknown here the story may dwindle to a fireside tale there it may become an epic in the mouth of homer or a novel in the hands of madame daulnoy or miss thackeray the savage makes the characters beasts or birds the epic \ poet or sagaman made them heroic kings or lovely baleful sorceresses daughters of the sun the french countess makes them princesses and countesses like its own heroes the popular story can assume every shape like some of them it has drunk the waters of immortality        a curious essay by mr h e warner on the magical      flight urges that there is no plot but only a fortuitous      congeries of storyatoms scribners magazine june 1887      there is a good deal to be said in this case for mr      warners conclusions     appendix a fontenelles forgotten common sense  in the opinion of aristotle most discoveries and inventions have been made time after time and forgotten again aristotle may not have been quite correct in this view and his remarks perhaps chiefly applied to politics in which every conceivable and inconceivable experiment has doubtless been attempted in a field of less general interestnamely the explanation of the absurdities of mythologythe true cause was discovered more than a hundred years ago by a man of great reputation and then was quietly forgotten why did the ancient peoplesabove all the greekstell such extremely gross and irrational stories about their gods and heroes that is the riddle of the mythological sphinx it was answered briefly wittily and correctly by fontenelle and the answer was neglected and half a dozen learned but impossible theories have since come in and out of fashion only within the last ten years has fontenelles idea been not resuscitated but rediscovered the followers of mr e b taylor mannhardt gaidoz and the rest do not seem to be aware that they are only repeating the notions of the nephew of corneille  the academicians theory is stated in a short essay de lorigine des fables oeuvres paris 1758 vol iii p270 we have been so accustomed from childhood he says to the absurdities of greek myth that we have ceased to be aware that they are absurd why are the legends of men and beasts and gods so incredible and revolting why have we ceased to tell such tales the answer is that early men were in a state of almost inconceivable savagery and ignorance and that the greek myths are inherited from people in that condition look at the kaffirs and iroquois says fontenelle if you wish to know what early men were like and remember that even the iroquois and kaffirs are people with a long past with knowledge and culture politesse which the first men did not enjoy now the more ignorant a man is the more prodigies he supposes himself to behold thus the first narratives of the earliest men were full of monstrous things parce quils etoient faits par des gens sujets a voir bien des choses qui netaient pas this condition answers in mr tylors system to the confusion the savage makes between dreams and facts and to the hallucinations which beset him when he does not get his regular meals here then we have a groundwork of irresponsible fancy  the next step is this even the rudest men are curious and ask the reason why of phenomena ii y a eu de la philosophie meme dans ces siecles grossiers and this rude philosophy greatly contributed to the origin of myths  men looked for causes of things whence comes this river asked the reflective man of those agesa queer philosopher yet one who might have been a descartes did he live today after long meditation he concluded that some one had always to keep filling the source whence the stream springs and whence came the water our philosopher did not consider so curiously he had evolved the myth of a waternymph or naiad and there he stopped the characteristic of these mythical explanationsas of all philosophies past present and to comewas that they were limited by human experience early mans experience showed him that effects were produced by conscious sentient personal causes like himself he sprang to the conclusion that all hidden causes were also persons these persons are the dramatis personæ of myth it was a person who caused thunder with a hammer or a mace or it was a bird whose wings produced the din  from this rough philosophy which prevailed in the early ages were born the gods and goddessesdeities made not only in the likeness of man but of savage man as he in his ignorance and superstition conceived himself to be fontenelle might have added that those fancied personal causes who became gods were also fashioned in the likeness of the beasts whom early man regarded as his equals or superiors but he neglects this point he correctly remarks that the gods of myth appear immoral to us because they were devised by men whose morality was all unlike ourswho prized justice less than power especially he might have added magical power as morality ripened into selfconsciousness the gods improved with the improvement of men and the gods known to cicero are much better than those known to homer because better philosophers have had a hand at their making moreover in the earliest speculations an imaginative and hairbrained philosophy explained all that seemed extraordinary in nature while the sphere of philosophy was filled by fanciful narratives about facts the constellations called the bears were accounted for as metamorphosed men and women indeed all the metamorphoses are the physical philosophy of these early times which accounted for every fact by what we now calletiological naturemyths even the peculiarities of birds and beasts were thus explained the partridge flies low because daedalus who had seen his son icarus perish through a lofty flight was changed into a partridge this habit of mind which finds a story for the solution of every problem survives fontenelle remarks in what we now call folklorepopular tradition thus the elder tree is said to have borne as good berries as the vine does till judas iscariot hanged himself from its branches this story must be later than christianity but it is precisely identical in character with those ancient metamorphoses which ovid collected the kind of fancy that produced these and other prodigious myths is not peculiar fontenelle maintains to eastern peoples it is common to all men at a certain mental stagein the tropics or in the regions of eternal ice thus the worldwide similarities of myths are on the whole the consequence of a worldwide uniformity of intellectual development  fontenelle hints at his proof of this theory he compares the myths of america with those of greece and shows that distance in space and difference of race do not hinder peruvians and athenians from being in the same tale for the greeks with all their intelligence did not in their beginnings think more rationally than the savages of america who were also apparently a rather primitive people assez nouveau he concludes that the americans might have become as sensible as the greeks if they had been allowed the leisure  with an exception in the israelites fontenelle decides that all nations made the astounding part of their myths while they were savages and retained them from custom and religious conservatism but myths were also borrowed and interchanged between phoenicia egypt and greece further greek misunderstandings of the meanings of phoenician and other foreign words gave rise to myths finally myths were supposed to contain treasures of antique mysterious wisdom and mythology was explained by systems which themselves are only myths stories told by the learned to themselves and to the public  it is not science to fill ones head with the follies of phoenicians and greeks but it is science to understand what led greeks and phoenicians to imagine these follies a better and briefer system of mythology could not be devised but the mr casaubons of this world have neglected it and even now it is beyond their comprehension     appendix b reply to objections  in a work which perhaps inevitably contains much controversial matter it has seemed best to consign to an appendix the answers to objections against the method advocated by this means the attention is less directed from the matter in hand the exposition of the method itself we have announced our belief that a certain element in mythology is derived from the mental condition of savages to this it is replied with perfect truth that there are savages and savages that a vast number of shades of culture and of nascent or retrograding civilisation exist among the races to whom the term savage is commonly applied this is not only true but its truth is part of the very gist of our theory it is our contention that myth is sensibly affected by the varieties of culture which prevail among socalled savage tribes as they approach to or decline from the higher state of barbarism the anthropologist is or ought to be the last man to lump all savages together as if they were all on the same level of culture  when we speak of the savage mental condition we mean the mental condition of all uncultivated races who still fail to draw any marked line between man and the animate or inanimate things in the world and who explain physical phenomena on a vague theory more or less consciously held that all nature is animated and endowed with human attributes this state of mind is nowhere absolutely extinct it prevails to a limited extent among untutored european peasantry and among the children of the educated classes but this intellectual condition is most marked and most powerful among the races which ascend from the condition of the australian murri and the bushmen up to the comparatively advanced maoris of new zealand and algonkins or zunis of north america these are the sorts of people who for our present purpose must be succinctly described as still in the savage condition of the imagination  again it is constantly objected to our method that we have no knowledge of the past of races at present in the savage status the savage are as old as the civilised races and can as little be named primitive writes dr fairbairn mr max müller complains with justice of authors who speak of the savage of today as if he had only just been sent into the world forgetting that as a living species he is probably not a day younger than ourselves but mr max müller has himself admitted all we want namely that savages or nomads represent an earlier stage of culture than even the ancient sanskritspeaking aryans this follows from the learned writers assertion that savage tongues kaffir and so forth are still in the childhood which hebrew and the most ancient sanskrit had long left behind them we see in them savage languages what we can no longer expect to see even in the most ancient sanskrit or hebrew we watch the childhood of language with all its childish pranks these pranks are the result of the very habits of savage thought which we regard as earlier than the most ancient sanskrit        academy 20th july 1878              a        hibb lect p 66        lectures on science of language 2nd series p 41  thus mr max müller has admitted all that we needadmitted that savage language and therefore in his view savage thought is of an earlier stratum than for example the language of the vedas no more valuable concession could be made by a learned opponent  objections of an opposite character however are pushed along with the statement that we have no knowledge of the past of savages savages were not always what they are now they may have degenerated from a higher condition their present myths may be the corruption of something purer and better above all savages are not primitive  all this contention whatever its weight does not affect the thesis of the present argument it is quite true that we know nothing directly of the condition let us say of the australian tribes a thousand years ago except that it has left absolutely no material traces of higher culture but neither do we know anything directly about the condition of the indoeuropean peoples five hundred years before philology fancies that she gets her earliest glimpse of them we must take people as we find them and must not place too much trust in our attempts to reconstruct their dark backward as to the past of savages it is admitted by most anthropologists that certain tribes have probably seen better days the fuegians and the bushmen and the digger indians were probably driven by stronger races out of seats comparatively happy and habits comparatively settled into their present homes and their present makeshift wretchedness        the fuegiaus are not morally and socially so black as      they have occasionally been painted but it is probable that      they have seen better days if the possession of a      language with apparently a very superfluous number of      words is a proof of high civilisation in the past then the      fuegians are degraded indeed but the finding of one piece      of native pottery in an australian burialmound would prove      more than a wilderness of irregular verbs  but while degeneration is admitted as an element in history there seems no tangible reason for believing that the highest state which bushmen fuegians or diggers ever attained and from which they can be thought to have fallen was higher than a rather more comfortable savagery there are ups and downs in savage as in civilised life and perhaps crowned races may degrade but we have no evidence to show that the ancestors of the diggers or the fuegians were a crowned race their descent has not been comparatively a very deep one their presumed former height was not very high as mr tylor observes so far as history is to be our criterion progression is primary and degradation secondary culture must be gained before it can be lost one thing about the past of savages we do know it must have been a long past and there must have been a period in it when the savage had even less of what aristotle calls  even less of the equipment and provision necessary for a noble life than he possesses at present his past must have been long because great length of time is required for the evolution of his exceedingly complex customs such as his marriage laws and his minute etiquette mr herbert spencer has deduced from the multiplicity elaborateness and wide diffusion of australian marriage laws the inference that the australians were once more civilised than they are now and had once a kind of central government and police but to reason thus is to fail back on the old greek theory which for every traditional custom imagined an early legislative hero with a genius for devising laws and with power to secure their being obeyed the more generally accepted view of modern science is that law and custom are things slowly evolved under stress of human circumstances it is certain that the usual process is from the extreme complexity of savage to the clear simplicity of civilised rules of forbidden degrees wherever we see an advancing civilisation we see that it does not put on new complex and incomprehensible regulations but that it rather sloughs off the old complex and incomprehensible regulations bequeathed to it by savagery  this process is especially manifest in the laws of forbidden degrees in marriagelaws whose complexity among the australians or north american indians might puzzle a mathematician and whose simplicity in a civilised country seems transparent even to a child but while the elaborateness and stringency of savage customary law point to a more and not a less barbarous past they also indicate a past of untold duration somewhere in that past also it is evident that the savage must have been even worse off materially than he is at present even now he can light a fire he has a bow or a boomerang or a blowpipe and has attained very considerable skill in using his own rough tools of flint and his weapons tipped with quartz now man was certainly not born in the possession of fire he did not come into the world with a bow or a boomerang in his hand nor with an instinct which taught him to barb his fishinghooks these implements he had to learn to make and use and till he had learned to use them and make them his condition must necessarily have been more destitute of material equipment than that of any races known to us historically thus all that can be inferred about the past of savages is that it was of vast duration and that at one period man was more materially destitute and so far more struggling and forlorn than the murri of australia were when first discovered by europeans even then certain races may have had intellectual powers and potentialities beyond those of other races perhaps the first fathers of the white peoples of the north started with better brains and bodies than the first fathers of the veddahs of ceylon but they all started naked toolless fireless the only way of avoiding these conclusions is to holdthat men or some favoured races of man were created with civilised instincts and habits of thought and were miraculously provided with the first necessaries of life or were miraculously instructed to produce them without passing through slow stages of experiment invention and modification but we might as well assume with some early biblical commentators that the naked adam in paradise was miraculously clothed in a vesture of refulgent light against such beliefs we have only to say that they are without direct historical confirmation of any kind  but if for the sake of argument we admit the belief that primitive man was miraculously endowed and was placed at once in a stage of simple and happy civilisation our thesis still remains unaffected dr fairbairns saying has been quoted the savage are as old as the civilised races and can as little be called primitive but we do not wish to call savages primitive we have already said that savages have a farstretching unknown history behind them and that except on the supposition of miraculous enlightenment followed by degradation their past must have been engaged in slowly evolving their rude arts their strange beliefs and their elaborate customs undeniably there is nothing primitive in a man who can use a boomerang and who must assign each separate joint of the kangaroo he kills to a separate member of his family circle while to some of those members he is forbidden by law to speak men were not born into the world with all these notions the lowest savage has sought out or inherited many inventions and cannot be called primitive but it never was part of our argument that savages are primitive our argument does not find it necessary to claim savagery as the state from which all men set forth about what was primitive as we have no historical information on the topic we express no opinion at all man may if any one likes to think so have appeared on earth in a state of perfection and may have degenerated from that condition some such opinion that purity and reasonableness are nearer the beginning than absurdity and unreasonableness appears to be held by mr max müller who remarks i simply say that in the veda we have a nearer approach to a beginning and an intelligible beginning than in the wild invocations of hottentots or bushmen        lectures on india  would mr müller add i simply say that in the arts and political society of the vedic age we have a nearer approach to a beginning than in the arts and society of hottentots and bushmen is the use of chariots horses shipsare kings walled cities agriculture the art of weaving and so forth all familiar to the vedic poets nearer the beginning of mans civilisation than the life of the naked or skinclad hunter who has not yet learned to work the metals who acknowledges no king and has no certain abidingplace if not why is the religion of the civilised man nearer the beginning than that of the man who is not civilised we have already seen that in mr max mullers opinion his language is much farther from the beginning  whatever the primitive condition of man may have been it is certain that savagery was a stage through which he and his institutions have passed or from which he has copiously borrowed he may have degenerated from perfection or from a humble kind of harmless simplicity into savagery he may have risen into savagery from a purely animal condition but however this may have been modern savages are at present in the savage condition and the ancestors of the civilised races passed through or borrowed from a similar savage condition as mr tylor says it is not necessary to inquire how the savage state first came to be upon the earth it is enough that by some means or other it has actually come into existence it is a stage through which all societies have passed or if that be contested a condition of things from which all societies have borrowed this view of the case has been well put by m darmesteter        prim cult i 37        revue critique january 1884  he is speaking of the history of religion if savages do not represent religion in its germ if they do not exemplify that vague and indefinite thing conventionally styled primitive religion at least they represent a stage through which all religions have passed the proof is that a very little research into civilised religions discovers a most striking similarity between the most essential elements of the civilised and the nonhistoric creeds proofs of this have been given when we examined the myths of greece  we have next to criticise the attempts which have been made to discredit the evidence on which we rely for our knowledge of the intellectual constitution of the savage and of his religious ideas and his myths and legends if that evidence be valueless our whole theory is founded on the sand  the difficulties in the way of obtaining trustworthy information about the ideas myths and mental processes of savages are not only proclaimed by opponents of the anthropological method but are frankly acknowledged by anthropologists themselves the task is laborious and delicate but not impossible anthropology has at all events the advantage of studying an actual undeniably existing state of things to sift the evidence as to that state of things to examine the opportunities the discretion and the honesty of the witnesses is part of the business of anthropology a science which was founded on an uncritical acceptance of all the reports of missionaries travellers traders and beachcombers would be worth nothing but as will be shown anthropology is fortunate in the possession of a touchstone like that as theocritus says wherewith the moneychangers try gold lest perchance base metal pass for true  the difficulties which beset travellers and missionaries in their description of the religious and intellectual life of savages have been catalogued by mr max muller as he is not likely to have omitted anything which tells against the evidence of missionaries and travellers we may adopt his statement in an abridged shape with criticisms and with additional illustrations of our own        hibbert lectures p 9  first few men are quite proof against the fluctuations of public opinion thus in rousseaus time many travellers saw savages with the eyes rousseauthat is as models of a simple state of nature in the same way we may add modern educated travellers are apt to see savages in the light cast on them by mr tylor or sir john lubbock mr im thurn in guiana sees with mr tylors eyes messrs fison and howitt among the kamilaroi in australia see with the eyes of mr lewis morgan author of systems of consanguinity very well we must allow for the bias in each case but what are we to say when the travellers who lived long before begnard report precisely the same facts of savage life as the witty frenchman who wrote that next to the ape the laplander is the animal nearest to man what are we to say when the mariner or beachcomber or indian interpreter who never heard of rousseau brings from canada or the marquesas islands a report of ideas or customs which the trained anthropologist finds in new guinea or the admiralty islands and with which the inca garcilasso de la vega was familiar in peru if the wesleyan missionary in south africa is in the same tale with the jesuit in paraguay or in china while the lutheran in kamtschatka brings the same intelligence as that which they contribute and all three are supported by the shipwrecked mariner in tonga and by the squatter in queensland as well as by the evidence from ancient times and lands of strabo diodorus and pausanias what then is it not clear that if pagan greeks jesuits and wesleyans squatters and anthropologists indian interpreters and the fathers of the christian church are all agreed in finding this idea or that practice in their own times and countries their evidence is at least unaffected by the fluctuations of public opinion this criterion of undesigned coincidence in evidence drawn from protestants catholics pagans sceptics from times classical mediaeval and modern from men learned and unlearned is the touchstone of anthropology it will be admitted that the consentient testimony of persons in every stage of belief and prejudice of ignorance and learning cannot agree as it does agree by virtue of some fluctuation of public opinion it is to be regretted that in mr max mullers description of the difficulties which beset the study of savage religious ideas he entirely omits to mention on the other side the corroboration which is derived from the undesigned coincidence of independent testimony this point is so important that it may be well to quote mr tylors statement of the value of the anthropological criterion  it is a matter worthy of consideration that the accounts of similar phenomena of culture recurring in different parts of the world actually supply incidental proof of their own authenticity some years since a question which brings out this point was put to me by a great historian how can a statement as to customs myths beliefs etc of a savage tribe be treated as evidence where it depends on the testimony of some traveller or missionary who may be a superficial observer more or less ignorant of the native language a careless retailer of unsifted talk a man prejudiced or even wilfully deceitful this question is indeed one which every ethnographer ought to keep clearly and constantly before his mind of course he is bound to use his best judgment as to the trustworthiness of all authors he quotes and if possible to obtain several accounts to certify each point in each locality but it is over and above these measures of precaution that the test of recurrence comes in if two independent visitors to different countries say a mediaeval mohammedan in tartary and a modern englishman in dahomey or a jesuit missionary in brazil and a wesleyan in the fiji islands agree in describing some analogous art or rite or myth among the people they have visited it becomes difficult or impossible to set down such correspondence to accident or wilful fraud a story by a bushranger in australia may perhaps be objected to as a mistake or an invention but did a methodist minister in guinea conspire with him to cheat the public by telling the same story there the possibility of intentional or unintentional mystification is often barred by such a state of things as that a similar statement is made in two remote lands by two witnesses of whom a lived a century before b and b appears never to have heard of a how distant are the countries how wide apart the dates how different the creeds and characters of the observers in the catalogue of facts of civilisation needs no farther showing to any one who will even glance at the footnotes of the present work and the more odd the statement the less likely that several people in several places should have made it wrongly this being so it seems reasonable to judge that the statements are in the main truly given and that their close and regular coincidence is due to the cropping up of similar facts in various districts of culture now the most important facts of ethnography are vouched for in this way experience leads the student after a while to expect and find that the phenomena of culture as resulting from widelyacting similar causes should recur again and again in the world he even mistrusts isolated statements to which he knows of no parallel elsewhere and waits for their genuineness to be shown by corresponding accounts from the other side of the earth or the other end of history so strong indeed is the means of authentication that the ethnographer in his library may sometimes presume to decide not only whether a particular explorer is a shrewd and honest observer but also whether what he reports is conformable to the general rules of civilisation non quia sed quid  it must be added as a rider to mr tylos remarks that anthropology is rapidly making the accumulation of fresh and trustworthy evidence more difficult than ever travellers and missionaries have begun to read anthropological books and their evidence is therefore much more likely to be biassed now by anthropological theories than it was of old when mr mlennan wrote on totems in 1869 he was able to say it is some compensation for the completeness of the accounts that we can thoroughly trust them as the totem has not till now got itself mixed up with speculations and accordingly the observers have been unbiassed but as anthropology is now more widely studied the naif evidence of ignorance and of surprise grows more and more difficult to obtain        fortnightly review october 1869  we may now assert that though the evidence of each separate witness may be influenced by fluctuations of opinion yet the consensus of their testimony when they are unanimous remains unshaken the same argument applies to the private inclination and prejudice and method of inquiry of each individual observer  travellers in general and missionaries in particular are biassed in several distinct ways the missionary is sometimes anxious to prove that religion can only come by revelation and that certain tribes having received no revelation have no religion or religious myths at all sometimes the missionary on the other hand is anxious to demonstrate that the myths of his heathen flock are a corrupted version of the biblical narrative in the former case he neglects the study of savage myths in the latter he unconsciously accommodates what he hears to what he calls the truth in modern days the missionary often sees with the eyes of mr herbert spencer the traveller who is not a missionary may either have the same prejudices or he may be a sceptic about revealed religion in the latter case he is perhaps unconsciously moved to put burlesque versions of biblical stories into the mouths of his native informants or to represent the savages as ridiculing dr moffat found that they did ridicule the scriptural traditions which he communicates to them yet again we must remember that the leading questions of a european inquirer may furnish a savage with a thread on which to string answers which the questions themselves have suggested have you ever had a great flood yes was any one saved the leading question starts the invention of the savage on a delugemyth of which perhaps the idea has never before entered his mind  the last is a source of error pointed out by mr codrington        journal of anthrop inst february 1881  the questions of the european are a thread on which the ideas of the native precipitate themselves now as european inquirers are prone to ask much the same questions a people which like some celts and savages always answers yes will everywhere give much the same answers mr romilly in his book on the western pacific remarks in some parts of new britain if a stranger were to ask are there men with tails in the mountains he would probably be answered yes that being the answer which the new briton and the north briton too very often would imagine was expected of him and would be most likely to give satisfaction the train of thought in his mind would be something like this he must know that there are no such men but he cannot have asked so foolish a question without an object and therefore he wishes me to say yes of course the first yes leads to many others and in a very short time everything is known about these tailed men and a full account of them is sent home  what is true of tailed men applies to native answers about myths and customs when the questions are asked by persons who have not won the confidence of the people nor discovered their real beliefs by long and patient observation this must be borne in mind when missionaries tell us that savages believe in one supreme deity in a mediator and the like and it must be borne in mind when they tell us that savages have no supreme being at all always we must be wary a very pleasing example of inconsistency in reports about the same race may be found in a comparison of the account of the khonds in the thirteenth volume of the royal asiatic society with the account given by general campbell in his personal narrative the inquirer in the former case did not know the khond language and trusted to interpreters who were later expelled from the public service general campbell on the other hand believed himself to possess the confidence of the priests and chiefs and his description is quite different in cases of contradictions like these the anthropologist will do well to leave the subject alone unless he has very strong reasons for believing one or other of the contending witnesses        the western pacific and new guinea london 1886 pp 36        hibbert lectures p 92  we have now considered the objections that may be urged against the bias of witnesses  mr max müller founds another objection on the absence of recognised authorities among savages this absence of authority is not always complete the maoris for example have traditional hymns of great authority and antiquity there are often sacred songs and customs preserved by the red indians in chants recorded by picturewriting on birch bark and there always is some teaching from the mothers to their children or in the mysteries all these but above all the almost immutable sacredness of custom are sources of evidence but of course the story of one savage informant may differ widely from that of his neighbour the first may be the black sheep of the tribe the next may be the saint of the district both would be considered by european travellers as unimpeachable authorities with regard to their religion this is too strongly stated even the inquiring squatter will repose more confidence in the reports about his religion of a black with a decent character or of a black who has only recently mixed with white men than in those of a rumbibbing loafer about upcountry stations or a black professional bowler on a colonial cricketground our best evidence is from linguists who have been initiated into the secret mysteries still more will missionaries and scholars like bleek hahn codrington castren gill callaway theal and the rest sift and compare the evidence of the most trustworthy native informants the merits of the travellers we have named as observers and scholars are freely acknowledged by mr max müller himself to their statements also we can apply the criterion does bleeks report from the bushmen and hottentots confirm castrens from the finns does codrington in melanesia tell the same tale as gill in mangia or theal among the kaffirs are all confirmed by charlevoix and lafitau and brebeuf the old catholic apostles of the north american indians if this be so then we may presume that the inquirers have managed to extract true accounts from some of their native informants the object of the inquiry of course is to find out not what a few more educated and noble members of a tribe may think nor what some original speculative thinker among a lower race may have worked out for himself but to ascertain the general character of the ideas most popular and most widely prevalent among backward peoples  a third objection is that the priests of savage tribes are not unimpeachable authorities it is pointed out that even christian clergy have their differences of opinion naturally we expect most shades of opinion where there is most knowledge and most liberty but the liberty of savage heterodoxy is very wide indeed we might almost say that as in the mythology of greece there is no orthodox mythical doctrine among savages but amidst minor diversities we have found many ideas which are universal both in savage and civilised myths quod semper quod ubique quod ab omnibus it is on this universal element of faith not on the discrepancies of local priests that we must fix our attention many a different town in greece showed the birthplace or tomb of this or that deity the essential point is that all agreed in declaring that the god was born or died  once moreand this is a point of some importance when we are told that priests differ from each other in their statementswe must remember that these very differences are practically universal in all mythology even in that of civilised races thus if one savage authority declares that men came originally out of trees while his fellowtribesman avers that the human race was created out of clay and a third witness maintains that his first ancestors emerged from a hole in the ground and a fourth stands to it that his stock is descended from a swan or a serpent and a fifth holds that humanity was evolved from other animal forms these savage statements appear contradictory but when we find as we do precisely the same sort of contradictions everywhere recurring among civilised peoples in greece india egypt as well as in africa america and australia there seems no longer any reason to distrust the various versions of the myth which are given by various priests or chiefs each witness is only telling the legend which he has heard and prefers and it is precisely the coexistence of all these separate monstrous beliefs which makes the enigma and the attraction of mythology in short the discrepancies of savage myths are not an argument against the authenticity of our information on the topic because the discrepancies themselves are repeated in civilised myth semper et ubique et ab omnibus to object to the presence of discrepant accounts is to object to mythology for being mythological  another objection is derived from the unwillingness of savages to talk about religion and from the difficulty of understanding them when they do talk of it this hardly applies when europeans are initiated into savage mysteries we may add a fair example of the difficulty of learning about alien religions it is given by garcilasso de la vega son of an inca princess and a companion of pizarro        garcilaaso de la vega royal commentaries vol i 123  the method that our spaniards adopted in writing their histories was to ask the indians in spanish touching the things they wanted to find out from them these from not having a clear knowledge of ancient things or from bad memories told them wrong or mixed up poetical fables with their replies and the worst of it was that neither party had more than a very imperfect knowledge of the language of the other so as to understand the inquiry and to reply to it in this great confusion the priest or layman who asked the questions placed the meaning to them which was nearest to the desired answer or which was most like what the indian was understood to have said thus they interpreted according to their pleasure or prejudice and wrote things down as truths which the indians never dreamt of as an example of these comparisons garcilasso gives the discovery of the doctrine of the trinity among the people of peru a socalled icona was found answering to the father a son racab and a holy spirit estrua nor was the virgin lacking nor even st anne all these things are fictions of the spaniards but no sooner has garcilasso rebuked the spaniards and their method than he hastens to illustrate by his own example another difficulty that besets us in our search for evidence of myths he says as if it were a matter of certain fact that tlasolteute a kind of priapus god of lust and ometoctilti god of drunkenness and the god of murder and the others were the names of men and women whom the natives of that land worshipped as gods and goddesses thus garcilasso euhemerises audaciously as also does sahagun in his account of mexican religion we have no right to assume that gods of natural departments any more than dionysus and priapus and ares had once been real men and were deified on evidence like the statement of garcilassp he is giving his own euhemeristic guess as if it were matter of fact and this is a common custom with even the more intelligent of the early missionaries  another example of the natural difficulty in studying the myths of savages may be taken from mr sproats scenes of savage life 1868 there is an honesty and candour in mr sproats work which by itself seems to clear this witness at least of charges of haste or prejudice the religion of savages says this inquirer is a subject as to which a traveller might easily form erroneous opinions owing to the practical difficulty even to one skilled in the language of ascertaining the true nature of their superstitions this short chapter is the result of more than four years inquiry made unremittingly under favourable circumstances there is a constant temptation from which the unbiassed observer cannot be quite free to fill up in ones mind without proper material the gap between what is known of the religion of the natives for certain and the larger lessknown portion which can only be guessed at and i frequently found that under this temptation i was led on to form in my own mind a connected whole designed to coincide with some ingenious theory which i might wish to be true generally speaking it is necessary i think to view with suspicion any very regular account given by travellers of the religion of savages yet we have seen the absence of regularity the differences of opinion among priests objected to by mr max müller as a proof of the untrustworthy nature of our evidence the real religious notions of savages cannot be separated from the vague and unformed as well as bestial and grotesque mythology with which they are intermixed the faint struggling efforts of our natures in so early or so little advanced a stage of moral and intellectual cultivation can produce only a medley of opinions and beliefs not to be dignified by the epithet religious which are held loosely by the people themselves and are neither very easily discovered nor explained when we came to civilised mythologies we found that they also are bestial and grotesque loosely held and a medley of opinions and beliefs   mr sproat was two years among the ahts with his mind constantly directed to the subject of their religious beliefs before he could discover that they had any such beliefs at all traders assured him that they had none he found that the ahts were fond of mystification and of sells and in short this inquirer living with the ahts like an aht discounted every sort of circumstance which could invalidate his statement of their myths        pp 203205  now when we find mr codrington taking the same precautions in melanesia and when his account of melanesian myths reads like a close copy of mr sproats account of aht legends and when both are corroborated by the collections of bleek and hahn and gill and castren and eink in far distant corners of the world while the modern testimony of these scholarly men is in harmony with that of the old jesuit missionaries and of untaught adventurers who have lived for many years with savages surely it will be admitted that the difficulty of ascertaining savage opinion has been to a great extent overcome if all the evidence be wrong the coincidences of the witnesses with each other and of the savage myths they report with the myths of greeks and aryans of india will be no less than a miracle  we have now examined the objections urged against a system founded on the comparative study of savage myths it cannot be said of us as it has been said of de brosses that whatever we find in the voyages of sailors and traders is welcome to us that we have a theory to defend and whatever seems to support it is sure to be true our evidence is based to a very great extent on the communications of missionaries who are acknowledged to be scholarly and sober men it is confirmed by other evidence catholic dissenting pagan scientific and by the reports of illiterate men unbiassed by science and little biassed by religion  but we have not yet exhausted our evidence nor had recourse to our ultimate criterion that evidence that criterion is derived from the study of comparative institutions of comparative ritual of comparative law and of comparative customs in the widely diffused rites and institutions which express themselves in actual practice we have sure evidence for the ideas on which the customs are founded for example if a man pays away his wampum or his yams or his arrowheads to a magician for professional services it follows that he does believe in magic if he puts to death a tribesman for the sin of marrying a woman to whom he was only akin by virtue of common descent from the same beast or plant it seems to follow that he does believe in descent from and kinship with plants and beasts if he buries food and valuable weapons with his dead it follows that he does or that his fathers did believe in the continued life of the dead at the very least in all three cases the man is acting on what must once have been actual beliefs even if the consequent practices be still in force only through custom after the real faith has dwindled away thus the belief past or present in certain opinions can be deduced from actual practices just as we may deduce from our own coronation service the fact that oil anointed on a mans head by a priest was once believed to have a mysterious efficacy or the fact that a certain rough block of red sandstone was once supposed to have some kind of sacredness of all these sources of evidence none is more valuable than the testimony of ritual a moments reflection will show that ritual among any people wild or civilised is not a thing easily altered if we take the savage his ritual consists mainly of the magical rites by which he hopes to constrain his gods to answer his prayers though he may also reveal to the neophyte our father if we examine the greeks we discover the same element in such rites as the attic thesmophoria the torchdance of demeter the rainmaking on the arcadian mount lycæus with many other examples meanwhile the old heathen ritual survives in europe as rural folklore and we can thus display a chain of evidence from savage magic to greek ritual with the folklore of germany france eussia and scotland for the link between these and our own time this is almost our best evidence for the ancient idea about gods and their service from the evidence of institutions then the evidence of reports may be supplemented the direct testimony as m darmesteter says heureusement peutetre supplee par le temoignage indirect celui qui porte sur les usages les coutumes lordre exterieur de la vie everything that shows us religious faith embodied in action now these actions also are only attested by the reports of travellers missionaries and historians but it is comparatively easy to describe correctly what is done much more easy than to discover what is thought yet it will be found that the direct evidence of institutions corroborates the less direct evidence as to thought and opinion thus an uncommonly strong texture of testimony is woven by the coincidence of evidence direct and indirect ancient and modern of learned and unlearned men of catholics protestants pagans and sceptics what can be said against that evidence we have heard we have examined the objections based on the influence of public opinion on travellers on the absence of recognised authorities among savages on the discrepancies of the authorities who are recognised on the unwillingness of savages to talk of their religion and on the difficulty of understanding them when they do talk of it  but after allowing for all these drawbacks as every anthropologist worthy of the name will in each case allow we have shown that there does remain a body of coincident evidence of authority now learned and critical now uncritical and unlearned which cannot be set aside as extremely untrustworthy this authority is accepted in questions of the evolution of art politics handicraft why not in questions of religion it is usually evidence given by men who did not see its tendency or know its value a chance word in the veda shows us that a savage point of marriage etiquette was known to the poet a sneer of theophrastus a denunciation of ezekiel an anecdote of herodotus reveal to us the practices of contemporary savages as they existed thousands of years ago among races savage or civilised a travellers tale of melville or mandeville proves to be no mere yarn but completes the evidence for the existence in asia or the marquesas islands of belief and rites proved to occur in europe or india  such is the nature of the evidence for savage ideas and for their survivals in civilisation and the amount of the evidence is best known to him who has to plod through tracts histories and missionary reports
