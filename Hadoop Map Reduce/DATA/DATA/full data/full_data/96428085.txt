                239     the great keinplatz experiment  and other tales of twilight and the unseen     i  the brown hand   every one knows that sir dominick holden the famous indian surgeon made me his heir and that his death changed me in an hour from a hardworking and impecunious medical man to a welltodo landed proprietor many know also that there were at least five people between the inheritance and me and that sir dominicks selection appeared to be altogether arbitrary and whimsical i can assure them however that they are quite mistaken and that although i only knew sir dominick in the closing years of his life there were none the less very real reasons why he should show his goodwill towards me as a matter of fact though i say it myself no man ever did more for another than i did for my indian uncle i cannot expect the story to be believed but it is so singular that i should feel that it was a breach of duty if i did not put it upon recordso here it is and your belief or incredulity is your own affair  sir dominick holden cb kcsi and i dont know what besides was the most distinguished indian surgeon of his day in the army originally he afterwards settled down into civil practice in bombay and visited as a consultant every part of india his name is best remembered in connection with the oriental hospital which he founded and supported the time came however when his iron constitution began to show signs of the long strain to which he had subjected it and his brother practitioners who were not perhaps entirely disinterested upon the point were unanimous in recommending him to return to england he held on so long as he could but at last he developed nervous symptoms of a very pronounced character and so came back a broken man to his native county of wiltshire he bought a considerable estate with an ancient manorhouse upon the edge of salisbury plain and devoted his old age to the study of comparative pathology which had been his learned hobby all his life and in which he was a foremost authority  we of the family were as may be imagined much excited by the news of the return of this rich and childless uncle to england on his part although by no means exuberant in his hospitality he showed some sense of his duty to his relations and each of us in turn had an invitation to visit him from the accounts of my cousins it appeared to be a melancholy business and it was with mixed feelings that i at last received my own summons to appear at rodenhurst my wife was so carefully excluded in the invitation that my first impulse was to refuse it but the interests of the children had to be considered and so with her consent i set out one october afternoon upon my visit to wiltshire with little thought of what that visit was to entail  my uncles estate was situated where the arable land of the plains begins to swell upwards into the rounded chalk hills which are characteristic of the county as i drove from dinton station in the waning light of that autumn day i was impressed by the weird nature of the scenery the few scattered cottages of the peasants were so dwarfed by the huge evidences of prehistoric life that the present appeared to be a dream and the past to be the obtrusive and masterful reality the road wound through the valleys formed by a succession of grassy hills and the summit of each was cut and carved into the most elaborate fortifications some circular and some square but all on a scale which has defied the winds and the rains of many centuries some call them roman and some british but their true origin and the reasons for this particular tract of country being so interlaced with entrenchments have never been finally made clear here and there on the long smooth olivecoloured slopes there rose small rounded barrows or tumuli beneath them lie the cremated ashes of the race which cut so deeply into the hills but their graves tell us nothing save that a jar full of dust represents the man who once laboured under the sun  it was through this weird country that i approached my uncles residence of rodenhurst and the house was as i found in due keeping with its surroundings two broken and weatherstained pillars each surmounted by a mutilated heraldic emblem flanked the entrance to a neglected drive a cold wind whistled through the elms which lined it and the air was full of the drifting leaves at the far end under the gloomy arch of trees a single yellow lamp burned steadily in the dim halflight of the coming night i saw a long low building stretching out two irregular wings with deep eaves a sloping gambrel roof and walls which were crisscrossed with timber balks in the fashion of the tudors the cheery light of a fire flickered in the broad latticed window to the left of the lowporched door and this as it proved marked the study of my uncle for it was thither that i was led by his butler in order to make my hosts acquaintance  he was cowering over his fire for the moist chill of an english autumn had set him shivering his lamp was unlit and i only saw the red glow of the embers beating upon a huge craggy face with a red indian nose and cheek and deep furrows and seams from eye to chin the sinister marks of hidden volcanic fires he sprang up at my entrance with something of an oldworld courtesy and welcomed me warmly to rodenhurst at the same time i was conscious as the lamp was carried in that it was a very critical pair of lightblue eyes which looked out at me from under shaggy eyebrows like scouts beneath a bush and that this outlandish uncle of mine was carefully reading off my character with all the ease of a practised observer and an experienced man of the world  for my part i looked at him and looked again for i had never seen a man whose appearance was more fitted to hold ones attention his figure was the framework of a giant but he had fallen away until his coat dangled straight down in a shocking fashion from a pair of broad and bony shoulders all his limbs were huge and yet emaciated and i could not take my gaze from his knobby wrists and long gnarled hands but his eyesthose peering lightblue eyesthey were the most arrestive of any of his peculiarities it was not their colour alone nor was it the ambush of hair in which they lurked but it was the expression which i read in them for the appearance and bearing of the man were masterful and one expected a certain corresponding arrogance in his eyes but instead of that i read the look which tells of a spirit cowed and crushed the furtive expectant look of the dog whose master has taken the whip from the rack i formed my own medical diagnosis upon one glance at those critical and yet appealing eyes i believed that he was stricken with some mortal ailment that he knew himself to be exposed to sudden death and that he lived in terror of it such was my judgmenta false one as the event showed but i mention it that it may help you to realise the look which i read in his eyes  my uncles welcome was as i have said a courteous one and in an hour or so i found myself seated between him and his wife at a comfortable dinner with curious pungent delicacies upon the table and a stealthy quickeyed oriental waiter behind his chair the old couple had come round to that tragic imitation of the dawn of life when husband and wife having lost or scattered all those who were their intimates find themselves face to face and alone once more their work done and the end nearing fast those who have reached that stage in sweetness and love who can change their winter into a gentle indian summer have come as victors through the ordeal of life lady holden was a small alert woman with a kindly eye and her expression as she glanced at him was a certificate of character to her husband and yet though i read a mutual love in their glances i read also mutual horror and recognised in her face some reflection of that stealthy fear which i had detected in his their talk was sometimes merry and sometimes sad but there was a forced note in their merriment and a naturalness in their sadness which told me that a heavy heart beat upon either side of me  we were sitting over our first glass of wine and the servants had left the room when the conversation took a turn which produced a remarkable effect upon my host and hostess i cannot recall what it was which started the topic of the supernatural but it ended in my showing them that the abnormal in psychical experiences was a subject to which i had like many neurologists devoted a great deal of attention i concluded by narrating my experiences when as a member of the psychical research society i had formed one of a committee of three who spent the night in a haunted house our adventures were neither exciting nor convincing but such as it was the story appeared to interest my auditors in a remarkable degree they listened with an eager silence and i caught a look of intelligence between them which i could not understand lady holden immediately afterwards rose and left the room  sir dominick pushed the cigarbox over to me and we smoked for some little time in silence that huge bony hand of his was twitching as he raised it with his cheroot to his lips and i felt that the mans nerves were vibrating like fiddlestrings my instincts told me that he was on the verge of some intimate confidence and i feared to speak lest i should interrupt it at last he turned towards me with a spasmodic gesture like a man who throws his last scruple to the winds  from the little that i have seen of you it appears to me dr hardacre said he that you are the very man i have wanted to meet  i am delighted to hear it sir  your head seems to be cool and steady you will acquit me of any desire to flatter you for the circumstances are too serious to permit of insincerities you have some special knowledge upon these subjects and you evidently view them from that philosophical standpoint which robs them of all vulgar terror i presume that the sight of an apparition would not seriously discompose you  i think not sir  would even interest you perhaps  most intensely  as a psychical observer you would probably investigate it in as impersonal a fashion as an astronomer investigates a wandering comet  precisely  he gave a heavy sigh  believe me dr hardacre there was a time when i could have spoken as you do now my nerve was a byword in india even the mutiny never shook it for an instant and yet you see what i am reduced tothe most timorous man perhaps in all this county of wiltshire do not speak too bravely upon this subject or you may find yourself subjected to as longdrawn a test as i ama test which can only end in the madhouse or the grave  i waited patiently until he should see fit to go farther in his confidence his preamble had i need not say filled me with interest and expectation  for some years dr hardacre he continued my life and that of my wife have been made miserable by a cause which is so grotesque that it borders upon the ludicrous and yet familiarity has never made it more easy to bearon the contrary as time passes my nerves become more worn and shattered by the constant attrition if you have no physical fears dr hardacre i should very much value your opinion upon this phenomenon which troubles us so  for what it is worth my opinion is entirely at your service may i ask the nature of the phenomenon  i think that your experiences will have a higher evidential value if you are not told in advance what you may expect to encounter you are yourself aware of the quibbles of unconscious cerebration and subjective impressions with which a scientific sceptic may throw a doubt upon your statement it would be as well to guard against them in advance  what shall i do then  i will tell you would you mind following me this way he led me out of the diningroom and down a long passage until we came to a terminal door inside there was a large bare room fitted as a laboratory with numerous scientific instruments and bottles a shelf ran along one side upon which there stood a long line of glass jars containing pathological and anatomical specimens  you see that i still dabble in some of my old studies said sir dominick these jars are the remains of what was once a most excellent collection but unfortunately i lost the greater part of them when my house was burned down in bombay in 92 it was a most unfortunate affair for mein more ways than one i had examples of many rare conditions and my splenic collection was probably unique these are the survivors  i glanced over them and saw that they really were of a very great value and rarity from a pathological point of view bloated organs gaping cysts distorted bones odious parasitesa singular exhibition of the products of india  there is as you see a small settee here said my host it was far from our intention to offer a guest so meagre an accommodation but since affairs have taken this turn it would be a great kindness upon your part if you would consent to spend the night in this apartment i beg that you will not hesitate to let me know if the idea should be at all repugnant to you  on the contrary i said it is most acceptable  my own room is the second on the left so that if you should feel that you are in need of company a call would always bring me to your side  i trust that i shall not be compelled to disturb you  it is unlikely that i shall be asleep i do not sleep much do not hesitate to summon me  and so with this agreement we joined lady holden in the drawingroom and talked of lighter things  it was no affectation upon my part to say that the prospect of my nights adventure was an agreeable one i had no pretence to greater physical courage than my neighbours but familiarity with a subject robs it of those vague and undefined terrors which are the most appalling to the imaginative mind the human brain is capable of only one strong emotion at a time and if it be filled with curiosity or scientific enthusiasm there is no room for fear it is true that i had my uncles assurance that he had himself originally taken this point of view but i reflected that the breakdown of his nervous system might be due to his forty years in india as much as to any psychical experiences which had befallen him i at least was sound in nerve and brain and it was with something of the pleasurable thrill of anticipation with which the sportsman takes his position beside the haunt of his game that i shut the laboratory door behind me and partially undressing lay down upon the rugcovered settee  it was not an ideal atmosphere for a bedroom the air was heavy with many chemical odours that of methylated spirit predominating nor were the decorations of my chamber very sedative the odious line of glass jars with their relics of disease and suffering stretched in front of my very eyes there was no blind to the window and a threequarter moon streamed its white light into the room tracing a silver square with filigree lattices upon the opposite wall when i had extinguished my candle this one bright patch in the midst of the general gloom had certainly an eerie and discomposing aspect a rigid and absolute silence reigned throughout the old house so that the low swish of the branches in the garden came softly and smoothly to my ears it may have been the hypnotic lullaby of this gentle susurrus or it may have been the result of my tiring day but after many dozings and many efforts to regain my clearness of perception i fell at last into a deep and dreamless sleep  i was awakened by some sound in the room and i instantly raised myself upon my elbow on the couch some hours had passed for the square patch upon the wall had slid downwards and sideways until it lay obliquely at the end of my bed the rest of the room was in deep shadow at first i could see nothing presently as my eyes became accustomed to the faint light i was aware with a thrill which all my scientific absorption could not entirely prevent that something was moving slowly along the line of the wall a gentle shuffling sound as of soft slippers came to my ears and i dimly discerned a human figure walking stealthily from the direction of the door as it emerged into the patch of moonlight i saw very clearly what it was and how it was employed it was a man short and squat dressed in some sort of darkgrey gown which hung straight from his shoulders to his feet the moon shone upon the side of his face and i saw that it was chocolatebrown in colour with a ball of black hair like a womans at the back of his head he walked slowly and his eyes were cast upwards towards the line of bottles which contained those gruesome remnants of humanity he seemed to examine each jar with attention and then to pass on to the next when he had come to the end of the line immediately opposite my bed he stopped faced me threw up his hands with a gesture of despair and vanished from my sight  i have said that he threw up his hands but i should have said his arms for as he assumed that attitude of despair i observed a singular peculiarity about his appearance he had only one hand as the sleeves drooped down from the upflung arms i saw the left plainly but the right ended in a knobby and unsightly stump in every other way his appearance was so natural and i had both seen and heard him so clearly that i could easily have believed that he was an indian servant of sir dominicks who had come into my room in search of something it was only his sudden disappearance which suggested anything more sinister to me as it was i sprang from my couch lit a candle and examined the whole room carefully there were no signs of my visitor and i was forced to conclude that there had really been something outside the normal laws of nature in his appearance i lay awake for the remainder of the night but nothing else occurred to disturb me  i am an early riser but my uncle was an even earlier one for i found him pacing up and down the lawn at the side of the house he ran towards me in his eagerness when he saw me come out from the door  well well he cried did you see him  an indian with one hand  precisely  yes i saw himand i told him all that occurred when i had finished he led the way into his study we have a little time before breakfast said he it will suffice to give you an explanation of this extraordinary affairso far as i can explain that which is essentially inexplicable in the first place when i tell you that for four years i have never passed one single night either in bombay aboard ship or here in england without my sleep being broken by this fellow you will understand why it is that i am a wreck of my former self his programme is always the same he appears by my bedside shakes me roughly by the shoulder passes from my room into the laboratory walks slowly along the line of my bottles and then vanishes for more than a thousand times he has gone through the same routine  what does he want  he wants his hand  his hand  yes it came about in this way i was summoned to peshawur for a consultation some ten years ago and while there i was asked to look at the hand of a native who was passing through with an afghan caravan the fellow came from some mountain tribe living away at the back of beyond somewhere on the other side of kaffiristan he talked a bastard pushtoo and it was all i could do to understand him he was suffering from a soft sarcomatous swelling of one of the metacarpal joints and i made him realise that it was only by losing his hand that he could hope to save his life after much persuasion he consented to the operation and he asked me when it was over what fee i demanded the poor fellow was almost a beggar so that the idea of a fee was absurd but i answered in jest that my fee should be his hand and that i proposed to add it to my pathological collection  to my surprise he demurred very much to the suggestion and he explained that according to his religion it was an allimportant matter that the body should be reunited after death and so make a perfect dwelling for the spirit the belief is of course an old one and the mummies of the egyptians arose from an analogous superstition i answered him that his hand was already off and asked him how he intended to preserve it he replied that he would pickle it in salt and carry it about with him i suggested that it might be safer in my keeping than his and that i had better means than salt for preserving it on realising that i really intended to carefully keep it his opposition vanished instantly but remember sahib said he i shall want it back when i am dead i laughed at the remark and so the matter ended i returned to my practice and he no doubt in the course of time was able to continue his journey to afghanistan  well as i told you last night i had a bad fire in my house at bombay half of it was burned down and among other things my pathological collection was largely destroyed what you see are the poor remains of it the hand of the hillman went with the rest but i gave the matter no particular thought at the time that was six years ago  four years agotwo years after the firei was awakened one night by a furious tugging at my sleeve i sat up under the impression that my favourite mastiff was trying to arouse me instead of this i saw my indian patient of long ago dressed in the long grey gown which was the badge of his people he was holding up his stump and looking reproachfully at me he then went over to my bottles which at that time i kept in my room and he examined them carefully after which he gave a gesture of anger and vanished i realised that he had just died and that he had come to claim my promise that i should keep his limb in safety for him  well there you have it all dr hardacre every night at the same hour for four years this performance has been repeated it is a simple thing in itself but it has worn me out like water dropping on a stone it has brought a vile insomnia with it for i cannot sleep now for the expectation of his coming it has poisoned my old age and that of my wife who has been the sharer in this great trouble but there is the breakfast gong and she will be waiting impatiently to know how it fared with you last night we are both much indebted to you for your gallantry for it takes something from the weight of our misfortune when we share it even for a single night with a friend and it reassures us as to our sanity which we are sometimes driven to question  this was the curious narrative which sir dominick confided to mea story which to many would have appeared to be a grotesque impossibility but which after my experience of the night before and my previous knowledge of such things i was prepared to accept as an absolute fact i thought deeply over the matter and brought the whole range of my reading and experience to bear upon it after breakfast i surprised my host and hostess by announcing that i was returning to london by the next train  my dear doctor cried sir dominick in great distress you make me feel that i have been guilty of a gross breach of hospitality in intruding this unfortunate matter upon you i should have borne my own burden  it is indeed that matter which is taking me to london i answered but you are mistaken i assure you if you think that my experience of last night was an unpleasant one to me on the contrary i am about to ask your permission to return in the evening and spend one more night in your laboratory i am very eager to see this visitor once again  my uncle was exceedingly anxious to know what i was about to do but my fears of raising false hopes prevented me from telling him i was back in my own consultingroom a little after luncheon and was confirming my memory of a passage in a recent book upon occultism which had arrested my attention when i had read it  in the case of earthbound spirits said my authority some one dominant idea obsessing them at the hour of death is sufficient to hold them in this material world they are the amphibia of this life and of the next capable of passing from one to the other as the turtle passes from land to water the causes which may bind a soul so strongly to a life which its body has abandoned are any violent emotion avarice revenge anxiety love and pity have all been known to have this effect as a rule it springs from some unfulfilled wish and when the wish has been fulfilled the material bond relaxes there are many cases upon record which show the singular persistence of these visitors and also their disappearance when their wishes have been fulfilled or in some cases when a reasonable compromise has been effected  a reasonable compromise effectedthose were the words which i had brooded over all the morning and which i now verified in the original no actual atonement could be made herebut a reasonable compromise i made my way as fast as a train could take me to the shadwell seamens hospital where my old friend jack hewett was housesurgeon without explaining the situation i made him understand what it was that i wanted  a brown mans hand said he in amazement what in the world do you want that for  never mind ill tell you some day i know that your wards are full of indians  i should think so but a hand he thought a little and then struck a bell  travers said he to a studentdresser what became of the hands of the lascar which we took off yesterday i mean the fellow from the east india dock who got caught in the steam winch  they are in the postmortem room sir  just pack one of them in antiseptics and give it to dr hardacre  and so i found myself back at rodenhurst before dinner with this curious outcome of my day in town i still said nothing to sir dominick but i slept that night in the laboratory and i placed the lascars hand in one of the glass jars at the end of my couch  so interested was i in the result of my experiment that sleep was out of the question i sat with a shaded lamp beside me and waited patiently for my visitor this time i saw him clearly from the first he appeared beside the door nebulous for an instant and then hardening into as distinct an outline as any living man the slippers beneath his grey gown were red and heelless which accounted for the low shuffling sound which he made as he walked as on the previous night he passed slowly along the line of bottles until he paused before that which contained the hand he reached up to it his whole figure quivering with expectation took it down examined it eagerly and then with a face which was convulsed with disappointment he hurled it down on the floor there was a crash which resounded through the house and when i looked up the mutilated indian had disappeared a moment later my door flew open and sir dominick rushed in  you are not hurt he cried  nobut deeply disappointed  he looked in astonishment at the splinters of glass and the brown hand lying upon the floor  good god he cried what is this  i told him my idea and its wretched sequel he listened intently but shook his head  it was well thought of said he but i fear that there is no such easy end to my sufferings but one thing i now insist upon it is that you shall never again upon any pretext occupy this room my fears that something might have happened to youwhen i heard that crashhave been the most acute of all the agonies which i have undergone i will not expose myself to a repetition of it  he allowed me however to spend the remainder of the night where i was and i lay there worrying over the problem and lamenting my own failure with the first light of morning there was the lascars hand still lying upon the floor to remind me of my fiasco i lay looking at itand as i lay suddenly an idea flew like a bullet through my head and brought me quivering with excitement out of my couch i raised the grim relic from where it had fallen yes it was indeed so the hand was the left hand of the lascar  by the first train i was on my way to town and hurried at once to the seamens hospital i remembered that both hands of the lascar had been amputated but i was terrified lest the precious organ which i was in search of might have been already consumed in the crematory my suspense was soon ended it had still been preserved in the postmortem room and so i returned to rodenhurst in the evening with my mission accomplished and the material for a fresh experiment  but sir dominick holden would not hear of my occupying the laboratory again to all my entreaties he turned a deaf ear it offended his sense of hospitality and he could no longer permit it i left the hand therefore as i had done its fellow the night before and i occupied a comfortable bedroom in another portion of the house some distance from the scene of my adventures  but in spite of that my sleep was not destined to be uninterrupted in the dead of night my host burst into my room a lamp in his hand his huge gaunt figure was enveloped in a loose dressinggown and his whole appearance might certainly have seemed more formidable to a weaknerved man than that of the indian of the night before but it was not his entrance so much as his expression which amazed me he had turned suddenly younger by twenty years at the least his eyes were shining his features radiant and he waved one hand in triumph over his head i sat up astounded staring sleepily at this extraordinary visitor but his words soon drove the sleep from my eyes  we have done it we have succeeded he shouted my dear hardacre how can i ever in this world repay you  you dont mean to say that it is all right  indeed i do i was sure that you would not mind being awakened to hear such blessed news  mind i should think not indeed but is it really certain  i have no doubt whatever upon the point i owe you such a debt my dear nephew as i have never owed a man before and never expected to what can i possibly do for you that is commensurate providence must have sent you to my rescue you have saved both my reason and my life for another six months of this must have seen me either in a cell or a coffin and my wifeit was wearing her out before my eyes never could i have believed that any human being could have lifted this burden off me he seized my hand and wrung it in his bony grip  it was only an experimenta forlorn hopebut i am delighted from my heart that it has succeeded but how do you know that it is all right have you seen something  he seated himself at the foot of my bed  i have seen enough said he it satisfies me that i shall be troubled no more what has passed is easily told you know that at a certain hour this creature always comes to me tonight he arrived at the usual time and aroused me with even more violence than is his custom i can only surmise that his disappointment of last night increased the bitterness of his anger against me he looked angrily at me and then went on his usual round but in a few minutes i saw him for the first time since this persecution began return to my chamber he was smiling i saw the gleam of his white teeth through the dim light he stood facing me at the end of my bed and three times he made the low eastern salaam which is their solemn leavetaking and the third time that he bowed he raised his arms over his head and i saw his two hands outstretched in the air so he vanished and as i believe for ever                                       so that is the curious experience which won me the affection and the gratitude of my celebrated uncle the famous indian surgeon his anticipations were realised and never again was he disturbed by the visits of the restless hillman in search of his lost member sir dominick and lady holden spent a very happy old age unclouded so far as i know by any trouble and they finally died during the great influenza epidemic within a few weeks of each other in his lifetime he always turned to me for advice in everything which concerned that english life of which he knew so little and i aided him also in the purchase and development of his estates it was no great surprise to me therefore that i found myself eventually promoted over the heads of five exasperated cousins and changed in a single day from a hardworking country doctor into the head of an important wiltshire family i at least have reason to bless the memory of the man with the brown hand and the day when i was fortunate enough to relieve rodenhurst of his unwelcome presence     ii  the usher of lea house school   mr lumsden the senior partner of lumsden and westmacott the wellknown scholastic and clerical agents was a small dapper man with a sharp abrupt manner a critical eye and an incisive way of speaking  your name sir said he sitting pen in hand with his long redlined folio in front of him  harold weld  oxford or cambridge  cambridge  honours  no sir  athlete  nothing remarkable i am afraid  not a blue  oh no  mr lumsden shook his head despondently and shrugged his shoulders in a way which sent my hopes down to zero there is a very keen competition for masterships mr weld said he the vacancies are few and the applicants innumerable a firstclass athlete oar or cricketer or a man who has passed very high in his examinations can usually find a vacancyi might say always in the case of the cricketer but the average manif you will excuse the description mr weldhas a very great difficulty almost an insurmountable difficulty we have already more than a hundred such names upon our lists and if you think it worth while our adding yours i dare say that in the course of some years we may possibly be able to find you some opening which  he paused on account of a knock at the door it was a clerk with a note mr lumsden broke the seal and read it  why mr weld said he this is really rather an interesting coincidence i understand you to say that latin and english are your subjects and that you would prefer for a time to accept a place in an elementary establishment where you would have time for private study  quite so  this note contains a request from an old client of ours dr phelps mccarthy of willow lea house academy west hampstead that i should at once send him a young man who should be qualified to teach latin and english to a small class of boys under fourteen years of age his vacancy appears to be the very one which you are looking for the terms are not munificentsixty pounds board lodging and washingbut the work is not onerous and you would have the evenings to yourself  that would do i cried with all the eagerness of the man who sees work at last after weary months of seeking  i dont know that it is quite fair to these gentlemen whose names have been so long upon our list said mr lumsden glancing down at his open ledger but the coincidence is so striking that i feel we must really give you the refusal of it  then i accept it sir and i am much obliged to you  there is one small provision in dr mccarthys letter he stipulates that the applicant must be a man with an imperturbable good temper  i am the very man said i with conviction  well said mr lumsden with some hesitation i hope that your temper is really as good as you say for i rather fancy that you may need it  i presume that every elementary schoolmaster does  yes sir but it is only fair to you to warn you that there may be some especially trying circumstances in this particular situation dr phelps mccarthy does not make such a condition without some very good and pressing reason  there was a certain solemnity in his speech which struck a chill in the delight with which i had welcomed this providential vacancy  may i ask the nature of these circumstances i asked  we endeavour to hold the balance equally between our clients and to be perfectly frank with all of them if i knew of objections to you i should certainly communicate them to dr mccarthy and so i have no hesitation in doing as much for you i find he continued glancing over the pages of his ledger that within the last twelve months we have supplied no fewer than seven latin masters to willow lea house academy four of them having left so abruptly as to forfeit their months salary and none of them having stayed more than eight weeks  and the other masters have they stayed  there is only one other residential master and he appears to be unchanged you can understand mr weld continued the agent closing both the ledger and the interview that such rapid changes are not desirable from a masters point of view whatever may be said for them by an agent working on commission i have no idea why these gentlemen have resigned their situations so early i can only give you the facts and advise you to see dr mccarthy at once and to form your own conclusions  great is the power of the man who has nothing to lose and it was therefore with perfect serenity but with a good deal of curiosity that i rang early that afternoon the heavy wroughtiron bell of the willow lea house academy the building was a massive pile square and ugly standing in its own extensive grounds with a broad carriagesweep curving up to it from the road it stood high and commanded a view on the one side of the grey roofs and bristling spires of northern london and on the other of the wellwooded and beautiful country which fringes the great city the door was opened by a boy in buttons and i was shown into a wellappointed study where the principal of the academy presently joined me  the warnings and insinuations of the agent had prepared me to meet a choleric and overbearing personone whose manner was an insupportable provocation to those who worked under him anything further from the reality cannot be imagined he was a frail gentle creature cleanshaven and roundshouldered with a bearing which was so courteous that it became almost deprecating his bushy hair was thickly shot with grey and his age i should imagine to verge upon sixty his voice was low and suave and he walked with a certain mincing delicacy of manner his whole appearance was that of a kindly scholar who was more at home among his books than in the practical affairs of the world  i am sure that we shall be very happy to have your assistance mr weld said he after a few professional questions mr percival manners left me yesterday and i should be glad if you could take over his duties tomorrow  may i ask if that is mr percival manners of selwyn i asked  precisely did you know him  yes he is a friend of mine  an excellent teacher but a little hasty in his disposition it was his only fault now in your case mr weld is your own temper under good control supposing for arguments sake that i were to so far forget myself as to be rude to you or to speak roughly or to jar your feelings in any way could you rely upon yourself to control your emotions  i smiled at the idea of this courteous little mincing creature ruffling my nerves  i think that i could answer for it sir said i  quarrels are very painful to me said he i wish every one to live in harmony under my roof i will not deny mr percival manners had provocation but i wish to find a man who can raise himself above provocation and sacrifice his own feelings for the sake of peace and concord  i will do my best sir  you cannot say more mr weld in that case i shall expect you tonight if you can get your things ready so soon  i not only succeeded in getting my things ready but i found time to call at the benedict club in piccadilly where i knew that i should find manners if he were still in town there he was sure enough in the smokingroom and i questioned him over a cigarette as to his reasons for throwing up his recent situation  you dont tell me that you are going to dr phelps mccarthys academy he cried staring at me in surprise my dear chap its no use you cant possibly remain there  but i saw him and he seemed the most courtly inoffensive fellow i never met a man with more gentle manners  he oh hes all right theres no vice in him have you seen theophilus st james  i have never heard the name who is he  your colleague the other master  no i have not seen him  hes the terror if you can stand him you have either the spirit of a perfect christian or else you have no spirit at all a more perfect bounder never bounded  but why does mccarthy stand it  my friend looked at me significantly through his cigarette smoke and shrugged his shoulders  you will form your own conclusions about that mine were formed very soon and i never found occasion to alter them  it would help me very much if you would tell me them  when you see a man in his own house allowing his business to be ruined his comfort destroyed and his authority defied by another man in a subordinate position and calmly submitting to it without so much as a word of protest what conclusion do you come to  that the one has a hold over the other  percival manners nodded his head  there you are youve hit it first barrel it seems to me that theres no other explanation which will cover the facts at some period in his life the little doctor has gone astray humanum est errare i have even done it myself but this was something serious and the other man got a hold of it and has never let go thats the truth blackmail is at the bottom of it but he had no hold over me and there was no reason why i should stand his insolence so i came awayand i very much expect to see you do the same  for some time he talked over the matter but he always came to the same conclusionthat i should not retain my new situation very long  it was with no very pleasant feelings after this preparation that i found myself face to face with the very man of whom i had received so evil an account dr mccarthy introduced us to each other in his study on the evening of that same day immediately after my arrival at the school  this is your new colleague mr st james said he in his genial courteous fashion i trust that you will mutually agree and that i shall find nothing but good feeling and sympathy beneath this roof  i shared the good doctors hope but my expectations of it were not increased by the appearance of my confrère he was a young bullnecked fellow about thirty years of age darkeyed and blackhaired with an exceedingly vigorous physique i have never seen a more strongly built man though he tended to run to fat in a way which showed that he was in the worst of training his face was coarse swollen and brutal with a pair of small black eyes deeply sunken in his head his heavy jowl his projecting ears and his thick bandy legs all went to make up a personality which was as formidable as it was repellent  i hear youve never been out before said he in a rude brusque fashion well its a poor life hard work and starvation pay as youll find out for yourself  but it has some compensations said the principal surely you will allow that mr st james  has it i never could find them what do you call compensations  even to be in the continual presence of youth is a privilege it has the effect of keeping youth in ones own soul for one reflects something of their high spirits and their keen enjoyment of life  little beasts cried my colleague  come come mr st james you are too hard upon them  i hate the sight of them if i could put them and their blessed copybooks and lexicons and slates into one bonfire id do it tonight  this is mr st jamess way of talking said the principal smiling nervously as he glanced at me you must not take him too seriously now mr weld you know where your room is and no doubt you have your own little arrangements to make the sooner you make them the sooner you will feel yourself at home  it seemed to me that he was only too anxious to remove me at once from the influence of this extraordinary colleague and i was glad to go for the conversation had become embarrassing  and so began an epoch which always seems to me as i look back to it to be the most singular in all my experience the school was in many ways an excellent one dr phelps mccarthy was an ideal principal his methods were modern and rational the management was all that could be desired and yet in the middle of this wellordered machine there intruded the incongruous and impossible mr st james throwing everything into confusion his duties were to teach english and mathematics and how he acquitted himself of them i do not know as our classes were held in separate rooms i can answer for it however that the boys feared him and loathed him and i know that they had good reason to do so for frequently my own teaching was interrupted by his bellowing of anger and even by the sound of his blows dr mccarthy spent most of his time in his class but it was i suspect to watch over the master rather than the boys and to try to moderate his ferocious temper when it threatened to become dangerous  it was in his bearing to the head master however that my colleagues conduct was most outrageous the first conversation which i have recorded proved to be typical of their intercourse he domineered over him openly and brutally i have heard him contradict him roughly before the whole school at no time would he show him any mark of respect and my temper often rose within me when i saw the quiet acquiescence of the old doctor and his patient tolerance of this monstrous treatment and yet the sight of it surrounded the principal also with a certain vague horror in my mind for supposing my friends theory to be correctand i could devise no better onehow black must have been the story which could be held over his head by this man and by fear of its publicity force him to undergo such humiliations this quiet gentle doctor might be a profound hypocrite a criminal a forger possibly or a poisoner only such a secret as this could account for the complete power which the younger man held over him why else should he admit so hateful a presence into his house and so harmful an influence into his school why should he submit to degradations which could not be witnessed far less endured without indignation  and yet if it were so i was forced to confess that my principal carried it off with extraordinary duplicity never by word or sign did he show that the young mans presence was distasteful to him i have seen him look pained it is true after some peculiarly outrageous exhibition but he gave me the impression that it was always on account of the scholars or of me never on account of himself he spoke to and of st james in an indulgent fashion smiling gently at what made my blood boil within me in his way of looking at him and addressing him one could see no trace of resentment but rather a sort of timid and deprecating good will his company he certainly courted and they spent many hours together in the study and the garden  as to my own relations with theophilus st james i made up my mind from the beginning that i should keep my temper with him and to that resolution i steadfastly adhered if dr mccarthy chose to permit this disrespect and to condone these outrages it was his affair and not mine it was evident that his one wish was that there should be peace between us and i felt that i could help him best by respecting this desire my easiest way to do so was to avoid my colleague and this i did to the best of my ability when we were thrown together i was quiet polite and reserved he on his part showed me no illwill but met me rather with a coarse joviality and a rough familiarity which he meant to be ingratiating he was insistent in his attempts to get me into his room at night for the purpose of playing euchre and of drinking  old mccarthy doesnt mind said he dont you be afraid of him well do what we like and ill answer for it that he wont object once only i went and when i left after a dull and gross evening my host was stretched dead drunk upon the sofa after that i gave the excuse of a course of study and spent my spare hours alone in my own room  one point upon which i was anxious to gain information was as to how long these proceedings had been going on when did st james assert his hold over dr mccarthy from neither of them could i learn how long my colleague had been in his present situation one or two leading questions upon my part were eluded or ignored in a manner so marked that it was easy to see that they were both of them as eager to conceal the point as i was to know it but at last one evening i had the chance of a chat with mrs carter the matronfor the doctor was a widowerand from her i got the information which i wanted it needed no questioning to get at her knowledge for she was so full of indignation that she shook with passion as she spoke of it and raised her hands into the air in the earnestness of her denunciation as she described the grievances which she had against my colleague  it was three years ago mr weld that he first darkened this doorstep she cried three bitter years they have been to me the school had fifty boys then now it has twentytwo thats what he has done for us in three years in another three there wont be one and the doctor that angel of patience you see how he treats him though he is not fit to lace his boots for him if it wasnt for the doctor you may be sure that i wouldnt stay an hour under the same roof with such a man and so i told him to his own face mr weld if the doctor would only pack him about his businessbut i know that i am saying more than i should she stopped herself with an effort and spoke no more upon the subject she had remembered that i was almost a stranger in the school and she feared that she had been indiscreet  there were one or two very singular points about my colleague the chief one was that he rarely took any exercise there was a playingfield within the college grounds and that was his farthest point if the boys went out it was i or dr mccarthy who accompanied them st james gave as a reason for this that he had injured his knee some years before and that walking was painful to him for my own part i put it down to pure laziness upon his part for he was of an obese heavy temperament twice however i saw him from my window stealing out of the grounds late at night and the second time i watched him return in the grey of the morning and slink in through an open window these furtive excursions were never alluded to but they exposed the hollowness of his story about his knee and they increased the dislike and distrust which i had of the man his nature seemed to be vicious to the core  another point small but suggestive was that he hardly ever during the months that i was at willow lea house received any letters and on those few occasions they were obviously tradesmens bills i am an early riser and used every morning to pick my own correspondence out of the bundle upon the hall table i could judge therefore how few were ever there for mr theophilus st james there seemed to me to be something peculiarly ominous in this what sort of a man could he be who during thirty years of his life had never made a single friend high or low who cared to continue to keep in touch with him and yet the sinister fact remained that the head master not only tolerated but was even intimate with him more than once on entering a room i had found them talking confidentially together and they would walk arm in arm in deep conversation up and down the garden paths so curious did i become to know what the tie was which bound them that i found it gradually push out my other interests and become the main purpose of my life in school and out of school at meals and at play i was perpetually engaged in watching dr phelps mccarthy and mr theophilus st james and in endeavouring to solve the mystery which surrounded them  but unfortunately my curiosity was a little too open i had not the art to conceal the suspicions which i felt about the relations which existed between these two men and the nature of the hold which the one appeared to have over the other it may have been my manner of watching them it may have been some indiscreet question but it is certain that i showed too clearly what i felt one night i was conscious that the eyes of theophilus st james were fixed upon me in a surly and menacing stare i had a foreboding of evil and i was not surprised when dr mccarthy called me next morning into his study  i am very sorry mr weld said he but i am afraid that i shall be compelled to dispense with your services  perhaps you would give me some reason for dismissing me i answered for i was conscious of having done my duties to the best of my power and knew well that only one reason could be given  i have no fault to find with you said he and the colour came to his cheeks  you send me away at the suggestion of my colleague  his eyes turned away from mine  we will not discuss the question mr weld it is impossible for me to discuss it in justice to you i will give you the strongest recommendation for your next situation i can say no more i hope that you will continue your duties here until you have found a place elsewhere  my whole soul rose against the injustice of it and yet i had no appeal and no redress i could only bow and leave the room with a bitter sense of illusage at my heart  my first instinct was to pack my boxes and leave the house but the head master had given me permission to remain until i had found another situation i was sure that st james desired me to go and that was a strong reason why i should stay if my presence annoyed him i should give him as much of it as i could i had begun to hate him and to long to have my revenge upon him if he had a hold over our principal might not i in turn obtain one over him it was a sign of weakness that he should be so afraid of my curiosity he would not resent it so much if he had not something to fear from it i entered my name once more upon the books of the agents but meanwhile i continued to fulfil my duties at willow lea house and so it came about that i was present at the dénouement of this singular situation  during that weekfor it was only a week before the crisis camei was in the habit of going down each evening after the work of the day was done to inquire about my new arrangements one night it was a cold and windy evening in march i had just stepped out from the hall door when a strange sight met my eyes a man was crouching before one of the windows of the house his knees were bent and his eyes were fixed upon the small line of light between the curtain and the sash the window threw a square of brightness in front of it and in the middle of this the dark shadow of this ominous visitor showed clear and hard it was but for an instant that i saw him for he glanced up and was off in a moment through the shrubbery i could hear the patter of his feet as he ran down the road until it died away in the distance  it was evidently my duty to turn back and to tell dr mccarthy what i had seen i found him in his study i had expected him to be disturbed at such an incident but i was not prepared for the state of panic into which he fell he leaned back in his chair white and gasping like one who has received a mortal blow  which window mr weld he asked wiping his forehead which window was it  the next to the diningroommr st jamess window  dear me dear me this is indeed unfortunate a man looking through mr st jamess window he wrung his hands like a man who is at his wits end what to do  i shall be passing the policestation sir would you wish me to mention the matter  no no he cried suddenly mastering his extreme agitation i have no doubt that it was some poor tramp who intended to beg i attach no importance to the incidentnone at all dont let me detain you mr weld if you wish to go out  i left him sitting in his study with reassuring words upon his lips but with horror upon his face my heart was heavy for my little employer as i started off once more for town as i looked back from the gate at the square of light which marked the window of my colleague i suddenly saw the black outline of dr mccarthys figure passing against the lamp he had hastened from his study then to tell st james what he had heard what was the meaning of it all this atmosphere of mystery this inexplicable terror these confidences between two such dissimilar men i thought and thought as i walked but do what i would i could not hit upon any adequate conclusion i little knew how near i was to the solution of the problem  it was very latenearly twelve oclockwhen i returned and the lights were all out save one in the doctors study the black gloomy house loomed before me as i walked up the drive its sombre bulk broken only by the one glimmering point of brightness i let myself in with my latchkey and was about to enter my own room when my attention was arrested by a short sharp cry like that of a man in pain i stood and listened my hand upon the handle of my door  all was silent in the house save for a distant murmur of voices which came i knew from the doctors room i stole quietly down the corridor in that direction the sound resolved itself now into two voices the rough bullying tones of st james and the lower tone of the doctor the one apparently insisting and the other arguing and pleading four thin lines of light in the blackness showed me the door of the doctors room and step by step i drew nearer to it in the darkness st jamess voice within rose louder and louder and his words came plainly to my ear  ill have every pound of it if you wont give it me ill take it do you hear  dr mccarthys reply was inaudible but the angry voice broke in again  leave you destitute i leave you this little goldmine of a school and thats enough for one old man is it not how am i to set up in australia without money answer me that  again the doctor said something in a soothing voice but his answer only roused his companion to a higher pitch of fury  done for me what have you ever done for me except what you couldnt help doing it was for your good name not for my safety that you cared but enough cackle i must get on my way before morning will you open your safe or will you not  oh james how can you use me so cried a wailing voice and then there came a sudden little scream of pain at the sound of that helpless appeal from brutal violence i lost for once that temper upon which i had prided myself every bit of manhood in me cried out against any further neutrality with my walking cane in my hand i rushed into the study as i did so i was conscious that the halldoor bell was violently ringing  you villain i cried let him go  the two men were standing in front of a small safe which stood against one wall of the doctors room st james held the old man by the wrist and he had twisted his arm round in order to force him to produce the key my little head master white but resolute was struggling furiously in the grip of the burly athlete the bully glared over his shoulder at me with a mixture of fury and terror upon his brutal features then realising that i was alone he dropped his victim and made for me with a horrible curse  you infernal spy he cried ill do for you anyhow before i leave  i am not a very strong man and i realised that i was helpless if once at close quarters twice i cut at him with my stick but he rushed in at me with a murderous growl and seized me by the throat with both his muscular hands i fell backwards and he on the top of me with a grip which was squeezing the life from me i was conscious of his malignant yellowtinged eyes within a few inches of my own and then with a beating of pulses in my head and a singing in my ears my senses slipped away from me but even in that supreme moment i was aware that the doorbell was still violently ringing  when i came to myself i was lying upon the sofa in dr mccarthys study and the doctor himself was seated beside me he appeared to be watching me intently and anxiously for as i opened my eyes and looked about me he gave a great cry of relief thank god he cried thank god  where is he i asked looking round the room as i did so i became aware that the furniture was scattered in every direction and that there were traces of an even more violent struggle than that in which i had been engaged  the doctor sank his face between his hands  they have him he groaned after these years of trial they have him again but how thankful i am that he has not for a second time stained his hands in blood  as the doctor spoke i became aware that a man in the braided jacket of an inspector of police was standing in the doorway  yes sir he remarked you have had a pretty narrow escape if we had not got in when we did you would not be here to tell the tale i dont know that i ever saw any one much nearer to the undertaker  i sat up with my hands to my throbbing head  dr mccarthy said i this is all a mystery to me i should be glad if you could explain to me who this man is and why you have tolerated him so long in your house  i owe you an explanation mr weldand the more so since you have in so chivalrous a fashion almost sacrificed your life in my defence there is no reason now for secrecy in a word mr weld this unhappy mans real name is james mccarthy and he is my only son  your son  alas yes what sin have i ever committed that i should have such a punishment he has made my whole life a misery from the first years of his boyhood violent headstrong selfish unprincipled he has always been the same at eighteen he was a criminal at twenty in a paroxysm of passion he took the life of a boon companion and was tried for murder he only just escaped the gallows and he was condemned to penal servitude three years ago he succeeded in escaping and managed in face of a thousand obstacles to reach my house in london my wifes heart had been broken by his condemnation and as he had succeeded in getting a suit of ordinary clothes there was no one here to recognise him for months he lay concealed in the attics until the first search of the police should be over then i gave him employment here as you have seen though by his rough and overbearing manners he made my own life miserable and that of his fellowmasters unbearable you have been with us for four months mr weld but no other master endured him so long i apologise now for all you have had to submit to but i ask you what else could i do for his dead mothers sake i could not let harm come to him as long as it was in my power to fend it off only under my roof could he find a refugethe only spot in all the worldand how could i keep him here without it exciting remark unless i gave him some occupation i made him english master therefore and in that capacity i have protected him here for three years you have no doubt observed that he never during the daytime went beyond the college grounds you now understand the reason but when tonight you came to me with your report of a man who was looking through his window i understood that his retreat was at last discovered i besought him to fly at once but he had been drinking the unhappy fellow and my words fell upon deaf ears when at last he made up his mind to go he wished to take from me in his flight every shilling which i possessed it was your entrance which saved me from him while the police in turn arrived only just in time to rescue you i have made myself amenable to the law by harbouring an escaped prisoner and remain here in the custody of the inspector but a prison has no terrors for me after what i have endured in this house during the last three years  it seems to me doctor said the inspector that if you have broken the law you have had quite enough punishment already  god knows i have cried dr mccarthy and sank his haggard face upon his hands     iii  b 24   i told my story when i was taken and no one would listen to me then i told it again at the trialthe whole thing absolutely as it happened without so much as a word added i set it all out truly so help me god all that lady mannering said and did and then all that i had said and done just as it occurred and what did i get for it the prisoner put forward a rambling and inconsequential statement incredible in its details and unsupported by any shred of corroborative evidence that was what one of the london papers said and others let it pass as if i had made no defence at all and yet with my own eyes i saw lord mannering murdered and i am as guiltless of it as any man on the jury that tried me  now sir you are there to receive the petitions of prisoners it all lies with you all i ask is that you read itjust read itand then that you make an inquiry or two about the private character of this lady mannering if she still keeps the name that she had three years ago when to my sorrow and ruin i came to meet her you could use a private inquiry agent or a good lawyer and you would soon learn enough to show you that my story is the true one think of the glory it would be to you to have all the papers saying that there would have been a shocking miscarriage of justice if it had not been for your perseverance and intelligence that must be your reward since i am a poor man and can offer you nothing but if you dont do it may you never lie easy in your bed again may no night pass that you are not haunted by the thought of the man who rots in gaol because you have not done the duty which you are paid to do but you will do it sir i know just make one or two inquiries and you will soon find which way the wind blows remember also that the only person who profited by the crime was herself since it changed her from an unhappy wife to a rich young widow theres the end of the string in your hand and you only have to follow it up and see where it leads to  mind you sir i make no complaint as far as the burglary goes i dont whine about what i have deserved and so far i have had no more than i have deserved burglary it was right enough and my three years have gone to pay for it it was shown at the trial that i had had a hand in the merton cross business and did a year for that so my story had the less attention on that account a man with a previous conviction never gets a really fair trial i own to the burglary but when it comes to the murder which brought me a liferany judge but sir james might have given me the gallowsthen i tell you that i had nothing to do with it and that i am an innocent man and now ill take that night the 13th of september 1894 and ill give you just exactly what occurred and may gods hand strike me down if i go one inch over the truth  i had been at bristol in the summer looking for work and then i had a notion that i might get something at portsmouth for i was trained as a skilled mechanic so i came tramping my way across the south of england and doing odd jobs as i went i was trying all i knew to keep off the cross for i had done a year in exeter gaol and i had had enough of visiting queen victoria but its cruel hard to get work when once the black mark is against your name and it was all i could do to keep soul and body together at last after ten days of woodcutting and stonebreaking on starvation pay i found myself near salisbury with a couple of shillings in my pocket and my boots and my patience clean wore out theres an alehouse called the willing mind which stands on the road between blandford and salisbury and it was there that night i engaged a bed i was sitting alone in the taproom just about closing time when the innkeeperallen his name wascame beside me and began yarning about the neighbours he was a man that liked to talk and to have some one to listen to his talk so i sat there smoking and drinking a mug of ale which he had stood me and i took no great interest in what he said until he began to talk as the devil would have it about the riches of mannering hall  meaning the large house on the right before i came to the village said i the one that stands in its own park  exactly said heand i am giving all our talk so that you may know that i am telling you the truth and hiding nothing the long white house with the pillars said he at the side of the blandford road  now i had looked at it as i passed and it had crossed my mind as such thoughts will that it was a very easy house to get into with that great row of grand windows and glass doors i had put the thought away from me and now here was this landlord bringing it back with his talk about the riches within i said nothing but i listened and as luck would have it he would always come back to this one subject  he was a miser young so you can think what he is now in his age said he well hes had some good out of his money  what good can he have had if he does not spend it said i  well it bought him the prettiest wife in england and that was some good that he got out of it she thought she would have the spending of it but she knows the difference now  who was she then i asked just for the sake of something to say  she was nobody at all until the old lord made her his lady said he she came from up london way and some said that she had been on the stage there but nobody knew the old lord was away for a year and when he came home he brought a young wife back with him and there she has been ever since stephens the butler did tell me once that she was the light of the house when fust she came but what with her husbands mean and aggravatin way and what with her lonelinessfor he hates to see a visitor within his doors and what with his bitter wordsfor he has a tongue like a hornets sting her life all went out of her and she became a white silent creature moping about the country lanes some say that she loved another man and that it was just the riches of the old lord which tempted her to be false to her lover and that now she is eating her heart out because she has lost the one without being any nearer to the other for she might be the poorest woman in the parish for all the money that she has the handling of  well sir you can imagine that it did not interest me very much to hear about the quarrels between a lord and a lady what did it matter to me if she hated the sound of his voice or if he put every indignity upon her in the hope of breaking her spirit and spoke to her as he would never have dared to speak to one of his servants the landlord told me of these things and of many more like them but they passed out of my mind for they were no concern of mine but what i did want to hear was the form in which lord mannering kept his riches titledeeds and stock certificates are but paper and more danger than profit to the man who takes them but metal and stones are worth a risk and then as if he were answering my very thoughts the landlord told me of lord mannerings great collection of gold medals that it was the most valuable in the world and that it was reckoned that if they were put into a sack the strongest man in the parish would not be able to raise them then his wife called him and he and i went to our beds  i am not arguing to make out a case for myself but i beg you sir to bear all the facts in your mind and to ask yourself whether a man could be more sorely tempted than i was i make bold to say that there are few who could have held out against it there i lay on my bed that night a desperate man without hope or work and with my last shilling in my pocket i had tried to be honest and honest folk had turned their backs upon me they taunted me for theft and yet they pushed me towards it i was caught in the stream and could not get out and then it was such a chance the great house all lined with windows the golden medals which could so easily be melted down it was like putting a loaf before a starving man and expecting him not to eat it i fought against it for a time but it was no use at last i sat up on the side of my bed and i swore that that night i should either be a rich man and able to give up crime for ever or that the irons should be on my wrists once more then i slipped on my clothes and having put a shilling on the tablefor the landlord had treated me well and i did not wish to cheat himi passed out through the window into the garden of the inn  there was a high wall round this garden and i had a job to get over it but once on the other side it was all plain sailing i did not meet a soul upon the road and the iron gate of the avenue was open no one was moving at the lodge the moon was shining and i could see the great house glimmering white through an archway of trees i walked up it for a quarter of a mile or so until i was at the edge of the drive where it ended in a broad gravelled space before the main door there i stood in the shadow and looked at the long building with a full moon shining in every window and silvering the high stone front i crouched there for some time and i wondered where i should find the easiest entrance the corner window of the side seemed to be the one which was least overlooked and a screen of ivy hung heavily over it my best chance was evidently there i worked my way under the trees to the back of the house and then crept along in the black shadow of the building a dog barked and rattled his chain but i stood waiting until he was quiet and then i stole on once more until i came to the window which i had chosen  it is astonishing how careless they are in the country in places far removed from large towns where the thought of burglars never enters their heads i call it setting temptation in a poor mans way when he puts his hand meaning no harm upon a door and finds it swing open before him in this case it was not so bad as that but the window was merely fastened with the ordinary catch which i opened with a push from the blade of my knife i pulled up the window as quickly as possible then i thrust the knife through the slit in the shutter and prized it open they were folding shutters and i shoved them before me and walked into the room  good evening sir you are very welcome said a voice  ive had some starts in my life but never one to come up to that one there in the opening of the shutters within reach of my arm was standing a woman with a small coil of wax taper burning in her hand she was tall and straight and slender with a beautiful white face that might have been cut out of clear marble but her hair and eyes were as black as night she was dressed in some sort of white dressinggown which flowed down to her feet and what with this robe and what with her face it seemed as if a spirit from above was standing in front of me my knees knocked together and i held on to the shutter with one hand to give me support i should have turned and run away if i had had the strength but i could only just stand and stare at her  she soon brought me back to myself once more  dont be frightened said she and they were strange words for the mistress of a house to have to use to a burglar i saw you out of my bedroom window when you were hiding under those trees so i slipped downstairs and then i heard you at the window i should have opened it for you if you had waited but you managed it yourself just as i came up  i still held in my hand the long claspknife with which i had opened the shutter i was unshaven and grimed from a week on the roads altogether there are few people who would have cared to face me alone at one in the morning but this woman if i had been her lover meeting her by appointment could not have looked upon me with a more welcoming eye she laid her hand upon my sleeve and drew me into the room  whats the meaning of this maam dont get trying any little games upon me said i in my roughest wayand i can put it on rough when i like itll be the worse for you if you play me any trick i added showing her my knife  i will play you no trick said she on the contrary i am your friend and i wish to help you  excuse me maam but i find it hard to believe that said i why should you wish to help me  i have my own reasons said she and then suddenly with those black eyes blazing out of her white face its because i hate him hate him hate him now you understand  i remembered what the landlord had told me and i did understand i looked at her ladyships face and i knew that i could trust her she wanted to revenge herself upon her husband she wanted to hit him where it would hurt him mostupon the pocket she hated him so that she would even lower her pride to take such a man as me into her confidence if she could gain her end by doing so ive hated some folk in my time but i dont think i ever understood what hate was until i saw that womans face in the light of the taper  youll trust me now said she with another coaxing touch upon my sleeve  yes your ladyship  you know me then  i can guess who you are  i dare say my wrongs are the talk of the county but what does he care for that he only cares for one thing in the whole world and that you can take from him this night have you a bag  no your ladyship  shut the shutter behind you then no one can see the light you are quite safe the servants all sleep in the other wing i can show you where all the most valuable things are you cannot carry them all so we must pick the best  the room in which i found myself was long and low with many rugs and skins scattered about on a polished wood floor small cases stood here and there and the walls were decorated with spears and swords and paddles and other things which find their way into museums there were some queer clothes too which had been brought from savage countries and the lady took down a large leather sackbag from among them  this sleepingsack will do said she now come with me and i will show you where the medals are  it was like a dream to me to think that this tall white woman was the lady of the house and that she was lending me a hand to rob her own home i could have burst out laughing at the thought of it and yet there was something in that pale face of hers which stopped my laughter and turned me cold and serious she swept on in front of me like a spirit with the green taper in her hand and i walked behind with my sack until we came to a door at the end of this museum it was locked but the key was in it and she led me through  the room beyond was a small one hung all round with curtains which had pictures on them it was the hunting of a deer that was painted on it as i remember and in the flicker of that light youd have sworn that the dogs and the horses were streaming round the walls the only other thing in the room was a row of cases made of walnut with brass ornaments they had glass tops and beneath this glass i saw the long lines of those gold medals some of them as big as a plate and half an inch thick all resting upon red velvet and glowing and gleaming in the darkness my fingers were just itching to be at them and i slipped my knife under the lock of one of the cases to wrench it open  wait a moment said she laying her hand upon my arm you might do better than this  i am very well satisfied maam said i and much obliged to your ladyship for kind assistance  you can do better she repeated would not golden sovereigns be worth more to you than these things  why yes said i thats best of all  well said she he sleeps just above our head it is but one short staircase there is a tin box with money enough to fill this bag under his bed  how can i get it without waking him  what matter if he does wake she looked very hard at me as she spoke you could keep him from calling out  no no maam ill have none of that  just as you like said she i thought that you were a stouthearted sort of man by your appearance but i see that i made a mistake if you are afraid to run the risk of one old man then of course you cannot have the gold which is under his bed you are the best judge of your own business but i should think that you would do better at some other trade  ill not have murder on my conscience  you could overpower him without harming him i never said anything about murder the money lies under the bed but if you are fainthearted it is better that you should not attempt it  she worked upon me so partly with her scorn and partly with this money that she held before my eyes that i believe i should have yielded and taken my chances upstairs had it not been that i saw her eyes following the struggle within me in such a crafty malignant fashion that it was evident she was bent upon making me the tool of her revenge and that she would leave me no choice but to do the old man an injury or to be captured by him she felt suddenly that she was giving herself away and she changed her face to a kindly friendly smile but it was too late for i had had my warning  i will not go upstairs said i i have all i want here  she looked her contempt at me and there never was a face which could look it plainer  very good you can take these medals i should be glad if you would begin at this end i suppose they will all be the same value when melted down but these are the ones which are the rarest and therefore the most precious to him it is not necessary to break the locks if you press that brass knob you will find that there is a secret spring so take that small one firstit is the very apple of his eye  she had opened one of the cases and the beautiful things all lay exposed before me i had my hand upon the one which she had pointed out when suddenly a change came over her face and she held up one finger as a warning hist she whispered what is that  far away in the silence of the house we heard a low dragging shuffling sound and the distant tread of feet she closed and fastened the case in an instant  its my husband she whispered all right dont be alarmed ill arrange it here quick behind the tapestry  she pushed me behind the painted curtains upon the wall my empty leather bag still in my hand then she took her taper and walked quickly into the room from which we had come from where i stood i could see her through the open door  is that you robert she cried  the light of a candle shone through the door of the museum and the shuffling steps came nearer then i saw a face in the doorway a great heavy face all lines and creases with a huge curving nose and a pair of gold glasses fixed across it he had to throw his head back to see through the glasses and that great nose thrust out in front of him like the beak of some sort of fowl he was a big man very tall and burly so that in his loose dressinggown his figure seemed to fill up the whole doorway he had a pile of grey curling hair all round his head but his face was cleanshaven his mouth was thin and small and prim hidden away under his long masterful nose he stood there holding the candle in front of him and looking at his wife with a queer malicious gleam in his eyes it only needed that one look to tell me that he was as fond of her as she was of him  hows this he asked some new tantrum what do you mean by wandering about the house why dont you go to bed  i could not sleep she answered she spoke languidly and wearily if she was an actress once she had not forgotten her calling  might i suggest said he in the same mocking kind of voice that a good conscience is an excellent aid to sleep  that cannot be true she answered for you sleep very well  i have only one thing in my life to be ashamed of said he and his hair bristled up with anger until he looked like an old cockatoo you know best what that is it is a mistake which has brought its own punishment with it  to me as well as to you remember that  you have very little to whine about it was i who stooped and you who rose  rose  yes rose i suppose you do not deny that it is a promotion to exchange the musichall for mannering hall fool that i was ever to take you out of your true sphere  if you think so why do you not separate  because private misery is better than public humiliation because it is easier to suffer for a mistake than to own to it because also i like to keep you in my sight and to know that you cannot go back to him  you villain you cowardly villain  yes yes my lady i know your secret ambition but it shall never be while i live and if it happens after my death i will at least take care that you go to him as a beggar you and dear edward will never have the satisfaction of squandering my savings and you may make up your mind to that my lady why are those shutters and the window open  i found the night very close  it is not safe how do you know that some tramp may not be outside are you aware that my collection of medals is worth more than any similar collection in the world you have left the door open also what is there to prevent any one from rifling the cases  i was here  i know you were i heard you moving about in the medal room and that was why i came down what were you doing  looking at the medals what else should i be doing  this curiosity is something new he looked suspiciously at her and moved on towards the inner room she walking beside him  it was at this moment that i saw something which startled i had laid my claspknife open upon the top of one of the cases and there it lay in full view she saw it before he did and with a womans cunning she held her taper out so that the light of it came between lord mannerings eyes and the knife then she took it with her left hand and held it against her gown out of his sight he looked about from case to casei could have put my hand at one time upon his long nosebut there was nothing to show that the medals had been tampered with and so still snarling and grumbling he shuffled off into the other room once more  and now i have to speak of what i heard rather than of what i saw but i swear to you as i shall stand some day before my maker that what i say is the truth  when they passed into the outer room i saw him lay his candle upon the corner of one of the tables and he sat himself down but in such a position that he was just out of my sight she moved behind him as i could tell from the fact that the light of her taper threw his long lumpy shadow upon the floor in front of him then he began talking about this man whom he called edward and every word that he said was like a blistering drop of vitriol he spoke low so that i could not hear it all but from what i heard i should guess that she would as soon have been lashed with a whip at first she said some hot words in reply but then she was silent and he went on and on in that cold mocking voice of his nagging and insulting and tormenting until i wondered that she could bear to stand there in silence and listen to it then suddenly i heard him say in a sharp voice come from behind me leave go of my collar what would you dare to strike me there was a sound like a blow just a soft sort of thud and then i heard him cry out my god its blood he shuffled with his feet as if he was getting up and then i heard another blow and he cried out oh you shedevil and was quiet except for a dripping and splashing upon the floor  i ran out from behind my curtain at that and rushed into the other room shaking all over with the horror of it the old man had slipped down in the chair and his dressinggown had rucked up until he looked as if he had a monstrous hump to his back his head with the gold glasses still fixed on his nose was lolling over upon one side and his little mouth was open just like a dead fish i could not see where the blood was coming from but i could still hear it drumming upon the floor she stood behind him with the candle shining full upon her face her lips were pressed together and her eyes shining and a touch of colour had come into each of her cheeks it just wanted that to make her the most beautiful woman i had ever seen in my life  youve done it now said i  yes said she in her quiet way ive done it now  what are you going to do i asked theyll have you for murder as sure as fate  never fear about me i have nothing to live for and it does not matter give me a hand to set him straight in the chair it is horrible to see him like this  i did so though it turned me cold all over to touch him some of his blood came on my hand and sickened me  now said she you may as well have the medals as any one else take them and go  i dont want them i only want to get away i was never mixed up with a business like this before  nonsense said she you came for the medals and here they are at your mercy why should you not have them there is no one to prevent you  i held the bag still in my hand she opened the case and between us we threw a hundred or so of the medals into it they were all from the one case but i could not bring myself to wait for any more then i made for the window for the very air of this house seemed to poison me after what i had seen and heard as i looked back i saw her standing there tall and graceful with the light in her hand just as i had seen her first she waved goodbye and i waved back at her and sprang out into the gravel drive  i thank god that i can lay my hand upon my heart and say that i have never done a murder but perhaps it would be different if i had been able to read that womans mind and thoughts there might have been two bodies in the room instead of one if i could have seen behind that last smile of hers but i thought of nothing but of getting safely away and it never entered my head how she might be fixing the rope round my neck i had not taken five steps out from the window skirting down the shadow of the house in the way that i had come when i heard a scream that might have raised the parish and then another and another  murder she cried murder murder help and her voice rang out in the quiet of the nighttime and sounded over the whole countryside it went through my head that dreadful cry in an instant lights began to move and windows to fly up not only in the house behind me but at the lodge and in the stables in front like a frightened rabbit i bolted down the drive but i heard the clang of the gate being shut before i could reach it then i hid my bag of medals under some dry fagots and i tried to get away across the park but some one saw me in the moonlight and presently i had half a dozen of them with dogs upon my heels i crouched down among the brambles but those dogs were too many for me and i was glad enough when the men came up and prevented me from being torn into pieces they seized me and dragged me back to the room from which i had come  is this the man your ladyship asked the oldest of themthe same whom i found out afterwards to be the butler  she had been bending over the body with her handkerchief to her eyes and now she turned upon me with the face of a fury oh what an actress that woman was  yes yes it is the very man she cried oh you villain you cruel villain to treat an old man so  there was a man there who seemed to be a village constable he laid his hand upon my shoulder  what do you say to that said he  it was she who did it i cried pointing at the woman whose eyes never flinched before mine  come come try another said the constable and one of the menservants struck at me with his fist  i tell you that i saw her do it she stabbed him twice with a knife she first helped me to rob him and then she murdered him  the footman tried to strike me again but she held up her hand  do not hurt him said she i think that his punishment may safely be left to the law  ill see to that your ladyship said the constable your ladyship actually saw the crime committed did you not  yes yes i saw it with my own eyes it was horrible we heard the noise and we came down my poor husband was in front the man had one of the cases open and was filling a black leather bag which he held in his hand he rushed past us and my husband seized him there was a struggle and he stabbed him twice there you can see the blood upon his hands if i am not mistaken his knife is still in lord mannerings body  look at the blood upon her hands i cried  she has been holding up his lordships head you lying rascal said the butler  and heres the very sack her ladyship spoke of said the constable as a groom came in with the one which i had dropped in my flight and here are the medals inside it thats good enough for me we will keep him safe here tonight and tomorrow the inspector and i can take him into salisbury  poor creature said the woman for my own part i forgive him any injury which he has done me who knows what temptation may have driven him to crime his conscience and the law will give him punishment enough without any reproach of mine rendering it more bitter  i could not answeri tell you sir i could not answer so taken aback was i by the assurance of the woman and so seeming by my silence to agree to all that she had said i was dragged away by the butler and the constable into the cellar in which they locked me for the night  there sir i have told you the whole story of the events which led up to the murder of lord mannering by his wife upon the night of september the 14th in the year 1894 perhaps you will put my statement on one side as the constable did at mannering towers or the judge afterwards at the county assizes or perhaps you will see that there is the ring of truth in what i say and you will follow it up and so make your name for ever as a man who does not grudge personal trouble where justice is to be done i have only you to look to sir and if you will clear my name of this false accusation then i will worship you as one man never yet worshipped another but if you fail me then i give you my solemn promise that i will rope myself up this day month to the bar of my window and from that time on i will come to plague you in your dreams if ever yet one man was able to come back and to haunt another what i ask you to do is very simple make inquiries about this woman watch her learn her past history find out what she is making of the money which has come to her and whether there is not a man edward as i have stated if from all this you learn anything which shows you her real character or which seems to you to corroborate the story which i have told you then i am sure that i can rely upon your goodness of heart to come to the rescue of an innocent man     iv  the great keinplatz experiment   of all the sciences which have puzzled the sons of men none had such an attraction for the learned professor von baumgarten as those which relate to psychology and the illdefined relations between mind and matter a celebrated anatomist a profound chemist and one of the first physiologists in europe it was a relief for him to turn from these subjects and to bring his varied knowledge to bear upon the study of the soul and the mysterious relationship of spirits at first when as a young man he began to dip into the secrets of mesmerism his mind seemed to be wandering in a strange land where all was chaos and darkness save that here and there some great unexplainable and disconnected fact loomed out in front of him as the years passed however and as the worthy professors stock of knowledge increased for knowledge begets knowledge as money bears interest much which had seemed strange and unaccountable began to take another shape in his eyes new trains of reasoning became familiar to him and he perceived connecting links where all had been incomprehensible and startling by experiments which extended over twenty years he obtained a basis of facts upon which it was his ambition to build up a new exact science which should embrace mesmerism spiritualism and all cognate subjects in this he was much helped by his intimate knowledge of the more intricate parts of animal physiology which treat of nerve currents and the working of the brain for alexis von baumgarten was regius professor of physiology at the university of keinplatz and had all the resources of the laboratory to aid him in his profound researches  professor von baumgarten was tall and thin with a hatchet face and steelgrey eyes which were singularly bright and penetrating much thought had furrowed his forehead and contracted his heavy eyebrows so that he appeared to wear a perpetual frown which often misled people as to his character for though austere he was tenderhearted he was popular among the students who would gather round him after his lectures and listen eagerly to his strange theories often he would call for volunteers from amongst them in order to conduct some experiment so that eventually there was hardly a lad in the class who had not at one time or another been thrown into a mesmeric trance by his professor  of all these young devotees of science there was none who equalled in enthusiasm fritz von hartmann it had often seemed strange to his fellowstudents that wild reckless fritz as dashing a young fellow as ever hailed from the rhinelands should devote the time and trouble which he did in reading up abstruse works and in assisting the professor in his strange experiments the fact was however that fritz was a knowing and longheaded fellow months before he had lost his heart to young elise the blueeyed yellowhaired daughter of the lecturer although he had succeeded in learning from her lips that she was not indifferent to his suit he had never dared to announce himself to her family as a formal suitor hence he would have found it a difficult matter to see his young lady had he not adopted the expedient of making himself useful to the professor by this means he frequently was asked to the old mans house where he willingly submitted to be experimented upon in any way as long as there was a chance of his receiving one bright glance from the eyes of elise or one touch of her little hand  young fritz von hartmann was a handsome lad enough there were broad acres too which would descend to him when his father died to many he would have seemed an eligible suitor but madame frowned upon his presence in the house and lectured the professor at times on his allowing such a wolf to prowl around their lamb to tell the truth fritz had an evil name in keinplatz never was there a riot or a duel or any other mischief afoot but the young rhinelander figured as a ringleader in it no one used more free and violent language no one drank more no one played cards more habitually no one was more idle save in the one solitary subject no wonder then that the good frau professorin gathered her fräulein under her wing and resented the attentions of such a mauvais sujet as to the worthy lecturer he was too much engrossed by his strange studies to form an opinion upon the subject one way or the other  for many years there was one question which had continually obtruded itself upon his thoughts all his experiments and his theories turned upon a single point a hundred times a day the professor asked himself whether it was possible for the human spirit to exist apart from the body for a time and then to return to it once again when the possibility first suggested itself to him his scientific mind had revolted from it it clashed too violently with preconceived ideas and the prejudices of his early training gradually however as he proceeded farther and farther along the pathway of original research his mind shook off its old fetters and became ready to face any conclusion which could reconcile the facts there were many things which made him believe that it was possible for mind to exist apart from matter at last it occurred to him that by a daring and original experiment the question might be definitely decided  it is evident he remarked in his celebrated article upon invisible entities which appeared in the keinplatz wochentliche medicalschrift about this time and which surprised the whole scientific worldit is evident that under certain conditions the soul or mind does separate itself from the body in the case of a mesmerised person the body lies in a cataleptic condition but the spirit has left it perhaps you reply that the soul is there but in a dormant condition i answer that this is not so otherwise how can one account for the condition of clairvoyance which has fallen into disrepute through the knavery of certain scoundrels but which can easily be shown to be an undoubted fact i have been able myself with a sensitive subject to obtain an accurate description of what was going on in another room or another house how can such knowledge be accounted for on any hypothesis save that the soul of the subject has left the body and is wandering through space for a moment it is recalled by the voice of the operator and says what it has seen and then wings its way once more through the air since the spirit is by its very nature invisible we cannot see these comings and goings but we see their effect in the body of the subject now rigid and inert now struggling to narrate impressions which could never have come to it by natural means there is only one way which i can see by which the fact can be demonstrated although we in the flesh are unable to see these spirits yet our own spirits could we separate them from the body would be conscious of the presence of others it is my intention therefore shortly to mesmerise one of my pupils i shall then mesmerise myself in a manner which has become easy to me after that if my theory holds good my spirit will have no difficulty in meeting and communing with the spirit of my pupil both being separated from the body i hope to be able to communicate the result of this interesting experiment in an early number of the keinplatz wochenliche medicalschrift  when the good professor finally fulfilled his promise and published an account of what occurred the narrative was so extraordinary that it was received with general incredulity the tone of some of the papers was so offensive in their comments upon the matter that the angry savant declared that he would never open his mouth again or refer to the subject in any waya promise which he has faithfully kept this narrative has been compiled however from the most authentic sources and the events cited in it may be relied upon as substantially correct  it happened then that shortly after the time when professor von baumgarten conceived the idea of the abovementioned experiment he was walking thoughtfully homewards after a long day in the laboratory when he met a crowd of roystering students who had just streamed out from a beerhouse at the head of them halfintoxicated and very noisy was young fritz von hartmann the professor would have passed them but his pupil ran across and intercepted him  heh my worthy master he said taking the old man by the sleeve and leading him down the road with him there is something that i have to say to you and it is easier for me to say it now when the good beer is humming in my head than at another time  what is it then fritz the physiologist asked looking at him in mild surprise  i hear mein herr that you are about to do some wondrous experiment in which you hope to take a mans soul out of his body and then to put it back again is it not so  it is true fritz  and have you considered my dear sir that you may have some difficulty in finding some one on whom to try this potztausend suppose that the soul went out and would not come back that would be a bad business who is to take the risk  but fritz the professor cried very much startled by this view of the matter i had relied upon your assistance in the attempt surely you will not desert me consider the honour and glory  consider the fiddlesticks the student cried angrily am i to be paid always thus did i not stand two hours upon a glass insulator while you poured electricity into my body have you not stimulated my phrenic nerves besides ruining my digestion with a galvanic current round my stomach fourandthirty times you have mesmerised me and what have i got from all this nothing and now you wish to take my soul out as you would take the works from a watch it is more than flesh and blood can stand  dear dear the professor cried in great distress that is very true fritz i never thought of it before if you can but suggest how i can compensate you you will find me ready and willing  then listen said fritz solemnly if you will pledge your word that after this experiment i may have the hand of your daughter then i am willing to assist you but if not i shall have nothing to do with it these are my only terms  and what would my daughter say to this the professor exclaimed after a pause of astonishment  elise would welcome it the young man replied we have loved each other long  then she shall be yours the physiologist said with decision for you are a goodhearted young man and one of the best neurotic subjects that i have ever knownthat is when you are not under the influence of alcohol my experiment is to be performed upon the fourth of next month you will attend at the physiological laboratory at twelve oclock it will be a great occasion fritz von gruben is coming from jena and hinterstein from basle the chief men of science of all south germany will be there  i shall be punctual the student said briefly and so the two parted the professor plodded homeward thinking of the great coming event while the young man staggered along after his noisy companions with his mind full of the blueeyed elise and of the bargain which he had concluded with her father  the professor did not exaggerate when he spoke of the widespread interest excited by his novel psychological experiment long before the hour had arrived the room was filled by a galaxy of talent besides the celebrities whom he had mentioned there had come from london the great professor lurcher who had just established his reputation by a remarkable treatise upon cerebral centres several great lights of the spiritualistic body had also come a long distance to be present as had a swedenborgian minister who considered that the proceedings might throw some light upon the doctrines of the rosy cross  there was considerable applause from this eminent assembly upon the appearance of professor von baumgarten and his subject upon the platform the lecturer in a few wellchosen words explained what his views were and how he proposed to test them i hold he said that when a person is under the influence of mesmerism his spirit is for the time released from his body and i challenge any one to put forward any other hypothesis which will account for the fact of clairvoyance i therefore hope that upon mesmerising my young friend here and then putting myself into a trance our spirits may be able to commune together though our bodies lie still and inert after a time nature will resume her sway our spirits will return into our respective bodies and all will be as before with your kind permission we shall now proceed to attempt the experiment  the applause was renewed at this speech and the audience settled down in expectant silence with a few rapid passes the professor mesmerised the young man who sank back in his chair pale and rigid he then took a bright globe of glass from his pocket and by concentrating his gaze upon it and making a strong mental effort he succeeded in throwing himself into the same condition it was a strange and impressive sight to see the old man and the young sitting together in the same cataleptic condition whither then had their souls fled that was the question which presented itself to each and every one of the spectators  five minutes passed and then ten and then fifteen and then fifteen more while the professor and his pupil sat stiff and stark upon the platform during that time not a sound was heard from the assembled savants but every eye was bent upon the two pale faces in search of the first signs of returning consciousness nearly an hour had elapsed before the patient watchers were rewarded a faint flush came back to the cheeks of professor von baumgarten the soul was coming back once more to its earthly tenement suddenly he stretched out his long thin arms as one awaking from sleep and rubbing his eyes stood up from his chair and gazed about him as though he hardly realised where he was tausend teufel he exclaimed rapping out a tremendous south german oath to the great astonishment of his audience and to the disgust of the swedenborgian where the henker am i then and what in thunder has occurred oh yes i remember now one of these nonsensical mesmeric experiments there is no result this time for i remember nothing at all since i became unconscious so you have had all your long journeys for nothing my learned friends and a very good joke too at which the regius professor of physiology burst into a roar of laughter and slapped his thigh in a highly indecorous fashion the audience were so enraged at this unseemly behaviour on the part of their host that there might have been a considerable disturbance had it not been for the judicious interference of young fritz von hartmann who had now recovered from his lethargy stepping to the front of the platform the young man apologised for the conduct of his companion i am sorry to say he said that he is a harumscarum sort of fellow although he appeared so grave at the commencement of this experiment he is still suffering from mesmeric reaction and is hardly accountable for his words as to the experiment itself i do not consider it to be a failure it is very possible that our spirits may have been communing in space during this hour but unfortunately our gross bodily memory is distinct from our spirit and we cannot recall what has occurred my energies shall now be devoted to devising some means by which spirits may be able to recollect what occurs to them in their free state and i trust that when i have worked this out i may have the pleasure of meeting you all once again in this hall and demonstrating to you the result this address coming from so young a student caused considerable astonishment among the audience and some were inclined to be offended thinking that he assumed rather too much importance the majority however looked upon him as a young man of great promise and many comparisons were made as they left the hall between his dignified conduct and the levity of his professor who during the above remarks was laughing heartily in a corner by no means abashed at the failure of the experiment  now although all these learned men were filing out of the lectureroom under the impression that they had seen nothing of note as a matter of fact one of the most wonderful things in the whole history of the world had just occurred before their very eyes professor von baumgarten had been so far correct in his theory that both his spirit and that of his pupil had been for a time absent from the body but here a strange and unforeseen complication had occurred in their return the spirit of fritz von hartmann had entered into the body of alexis von baumgarten and that of alexis von baumgarten had taken up its abode in the frame of fritz von hartmann hence the slang and scurrility which issued from the lips of the serious professor and hence also the weighty words and grave statements which fell from the careless student it was an unprecedented event yet no one knew of it least of all those whom it concerned  the body of the professor feeling conscious suddenly of a great dryness about the back of the throat sallied out into the street still chuckling to himself over the result of the experiment for the soul of fritz within was reckless at the thought of the bride whom he had won so easily his first impulse was to go up to the house and see her but on second thought he came to the conclusion that it would be best to stay away until madame baumgarten should be informed by her husband of the agreement which had been made he therefore made his way down to the grüner mann which was one of the favourite trystingplaces of the wilder students and ran boisterously waving his cane in the air into the little parlour where sat spiegle and müller and half a dozen other boon companions  ha ha my boys he shouted i knew i should find you here drink up every one of you and call for what you like for im going to stand treat today  had the green man who is depicted upon the signpost of that wellknown inn suddenly marched into the room and called for a bottle of wine the students could not have been more amazed than they were by this unexpected entry of their revered professor they were so astonished that for a minute or two they glared at him in utter bewilderment without being able to make any reply to his hearty invitation  donner und blitzen shouted the professor angrily what the deuce is the matter with you then you sit there like a set of stuck pigs staring at me what is it then  it is the unexpected honour stammered spiegel who was in the chair  honourrubbish said the professor testily do you think that just because i happen to have been exhibiting mesmerism to a parcel of old fossils i am therefore too proud to associate with dear old friends like you come out of that chair spiegel my boy for i shall preside now beer or wine or schnapps my ladscall for what you like and put it all down to me  never was there such an afternoon in the grüner mann the foaming flagons of lager and the greennecked bottles of rhenish circulated merrily by degrees the students lost their shyness in the presence of their professor as for him he shouted he sang he roared he balanced a long tobaccopipe upon his nose and offered to run a hundred yards against any member of the company the kellner and the barmaid whispered to each other outside the door their astonishment at such proceedings on the part of a regius professor of the ancient university of keinplatz they had still more to whisper about afterwards for the learned man cracked the kellners crown and kissed the barmaid behind the kitchen door  gentlemen said the professor standing up albeit somewhat totteringly at the end of the table and balancing his high oldfashioned wine glass in his bony hand i must now explain to you what is the cause of this festivity  hear hear roared the students hammering their beer glasses against the table a speech a speechsilence for a speech  the fact is my friends said the professor beaming through his spectacles i hope very soon to be married  married cried a student bolder than the others is madame dead then  madame who  why madame von baumgarten of course  ha ha laughed the professor i can see then that you know all about my former difficulties no she is not dead but i have reason to believe that she will not oppose my marriage  that is very accommodating of her remarked one of the company  in fact said the professor i hope that she will now be induced to aid me in getting a wife she and i never took to each other very much but now i hope all that may be ended and when i marry she will come and stay with me  what a happy family exclaimed some wag  yes indeed and i hope you will come to my wedding all of you i wont mention names but here is to my little bride and the professor waved his glass in the air  heres to his little bride roared the roysterers with shouts of laughter heres her health sie soll lebenhoch and so the fun waxed still more fast and furious while each young fellow followed the professors example and drank a toast to the girl of his heart  while all this festivity had been going on at the grüner mann a very different scene had been enacted elsewhere young fritz von hartmann with a solemn face and a reserved manner had after the experiment consulted and adjusted some mathematical instruments after which with a few peremptory words to the janitor he had walked out into the street and wended his way slowly in the direction of the house of the professor as he walked he saw von althaus the professor of anatomy in front of him and quickening his pace he overtook him  i say von althaus he exclaimed tapping him on the sleeve you were asking me for some information the other day concerning the middle coat of the cerebral arteries now i find  donnerwetter shouted von althaus who was a peppery old fellow what the deuce do you mean by your impertinence ill have you up before the academical senate for this sir with which threat he turned on his heel and hurried away von hartmann was much surprised at this reception its on account of this failure of my experiment he said to himself and continued moodily on his way  fresh surprises were in store for him however he was hurrying along when he was overtaken by two students these youths instead of raising their caps or showing any other sign of respect gave a wild whoop of delight the instant that they saw him and rushing at him seized him by each arm and commenced dragging him along with them  gott in himmel roared von hartmann what is the meaning of this unparalleled insult where are you taking me  to crack a bottle of wine with us said the two students come along that is an invitation which you have never refused  i never heard of such insolence in my life cried von hartmann let go my arms i shall certainly have you rusticated for this let me go i say and he kicked furiously at his captors  oh if you choose to turn illtempered you may go where you like the students said releasing him we can do very well without you  i know you ill pay you out said von hartmann furiously and continued in the direction which he imagined to be his own home much incensed at the two episodes which had occurred to him on the way  now madame von baumgarten who was looking out of the window and wondering why her husband was late for dinner was considerably astonished to see the young student come stalking down the road as already remarked she had a great antipathy to him and if ever he ventured into the house it was on sufferance and under the protection of the professor still more astonished was she therefore when she beheld him undo the wicketgate and stride up the garden path with the air of one who is master of the situation she could hardly believe her eyes and hastened to the door with all her maternal instincts up in arms from the upper windows the fair elise had also observed this daring move upon the part of her lover and her heart beat quick with mingled pride and consternation  good day sir madame von baumgarten remarked to the intruder as she stood in gloomy majesty in the open doorway  a very fine day indeed martha returned the other now dont stand there like a statue of juno but bustle about and get the dinner ready for i am wellnigh starved  martha dinner ejaculated the lady falling back in astonishment  yes dinner martha dinner howled von hartmann who was becoming irritable is there anything wonderful in that request when a man has been out all day ill wait in the diningroom anything will do schinken and sausage and prunesany little thing that happens to be about there you are standing staring again woman will you or will you not stir your legs  this last address delivered with a perfect shriek of rage had the effect of sending good madame von baumgarten flying along the passage and through the kitchen where she locked herself up in the scullery and went into violent hysterics in the meantime von hartmann strode into the room and threw himself down upon the sofa in the worst of tempers  elise he shouted confound the girl elise  thus roughly summoned the young lady came timidly downstairs and into the presence of her lover dearest she cried throwing her arms round him i know this is all done for my sake it is a ruse in order to see me  von hartmanns indignation at this fresh attack upon him was so great that he became speechless for a minute from rage and could only glare and shake his fists while he struggled in her embrace when he at last regained his utterance he indulged in such a bellow of passion that the young lady dropped back petrified with fear into an armchair  never have i passed such a day in my life von hartmann cried stamping upon the floor my experiment has failed von althaus has insulted me two students have dragged me along the public road my wife nearly faints when i ask her for dinner and my daughter flies at me and hugs me like a grizzly bear  you are ill dear the young lady cried your mind is wandering you have not even kissed me once  no and i dont intend to either von hartmann said with decision you ought to be ashamed of yourself why dont you go and fetch my slippers and help your mother to dish the dinner  and is it for this elise cried burying her face in her handkerchiefis it for this that i have loved you passionately for upwards of ten months is it for this that i have braved my mothers wrath oh you have broken my heart i am sure you have and she sobbed hysterically  i cant stand much more of this roared von hartmann furiously what the deuce does the girl mean what did i do ten months ago which inspired you with such a particular affection for me if you are really so very fond you would do better to run away down and find the schinken and some bread instead of talking all this nonsense  oh my darling cried the unhappy maiden throwing herself into the arms of what she imagined to be her lover you do but joke in order to frighten your little elise  now it chanced that at the moment of this unexpected embrace von hartmann was still leaning back against the end of the sofa which like much german furniture was in a somewhat rickety condition it also chanced that beneath this end of the sofa there stood a tank full of water in which the physiologist was conducting certain experiments upon the ova of fish and which he kept in his drawingroom in order to ensure an equable temperature the additional weight of the maiden combined with the impetus with which she hurled herself upon him caused the precarious piece of furniture to give way and the body of the unfortunate student was hurled backwards into the tank in which his head and shoulders were firmly wedged while his lower extremities flapped helplessly about in the air this was the last straw extricating himself with some difficulty from his unpleasant position von hartmann gave an inarticulate yell of fury and dashing out of the room in spite of the entreaties of elise he seized his hat and rushed off into the town all dripping and dishevelled with the intention of seeking in some inn the food and comfort which he could not find at home  as the spirit of von baumgarten encased in the body of von hartmann strode down the winding pathway which led down to the little town brooding angrily over his many wrongs he became aware that an elderly man was approaching him who appeared to be in an advanced state of intoxication von hartmann waited by the side of the road and watched this individual who came stumbling along reeling from one side of the road to the other and singing a student song in a very husky and drunken voice at first his interest was merely excited by the fact of seeing a man of so venerable an appearance in such a disgraceful condition but as he approached nearer he became convinced that he knew the other well though he could not recall when or where he had met him this impression became so strong with him that when the stranger came abreast of him he stepped in front of him and took a good look at his features  well sonny said the drunken man surveying von hartmann and swaying about in front of him where the henker have i seen you before i know you as well as i know myself who the deuce are you  i am professor von baumgarten said the student may i ask who you are i am strangely familiar with your features  you should never tell lies young man said the other youre certainly not the professor for he is an ugly snuffy old chap and you are a big broadshouldered young fellow as to myself i am fritz von hartmann at your service  that you certainly are not exclaimed the body of von hartmann you might very well be his father but hullo sir are you aware that you are wearing my studs and my watchchain  donnerwetter hiccoughed the other if those are not the trousers for which my tailor is about to sue me may i never taste beer again  now as von hartmann overwhelmed by the many strange things which had occurred to him that day passed his hand over his forehead and cast his eyes downwards he chanced to catch the reflection of his own face in a pool which the rain had left upon the road to his utter astonishment he perceived that his face was that of a youth that his dress was that of a fashionable young student and that in every way he was the antithesis of the grave and scholarly figure in which his mind was wont to dwell in an instant his active brain ran over the series of events which had occurred and sprang to the conclusion he fairly reeled under the blow  himmel he cried i see it all our souls are in the wrong bodies i am you and you are i my theory is provedbut at what an expense is the most scholarly mind in europe to go about with this frivolous exterior oh the labours of a lifetime are ruined and he smote his breast in his despair  i say remarked the real von hartmann from the body of the professor i quite see the force of your remarks but dont go knocking my body about like that you received it in an excellent condition but i perceive that you have wet it and bruised it and spilled snuff over my ruffled shirtfront  it matters little the other said moodily such as we are so must we stay my theory is triumphantly proved but the cost is terrible  if i thought so said the spirit of the student it would be hard indeed what could i do with these stiff old limbs and how could i woo elise and persuade her that i was not her father no thank heaven in spite of the beer which has upset me more than ever it could upset my real self i can see a way out of it  how gasped the professor  why by repeating the experiment liberate our souls once more and the chances are that they will find their way back into their respective bodies  no drowning man could clutch more eagerly at a straw than did von baumgartens spirit at this suggestion in feverish haste he dragged his own frame to the side of the road and threw it into a mesmeric trance he then extracted the crystal ball from the pocket and managed to bring himself into the same condition  some students and peasants who chanced to pass during the next hour were much astonished to see the worthy professor of physiology and his favourite student both sitting upon a very muddy bank and both completely insensible before the hour was up quite a crowd had assembled and they were discussing the advisability of sending for an ambulance to convey the pair to hospital when the learned savant opened his eyes and gazed vacantly around him for an instant he seemed to forget how he had come there but next moment he astonished his audience by waving his skinny arms above his head and crying out in a voice of rapture gott sei gedanket i am myself again i feel i am nor was the amazement lessened when the student springing to his feet burst into the same cry and the two performed a sort of pas de joie in the middle of the road  for some time after that people had some suspicion of the sanity of both the actors in this strange episode when the professor published his experiences in the medicalschrift as he had promised he was met by an intimation even from his colleagues that he would do well to have his mind cared for and that another such publication would certainly consign him to a madhouse the student also found by experience that it was wisest to be silent about the matter  when the worthy lecturer returned home that night he did not receive the cordial welcome which he might have looked for after his strange adventures on the contrary he was roundly upbraided by both his female relatives for smelling of drink and tobacco and also for being absent while a young scapegrace invaded the house and insulted its occupants it was long before the domestic atmosphere of the lecturers house resumed its normal quiet and longer still before the genial face of von hartmann was seen beneath its roof perseverance however conquers every obstacle and the student eventually succeeded in pacifying the enraged ladies and in establishing himself upon the old footing he has now no longer any cause to fear the enmity of madame for he is hauptmann von hartmann of the emperors own uhlans and his loving wife elise has already presented him with two little uhlans as a visible sign and token of her affection     v  cyprian overbeck wells  a literary mosaic   from my boyhood i have had an intense and overwhelming conviction that my real vocation lay in the direction of literature i have however had a most unaccountable difficulty in getting any responsible person to share my views it is true that private friends have sometimes after listening to my effusions gone the length of remarking really smith thats not half bad or you take my advice old boy and send that to some magazine but i have never on these occasions had the moral courage to inform my adviser that the article in question had been sent to wellnigh every publisher in london and had come back again with a rapidity and precision which spoke well for the efficiency of our postal arrangements  had my manuscripts been paper boomerangs they could not have returned with greater accuracy to their unhappy despatcher oh the vileness and utter degradation of the moment when the stale little cylinder of closely written pages which seemed so fresh and full of promise a few days ago is handed in by a remorseless postman and what moral depravity shines through the editors ridiculous plea of want of space but the subject is a painful one and a digression from the plain statement of facts which i originally contemplated  from the age of seventeen to that of threeandtwenty i was a literary volcano in a constant state of eruption poems and tales articles and reviews nothing came amiss to my pen from the great seaserpent to the nebular hypothesis i was ready to write on anything or everything and i can safely say that i seldom handled a subject without throwing new lights upon it poetry and romance however had always the greatest attractions for me how i have wept over the pathos of my heroines and laughed at the comicalities of my buffoons alas i could find no one to join me in my appreciation and solitary admiration for ones self however genuine becomes satiating after a time my father remonstrated with me too on the score of expense and loss of time so that i was finally compelled to relinquish my dreams of literary independence and to become a clerk in a wholesale mercantile firm connected with the west african trade  even when condemned to the prosaic duties which fell to my lot in the office i continued faithful to my first love i have introduced pieces of wordpainting into the most commonplace business letters which have i am told considerably astonished the recipients my refined sarcasm has made defaulting creditors writhe and wince occasionally like the great silas wegg i would drop into poetry and so raise the whole tone of the correspondence thus what could be more elegant than my rendering of the firms instructions to the captain of one of their vessels it ran in this way    from england captain you must steer a   course directly to madeira   land the casks of salted beef   then away to teneriffe   pray be careful cool and wary   with the merchants of canary   when you leave them make the most   of the trade winds to the coast   down it you shall sail as far   as the land of calabar   and from there youll onward go   to bonny and fernando po  and so on for four pages the captain instead of treasuring up this little gem called at the office next day and demanded with quite unnecessary warmth what the thing meant and i was compelled to translate it all back into prose on this as on other similar occasions my employer took me severely to taskfor he was you see a man entirely devoid of all pretensions to literary taste  all this however is a mere preamble and leads up to the fact that after ten years or so of drudgery i inherited a legacy which though small was sufficient to satisfy my simple wants finding myself independent i rented a quiet house removed from the uproar and bustle of london and there i settled down with the intention of producing some great work which should single me out from the family of the smiths and render my name immortal to this end i laid in several quires of foolscap a box of quill pens and a sixpenny bottle of ink and having given my housekeeper injunctions to deny me to all visitors i proceeded to look round for a suitable subject  i was looking round for some weeks at the end of that time i found that i had by constant nibbling devoured a large number of the quills and had spread the ink out to such advantage what with blots spills and abortive commencements that there appeared to be some everywhere except in the bottle as to the story itself however the facility of my youth had deserted me completely and my mind remained a complete blank nor could i do what i would excite my sterile imagination to conjure up a single incident or character  in this strait i determined to devote my leisure to running rapidly through the works of the leading english novelists from daniel defoe to the present day in the hope of stimulating my latent ideas and of getting a good grasp of the general tendency of literature for some time past i had avoided opening any work of fiction because one of the greatest faults of my youth had been that i invariably and unconsciously mimicked the style of the last author whom i had happened to read now however i made up my mind to seek safety in a multitude and by consulting all the english classics to avoid the danger of imitating any one too closely i had just accomplished the task of reading through the majority of the standard novels at the time when my narrative commences  it was then about twenty minutes to ten on the night of the fourth of june eighteen hundred and eightysix that after disposing of a pint of beer and a welsh rarebit for my supper i seated myself in my armchair cocked my feet upon a stool and lit my pipe as was my custom both my pulse and my temperature were as far as i know normal at the time i would give the state of the barometer but that unlucky instrument had experienced an unprecedented fall of fortytwo inchesfrom a nail to the groundand was not in a reliable condition we live in a scientific age and i flatter myself that i move with the times  whilst in that comfortable lethargic condition which accompanies both digestion and poisoning by nicotine i suddenly became aware of the extraordinary fact that my little drawingroom had elongated into a great salon and that my humble table had increased in proportion round this colossal mahogany were seated a great number of people who were talking earnestly together and the surface in front of them was strewn with books and pamphlets i could not help observing that these persons were dressed in a most extraordinary mixture of costumes for those at the end nearest to me wore peruke wigs swords and all the fashions of two centuries back those about the centre had tight kneebreeches high cravats and heavy bunches of seals while among those at the far side the majority were dressed in the most modern style and among them i saw to my surprise several eminent men of letters whom i had the honour of knowing there were two or three women in the company i should have risen to my feet to greet these unexpected guests but all power of motion appeared to have deserted me and i could only lie still and listen to their conversation which i soon perceived to be all about myself  egad exclaimed a rough weatherbeaten man who was smoking a long churchwarden pipe at my end of the table my heart softens for him why gossips weve been in the same straits ourselves gadzooks never did mother feel more concern for her eldest born than i when rory random went out to make his own way in the world  right tobias right cried another man seated at my very elbow by my troth i lost more flesh over poor robin on his island than had i the sweating sickness twice told the tale was wellnigh done when in swaggers my lord of rochestera merry gallant and one whose word in matters literary might make or mar how now defoe quoth he hast a tale on hand even so your lordship i returned a right merry one i trust quoth he discourse unto me concerning thy heroine a comely lass dan or i mistake nay i replied there is no heroine in the matter split not your phrases quoth he thou weighest every word like a scald attorney speak to me of thy principal female character be she heroine or no my lord i answered there is no female character then out upon thyself and thy book too he cried thou hadst best burn itand so out in great dudgeon whilst i fell to mourning over my poor romance which was thus as it were sentenced to death before its birth yet there are a thousand now who have heard of robin and his man friday to one who has heard of my lord of rochester  very true defoe said a geniallooking man in a red waistcoat who was sitting at the modern end of the table but all this wont help our good friend smith in making a start at his story which i believe was the reason why we assembled  the dickens it is stammered a little man beside him and everybody laughed especially the genial man who cried out charley lamb charley lamb youll never alter you would make a pun if you were hanged for it  that would be a case of haltering returned the other on which everybody laughed again  by this time i had begun to dimly realise in my confused brain the enormous honour which had been done me the greatest masters of fiction in every age of english letters had apparently made a rendezvous beneath my roof in order to assist me in my difficulties there were many faces at the table whom i was unable to identify but when i looked hard at others i often found them to be very familiar to me whether from paintings or from mere description thus between the first two speakers who had betrayed themselves as defoe and smollett there sat a dark saturnine corpulent old man with harsh prominent features who i was sure could be none other than the famous author of gulliver there were several others of whom i was not so sure sitting at the other side of the table but i conjecture that both fielding and richardson were among them and i could swear to the lanternjaws and cadaverous visage of lawrence sterne higher up i could see among the crowd the high forehead of sir walter scott the masculine features of george eliot and the flattened nose of thackeray while amongst the living i recognised james payn walter besant the lady known as ouida robert louis stevenson and several of lesser note never before probably had such an assemblage of choice spirits gathered under one roof  well said sir walter scott speaking with a very pronounced accent ye ken the auld proverb sirs ower mony cooks or as the border minstrel sang    black johnstone wi his troopers ten     might mak the heart turn cauld   but johnstone when hes a alane     is waur ten thoosand fauld  the johnstones were one of the redesdale families second cousins of the armstrongs and connected by marriage to  perhaps sir walter interrupted thackeray you would take the responsibility off our hands by yourself dictating the commencement of a story to this young literary aspirant  na na cried sir walter ill do my share but theres chairlie over there as full o wut as a radicals full o treason hes the laddie to give a cheery opening to it  dickens was shaking his head and apparently about to refuse the honour when a voice from among the modernsi could not see who it was for the crowdsaid  suppose we begin at the end of the table and work round any one contributing a little as the fancy seizes him  agreed agreed cried the whole company and every eye was turned on defoe who seemed very uneasy and filled his pipe from a great tobaccobox in front of him  nay gossips he said there are others more worthy but he was interrupted by loud cries of no no from the whole table and smollett shouted out stand to it danstand to it you and i and the dean here will make three short tacks just to fetch her out of harbour and then she may drift where she pleases thus encouraged defoe cleared his throat and began in this way talking between the puffs of his pipe  my father was a welltodo yeoman of cheshire named cyprian overbeck but marrying about the year 1617 he assumed the name of his wifes family which was wells and thus i their eldest son was named cyprian overbeck wells the farm was a very fertile one and contained some of the best grazing land in those parts so that my father was enabled to lay by money to the extent of a thousand crowns which he laid out in an adventure to the indies with such surprising success that in less than three years it had increased fourfold thus encouraged he bought a part share of the trader and fitting her out once more with such commodities as were most in demand viz old muskets hangers and axes besides glasses needles and the like he placed me on board as supercargo to look after his interests and despatched us upon our voyage  we had a fair wind as far as cape de verde and there getting into the northwest tradewinds made good progress down the african coast beyond sighting a barbary rover once whereat our mariners were in sad distress counting themselves already as little better than slaves we had good luck until we had come within a hundred leagues of the cape of good hope when the wind veered round to the southward and blew exceeding hard while the sea rose to such a height that the end of the mainyard dipped into the water and i heard the master say that though he had been at sea for fiveandthirty years he had never seen the like of it and that he had little expectation of riding through it on this i fell to wringing my hands and bewailing myself until the mast going by the board with a crash i thought that the ship had struck and swooned with terror falling into the scuppers and lying like one dead which was the saving of me as will appear in the sequel for the mariners giving up all hope of saving the ship and being in momentary expectation that she would founder pushed off in the longboat whereby i fear that they met the fate which they hoped to avoid since i have never from that day heard anything of them for my own part on recovering from the swoon into which i had fallen i found that by the mercy of providence the sea had gone down and that i was alone in the vessel at which last discovery i was so terrorstruck that i could but stand wringing my hands and bewailing my sad fate until at last taking heart i fell to comparing my lot with that of my unhappy camerados on which i became more cheerful and descending to the cabin made a meal off such dainties as were in the captains locker  having got so far defoe remarked that he thought he had given them a fair start and handed over the story to dean swift who after premising that he feared he would find himself as much at sea as master cyprian overbeck wells continued in this way  for two days i drifted about in great distress fearing that there should be a return of the gale and keeping an eager lookout for my late companions upon the third day towards evening i observed to my extreme surprise that the ship was under the influence of a very powerful current which ran to the northeast with such violence that she was carried now bows on now stern on and occasionally drifting sideways like a crab at a rate which i cannot compute at less than twelve or fifteen knots an hour for several weeks i was borne away in this manner until one morning to my inexpressible joy i sighted an island upon the starboard quarter the current would however have carried me past it had i not made shift though singlehanded to set the flyingjib so as to turn her bows and then clapping on the spritsail studdingsail and foresail i clewed up the halliards upon the port side and put the wheel down hard astarboard the wind being at the time northeasthalfeast  at the description of this nautical manoeuvre i observed that smollett grinned and a gentleman who was sitting higher up the table in the uniform of the royal navy and who i guessed to be captain marryat became very uneasy and fidgeted in his seat  by this means i got clear of the current and was able to steer within a quarter of a mile of the beach which indeed i might have approached still nearer by making another tack but being an excellent swimmer i deemed it best to leave the vessel which was almost waterlogged and to make the best of my way to the shore  i had had my doubts hitherto as to whether this newfound country was inhabited or no but as i approached nearer to it being on the summit of a great wave i perceived a number of figures on the beach engaged apparently in watching me and my vessel my joy however was considerably lessened when on reaching the land i found that the figures consisted of a vast concourse of animals of various sorts who were standing about in groups and who hurried down to the waters edge to meet me i had scarce put my foot upon the sand before i was surrounded by an eager crowd of deer dogs wild boars buffaloes and other creatures none of whom showed the least fear either of me or of each other but on the contrary were animated by a common feeling of curiosity as well as it would appear by some degree of disgust  a second edition whispered lawrence sterne to his neighbour gulliver served up cold  did you speak sir asked the dean very sternly having evidently overheard the remark  my words were not addressed to you sir answered sterne looking rather frightened  they were none the less insolent roared the dean your reverence would fain make a sentimental journey of the narrative i doubt not and find pathos in a dead donkeythough faith no man can blame thee for mourning over thy own kith and kin  better that than to wallow in all the filth of yahooland returned sterne warmly and a quarrel would certainly have ensued but for the interposition of the remainder of the company as it was the dean refused indignantly to have any further hand in the story and sterne also stood out of it remarking with a sneer that he was loth to fit a good blade on to a poor handle under these circumstances some further unpleasantness might have occurred had not smollett rapidly taken up the narrative continuing it in the third person instead of the first  our hero being considerably alarmed at this strange reception lost little time in plunging into the sea again and regaining his vessel being convinced that the worst which might befall him from the elements would be as nothing compared to the dangers of this mysterious island it was as well that he took this course for before nightfall his ship was overhauled and he himself picked up by a british manofwar the lightning 74 then returning from the west indies where it had formed part of the fleet under the command of admiral benbow young wells being a likely lad enough wellspoken and highspirited was at once entered on the books as officers servant in which capacity he both gained great popularity on account of the freedom of his manners and found an opportunity for indulging in those practical pleasantries for which he had all his life been famous  among the quartermasters of the lightning there was one named jedediah anchorstock whose appearance was so remarkable that it quickly attracted the attention of our hero he was a man of about fifty dark with exposure to the weather and so tall that as he came along the tween decks he had to bend himself nearly double the most striking peculiarity of this individual was however that in his boyhood some evilminded person had tattooed eyes all over his countenance with such marvellous skill that it was difficult at a short distance to pick out his real ones among so many counterfeits on this strange personage master cyprian determined to exercise his talents for mischief the more so as he learned that he was extremely superstitious and also that he had left behind him in portsmouth a strongminded spouse of whom he stood in mortal terror with this object he secured one of the sheep which were kept on board for the officers table and pouring a can of rumbo down its throat reduced it to a state of utter intoxication he then conveyed it to anchorstocks berth and with the assistance of some other imps as mischievous as himself dressed it up in a high nightcap and gown and covered it over with the bedclothes  when the quartermaster came down from his watch our hero met him at the door of his berth with an agitated face mr anchorstock said he can it be that your wife is on board wife roared the astonished sailor ye whitefaced swab what dye mean if shes not here in the ship it must be her ghost said cyprian shaking his head gloomily in the ship how in thunder could she get into the ship why master i believe as how youre weak in the upper works dye see to as much as think o such a thing my poll is moored head and starn behind the point at portsmouth moren two thousand mile away upon my word said our hero very earnestly i saw a female look out of your cabin not five minutes ago ay ay mr anchorstock joined in several of the conspirators we all saw hera spankinglooking craft with a deadlight mounted on one side sure enough said anchorstock staggered by this accumulation of evidence my pollys starboard eye was doused for ever by long sue williams of the hard but if so be as she be there i must see her be she ghost or quick with which the honest sailor in much perturbation and trembling in every limb began to shuffle forward into the cabin holding the light well in front of him it chanced however that the unhappy sheep which was quietly engaged in sleeping off the effects of its unusual potations was awakened by the noise of his approach and finding herself in such an unusual position sprang out of bed and rushed furiously for the door bleating wildly and rolling about like a brig in a tornado partly from intoxication and partly from the nightdress which impeded her movements as anchorstock saw this extraordinary apparition bearing down upon him he uttered a yell and fell flat upon his face convinced that he had to do with a supernatural visitor the more so as the confederates heightened the effect by a chorus of most ghastly groans and cries the joke had nearly gone beyond what was originally intended for the quartermaster lay as one dead and it was only with the greatest difficulty that he could be brought to his senses to the end of the voyage he stoutly asserted that he had seen the distant mrs anchorstock remarking with many oaths that though he was too woundily scared to take much note of the features there was no mistaking the strong smell of rum which was characteristic of his better half  it chanced shortly after this to be the kings birthday an event which was signalised aboard the lightning by the death of the commander under singular circumstances this officer who was a real fairweather jack hardly knowing the ships keel from her ensign had obtained his position through parliamentary interest and used it with such tyranny and cruelty that he was universally execrated so unpopular was he that when a plot was entered into by the whole crew to punish his misdeeds with death he had not a single friend among six hundred souls to warn him of his danger it was the custom on board the kings ships that upon his birthday the entire ships company should be drawn up upon deck and that at a signal they should discharge their muskets into the air in honour of his majesty on this occasion word had been secretly passed round for every man to slip a slug into his firelock instead of the blank cartridge provided on the boatswain blowing his whistle the men mustered upon deck and formed line whilst the captain standing well in front of them delivered a few words to them when i give the word he concluded you shall discharge your pieces and by thunder if any man is a second before or a second after his fellows i shall trice him up to the weather rigging with these words he roared fire on which every man levelled his musket straight at his head and pulled the trigger so accurate was the aim and so short the distance that more than five hundred bullets struck him simultaneously blowing away his head and a large portion of his body there were so many concerned in this matter and it was so hopeless to trace it to any individual that the officers were unable to punish any one for the affairthe more readily as the captains haughty ways and heartless conduct had made him quite as hateful to them as to the men whom he commanded  by his pleasantries and the natural charm of his manners our hero so far won the good wishes of the ships company that they parted with infinite regret upon their arrival in england filial duty however urged him to return home and report himself to his father with which object he posted from portsmouth to london intending to proceed thence to shropshire as it chanced however one of the horses sprained his off foreleg while passing through chichester and as no change could be obtained cyprian found himself compelled to put up at the crown and bull for the night  ods bodikins continued smollett laughing i never could pass a comfortable hostel without stopping and so with your permission ill een stop here and whoever wills may lead friend cyprian to his further adventures do you sir walter give us a touch of the wizard of the north  with these words smollett produced a pipe and filling it at defoes tobaccopot waited patiently for the continuation of the story  if i must i must remarked the illustrious scotchman taking a pinch of snuff but i must beg leave to put mr wells back a few hundred years for of all things i love the true mediæval smack to proceed then  our hero being anxious to continue his journey and learning that it would be some time before any conveyance would be ready determined to push on alone mounted on his gallant grey steed travelling was particularly dangerous at that time for besides the usual perils which beset wayfarers the southern parts of england were in a lawless and disturbed state which bordered on insurrection the young man however having loosened his sword in his sheath so as to be ready for every eventuality galloped cheerily upon his way guiding himself to the best of his ability by the light of the rising moon  he had not gone far before he realised that the cautions which had been impressed upon him by the landlord and which he had been inclined to look upon as selfinterested advice were only too well justified at a spot where the road was particularly rough and ran across some marsh land he perceived a short distance from him a dark shadow which his practised eye detected at once as a body of crouching men reining up his horse within a few yards of the ambuscade he wrapped his cloak round his bridlearm and summoned the party to stand forth  what ho my masters he cried are beds so scarce then that ye must hamper the high road of the king with your bodies now by st ursula of alpuxerra there be those who might think that birds who fly o nights were after higher game than the moorhen or the woodcock  blades and targets comrades exclaimed a tall powerful man springing into the centre of the road with several companions and standing in front of the frightened horse who is this swashbuckler who summons his majestys lieges from their repose a very soldado o truth hark ye sir or my lord or thy grace or whatsoever title your honours honour may be pleased to approve thou must curb thy tongue play or by the seven witches of gambleside thou may find thyself in but a sorry plight  i prythee then that thou wilt expound to me who and what ye are quoth our hero and whether your purpose be such as an honest man may approve of as to your threats they turn from my mind as your caitiffly weapons would shiver upon my hauberk from milan  nay allen interrupted one of the party addressing him who seemed to be their leader this is a lad of mettle and such a one as our honest jack longs for but we lure not hawks with empty hands look ye sir there is game afoot which it may need such bold hunters as thyself to follow come with us and take a firkin of canary and we will find better work for that glaive of thine than getting its owner into broil and bloodshed for by my troth milan or no milan if my curtel axe do but ring against that morion of thine it will be an ill day for thy fathers son  for a moment our hero hesitated as to whether it would best become his knightly traditions to hurl himself against his enemies or whether it might not be better to obey their requests prudence mingled with a large share of curiosity eventually carried the day and dismounting from his horse he intimated that he was ready to follow his captors  spoken like a man cried he whom they addressed as allen jack cade will be right glad of such a recruit blood and carrion but thou hast the thews of a young ox and i swear by the haft of my sword that it might have gone ill with some of us hadst thou not listened to reason  nay not so good allennot so squeaked a very small man who had remained in the background while there was any prospect of a fray but who now came pushing to the front hadst thou been alone it might indeed have been so perchance but an expert swordsman can disarm at pleasure such a one as this young knight well i remember in the palatinate how i clove to the chine even such anotherthe baron von slogstaff he struck at me look ye so but i with buckler and blade did as one might say deflect it and then countering in carte i returned in tierce and sost agnes save us who comes here  the apparition which frightened the loquacious little man was sufficiently strange to cause a qualm even in the bosom of the knight through the darkness there loomed a figure which appeared to be of gigantic size and a hoarse voice issuing apparently some distance above the heads of the party broke roughly on the silence of the night  now out upon thee thomas allen and foul be thy fate if thou hast abandoned thy post without good and sufficient cause by st anselm of the holy grove thou hadst best have never been born than rouse my spleen this night wherefore is it that you and your men are trailing over the moor like a flock of geese when michaelmas is near  good captain said allen doffing his bonnet an example followed by others of the band we have captured a goodly youth who was pricking it along the london road methought that some word of thanks were meet reward for such service rather than taunt or threat  nay take it not to heart bold allen exclaimed their leader who was none other than the great jack cade himself thou knowest of old that my temper is somewhat choleric and my tongue not greased with that unguent which oils the mouths of the lipserving lords of the land and you he continued turning suddenly upon our hero are you ready to join the great cause which will make england what it was when the learned alfred reigned in the land zounds man speak out and pick not your phrases  i am ready to do aught which may become a knight and a gentleman said the soldier stoutly  taxes shall be swept away cried cade excitedlythe impost and the anpostthe tithe and the hundredtax the poor mans saltbox and flourbin shall be as free as the noblemans cellar ha what sayest thou  it is but just said our hero  ay but they give us such justice as the falcon gives the leveret roared the orator down with them i saydown with every man of them noble and judge priest and king down with them all  nay said sir overbeck wells drawing himself up to his full height and laying his hand upon the hilt of his sword there i cannot follow thee but must rather defy thee as traitor and faineant seeing that thou art no true man but one who would usurp the rights of our master the king whom may the virgin protect  at these bold words and the defiance which they conveyed the rebels seemed for a moment utterly bewildered but encouraged by the hoarse shout of their leader they brandished their weapons and prepared to fall upon the knight who placed himself in a posture for defence and awaited their attack  there now cried sir walter rubbing his hands and chuckling ive put the chiel in a pretty warm corner and well see which of you moderns can take him oot ot neer a word more will ye get frae me to help him one way or the other  you try your hand james cried several voices and the author in question had got so far as to make an allusion to a solitary horseman who was approaching when he was interrupted by a tall gentleman a little farther down with a slight stutter and a very nervous manner  excuse me he said but i fancy that i may be able to do something here some of my humble productions have been said to excel sir walter at his best and i was undoubtedly stronger all round i could picture modern society as well as ancient and as to my plays why shakespeare never came near the lady of lyons for popularity there is this little thing here he rummaged among a great pile of papers in front of him ah thats a report of mine when i was in india here it is no this is one of my speeches in the house and this is my criticism on tennyson didnt i warm him up i cant find what i wanted but of course you have read them allrienzi and harold and the last of the barons every schoolboy knows them by heart as poor macaulay would have said allow me to give you a sample  in spite of the gallant knights valiant resistance the combat was too unequal to be sustained his sword was broken by a slash from a brown bill and he was borne to the ground he expected immediate death but such did not seem to be the intention of the ruffians who had captured him he was placed upon the back of his own charger and borne bound hand and foot over the trackless moor in the fastnesses of which the rebels secreted themselves  in the depths of these wilds there stood a stone building which had once been a farmhouse but having been for some reason abandoned had fallen into ruin and had now become the headquarters of cade and his men a large cowhouse near the farm had been utilised as sleeping quarters and some rough attempts had been made to shield the principal room of the main building from the weather by stopping up the gaping apertures in the walls in this apartment was spread out a rough meal for the returning rebels and our hero was thrown still bound into an empty outhouse there to await his fate  sir walter had been listening with the greatest impatience to bulwer lyttons narrative but when it had reached this point he broke in impatiently  we want a touch of your own style man he said the animalmagneticoelectrohystericalbiologicalmysterious sort of story is all your own but at present you are just a poor copy of myself and nothing more  there was a murmur of assent from the company and defoe remarked truly master lytton there is a plaguey resemblance in the style which may indeed be but a chance and yet methinks it is sufficiently marked to warrant such words as our friend hath used  perhaps you will think that this is an imitation also said lytton bitterly and leaning back in his chair with a morose countenance he continued the narrative in this way  our unfortunate hero had hardly stretched himself upon the straw with which his dungeon was littered when a secret door opened in the wall and a venerable old man swept majestically into the apartment the prisoner gazed upon him with astonishment not unmixed with awe for on his broad brow was printed the seal of much knowledgesuch knowledge as it is not granted to a son of man to know he was clad in a long white robe crossed and chequered with mystic devices in the arabic character while a high scarlet tiara marked with the square and circle enhanced his venerable appearance my son he said turning his piercing and yet dreamy gaze upon sir overbeck all things lead to nothing and nothing is the foundation of all things cosmos is impenetrable why then should we exist  astounded at this weighty query and at the philosophic demeanour of his visitor our hero made shift to bid him welcome and to demand his name and quality as the old man answered him his voice rose and fell in musical cadences like the sighing of the east wind while an ethereal and aromatic vapour pervaded the apartment  i am the eternal nonego he answered i am the concentrated negativethe everlasting essence of nothing you see in me that which existed before the beginning of matter many years before the commencement of time i am the algebraic x which represents the infinite divisibility of a finite particle  sir overbeck felt a shudder as though an icecold hand had been placed upon his brow what is your message he whispered falling prostrate before his mysterious visitor  to tell you that the eternities beget chaos and that the immensities are at the mercy of the divine ananke infinitude crouches before a personality the mercurial essence is the prime mover in spirituality and the thinker is powerless before the pulsating inanity the cosmical procession is terminated only by the unknowable and unpronounceable  may i ask mr smollett what you find to laugh at  gadzooks master cried smollett who had been sniggering for some time back it seems to me that there is little danger of any one venturing to dispute that style with you  its all your own murmured sir walter  and very pretty too quoth lawrence sterne with a malignant grin pray sir what language do you call it  lytton was so enraged at these remarks and at the favour with which they appeared to be received that he endeavoured to stutter out some reply and then losing control of himself completely picked up all his loose papers and strode out of the room dropping pamphlets and speeches at every step this incident amused the company so much that they laughed for several minutes without cessation gradually the sound of their laughter sounded more and more harshly in my ears the lights on the table grew dim and the company more misty until they and their symposium vanished away altogether i was sitting before the embers of what had been a roaring fire but was now little more than a heap of grey ashes and the merry laughter of the august company had changed to the recriminations of my wife who was shaking me violently by the shoulder and exhorting me to choose some more seasonable spot for my slumbers so ended the wondrous adventures of master cyprian overbeck wells but i still live in the hopes that in some future dream the great masters may themselves finish that which they have begun     vi  playing with fire   i cannot pretend to say what occurred on the 14th of april last at no 17 badderly gardens put down in black and white my surmise might seem too crude too grotesque for serious consideration and yet that something did occur and that it was of a nature which will leave its mark upon every one of us for the rest of our lives is as certain as the unanimous testimony of five witnesses can make it i will not enter into any argument or speculation i will only give a plain statement which will be submitted to john moir harvey deacon and mrs delamere and withheld from publication unless they are prepared to corroborate every detail i cannot obtain the sanction of paul le duc for he appears to have left the country  it was john moir the wellknown senior partner of moir moir and sanderson who had originally turned our attention to occult subjects he had like many very hard and practical men of business a mystic side to his nature which had led him to the examination and eventually to the acceptance of those elusive phenomena which are grouped together with much that is foolish and much that is fraudulent under the common heading of spiritualism his researches which had begun with an open mind ended unhappily in dogma and he became as positive and fanatical as any other bigot he represented in our little group the body of men who have turned these singular phenomena into a new religion  mrs delamere our medium was his sister the wife of delamere the rising sculptor our experience had shown us that to work on these subjects without a medium was as futile as for an astronomer to make observations without a telescope on the other hand the introduction of a paid medium was hateful to all of us was it not obvious that he or she would feel bound to return some result for money received and that the temptation to fraud would be an overpowering one no phenomena could be relied upon which were produced at a guinea an hour but fortunately moir had discovered that his sister was mediumisticin other words that she was a battery of that animal magnetic force which is the only form of energy which is subtle enough to be acted upon from the spiritual plane as well as from our own material one of course when i say this i do not mean to beg the question but i am simply indicating the theories upon which we were ourselves rightly or wrongly explaining what we saw the lady came not altogether with the approval of her husband and though she never gave indications of any very great psychic force we were able at least to obtain those usual phenomena of messagetilting which are at the same time so puerile and so inexplicable every sunday evening we met in harvey deacons studio at badderly gardens the next house to the corner of merton park road  harvey deacons imaginative work in art would prepare any one to find that he was an ardent lover of everything which was outré and sensational a certain picturesqueness in the study of the occult had been the quality which had originally attracted him to it but his attention was speedily arrested by some of those phenomena to which i have referred and he was coming rapidly to the conclusion that what he had looked upon as an amusing romance and an afterdinner entertainment was really a very formidable reality he is a man with a remarkably clear and logical braina true descendant of his ancestor the wellknown scotch professorand he represented in our small circle the critical element the man who has no prejudices is prepared to follow facts as far as he can see them and refuses to theorise in advance of his data his caution annoyed moir as much as the latters robust faith amused deacon but each in his own way was equally keen upon the matter  and i what am i to say that i represented i was not the devotee i was not the scientific critic perhaps the best that i can claim for myself is that i was the dilettante man about town anxious to be in the swim of every fresh movement thankful for any new sensation which would take me out of myself and open up fresh possibilities of existence i am not an enthusiast myself but i like the company of those who are moirs talk which made me feel as if we had a private passkey through the door of death filled me with a vague contentment the soothing atmosphere of the séance with the darkened lights was delightful to me in a word the thing amused me and so i was there  it was as i have said upon the 14th of april last that the very singular event which i am about to put upon record took place i was the first of the men to arrive at the studio but mrs delamere was already there having had afternoon tea with mrs harvey deacon the two ladies and deacon himself were standing in front of an unfinished picture of his upon the easel i am not an expert in art and i have never professed to understand what harvey deacon meant by his pictures but i could see in this instance that it was all very clever and imaginative fairies and animals and allegorical figures of all sorts the ladies were loud in their praises and indeed the colour effect was a remarkable one  what do you think of it markham he asked  well its above me said i these beastswhat are they  mythical monsters imaginary creatures heraldic emblemsa sort of weird bizarre procession of them  with a white horse in front  its not a horse said he rather testilywhich was surprising for he was a very goodhumoured fellow as a rule and hardly ever took himself seriously  what is it then  cant you see the horn in front its a unicorn i told you they were heraldic beasts cant you recognise one  very sorry deacon said i for he really seemed to be annoyed  he laughed at his own irritation  excuse me markham said he the fact is that i have had an awful job over the beast all day i have been painting him in and painting him out and trying to imagine what a real live ramping unicorn would look like at last i got him as i hoped so when you failed to recognise it it took me on the raw  why of course its a unicorn said i for he was evidently depressed at my obtuseness i can see the horn quite plainly but i never saw a unicorn except beside the royal arms and so i never thought of the creature and these others are griffins and cockatrices and dragons of sorts  yes i had no difficulty with them it was the unicorn which bothered me however theres an end of it until tomorrow he turned the picture round upon the easel and we all chatted about other subjects  moir was late that evening and when he did arrive he brought with him rather to our surprise a small stout frenchman whom he introduced as monsieur paul le duc i say to our surprise for we held a theory that any intrusion into our spiritual circle deranged the conditions and introduced an element of suspicion we knew that we could trust each other but all our results were vitiated by the presence of an outsider however moir soon reconciled us to the innovation monsieur paul le duc was a famous student of occultism a seer a medium and a mystic he was travelling in england with a letter of introduction to moir from the president of the parisian brothers of the rosy cross what more natural than that he should bring him to our little séance or that we should feel honoured by his presence  he was as i have said a small stout man undistinguished in appearance with a broad smooth cleanshaven face remarkable only for a pair of large brown velvety eyes staring vaguely out in front of him he was well dressed with the manners of a gentleman and his curious little turns of english speech set the ladies smiling mrs deacon had a prejudice against our researches and left the room upon which we lowered the lights as was our custom and drew up our chairs to the square mahogany table which stood in the centre of the studio the light was subdued but sufficient to allow us to see each other quite plainly i remember that i could even observe the curious podgy little squaretopped hands which the frenchman laid upon the table  what a fun said he it is many years since i have sat in this fashion and it is to me amusing madame is medium does madame make the trance  well hardly that said mrs delamere but i am always conscious of extreme sleepiness  it is the first stage then you encourage it and there comes the trance when the trance comes then out jumps your little spirit and in jumps another little spirit and so you have direct talking or writing you leave your machine to be worked by another hein but what have unicorns to do with it  harvey deacon started in his chair the frenchman was moving his head slowly round and staring into the shadows which draped the walls  what a fun said he always unicorns who has been thinking so hard upon a subject so bizarre  this is wonderful cried deacon i have been trying to paint one all day but how could you know it  you have been thinking of them in this room  certainly  but thoughts are things my friend when you imagine a thing you make a thing you did not know it hein but i can see your unicorns because it is not only with my eye that i can see  do you mean to say that i create a thing which has never existed by merely thinking of it  but certainly it is the fact which lies under all other facts that is why an evil thought is also a danger  they are i suppose upon the astral plane said moir  ah well these are but words my friends they are theresomewhereeverywherei cannot tell myself i see them i could touch them  you could not make us see them  it is to materialise them hold it is an experiment but the power is wanting let us see what power we have and then arrange what we shall do may i place you as i wish  you evidently know a great deal more about it than we do said harvey deacon i wish that you would take complete control  it may be that the conditions are not good but we will try what we can do madame will sit where she is i next and this gentleman beside me meester moir will sit next to madame because it is well to have blacks and blondes in turn so and now with your permission i will turn the lights all out  what is the advantage of the dark i asked  because the force with which we deal is a vibration of ether and so also is light we have the wires all for ourselves nowhein you will not be frightened in the darkness madame what a fun is such a séance  at first the darkness appeared to be absolutely pitchy but in a few minutes our eyes became so far accustomed to it that we could just make out each others presencevery dimly and vaguely it is true i could see nothing else in the roomonly the black loom of the motionless figures we were all taking the matter much more seriously than we had ever done before  you will place your hands in front it is hopeless that we touch since we are so few round so large a table you will compose yourself madame and if sleep should come to you you will not fight against it and now we sit in silence and we expecthein  so we sat in silence and expected staring out into the blackness in front of us a clock ticked in the passage a dog barked intermittently far away once or twice a cab rattled past in the street and the gleam of its lamps through the chink in the curtains was a cheerful break in that gloomy vigil i felt those physical symptoms with which previous séances had made me familiarthe coldness of the feet the tingling in the hands the glow of the palms the feeling of a cold wind upon the back strange little shooting pains came in my forearms especially as it seemed to me in my left one which was nearest to our visitordue no doubt to disturbance of the vascular system but worthy of some attention all the same at the same time i was conscious of a strained feeling of expectancy which was almost painful from the rigid absolute silence of my companions i gathered that their nerves were as tense as my own  and then suddenly a sound came out of the darknessa low sibilant sound the quick thin breathing of a woman quicker and thinner yet it came as between clenched teeth to end in a loud gasp with a dull rustle of cloth  whats that is all right some one asked in the darkness  yes all is right said the frenchman it is madame she is in her trance now gentlemen if you will wait quiet you will see something i think which will interest you much  still the ticking in the hall still the breathing deeper and fuller now from the medium still the occasional flash more welcome than ever of the passing lights of the hansoms what a gap we were bridging the halfraised veil of the eternal on the one side and the cabs of london on the other the table was throbbing with a mighty pulse it swayed steadily rhythmically with an easy swooping scooping motion under our fingers sharp little raps and cracks came from its substance filefiring volleyfiring the sounds of a fagot burning briskly on a frosty night  there is much power said the frenchman see it on the table  i had thought it was some delusion of my own but all could see it now there was a greenishyellow phosphorescent lightor i should say a luminous vapour rather than a lightwhich lay over the surface of the table it rolled and wreathed and undulated in dim glimmering folds turning and swirling like clouds of smoke i could see the white squareended hands of the french medium in this baleful light  what a fun he cried it is splendid  shall we call the alphabet asked moir  but nofor we can do much better said our visitor it is but a clumsy thing to tilt the table for every letter of the alphabet and with such a medium as madame we should do better than that  yes you will do better said a voice  who was that who spoke was that you markham  no i did not speak  it was madame who spoke  but it was not her voice  is that you mrs delamere  it is not the medium but it is the power which uses the organs of the medium said the strange deep voice  where is mrs delamere it will not hurt her i trust  the medium is happy in another plane of existence she has taken my place as i have taken hers  who are you  it cannot matter to you who i am i am one who has lived as you are living and who has died as you will die  we heard the creak and grate of a cab pulling up next door there was an argument about the fare and the cabman grumbled hoarsely down the street the greenyellow cloud still swirled faintly over the table dull elsewhere but glowing into a dim luminosity in the direction of the medium it seemed to be piling itself up in front of her a sense of fear and cold struck into my heart it seemed to me that lightly and flippantly we had approached the most real and august of sacraments that communion with the dead of which the fathers of the church had spoken  dont you think we are going too far should we not break up this séance i cried  but the others were all earnest to see the end of it they laughed at my scruples  all the powers are made for use said harvey deacon if we can do this we should do this every new departure of knowledge has been called unlawful in its inception it is right and proper that we should inquire into the nature of death  it is right and proper said the voice  there what more could you ask cried moir who was much excited let us have a test will you give us a test that you are really there  what test do you demand  well nowi have some coins in my pocket will you tell me how many  we come back in the hope of teaching and of elevating and not to guess childish riddles  ha ha meester moir you catch it that time cried the frenchman but surely this is very good sense what the control is saying  it is a religion not a game said the cold hard voice  exactlythe very view i take of it cried moir i am sure i am very sorry if i have asked a foolish question you will not tell me who you are  what does it matter  have you been a spirit long  yes  how long  we cannot reckon time as you do our conditions are different  are you happy  yes  you would not wish to come back to life  nocertainly not  are you busy  we could not be happy if we were not busy  what do you do  i have said that the conditions are entirely different  can you give us no idea of your work  we labour for our own improvement and for the advancement of others  do you like coming here tonight  i am glad to come if i can do any good by coming  then to do good is your object  it is the object of all life on every plane  you see markham that should answer your scruples  it did for my doubts had passed and only interest remained  have you pain in your life i asked  no pain is a thing of the body  have you mental pain  yes one may always be sad or anxious  do you meet the friends whom you have known on earth  some of them  why only some of them  only those who are sympathetic  do husbands meet wives  those who have truly loved  and the others  they are nothing to each other  there must be a spiritual connection  of course  is what we are doing right  if done in the right spirit  what is the wrong spirit  curiosity and levity  may harm come of that  very serious harm  what sort of harm  you may call up forces over which you have no control  evil forces  undeveloped forces  you say they are dangerous dangerous to body or mind  sometimes to both  there was a pause and the blackness seemed to grow blacker still while the yellowgreen fog swirled and smoked upon the table  any questions you would like to ask moir said harvey deacon  only thisdo you pray in your world  one should pray in every world  why  because it is the acknowledgment of forces outside ourselves  what religion do you hold over there  we differ exactly as you do  you have no certain knowledge  we have only faith  these questions of religion said the frenchman they are of interest to you serious english people but they are not so much fun it seems to me that with this power here we might be able to have some great experiencehein something of which we could talk  but nothing could be more interesting than this said moir  well if you think so that is very well the frenchman answered peevishly for my part it seems to me that i have heard all this before and that tonight i should weesh to try some experiment with all this force which is given to us but if you have other questions then ask them and when you are finish we can try something more  but the spell was broken we asked and asked but the medium sat silent in her chair only her deep regular breathing showed that she was there the mist still whirled upon the table  you have disturbed the harmony she will not answer  but we have learned already all that she can tellhein for my part i wish to see something i have never seen before  what then  you will let me try  what would you do  i have said to you that thoughts are things now i wish to prove it to you and to show you that which is only a thought yes yes i can do it and you will see now i ask you only to sit still and say nothing and keep ever your hands quiet upon the table  the room was blacker and more silent than ever the same feeling of apprehension which had lain heavily upon me at the beginning of the séance was back at my heart once more the roots of my hair were tingling  it is working it is working cried the frenchman and there was a crack in his voice as he spoke which told me that he also was strung to his tightest  the luminous fog drifted slowly off the table and wavered and flickered across the room there in the farther and darkest corner it gathered and glowed hardening down into a shining corea strange shifty luminous and yet nonilluminating patch of radiance bright itself but throwing no rays into the darkness it had changed from a greenishyellow to a dusky sullen red then round this centre there coiled a dark smoky substance thickening hardening growing denser and blacker and then the light went out smothered in that which had grown round it  it has gone  hushtheres something in the room  we heard it in the corner where the light had been something which breathed deeply and fidgeted in the darkness  what is it le duc what have you done  it is all right no harm will come the frenchmans voice was treble with agitation  good heavens moir theres a large animal in the room here it is close by my chair go away go away  it was harvey deacons voice and then came the sound of a blow upon some hard object and then  and then  how can i tell you what happened then  some huge thing hurtled against us in the darkness rearing stamping smashing springing snorting the table was splintered we were scattered in every direction it clattered and scrambled amongst us rushing with horrible energy from one corner of the room to another we were all screaming with fear grovelling upon our hands and knees to get away from it something trod upon my left hand and i felt the bones splinter under the weight  a light a light some one yelled  moir you have matches matches  no i have none deacon where are the matches for gods sake the matches  i cant find them here you frenchman stop it  it is beyond me oh mon dieu i cannot stop it the door where is the door  my hand by good luck lit upon the handle as i groped about in the darkness the hardbreathing snorting rushing creature tore past me and butted with a fearful crash against the oaken partition the instant that it had passed i turned the handle and next moment we were all outside and the door shut behind us from within came a horrible crashing and rending and stamping  what is it in heavens name what is it  a horse i saw it when the door opened but mrs delamere  we must fetch her out come on markham the longer we wait the less we shall like it  he flung open the door and we rushed in she was there on the ground amidst the splinters of her chair we seized her and dragged her swiftly out and as we gained the door i looked over my shoulder into the darkness there were two strange eyes glowing at us a rattle of hoofs and i had just time to slam the door when there came a crash upon it which split it from top to bottom  its coming through its coming  run run for your lives cried the frenchman  another crash and something shot through the riven door it was a long white spike gleaming in the lamplight for a moment it shone before us and then with a snap it disappeared again  quick quick this way harvey deacon shouted carry her in here quick  we had taken refuge in the diningroom and shut the heavy oak door we laid the senseless woman upon the sofa and as we did so moir the hard man of business drooped and fainted across the hearthrug harvey deacon was as white as a corpse jerking and twitching like an epileptic with a crash we heard the studio door fly to pieces and the snorting and stamping were in the passage up and down shaking the house with their fury the frenchman had sunk his face on his hands and sobbed like a frightened child  what shall we do i shook him roughly by the shoulder is a gun any use  no no the power will pass then it will end  you might have killed us allyou unspeakable foolwith your infernal experiments  i did not know how could i tell that it would be frightened it is mad with terror it was his fault he struck it  harvey deacon sprang up good heavens he cried  a terrible scream sounded through the house  its my wife here im going out if its the evil one himself i am going out  he had thrown open the door and rushed out into the passage at the end of it at the foot of the stairs mrs deacon was lying senseless struck down by the sight which she had seen but there was nothing else  with eyes of horror we looked about us but all was perfectly quiet and still i approached the black square of the studio door expecting with every slow step that some atrocious shape would hurl itself out of it but nothing came and all was silent inside the room peeping and peering our hearts in our mouths we came to the very threshold and stared into the darkness there was still no sound but in one direction there was also no darkness a luminous glowing cloud with an incandescent centre hovered in the corner of the room slowly it dimmed and faded growing thinner and fainter until at last the same dense velvety blackness filled the whole studio and with the last flickering gleam of that baleful light the frenchman broke into a shout of joy  what a fun he cried no one is hurt and only the door broken and the ladies frightened but my friends we have done what has never been done before  and as far as i can help said harvey deacon it will certainly never be done again  and that was what befell on the 14th of april last at no 17 badderly gardens i began by saying that it would seem too grotesque to dogmatise as to what it was which actually did occur but i give my impressions our impressions since they are corroborated by harvey deacon and john moir for what they are worth you may if it pleases you imagine that we were the victims of an elaborate and extraordinary hoax or you may think with us that we underwent a very real and a very terrible experience or perhaps you may know more than we do of such occult matters and can inform us of some similar occurrence in this latter case a letter to william markham 146m the albany would help to throw a light upon that which is very dark to us     vii  the ring of thoth   mr john vansittart smith frs of 147a gower street was a man whose energy of purpose and clearness of thought might have placed him in the very first rank of scientific observers he was the victim however of a universal ambition which prompted him to aim at distinction in many subjects rather than preeminence in one in his early days he had shown an aptitude for zoology and for botany which caused his friends to look upon him as a second darwin but when a professorship was almost within his reach he had suddenly discontinued his studies and turned his whole attention to chemistry here his researches upon the spectra of the metals had won him his fellowship in the royal society but again he played the coquette with his subject and after a years absence from the laboratory he joined the oriental society and delivered a paper on the hieroglyphic and demotic inscriptions of el kab thus giving a crowning example both of the versatility and of the inconstancy of his talents  the most fickle of wooers however is apt to be caught at last and so it was with john vansittart smith the more he burrowed his way into egyptology the more impressed he became by the vast field which it opened to the inquirer and by the extreme importance of a subject which promised to throw a light upon the first germs of human civilisation and the origin of the greater part of our arts and sciences so struck was mr smith that he straightway married an egyptological young lady who had written upon the sixth dynasty and having thus secured a sound base of operations he set himself to collect materials for a work which should unite the research of lepsius and the ingenuity of champollion the preparation of this magnum opus entailed many hurried visits to the magnificent egyptian collections of the louvre upon the last of which no longer ago than the middle of last october he became involved in a most strange and noteworthy adventure  the trains had been slow and the channel had been rough so that the student arrived in paris in a somewhat befogged and feverish condition on reaching the hôtel de france in the rue laffitte he had thrown himself upon a sofa for a couple of hours but finding that he was unable to sleep he determined in spite of his fatigue to make his way to the louvre settle the point which he had come to decide and take the evening train back to dieppe having come to this conclusion he donned his greatcoat for it was a raw rainy day and made his way across the boulevard des italiens and down the avenue de lopéra once in the louvre he was on familiar ground and he speedily made his way to the collection of papyri which it was his intention to consult  the warmest admirers of john vansittart smith could hardly claim for him that he was a handsome man his highbeaked nose and prominent chin had something of the same acute and incisive character which distinguished his intellect he held his head in a birdlike fashion and birdlike too was the pecking motion with which in conversation he threw out his objections and retorts as he stood with the high collar of his greatcoat raised to his ears he might have seen from the reflection in the glasscase before him that his appearance was a singular one yet it came upon him as a sudden jar when an english voice behind him exclaimed in very audible tones what a queerlooking mortal  the student had a large amount of petty vanity in his composition which manifested itself by an ostentatious and overdone disregard of all personal considerations he straightened his lips and looked rigidly at the roll of papyrus while his heart filled with bitterness against the whole race of travelling britons  yes said another voice he really is an extraordinary fellow  do you know said the first speaker one could almost believe that by the continual contemplation of mummies the chap has become half a mummy himself  he has certainly an egyptian cast of countenance said the other  john vansittart smith spun round upon his heel with the intention of shaming his countrymen by a corrosive remark or two to his surprise and relief the two young fellows who had been conversing had their shoulders turned towards him and were gazing at one of the louvre attendants who was polishing some brasswork at the other side of the room  carter will be waiting for us at the palais royal said one tourist to the other glancing at his watch and they clattered away leaving the student to his labours  i wonder what these chatterers call an egyptian cast of countenance thought john vansittart smith and he moved his position slightly in order to catch a glimpse of the mans face he started as his eyes fell upon it it was indeed the very face with which his studies had made him familiar the regular statuesque features broad brow wellrounded chin and dusky complexion were the exact counterpart of the innumerable statues mummycases and pictures which adorned the walls of the apartment the thing was beyond all coincidence the man must be an egyptian the national angularity of the shoulders and narrowness of the hips were alone sufficient to identify him  john vansittart smith shuffled towards the attendant with some intention of addressing him he was not light of touch in conversation and found it difficult to strike the happy mean between the brusqueness of the superior and the geniality of the equal as he came nearer the man presented his side face to him but kept his gaze still bent upon his work vansittart smith fixing his eyes upon the fellows skin was conscious of a sudden impression that there was something inhuman and preternatural about its appearance over the temple and cheekbone it was as glazed and as shiny as varnished parchment there was no suggestion of pores one could not fancy a drop of moisture upon that arid surface from brow to chin however it was crosshatched by a million delicate wrinkles which shot and interlaced as though nature in some maori mood had tried how wild and intricate a pattern she could devise  où est la collection de memphis asked the student with the awkward air of a man who is devising a question merely for the purpose of opening a conversation  cest là replied the man brusquely nodding his head at the other side of the room  vous êtes un egyptien nestce pas asked the englishman  the attendant looked up and turned his strange dark eyes upon his questioner they were vitreous with a misty dry shininess such as smith had never seen in a human head before as he gazed into them he saw some strong emotion gather in their depths which rose and deepened until it broke into a look of something akin both to horror and to hatred  non monsieur je suis français the man turned abruptly and bent low over his polishing the student gazed at him for a moment in astonishment and then turning to a chair in a retired corner behind one of the doors he proceeded to make notes of his researches among the papyri his thoughts however refused to return into their natural groove they would run upon the enigmatical attendant with the sphinxlike face and the parchment skin  where have i seen such eyes said vansittart smith to himself there is something saurian about them something reptilian theres the membrana nictitans of the snakes he mused bethinking himself of his zoological studies it gives a shiny effect but there was something more here there was a sense of power of wisdomso i read themand of weariness utter weariness and ineffable despair it may be all imagination but i never had so strong an impression by jove i must have another look at them he rose and paced round the egyptian rooms but the man who had excited his curiosity had disappeared  the student sat down again in his quiet corner and continued to work at his notes he had gained the information which he required from the papyri and it only remained to write it down while it was still fresh in his memory for a time his pencil travelled rapidly over the paper but soon the lines became less level the words more blurred and finally the pencil tinkled down upon the floor and the head of the student dropped heavily forward upon his chest tired out by his journey he slept so soundly in his lonely post behind the door that neither the clanking civil guard nor the footsteps of sightseers nor even the loud hoarse bell which gives the signal for closing were sufficient to arouse him  twilight deepened into darkness the bustle from the rue de rivoli waxed and then waned distant notre dame clanged out the hour of midnight and still the dark and lonely figure sat silently in the shadow it was not until close upon one in the morning that with a sudden gasp and an intaking of the breath vansittart smith returned to consciousness for a moment it flashed upon him that he had dropped asleep in his studychair at home the moon was shining fitfully through the unshuttered window however and as his eye ran along the lines of mummies and the endless array of polished cases he remembered clearly where he was and how he came there the student was not a nervous man he possessed that love of a novel situation which is peculiar to his race stretching out his cramped limbs he looked at his watch and burst into a chuckle as he observed the hour the episode would make an admirable anecdote to be introduced into his next paper as a relief to the graver and heavier speculations he was a little cold but wide awake and much refreshed it was no wonder that the guardians had overlooked him for the door threw its heavy black shadow right across him  the complete silence was impressive neither outside nor inside was there a creak or a murmur he was alone with the dead men of a dead civilisation what though the outer city reeked of the garish nineteenth century in all this chamber there was scarce an article from the shrivelled ear of wheat to the pigmentbox of the painter which had not held its own against four thousand years here was the flotsam and jetsam washed up by the great ocean of time from that faroff empire from stately thebes from lordly luxor from the great temples of heliopolis from a hundred rifled tombs these relics had been brought the student glanced round at the long silent figures who flickered vaguely up through the gloom at the busy toilers who were now so restful and he fell into a reverent and thoughtful mood an unwonted sense of his own youth and insignificance came over him leaning back in his chair he gazed dreamily down the long vista of rooms all silvery with the moonshine which extend through the whole wing of the widespread building his eyes fell upon the yellow glare of a distant lamp  john vansittart smith sat up on his chair with his nerves all on edge the light was advancing slowly towards him pausing from time to time and then coming jerkily onwards the bearer moved noiselessly in the utter silence there was no suspicion of the pat of a footfall an idea of robbers entered the englishmans head he snuggled up further into the corner the light was two rooms off now it was in the next chamber and still there was no sound with something approaching to a thrill of fear the student observed a face floating in the air as it were behind the flare of the lamp the figure was wrapped in shadow but the light fell full upon the strange eager face there was no mistaking the metallic glistening eyes and the cadaverous skin it was the attendant with whom he had conversed  vansittart smiths first impulse was to come forward and address him a few words of explanation would set the matter clear and lead doubtless to his being conducted to some side door from which he might make his way to his hotel as the man entered the chamber however there was something so stealthy in his movements and so furtive in his expression that the englishman altered his intention this was clearly no ordinary official walking the rounds the fellow wore feltsoled slippers stepped with a rising chest and glanced quickly from left to right while his hurried gasping breathing thrilled the flame of his lamp vansittart smith crouched silently back into the corner and watched him keenly convinced that his errand was one of secret and probably sinister import  there was no hesitation in the others movements he stepped lightly and swiftly across to one of the great cases and drawing a key from his pocket he unlocked it from the upper shelf he pulled down a mummy which he bore away with him and laid it with much care and solicitude upon the ground by it he placed his lamp and then squatting down beside it in eastern fashion he began with long quivering fingers to undo the cerecloths and bandages which girt it round as the crackling rolls of linen peeled off one after the other a strong aromatic odour filled the chamber and fragments of scented wood and of spices pattered down upon the marble floor  it was clear to john vansittart smith that this mummy had never been unswathed before the operation interested him keenly he thrilled all over with curiosity and his birdlike head protruded further and further from behind the door when however the last roll had been removed from the fourthousandyearold head it was all that he could do to stifle an outcry of amazement first a cascade of long black glossy tresses poured over the workmans hands and arms a second turn of the bandage revealed a low white forehead with a pair of delicately arched eyebrows a third uncovered a pair of bright deeply fringed eyes and a straight wellcut nose while a fourth and last showed a sweet full sensitive mouth and a beautifully curved chin the whole face was one of extraordinary loveliness save for the one blemish that in the centre of the forehead there was a single irregular coffeecoloured splotch it was a triumph of the embalmers art vansittart smiths eyes grew larger and larger as he gazed upon it and he chirruped in his throat with satisfaction  its effect upon the egyptologist was as nothing however compared with that which it produced upon the strange attendant he threw his hands up into the air burst into a harsh clatter of words and then hurling himself down upon the ground beside the mummy he threw his arms round her and kissed her repeatedly upon the lips and brow ma petite he groaned in french ma pauvre petite his voice broke with emotion and his innumerable wrinkles quivered and writhed but the student observed in the lamplight that his shining eyes were still dry and tearless as two beads of steel for some minutes he lay with a twitching face crooning and moaning over the beautiful head then he broke into a sudden smile said some words in an unknown tongue and sprang to his feet with the vigorous air of one who has braced himself for an effort  in the centre of the room there was a large circular case which contained as the student had frequently remarked a magnificent collection of early egyptian rings and precious stones to this the attendant strode and unlocking it threw it open on the edge at the side he placed his lamp and beside it a small earthenware jar which he had drawn from his pocket he then took a handful of rings from the case and with the most serious and anxious face he proceeded to smear each in turn with some liquid substance from the earthen pot holding them to the light as he did so he was clearly disappointed with the first lot for he threw them petulantly back into the case and drew out some more one of these a massive ring with a large crystal set in it he seized and eagerly tested with the contents of the jar instantly he uttered a cry of joy and threw out his arms in a wild gesture which upset the pot and sent the liquid streaming across the floor to the very feet of the englishman the attendant drew a red handkerchief from his bosom and mopping up the mess he followed it into the corner where in a moment he found himself face to face with his observer  excuse me said john vansittart smith with all imaginable politeness i have been unfortunate enough to fall asleep behind this door  and you have been watching me the other asked in english with a most venomous look on his corpselike face  the student was a man of veracity i confess said he that i have noticed your movements and that they have aroused my curiosity and interest in the highest degree  the man drew a long flamboyantbladed knife from his bosom you have had a very narrow escape he said had i seen you ten minutes ago i should have driven this through your heart as it is if you touch me or interfere with me in any way you are a dead man  i have no wish to interfere with you the student answered my presence here is entirely accidental all i ask is that you will have the extreme kindness to show me out through some side door he spoke with great suavity for the man was still pressing the tip of his dagger against the palm of his left hand as though to assure himself of its sharpness while his face preserved its malignant expression  if i thought said he but no perhaps it is as well what is your name  the englishman gave it  vansittart smith the other repeated are you the same vansittart smith who gave a paper in london upon el kab i saw a report of it your knowledge of the subject is contemptible  sir cried the egyptologist  yet it is superior to that of many who make even greater pretensions the whole keystone of our old life in egypt was not the inscriptions or monuments of which you make so much but was our hermetic philosophy and mystic knowledge of which you say little or nothing  our old life repeated the scholar wideeyed and then suddenly good god look at the mummys face  the strange man turned and flashed his light upon the dead woman uttering a long doleful cry as he did so the action of the air had already undone all the art of the embalmer the skin had fallen away the eyes had sunk inwards the discoloured lips had writhed away from the yellow teeth and the brown mark upon the forehead alone showed that it was indeed the same face which had shown such youth and beauty a few short minutes before  the man flapped his hands together in grief and horror then mastering himself by a strong effort he turned his hard eyes once more upon the englishman  it does not matter he said in a shaking voice it does not really matter i came here tonight with the fixed determination to do something it is now done all else is as nothing i have found my quest the old curse is broken i can rejoin her what matter about her inanimate shell so long as her spirit is awaiting me at the other side of the veil  these are wild words said vansittart smith he was becoming more and more convinced that he had to do with a madman  time presses and i must go continued the other the moment is at hand for which i have waited this weary time but i must show you out first come with me  taking up the lamp he turned from the disordered chamber and led the student swiftly through the long series of the egyptian assyrian and persian apartments at the end of the latter he pushed open a small door let into the wall and descended a winding stone stair the englishman felt the cold fresh air of the night upon his brow there was a door opposite him which appeared to communicate with the street to the right of this another door stood ajar throwing a spurt of yellow light across the passage come in here said the attendant shortly  vansittart smith hesitated he had hoped that he had come to the end of his adventure yet his curiosity was strong within him he could not leave the matter unsolved so he followed his strange companion into the lighted chamber  it was a small room such as is devoted to a concierge a wood fire sparkled in the grate at one side stood a truckle bed and at the other a coarse wooden chair with a round table in the centre which bore the remains of a meal as the visitors eye glanced round he could not but remark with an everrecurring thrill that all the small details of the room were of the most quaint design and antique workmanship the candlesticks the vases upon the chimneypiece the fireirons the ornaments upon the walls were all such as he had been wont to associate with the remote past the gnarled heavyeyed man sat himself down upon the edge of the bed and motioned his guest into the chair  there may be design in this he said still speaking excellent english it may be decreed that i should leave some account behind as a warning to all rash mortals who would set their wits up against workings of nature i leave it with you make such use as you will of it i speak to you now with my feet upon the threshold of the other world  i am as you surmised an egyptiannot one of the downtrodden race of slaves who now inhabit the delta of the nile but a survivor of that fiercer and harder people who tamed the hebrew drove the ethiopian back into the southern deserts and built those mighty works which have been the envy and the wonder of all after generations it was in the reign of tuthmosis sixteen hundred years before the birth of christ that i first saw the light you shrink away from me wait and you will see that i am more to be pitied than to be feared  my name was sosra my father had been the chief priest of osiris in the great temple of abaris which stood in those days upon the bubastic branch of the nile i was brought up in the temple and was trained in all those mystic arts which are spoken of in your own bible i was an apt pupil before i was sixteen i had learned all which the wisest priest could teach me from that time on i studied natures secrets for myself and shared my knowledge with no man  of all the questions which attracted me there were none over which i laboured so long as over those which concern themselves with the nature of life i probed deeply into the vital principle the aim of medicine had been to drive away disease when it appeared it seemed to me that a method might be devised which should so fortify the body as to prevent weakness or death from ever taking hold of it it is useless that i should recount my researches you would scarce comprehend them if i did they were carried out partly upon animals partly upon slaves and partly on myself suffice it that their result was to furnish me with a substance which when injected into the blood would endow the body with strength to resist the effects of time of violence or of disease it would not indeed confer immortality but its potency would endure for many thousands of years i used it upon a cat and afterwards drugged the creature with the most deadly poisons that cat is alive in lower egypt at the present moment there was nothing of mystery or magic in the matter it was simply a chemical discovery which may well be made again  love of life runs high in the young it seemed to me that i had broken away from all human care now that i had abolished pain and driven death to such a distance with a light heart i poured the accursed stuff into my veins then i looked round for some one whom i could benefit there was a young priest of thoth parmes by name who had won my goodwill by his earnest nature and his devotion to his studies to him i whispered my secret and at his request i injected him with my elixir i should now i reflected never be without a companion of the same age as myself  after this grand discovery i relaxed my studies to some extent but parmes continued his with redoubled energy every day i could see him working with his flasks and his distiller in the temple of thoth but he said little to me as to the result of his labours for my own part i used to walk through the city and look around me with exultation as i reflected that all this was destined to pass away and that only i should remain the people would bow to me as they passed me for the fame of my knowledge had gone abroad  there was war at this time and the great king had sent down his soldiers to the eastern boundary to drive away the hyksos a governor too was sent to abaris that he might hold it for the king i had heard much of the beauty of the daughter of this governor but one day as i walked out with parmes we met her borne upon the shoulders of her slaves i was struck with love as with lightning my heart went out from me i could have thrown myself beneath the feet of her bearers this was my woman life without her was impossible i swore by the head of horus that she should be mine i swore it to the priest of thoth he turned away from me with a brow which was as black as midnight  there is no need to tell you of our wooing she came to love me even as i loved her i learned that parmes had seen her before i did and had shown her that he too loved her but i could smile at his passion for i knew that her heart was mine the white plague had come upon the city and many were stricken but i laid my hands upon the sick and nursed them without fear or scathe she marvelled at my daring then i told her my secret and begged her that she would let me use my art upon her  your flower shall then be unwithered atma i said other things may pass away but you and i and our great love for each other shall outlive the tomb of king chefru  but she was full of timid maidenly objections was it right she asked was it not a thwarting of the will of the gods if the great osiris had wished that our years should be so long would he not himself have brought it about  with fond and loving words i overcame her doubts and yet she hesitated it was a great question she said she would think it over for this one night in the morning i should know of her resolution surely one night was not too much to ask she wished to pray to isis for help in her decision  with a sinking heart and a sad foreboding of evil i left her with her tirewomen in the morning when the early sacrifice was over i hurried to her house a frightened slave met me upon the steps her mistress was ill she said very ill in a frenzy i broke my way through the attendants and rushed through hall and corridor to my atmas chamber she lay upon her couch her head high upon the pillow with a pallid face and a glazed eye on her forehead there blazed a single angry purple patch i knew that hellmark of old it was the scar of the white plague the signmanual of death  why should i speak of that terrible time for months i was mad fevered delirious and yet i could not die never did an arab thirst after the sweet wells as i longed after death could poison or steel have shortened the thread of my existence i should soon have rejoined my love in the land with the narrow portal i tried but it was of no avail the accursed influence was too strong upon me one night as i lay upon my couch weak and weary parmes the priest of thoth came to my chamber he stood in the circle of the lamplight and he looked down upon me with eyes which were bright with a mad joy  why did you let the maiden die he asked why did you not strengthen her as you strengthened me  i was too late i answered but i had forgot you also loved her you are my fellow in misfortune is it not terrible to think of the centuries which must pass ere we look upon her again fools fools that we were to take death to be our enemy  you may say that he cried with a wild laugh the words come well from your lips for me they have no meaning  what mean you i cried raising myself upon my elbow surely friend this grief has turned your brain his face was aflame with joy and he writhed and shook like one who hath a devil  do you know whither i go he asked  nay i answered i cannot tell  i go to her said he she lies embalmed in the further tomb by the double palmtree beyond the city wall  why do you go there i asked  to die he shrieked to die i am not bound by earthen fetters  but the elixir is in your blood i cried  i can defy it said he i have found a stronger principle which will destroy it it is working in my veins at this moment and in an hour i shall be a dead man i shall join her and you shall remain behind  as i looked upon him i could see that he spoke words of truth the light in his eye told me that he was indeed beyond the power of the elixir  you will teach me i cried  never he answered  i implore you by the wisdom of thoth by the majesty of anubis  it is useless he said coldly  then i will find it out i cried  you cannot he answered it came to me by chance there is one ingredient which you can never get save that which is in the ring of thoth none will ever more be made  in the ring of thoth i repeated where then is the ring of thoth  that also you shall never know he answered you won her love who has won in the end i leave you to your sordid earth life my chains are broken i must go he turned upon his heel and fled from the chamber in the morning came the news that the priest of thoth was dead  my days after that were spent in study i must find this subtle poison which was strong enough to undo the elixir from early dawn to midnight i bent over the testtube and the furnace above all i collected the papyri and the chemical flasks of the priest of thoth alas they taught me little here and there some hint or stray expression would raise hope in my bosom but no good ever came of it still month after month i struggled on when my heart grew faint i would make my way to the tomb by the palmtrees there standing by the dead casket from which the jewel had been rifled i would feel her sweet presence and would whisper to her that i would rejoin her if mortal wit could solve the riddle  parmes had said that his discovery was connected with the ring of thoth i had some remembrance of the trinket it was a large and weighty circlet made not of gold but of a rarer and heavier metal brought from the mines of mount harbal platinum you call it the ring had i remembered a hollow crystal set in it in which some few drops of liquid might be stored now the secret of parmes could not have to do with the metal alone for there were many rings of that metal in the temple was it not more likely that he had stored his precious poison within the cavity of the crystal i had scarce come to this conclusion before in hunting through his papers i came upon one which told me that it was indeed so and that there was still some of the liquid unused  but how to find the ring it was not upon him when he was stripped for the embalmer of that i made sure neither was it among his private effects in vain i searched every room that he had entered every box and vase and chattel that he had owned i sifted the very sand of the desert in the place where he had been wont to walk but do what i would i could come upon no traces of the ring of thoth yet it may be that my labours would have overcome all obstacles had it not been for a new and unlookedfor misfortune  a great war had been waged against the hyksos and the captains of the great king had been cut off in the desert with all their bowmen and horsemen the shepherd tribes were upon us like the locusts in a dry year from the wilderness of shur to the great bitter lake there was blood by day and fire by night abaris was the bulwark of egypt but we could not keep the savages back the city fell the governor and the soldiers were put to the sword and i with many more was led away into captivity  for years and years i tended cattle in the great plains by the euphrates my master died and his son grew old but i was still as far from death as ever at last i escaped upon a swift camel and made my way back to egypt the hyksos had settled in the land which they had conquered and their own king ruled over the country abaris had been torn down the city had been burned and of the great temple there was nothing left save an unsightly mound everywhere the tombs had been rifled and the monuments destroyed of my atmas grave no sign was left it was buried in the sands of the desert and the palmtrees which marked the spot had long disappeared the papers of parmes and the remains of the temple of thoth were either destroyed or scattered far and wide over the deserts of syria all search after them was vain  from that time i gave up all hope of ever finding the ring or discovering the subtle drug i set myself to live as patiently as might be until the effect of the elixir should wear away how can you understand how terrible a thing time is you who have experience only of the narrow course which lies between the cradle and the grave i know it to my cost i who have floated down the whole stream of history i was old when ilium fell i was very old when herodotus came to memphis i was bowed down with years when the new gospel came upon earth yet you see me much as other men are with the cursed elixir still sweetening my blood and guarding me against that which i would court now at last at last i have come to the end of it  i have travelled in all lands and i have dwelt with all nations every tongue is the same to me i learned them all to help pass the weary time i need not tell you how slowly they drifted by the long dawn of modern civilisation the dreary middle years the dark times of barbarism they are all behind me now i have never looked with the eyes of love upon another woman atma knows that i have been constant to her  it was my custom to read all that the scholars had to say upon ancient egypt i have been in many positions sometimes affluent sometimes poor but i have always found enough to enable me to buy the journals which deal with such matters some nine months ago i was in san francisco when i read an account of some discoveries made in the neighbourhood of abaris my heart leapt into my mouth as i read it it said that the excavator had busied himself in exploring some tombs recently unearthed in one there had been found an unopened mummy with an inscription upon the outer case setting forth that it contained the body of the daughter of the governor of the city in the days of tuthmosis it added that on removing the outer case there had been exposed a large platinum ring set with a crystal which had been laid upon the breast of the embalmed woman this then was where parmes had hid the ring of thoth he might well say that it was safe for no egyptian would ever stain his soul by moving even the outer case of a buried friend  that very night i set off from san francisco and in a few weeks i found myself once more at abaris if a few sandheaps and crumbling walls may retain the name of the great city i hurried to the frenchmen who were digging there and asked them for the ring they replied that both the ring and the mummy had been sent to the boulak museum at cairo to boulak i went but only to be told that mariette bey had claimed them and had shipped them to the louvre i followed them and there at last in the egyptian chamber i came after close upon four thousand years upon the remains of my atma and upon the ring for which i had sought so long  but how was i to lay hands upon them how was i to have them for my very own it chanced that the office of attendant was vacant i went to the director i convinced him that i knew much about egypt in my eagerness i said too much he remarked that a professors chair would suit me better than a seat in the conciergerie i knew more he said than he did it was only by blundering and letting him think that he had overestimated my knowledge that i prevailed upon him to let me move the few effects which i have retained into this chamber it is my first and my last night here  such is my story mr vansittart smith i need not say more to a man of your perception by a strange chance you have this night looked upon the face of the woman whom i loved in those faroff days there were many rings with crystals in the case and i had to test for the platinum to be sure of the one which i wanted a glance at the crystal has shown me that the liquid is indeed within it and that i shall at last be able to shake off that accursed health which has been worse to me than the foulest disease i have nothing more to say to you i have unburdened myself you may tell my story or you may withhold it at your pleasure the choice rests with you i owe you some amends for you have had a narrow escape of your life this night i was a desperate man and not to be baulked in my purpose had i seen you before the thing was done i might have put it beyond your power to oppose me or to raise an alarm this is the door it leads into the rue de rivoli goodnight  the englishman glanced back for a moment the lean figure of sosra the egyptian stood framed in the narrow doorway the next the door had slammed and the heavy rasping of a bolt broke on the silent night  it was on the second day after his return to london that mr john vansittart smith saw the following concise narrative in the paris correspondence of the times  curious occurrence in the louvreyesterday morning a strange discovery was made in the principal eastern chamber the ouvriers who are employed to clean out the rooms in the morning found one of the attendants lying dead upon the floor with his arms round one of the mummies so close was his embrace that it was only with the utmost difficulty that they were separated one of the cases containing valuable rings had been opened and rifled the authorities are of opinion that the man was bearing away the mummy with some idea of selling it to a private collector but that he was struck down in the very act by longstanding disease of the heart it is said that he was a man of uncertain age and eccentric habits without any living relations to mourn over his dramatic and untimely end     viii  the los amigos fiasco   i used to be the leading practitioner of los amigos of course every one has heard of the great electrical generating gear there the town is wide spread and there are dozens of little townlets and villages all around which receive their supply from the same centre so that the works are on a very large scale the los amigos folk say that they are the largest upon earth but then we claim that for everything in los amigos except the gaol and the deathrate those are said to be the smallest  now with so fine an electrical supply it seemed to be a sinful waste of hemp that the los amigos criminals should perish in the oldfashioned manner and then came the news of the electrocutions in the east and how the results had not after all been so instantaneous as had been hoped the western engineers raised their eyebrows when they read of the puny shocks by which these men had perished and they vowed in los amigos that when an irreclaimable came their way he should be dealt handsomely by and have the run of all the big dynamos there should be no reserve said the engineers but he should have all that they had got and what the result of that would be none could predict save that it must be absolutely blasting and deadly never before had a man been so charged with electricity as they would charge him he was to be smitten by the essence of ten thunderbolts some prophesied combustion and some disintegration and disappearance they were waiting eagerly to settle the question by actual demonstration and it was just at that moment that duncan warner came that way  warner had been wanted by the law and by nobody else for many years desperado murderer train robber and road agent he was a man beyond the pale of human pity he had deserved a dozen deaths and the los amigos folk grudged him so gaudy a one as that he seemed to feel himself to be unworthy of it for he made two frenzied attempts at escape he was a powerful muscular man with a lion heart tangled black locks and a sweeping beard which covered his broad chest when he was tried there was no finer head in all the crowded court its no new thing to find the best face looking from the dock but his good looks could not balance his bad deeds his advocate did all he knew but the cards lay against him and duncan warner was handed over to the mercy of the big los amigos dynamos  i was there at the committee meeting when the matter was discussed the town council had chosen four experts to look after the arrangements three of them were admirable there was joseph mconnor the very man who had designed the dynamos and there was joshua westmacott the chairman of the los amigos electrical supply company limited then there was myself as the chief medical man and lastly an old german of the name of peter stulpnagel the germans were a strong body at los amigos and they all voted for their man that was how he got on the committee it was said that he had been a wonderful electrician at home and he was eternally working with wires and insulators and leyden jars but as he never seemed to get any further or to have any results worth publishing he came at last to be regarded as a harmless crank who had made science his hobby we three practical men smiled when we heard that he had been elected as our colleague and at the meeting we fixed it all up very nicely among ourselves without much thought of the old fellow who sat with his ears scooped forward in his hands for he was a trifle hard of hearing taking no more part in the proceedings than the gentlemen of the press who scribbled their notes on the back benches  we did not take long to settle it all in new york a strength of some two thousand volts had been used and death had not been instantaneous evidently their shock had been too weak los amigos should not fall into that error the charge should be six times greater and therefore of course it would be six times more effective nothing could possibly be more logical the whole concentrated force of the great dynamos should be employed on duncan warner  so we three settled it and had already risen to break up the meeting when our silent companion opened his mouth for the first time  gentlemen said he you appear to me to show an extraordinary ignorance upon the subject of electricity you have not mastered the first principles of its actions upon a human being  the committee was about to break into an angry reply to this brusque comment but the chairman of the electrical company tapped his forehead to claim its indulgence for the crankiness of the speaker  pray tell us sir said he with an ironical smile what is there in our conclusions with which you find fault  with your assumption that a large dose of electricity will merely increase the effect of a small dose do you not think it possible that it might have an entirely different result do you know anything by actual experiment of the effect of such powerful shocks  we know it by analogy said the chairman pompously all drugs increase their effect when they increase their dose for examplefor example  whisky said joseph mconnor  quite so whisky you see it there  peter stulpnagel smiled and shook his head  your argument is not very good said he when i used to take whisky i used to find that one glass would excite me but that six would send me to sleep which is just the opposite now suppose that electricity were to act in just the opposite way also what then  we three practical men burst out laughing we had known that our colleague was queer but we never had thought that he would be as queer as this  what then repeated peter stulpnagel  well take our chances said the chairman  pray consider said peter that workmen who have touched the wires and who have received shocks of only a few hundred volts have died instantly the fact is well known and yet when a much greater force was used upon a criminal at new york the man struggled for some little time do you not clearly see that the smaller dose is the more deadly  i think gentlemen that this discussion has been carried on quite long enough said the chairman rising again the point i take it has already been decided by the majority of the committee and duncan warner shall be electrocuted on tuesday by the full strength of the los amigos dynamos is it not so  i agree said joseph mconnor  i agree said i  and i protest said peter stulpnagel  then the motion is carried and your protest will be duly entered in the minutes said the chairman and so the sitting was dissolved  the attendance at the electrocution was a very small one we four members of the committee were of course present with the executioner who was to act under their orders the others were the united states marshal the governor of the gaol the chaplain and three members of the press the room was a small brick chamber forming an outhouse to the central electrical station it had been used as a laundry and had an oven and copper at one side but no other furniture save a single chair for the condemned man a metal plate for his feet was placed in front of it to which ran a thick insulated wire above another wire depended from the ceiling which could be connected with a small metallic rod projecting from a cap which was to be placed upon his head when this connection was established duncan warners hour was come  there was a solemn hush as we waited for the coming of the prisoner the practical engineers looked a little pale and fidgeted nervously with the wires even the hardened marshal was ill at ease for a mere hanging was one thing and this blasting of flesh and blood a very different one as to the pressmen their faces were whiter than the sheets which lay before them the only man who appeared to feel none of the influence of these preparations was the little german crank who strolled from one to the other with a smile on his lips and mischief in his eyes more than once he even went so far as to burst into a shout of laughter until the chaplain sternly rebuked him for his illtimed levity  how can you so far forget yourself mr stulpnagel said he as to jest in the presence of death  but the german was quite unabashed  if i were in the presence of death i should not jest said he but since i am not i may do what i choose  this flippant reply was about to draw another and a sterner reproof from the chaplain when the door was swung open and two warders entered leading duncan warner between them he glanced round him with a set face stepped resolutely forward and seated himself upon the chair  touch her off said he  it was barbarous to keep him in suspense the chaplain murmured a few words in his ear the attendant placed the cap upon his head and then while we all held our breath the wire and the metal were brought in contact  great scott shouted duncan warner  he had bounded in his chair as the frightful shock crashed through his system but he was not dead on the contrary his eyes gleamed far more brightly than they had done before there was only one change but it was a singular one the black had passed from his hair and beard as the shadow passes from a landscape they were both as white as snow and yet there was no other sign of decay his skin was smooth and plump and lustrous as a childs  the marshal looked at the committee with a reproachful eye  there seems to be some hitch here gentlemen said he  we three practical men looked at each other  peter stulpnagel smiled pensively  i think that another one should do it said i  again the connection was made and again duncan warner sprang in his chair and shouted but indeed were it not that he still remained in the chair none of us would have recognised him his hair and his beard had shredded off in an instant and the room looked like a barbers shop on a saturday night there he sat his eyes still shining his skin radiant with the glow of perfect health but with a scalp as bald as a dutch cheese and a chin without so much as a trace of down he began to revolve one of his arms slowly and doubtfully at first but with more confidence as he went on  that joint said he has puzzled half the doctors on the pacific slope its as good as new and as limber as a hickory twig  you are feeling pretty well asked the old german  never better in my life said duncan warner cheerily  the situation was a painful one the marshal glared at the committee peter stulpnagel grinned and rubbed his hands the engineers scratched their heads the baldheaded prisoner revolved his arm and looked pleased  i think that one more shock began the chairman  no sir said the marshal weve had foolery enough for one morning we are here for an execution and an execution well have  what do you propose  theres a hook handy upon the ceiling fetch a rope and well soon set this matter straight  there was another awkward delay while the warders departed for the cord peter stulpnagel bent over duncan warner and whispered something in his ear the desperado stared in surprise  you dont say he asked  the german nodded  what no ways  peter shook his head and the two began to laugh as though they shared some huge joke between them  the rope was brought and the marshal himself slipped the noose over the criminals neck then the two warders the assistant and he swung their victim into the air for half an hour he hunga dreadful sightfrom the ceiling then in solemn silence they lowered him down and one of the warders went out to order the shell to be brought round but as he touched ground again what was our amazement when duncan warner put his hands up to his neck loosened the noose and took a long deep breath  paul jeffersons sale is goin well he remarked i could see the crowd from up yonder and he nodded at the hook in the ceiling  up with him again shouted the marshal well get the life out of him somehow  in an instant the victim was up at the hook once more  they kept him there for an hour but when he came down he was perfectly garrulous  old man plunket goes too much to the arcady saloon said he three times hes been there in an hour and him with a family old man plunket would do well to swear off  it was monstrous and incredible but there it was there was no getting round it the man was there talking when he ought to have been dead we all sat staring in amazement but united states marshal carpenter was not a man to be euchred so easily he motioned the others to one side so that the prisoner was left standing alone  duncan warner said he slowly you are here to play your part and i am here to play mine your game is to live if you can and my game is to carry out the sentence of the law youve beat us on electricity ill give you one there and youve beat us on hanging for you seem to thrive on it but its my turn to beat you now for my duty has to be done  he pulled a sixshooter from his coat as he spoke and fired all the shots through the body of the prisoner the room was so filled with smoke that we could see nothing but when it cleared the prisoner was still standing there looking down in disgust at the front of his coat  coats must be cheap where you come from said he thirty dollars it cost me and look at it now the six holes in front are bad enough but four of the balls have passed out and a pretty fine state the back must be in  the marshals revolver fell from his hand and he dropped his arms to his sides a beaten man  maybe some of you gentlemen can tell me what this means said he looking helplessly at the committee  peter stulpnagel took a step forward  ill tell you all about it said he  you seem to be the only person who knows anything  i am the only person who knows anything i should have warned these gentlemen but as they would not listen to me i have allowed them to learn by experience what you have done with your electricity is that you have increased the mans vitality until he can deny death for centuries  centuries  yes it will take the wear of hundreds of years to exhaust the enormous nervous energy with which you have drenched him electricity is life and you have charged him with it to the utmost perhaps in fifty years you might execute him but i am not sanguine about it  great scott what shall i do with him cried the unhappy marshal  peter stulpnagel shrugged his shoulders  it seems to me that it does not much matter what you do with him now said he  maybe we could drain the electricity out of him again suppose we hang him up by the heels  no no its out of the question  well well he shall do no more mischief in los amigos anyhow said the marshal with decision he shall go into the new gaol the prison will wear him out  on the contrary said peter stulpnagel i think that it is much more probable that he will wear out the prison  it was rather a fiasco and for years we didnt talk more about it than we could help but its no secret now and i thought you might like to jot down the facts in your casebook     ix  how it happened   she was a writing medium this is what she wrote  i can remember some things upon that evening most distinctly and others are like some vague broken dreams that is what makes it so difficult to tell a connected story i have no idea now what it was that had taken me to london and brought me back so late it just merges into all my other visits to london but from the time that i got out at the little country station everything is extraordinarily clear i can live it againevery instant of it  i remember so well walking down the platform and looking at the illuminated clock at the end which told me that it was halfpast eleven i remember also my wondering whether i could get home before midnight then i remember the big motor with its glaring headlights and glitter of polished brass waiting for me outside it was my new thirtyhorsepower robur which had only been delivered that day i remember also asking perkins my chauffeur how she had gone and his saying that he thought she was excellent  ill try her myself said i and i climbed into the drivers seat  the gears are not the same said he perhaps sir i had better drive  no i should like to try her said i  and so we started on the fivemile drive for home  my old car had the gears as they used always to be in notches on a bar in this car you passed the gearlever through a gate to get on the higher ones it was not difficult to master and soon i thought that i understood it it was foolish no doubt to begin to learn a new system in the dark but one often does foolish things and one has not always to pay the full price for them i got along very well until i came to claystall hill it is one of the worst hills in england a mile and a half long and one in six in places with three fairly sharp curves my park gates stand at the very foot of it upon the main london road  we were just over the brow of this hill where the grade is steepest when the trouble began i had been on the top speed and wanted to get her on the free but she stuck between gears and i had to get her back on the top again by this time she was going at a great rate so i clapped on both brakes and one after the other they gave way i didnt mind so much when i felt my footbrake snap but when i put all my weight on my sidebrake and the lever clanged to its full limit without a catch it brought a cold sweat out of me by this time we were fairly tearing down the slope the lights were brilliant and i brought her round the first curve all right then we did the second one though it was a close shave for the ditch there was a mile of straight then with the third curve beneath it and after that the gate of the park if i could shoot into that harbour all would be well for the slope up to the house would bring her to a stand  perkins behaved splendidly i should like that to be known he was perfectly cool and alert i had thought at the very beginning of taking the bank and he read my intention  i wouldnt do it sir said he at this pace it must go over and we should have it on the top of us  of course he was right he got to the electric switch and had it off so we were in the free but we were still running at a fearful pace he laid his hands on the wheel  ill keep her steady said he if you care to jump and chance it we can never get round that curve better jump sir  no said i ill stick it out you can jump if you like  ill stick it with you sir said he  if it had been the old car i should have jammed the gearlever into the reverse and seen what would happen i expect she would have stripped her gears or smashed up somehow but it would have been a chance as it was i was helpless perkins tried to climb across but you couldnt do it going at that pace the wheels were whirring like a high wind and the big body creaking and groaning with the strain but the lights were brilliant and one could steer to an inch i remember thinking what an awful and yet majestic sight we should appear to any one who met us it was a narrow road and we were just a great roaring golden death to any one who came in our path  we got round the corner with one wheel three feet high upon the bank i thought we were surely over but after staggering for a moment she righted darted onwards that was the third corner and the last one there was only the park gate now it was facing us but as luck would have it not facing us directly it was about twenty yards to the left up the main road into which we ran perhaps i could have done it but i expect that the steeringgear had been jarred when we ran on the bank the wheel did not turn easily we shot out of the lane i saw the open gate on the left i whirled round my wheel with all the strength of my wrists perkins and i threw our bodies across and then the next instant going at fifty miles an hour my right front wheel struck full on the righthand pillar of my own gate i heard the crash i was conscious of flying through the air and thenand then                                       when i became aware of my own existence once more i was among some brushwood in the shadow of the oaks upon the lodge side of the drive a man was standing beside me i imagined at first that it was perkins but when i looked again i saw that it was stanley a man whom i had known at college some years before and for whom i had a really genuine affection there was always something peculiarly sympathetic to me in stanleys personality and i was proud to think that i had some similar influence upon him at the present moment i was surprised to see him but i was like a man in a dream giddy and shaken and quite prepared to take things as i found them without questioning them  what a smash i said good lord what an awful smash  he nodded his head and even in the gloom i could see that he was smiling the gentle wistful smile which i connected with him  i was quite unable to move indeed i had not any desire to try to move but my senses were exceedingly alert i saw the wreck of the motor lit up by the moving lanterns i saw the little group of people and heard the hushed voices there were the lodgekeeper and his wife and one or two more they were taking no notice of me but were very busy round the car then suddenly i heard a cry of pain  the weight is on him lift it easy cried a voice  its only my leg said another one which i recognised as perkinss wheres master he cried  here i am i answered but they did not seem to hear me they were all bending over something which lay in front of the car  stanley laid his hand upon my shoulder and his touch was inexpressibly soothing i felt light and happy in spite of all  no pain of course said he  none said i  there never is said he  and then suddenly a wave of amazement passed over me stanley stanley why stanley had surely died of enteric at bloemfontein in the boer war  stanley i cried and the words seemed to choke my throatstanley you are dead  he looked at me with the same old gentle wistful smile  so are you he answered     x  lot no 249   of the dealings of edward bellingham with william monkhouse lee and of the cause of the great terror of abercrombie smith it may be that no absolute and final judgment will ever be delivered it is true that we have the full and clear narrative of smith himself and such corroboration as he could look for from thomas styles the servant from the reverend plumptree peterson fellow of olds and from such other people as chanced to gain some passing glance at this or that incident in a singular chain of events yet in the main the story must rest upon smith alone and the most will think that it is more likely that one brain however outwardly sane has some subtle warp in its texture some strange flaw in its workings than that the path of nature has been overstepped in open day in so famed a centre of learning and light as the university of oxford yet when we think how narrow and how devious this path of nature is how dimly we can trace it for all our lamps of science and how from the darkness which girds it round great and terrible possibilities loom ever shadowly upwards it is a bold and confident man who will put a limit to the strange bypaths into which the human spirit may wander  in a certain wing of what we will call old college in oxford there is a corner turret of an exceeding great age the heavy arch which spans the open door has bent downwards in the centre under the weight of its years and the grey lichenblotched blocks of stone are bound and knitted together with withes and strand of ivy as though the old mother had set herself to brace them up against wind and weather from a door a stone stair curves upwards spirally passing two landings and terminating in a third one its steps all shapeless and hollowed by the tread of so many generations of the seekers after knowledge life has flowed like water down this winding stair and waterlike has left these smoothworn grooves behind it from the longgowned pedantic scholars of plantagenet days down to the young bloods of a later age how full and strong had been that tide of young english life and what was left now of all those hopes those strivings those fiery energies save here and there in some oldworld churchyard a few scratches upon a stone and perchance a handful of dust in a mouldering coffin yet here were the silent stair and the grey old wall with bend and saltire and many another heraldic device still to be read upon its surface like grotesque shadows thrown back from the days that had passed  in the month of may in the year 1884 three young men occupied the sets of rooms which opened on to the separate landings of the old stair each set consisted simply of a sittingroom and a bedroom while the two corresponding rooms upon the groundfloor were used the one as a coalcellar and the other as the livingroom of the servant or scout thomas styles whose duty it was to wait upon the three men above him to right and to left was a line of lecturerooms and of offices so that the dwellers in the old turret enjoyed a certain seclusion which made the chambers popular among the more studious undergraduates such were the three who occupied them nowabercrombie smith above edward bellingham beneath him and william monkhouse lee upon the lowest story  it was ten oclock on a bright spring night and abercrombie smith lay back in his armchair his feet upon the fender and his briarroot pipe between his lips in a similar chair and equally at his ease there lounged on the other side of the fireplace his old school friend jephro hastie both men were in flannels for they had spent their evening upon the river but apart from their dress no one could look at their hardcut alert faces without seeing that they were openair menmen whose minds and tastes turned naturally to all that was manly and robust hastie indeed was stroke of his college boat and smith was an even better oar but a coming examination had already cast its shadow over him and held him to his work save for the few hours a week which health demanded a litter of medical books upon the table with scattered bones models and anatomical plates pointed to the extent as well as the nature of his studies while a couple of singlesticks and a set of boxinggloves above the mantelpiece hinted at the means by which with hasties help he might take his exercise in its most compressed and least distant form they knew each other very wellso well that they could sit now in that soothing silence which is the very highest development of companionship  have some whisky said abercrombie smith at last between two cloudbursts scotch in the jug and irish in the bottle  no thanks im in for the sculls i dont liquor when im training how about you  im reading hard i think it best to leave it alone  hastie nodded and they relapsed into a contented silence  by the way smith asked hastie presently have you made the acquaintance of either of the fellows on your stair yet  just a nod when we pass nothing more  hum i should be inclined to let it stand at that i know something of them both not much but as much as i want i dont think i should take them to my bosom if i were you not that theres much amiss with monkhouse lee  meaning the thin one  precisely he is a gentlemanly little fellow i dont think there is any vice in him but then you cant know him without knowing bellingham  meaning the fat one  yes the fat one and hes a man whom i for one would rather not know  abercrombie smith raised his eyebrows and glanced across at his companion  whats up then he asked drink cards cad you used not to be censorious  ah you evidently dont know the man or you wouldnt ask theres something damnable about himsomething reptilian my gorge always rises at him i should put him down as a man with secret vicesan evil liver hes no fool though they say that he is one of the best men in his line that they have ever had in the college  medicine or classics  eastern languages hes a demon at them chillingworth met him somewhere above the second cataract last long and he told me that he just prattled to the arabs as if he had been born and nursed and weaned among them he talked coptic to the copts and hebrew to the jews and arabic to the bedouins and they were all ready to kiss the hem of his frockcoat there are some old hermit johnnies up in those parts who sit on rocks and scowl and spit at the casual stranger well when they saw this chap bellingham before he had said five words they just lay down on their bellies and wriggled chillingworth said that he never saw anything like it bellingham seemed to take it as his right too and strutted about among them and talked down to them like a dutch uncle pretty good for an undergrad of olds wasnt it  why do you say you cant know lee without knowing bellingham  because bellingham is engaged to his sister eveline such a bright little girl smith i know the whole family well its disgusting to see that brute with her a toad and a dove thats what they always remind me of  abercrombie smith grinned and knocked his ashes out against the side of the grate  you show every card in your hand old chap said he what a prejudiced greeneyed evilthinking old man it is you have really nothing against the fellow except that  well ive known her ever since she was as long as that cherrywood pipe and i dont like to see her taking risks and it is a risk he looks beastly and he has a beastly temper a venomous temper you remember his row with long norton  no you always forget that i am a freshman  ah it was last winter of course well you know the towpath along by the river there were several fellows going along it bellingham in front when they came on an old marketwoman coming the other way it had been rainingyou know what those fields are like when it has rainedand the path ran between the river and a great puddle that was nearly as broad well what does this swine do but keep the path and push the old girl into the mud where she and her marketings came to terrible grief it was a blackguard thing to do and long norton who is as gentle a fellow as ever stepped told him what he thought of it one word led to another and it ended in norton laying his stick across the fellows shoulders there was the deuce of a fuss about it and its a treat to see the way in which bellingham looks at norton when they meet now by jove smith its nearly eleven oclock  no hurry light your pipe again  not i im supposed to be in training here ive been sitting gossiping when i ought to have been safely tucked up ill borrow your skull if you can share it williams has had mine for a month ill take the little bones of your ear too if you are sure you wont need them thanks very much never mind a bag i can carry them very well under my arm goodnight my son and take my tip as to your neighbour  when hastie bearing his anatomical plunder had clattered off down the winding stair abercrombie smith hurled his pipe into the wastepaper basket and drawing his chair nearer to the lamp plunged into a formidable greencovered volume adorned with great coloured maps of that strange internal kingdom of which we are the hapless and helpless monarchs though a freshman at oxford the student was not so in medicine for he had worked for four years at glasgow and at berlin and this coming examination would place him finally as a member of his profession with his firm mouth broad forehead and clearcut somewhat hardfeatured face he was a man who if he had no brilliant talent was yet so dogged so patient and so strong that he might in the end overtop a more showy genius a man who can hold his own among scotchmen and north germans is not a man to be easily set back smith had left a name at glasgow and at berlin and he was bent now upon doing as much at oxford if hard work and devotion could accomplish it  he had sat reading for about an hour and the hands of the noisy carriage clock upon the side table were rapidly closing together upon the twelve when a sudden sound fell upon the students eara sharp rather shrill sound like the hissing intake of a mans breath who gasps under some strong emotion smith laid down his book and slanted his ear to listen there was no one on either side or above him so that the interruption came certainly from the neighbour beneaththe same neighbour of whom hastie had given so unsavory an account smith knew him only as a flabby palefaced man of silent and studious habits a man whose lamp threw a golden bar from the old turret even after he had extinguished his own this community in lateness had formed a certain silent bond between them it was soothing to smith when the hours stole on towards dawning to feel that there was another so close who set as small a value upon his sleep as he did even now as his thoughts turned towards him smiths feelings were kindly hastie was a good fellow but he was rough strongfibred with no imagination or sympathy he could not tolerate departures from what he looked upon as the model type of manliness if a man could not be measured by a publicschool standard then he was beyond the pale with hastie like so many who are themselves robust he was apt to confuse the constitution with the character to ascribe to want of principle what was really a want of circulation smith with his stronger mind knew his friends habit and made allowance for it now as his thoughts turned towards the man beneath him  there was no return of the singular sound and smith was about to turn to his work once more when suddenly there broke out in the silence of the night a hoarse cry a positive screamthe call of a man who is moved and shaken beyond all control smith sprang out of his chair and dropped his book he was a man of fairly firm fibre but there was something in this sudden uncontrollable shriek of horror which chilled his blood and pringled in his skin coming in such a place and at such an hour it brought a thousand fantastic possibilities into his head should he rush down or was it better to wait he had all the national hatred of making a scene and he knew so little of his neighbour that he would not lightly intrude upon his affairs for a moment he stood in doubt and even as he balanced the matter there was a quick rattle of footsteps upon the stairs and young monkhouse lee half dressed and as white as ashes burst into his room  come down he gasped bellinghams ill  abercrombie smith followed him closely downstairs into the sittingroom which was beneath his own and intent as he was upon the matter in hand he could not but take an amazed glance around him as he crossed the threshold it was such a chamber as he had never seen beforea museum rather than a study walls and ceiling were thickly covered with a thousand strange relics from egypt and the east tall angular figures bearing burdens or weapons stalked in an uncouth frieze round the apartments above were bullheaded storkheaded catheaded owlheaded statues with vipercrowned almondeyed monarchs and strange beetlelike deities cut out of the blue egyptian lapis lazuli horus and isis and osiris peeped down from every niche and shelf while across the ceiling a true son of old nile a great hangingjawed crocodile was slung in a double noose  in the centre of this singular chamber was a large square table littered with papers bottles and the dried leaves of some graceful palmlike plant these varied objects had all been heaped together in order to make room for a mummy case which had been conveyed from the wall as was evident from the gap there and laid across the front of the table the mummy itself a horrid black withered thing like a charred head on a gnarled bush was lying half out of the case with its clawlike hand and bony forearm resting upon the table propped up against the sarcophagus was an old yellow scroll of papyrus and in front of it in a wooden armchair sat the owner of the room his head thrown back his widelyopened eyes directed in a horrified stare to the crocodile above him and his blue thick lips puffing loudly with every expiration  my god hes dying cried monkhouse lee distractedly  he was a slim handsome young fellow oliveskinned and darkeyed of a spanish rather than of an english type with a celtic intensity of manner which contrasted with the saxon phlegm of abercrombie smith  only a faint i think said the medical student just give me a hand with him you take his feet now on to the sofa can you kick all those little wooden devils off what a litter it is now he will be all right if we undo his collar and give him some water what has he been up to at all  i dont know i heard him cry out i ran up i know him pretty well you know it is very good of you to come down  his heart is going like a pair of castanets said smith laying his hand on the breast of the unconscious man he seems to me to be frightened all to pieces chuck the water over him what a face he has got on him  it was indeed a strange and most repellent face for colour and outline were equally unnatural it was white not with the ordinary pallor of fear but with an absolutely bloodless white like the under side of a sole he was very fat but gave the impression of having at some time been considerably fatter for his skin hung loosely in creases and folds and was shot with a meshwork of wrinkles short stubbly brown hair bristled up from his scalp with a pair of thick wrinkled ears protruding at the sides his light grey eyes were still open the pupils dilated and the balls projecting in a fixed and horrid stare it seemed to smith as he looked down upon him that he had never seen natures danger signals flying so plainly upon a mans countenance and his thoughts turned more seriously to the warning which hastie had given him an hour before  what the deuce can have frightened him so he asked  its the mummy  the mummy how then  i dont know its beastly and morbid i wish he would drop it its the second fright he has given me it was the same last winter i found him just like this with that horrid thing in front of him  what does he want with the mummy then  oh hes a crank you know its his hobby he knows more about these things than any man in england but i wish he wouldnt ah hes beginning to come to  a faint tinge of colour had begun to steal back into bellinghams ghastly cheeks and his eyelids shivered like a sail after a calm he clasped and unclasped his hands drew a long thin breath between his teeth and suddenly jerking up his head threw a glance of recognition around him as his eyes fell upon the mummy he sprang off the sofa seized the roll of papyrus thrust it into a drawer turned the key and then staggered back on to the sofa  whats up he asked what do you chaps want  youve been shrieking out and making no end of a fuss said monkhouse lee if our neighbour here from above hadnt come down im sure i dont know what i should have done with you  ah its abercrombie smith said bellingham glancing up at him how very good of you to come in what a fool i am oh my god what a fool i am  he sunk his head on to his hands and burst into peal after peal of hysterical laughter  look here drop it cried smith shaking him roughly by the shoulder  your nerves are all in a jangle you must drop these little midnight games with mummies or youll be going off your chump youre all on wires now  i wonder said bellingham whether you would be as cool as i am if you had seen  what then  oh nothing i meant that i wonder if you could sit up at night with a mummy without trying your nerves i have no doubt that you are quite right i dare say that i have been taking it out of myself too much lately but i am all right now please dont go though just wait for a few minutes until i am quite myself  the room is very close remarked lee throwing open the window and letting in the cool night air  its balsamic resin said bellingham he lifted up one of the dried palmate leaves from the table and frizzled it over the chimney of the lamp it broke away into heavy smoke wreaths and a pungent biting odour filled the chamber its the sacred plantthe plant of the priests he remarked do you know anything of eastern languages smith  nothing at all not a word  the answer seemed to lift a weight from the egyptologists mind  by the way he continued how long was it from the time that you ran down until i came to my senses  not long some four or five minutes  i thought it could not be very long said he drawing a long breath but what a strange thing unconsciousness is there is no measurement to it i could not tell from my own sensations if it were seconds or weeks now that gentleman on the table was packed up in the days of the eleventh dynasty some forty centuries ago and yet if he could find his tongue he would tell us that this lapse of time has been but a closing of the eyes and a reopening of them he is a singularly fine mummy smith  smith stepped over to the table and looked down with a professional eye at the black and twisted form in front of him the features though horribly discoloured were perfect and two little nutlike eyes still lurked in the depths of the black hollow sockets the blotched skin was drawn tightly from bone to bone and a tangled wrap of black coarse hair fell over the ears two thin teeth like those of a rat overlay the shrivelled lower lip in its crouching position with bent joints and craned head there was a suggestion of energy about the horrid thing which made smiths gorge rise the gaunt ribs with their parchmentlike covering were exposed and the sunken leadenhued abdomen with the long slit where the embalmer had left his mark but the lower limbs were wrapped round with coarse yellow bandages a number of little clovelike pieces of myrrh and of cassia were sprinkled over the body and lay scattered on the inside of the case  i dont know his name said bellingham passing his hand over the shrivelled head you see the outer sarcophagus with the inscriptions is missing lot 249 is all the title he has now you see it printed on his case that was his number in the auction at which i picked him up  he has been a very pretty sort of fellow in his day remarked abercrombie smith  he has been a giant his mummy is six feet seven in length and that would be a giant over there for they were never a very robust race feel these great knotted bones too he would be a nasty fellow to tackle  perhaps these very hands helped to build the stones into the pyramids suggested monkhouse lee looking down with disgust in his eyes at the crooked unclean talons  no fear this fellow has been pickled in natron and looked after in the most approved style they did not serve hodsmen in that fashion salt or bitumen was enough for them it has been calculated that this sort of thing cost about seven hundred and thirty pounds in our money our friend was a noble at the least what do you make of that small inscription near his feet smith  i told you that i know no eastern tongue  ah so you did it is the name of the embalmer i take it a very conscientious worker he must have been i wonder how many modern works will survive four thousand years  he kept on speaking lightly and rapidly but it was evident to abercrombie smith that he was still palpitating with fear his hands shook his lower lip trembled and look where he would his eye always came sliding round to his gruesome companion through all his fear however there was a suspicion of triumph in his tone and manner his eyes shone and his footstep as he paced the room was brisk and jaunty he gave the impression of a man who has gone through an ordeal the marks of which he still bears upon him but which has helped him to his end  youre not going yet he cried as smith rose from the sofa  at the prospect of solitude his fears seemed to crowd back upon him and he stretched out a hand to detain him  yes i must go i have my work to do you are all right now i think that with your nervous system you should take up some less morbid study  oh i am not nervous as a rule and i have unwrapped mummies before  you fainted last time observed monkhouse lee  ah yes so i did well i must have a nerve tonic or a course of electricity you are not going lee  ill do whatever you wish ned  then ill come down with you and have a shakedown on your sofa goodnight smith i am so sorry to have disturbed you with my foolishness  they shook hands and as the medical student stumbled up the spiral and irregular stair he heard a key turn in a door and the steps of his two new acquaintances as they descended to the lower floor                                       in this strange way began the acquaintance between edward bellingham and abercrombie smith an acquaintance which the latter at least had no desire to push forward bellingham however appeared to have taken a fancy to his roughspoken neighbour and made his advances in such a way that he could hardly be repulsed without absolute brutality twice he called to thank smith for his assistance and many times afterwards he looked in with books papers and such other civilities as two bachelor neighbours can offer each other he was as smith soon found a man of wide reading with catholic tastes and an extraordinary memory his manner too was so pleasing and suave that one came after a time to overlook his repellent appearance for a jaded and wearied man he was no unpleasant companion and smith found himself after a time looking forward to his visits and even returning them  clever as he undoubtedly was however the medical student seemed to detect a dash of insanity in the man he broke out at times into a high inflated style of talk which was in contrast with the simplicity of his life  it is a wonderful thing he cried to feel that one can command powers of good and of evila ministering angel or a demon of vengeance and again of monkhouse lee he saidlee is a good fellow an honest fellow but he is without strength or ambition he would not make a fit partner for a man with a great enterprise he would not make a fit partner for me  at such hints and innuendoes stolid smith puffing solemnly at his pipe would simply raise his eyebrows and shake his head with little interjections of medical wisdom as to earlier hours and fresher air  one habit bellingham had developed of late which smith knew to be a frequent herald of a weakening mind he appeared to be for ever talking to himself at late hours of the night when there could be no visitor with him smith could still hear his voice beneath him in a low muffled monologue sunk almost to a whisper and yet very audible in the silence this solitary babbling annoyed and distracted the student so that he spoke more than once to his neighbour about it bellingham however flushed up at the charge and denied curtly that he had uttered a sound indeed he showed more annoyance over the matter than the occasion seemed to demand  had abercrombie smith had any doubt as to his own ears he had not to go far to find corroboration tom styles the little wrinkled manservant who had attended to the wants of the lodgers in the turret for a longer time than any mans memory could carry him was sorely put to it over the same matter  if you please sir said he as he tidied down the top chamber one morning do you think mr bellingham is all right sir  all right styles  yes sir right in his head sir  why should he not be then  well i dont know sir his habits has changed of late hes not the same man he used to be though i make free to say that he was never quite one of my gentlemen like mr hastie or yourself sir hes took to talkin to himself something awful i wonder it dont disturb you i dont know what to make of him sir  i dont know what business it is of yours styles  well i takes an interest mr smith it may be forward of me but i cant help it i feel sometimes as if i was mother and father to my young gentlemen it all falls on me when things go wrong and the relations come but mr bellingham sir i want to know what it is that walks about his room sometimes when hes out and when the doors locked on the outside  eh youre talking nonsense styles  maybe so sir but i heard it moren once with my own ears  rubbish styles  very good sir youll ring the bell if you want me  abercrombie smith gave little heed to the gossip of the old manservant but a small incident occurred a few days later which left an unpleasant effect upon his mind and brought the words of styles forcibly to his memory  bellingham had come up to see him late one night and was entertaining him with an interesting account of the rock tombs of beni hassan in upper egypt when smith whose hearing was remarkably acute distinctly heard the sound of a door opening on the landing below  theres some fellow gone in or out of your room he remarked  bellingham sprang up and stood helpless for a moment with the expression of a man who is half incredulous and half afraid  i surely locked it i am almost positive that i locked it he stammered no one could have opened it  why i hear some one coming up the steps now said smith  bellingham rushed out through the door slammed it loudly behind him and hurried down the stairs about halfway down smith heard him stop and thought he caught the sound of whispering a moment later the door beneath him shut a key creaked in a lock and bellingham with beads of moisture upon his pale face ascended the stairs once more and reentered the room  its all right he said throwing himself down in a chair it was that fool of a dog he had pushed the door open i dont know how i came to forget to lock it  i didnt know you kept a dog said smith looking very thoughtfully at the disturbed face of his companion  yes i havent had him long i must get rid of him hes a great nuisance  he must be if you find it so hard to shut him up i should have thought that shutting the door would have been enough without locking it  i want to prevent old styles from letting him out hes of some value you know and it would be awkward to lose him  i am a bit of a dogfancier myself said smith still gazing hard at his companion from the corner of his eyes perhaps youll let me have a look at it  certainly but i am afraid it cannot be tonight i have an appointment is that clock right then i am a quarter of an hour late already youll excuse me i am sure  he picked up his cap and hurried from the room in spite of his appointment smith heard him reenter his own chamber and lock his door upon the inside  this interview left a disagreeable impression upon the medical students mind bellingham had lied to him and lied so clumsily that it looked as if he had desperate reasons for concealing the truth smith knew that his neighbour had no dog he knew also that the step which he had heard upon the stairs was not the step of an animal but if it were not then what could it be there was old styless statement about the something which used to pace the room at times when the owner was absent could it be a woman smith rather inclined to the view if so it would mean disgrace and expulsion to bellingham if it were discovered by the authorities so that his anxiety and falsehoods might be accounted for and yet it was inconceivable that an undergraduate could keep a woman in his rooms without being instantly detected be the explanation what it might there was something ugly about it and smith determined as he turned to his books to discourage all further attempts at intimacy on the part of his softspoken and illfavoured neighbour  but his work was destined to interruption that night he had hardly caught up the broken threads when a firm heavy footfall came three steps at a time from below and hastie in blazer and flannels burst into the room  still at it said he plumping down into his wonted armchair what a chap you are to stew i believe an earthquake might come and knock oxford into a cocked hat and you would sit perfectly placid with your books among the ruins however i wont bore you long three whiffs of baccy and i am off  whats the news then asked smith cramming a plug of birdseye into his briar with his forefinger  nothing very much wilson made 70 for the freshmen against the eleven they say that they will play him instead of buddicomb for buddicomb is clean off colour he used to be able to bowl a little but its nothing but halfvolleys and long hops now  medium right suggested smith with the intense gravity which comes upon a varsity man when he speaks of athletics  inclining to fast with a work from leg comes with the arm about three inches or so he used to be nasty on a wet wicket oh bytheway have you heard about long norton  whats that  hes been attacked  attacked  yes just as he was turning out of the high street and within a hundred yards of the gate of olds  but who  ah thats the rub if you said what you would be more grammatical norton swears that it was not human and indeed from the scratches on his throat i should be inclined to agree with him  what then have we come down to spooks  abercrombie smith puffed his scientific contempt  well no i dont think that is quite the idea either i am inclined to think that if any showman has lost a great ape lately and the brute is in these parts a jury would find a true bill against it norton passes that way every night you know about the same hour theres a tree that hangs low over the paththe big elm from rainys garden norton thinks the thing dropped on him out of the tree anyhow he was nearly strangled by two arms which he says were as strong and as thin as steel bands he saw nothing only those beastly arms that tightened and tightened on him he yelled his head nearly off and a couple of chaps came running and the thing went over the wall like a cat he never got a fair sight of it the whole time it gave norton a shake up i can tell you i tell him it has been as good as a change at the seaside for him  a garrotter most likely said smith  very possible norton says not but we dont mind what he says the garrotter had long nails and was pretty smart at swinging himself over walls bytheway your beautiful neighbour would be pleased if he heard about it he had a grudge against norton and hes not a man from what i know of him to forget his little debts but hallo old chap what have you got in your noddle  nothing smith answered curtly  he had started in his chair and the look had flashed over his face which comes upon a man who is struck suddenly by some unpleasant idea  you looked as if something i had said had taken you on the raw bytheway you have made the acquaintance of master b since i looked in last have you not young monkhouse lee told me something to that effect  yes i know him slightly he has been up here once or twice  well youre big enough and ugly enough to take care of yourself hes not what i should call exactly a healthy sort of johnny though no doubt hes very clever and all that but youll soon find out for yourself lee is all right hes a very decent little fellow well so long old chap i row mullins for the vicechancellors pot on wednesday week so mind you come down in case i dont see you before  bovine smith laid down his pipe and turned stolidly to his books once more but with all the will in the world he found it very hard to keep his mind upon his work it would slip away to brood upon the man beneath him and upon the little mystery which hung round his chambers then his thoughts turned to this singular attack of which hastie had spoken and to the grudge which bellingham was said to owe the object of it the two ideas would persist in rising together in his mind as though there were some close and intimate connection between them and yet the suspicion was so dim and vague that it could not be put down in words  confound the chap cried smith as he shied his book on pathology across the room he has spoiled my nights reading and thats reason enough if there were no other why i should steer clear of him in the future  for ten days the medical student confined himself so closely to his studies that he neither saw nor heard anything of either of the men beneath him at the hours when bellingham had been accustomed to visit him he took care to sport his oak and though he more than once heard a knocking at his outer door he resolutely refused to answer it one afternoon however he was descending the stairs when just as he was passing it bellinghams door flew open and young monkhouse lee came out with his eyes sparkling and a dark flush of anger upon his olive cheeks close at his heels followed bellingham his fat unhealthy face all quivering with malignant passion  you fool he hissed youll be sorry  very likely cried the other mind what i say its off i wont hear of it  youve promised anyhow  oh ill keep that i wont speak but id rather little eva was in her grave once for all its off shell do what i say we dont want to see you again  so much smith could not avoid hearing but he hurried on for he had no wish to be involved in their dispute there had been a serious breach between them that was clear enough and lee was going to cause the engagement with his sister to be broken off smith thought of hasties comparison of the toad and the dove and was glad to think that the matter was at an end bellinghams face when he was in a passion was not pleasant to look upon he was not a man to whom an innocent girl could be trusted for life as he walked smith wondered languidly what could have caused the quarrel and what the promise might be which bellingham had been so anxious that monkhouse lee should keep  it was the day of the sculling match between hastie and mullins and a stream of men were making their way down to the banks of the isis a may sun was shining brightly and the yellow path was barred with the black shadows of the tall elmtrees on either side the grey colleges lay back from the road the hoary old mothers of minds looking out from their high mullioned windows at the tide of young life which swept so merrily past them blackclad tutors prim officials pale reading men brownfaced strawhatted young athletes in white sweaters or manycoloured blazers all were hurrying towards the blue winding river which curves through the oxford meadows  abercrombie smith with the intuition of an old oarsman chose his position at the point where he knew that the struggle if there were a struggle would come far off he heard the hum which announced the start the gathering roar of the approach the thunder of running feet and the shouts of the men in the boats beneath him a spray of halfclad deepbreathing runners shot past him and craning over their shoulders he saw hastie pulling a steady thirtysix while his opponent with a jerky forty was a good boats length behind him smith gave a cheer for his friend and pulling out his watch was starting off again for his chambers when he felt a touch upon his shoulder and found that young monkhouse lee was beside him  i saw you there he said in a timid deprecating way i wanted to speak to you if you could spare me a halfhour this cottage is mine i share it with harrington of kings come in and have a cup of tea  i must be back presently said smith i am hard on the grind at present but ill come in for a few minutes with pleasure i wouldnt have come out only hastie is a friend of mine  so he is of mine hasnt he a beautiful style mullins wasnt in it but come into the cottage its a little den of a place but it is pleasant to work in during the summer months  it was a small square white building with green doors and shutters and a rustic trelliswork porch standing back some fifty yards from the rivers bank inside the main room was roughly fitted up as a studydeal table unpainted shelves with books and a few cheap oleographs upon the wall a kettle sang upon a spiritstove and there were tea things upon a tray on the table  try that chair and have a cigarette said lee let me pour you out a cup of tea its so good of you to come in for i know that your time is a good deal taken up i wanted to say to you that if i were you i should change my rooms at once  eh  smith sat staring with a lighted match in one hand and his unlit cigarette in the other  yes it must seem very extraordinary and the worst of it is that i cannot give my reasons for i am under a solemn promisea very solemn promise but i may go so far as to say that i dont think bellingham is a very safe man to live near i intend to camp out here as much as i can for a time  not safe what do you mean  ah thats what i mustnt say but do take my advice and move your rooms we had a grand row today you must have heard us for you came down the stairs  i saw that you had fallen out  hes a horrible chap smith that is the only word for him i have had doubts about him ever since that night when he faintedyou remember when you came down i taxed him today and he told me things that made my hair rise and wanted me to stand in with him im not straitlaced but i am a clergymans son you know and i think there are some things which are quite beyond the pale i only thank god that i found him out before it was too late for he was to have married into my family  this is all very fine lee said abercrombie smith curtly but either you are saying a great deal too much or a great deal too little  i give you a warning  if there is real reason for warning no promise can bind you if i see a rascal about to blow a place up with dynamite no pledge will stand in my way of preventing him  ah but i cannot prevent him and i can do nothing but warn you  without saying what you warn me against  against bellingham  but that is childish why should i fear him or any man  i cant tell you i can only entreat you to change your rooms you are in danger where you are i dont even say that bellingham would wish to injure you but it might happen for he is a dangerous neighbour just now  perhaps i know more than you think said smith looking keenly at the young mans boyish earnest face suppose i tell you that some one else shares bellinghams rooms  monkhouse lee sprang from his chair in uncontrollable excitement  you know then he gasped  a woman  lee dropped back again with a groan  my lips are sealed he said i must not speak  well anyhow said smith rising it is not likely that i should allow myself to be frightened out of rooms which suit me very nicely it would be a little too feeble for me to move out all my goods and chattels because you say that bellingham might in some unexplained way do me an injury i think that ill just take my chance and stay where i am and as i see that its nearly five oclock i must ask you to excuse me  he bade the young student adieu in a few curt words and made his way homeward through the sweet spring evening feeling halfruffled halfamused as any other strong unimaginative man might who has been menaced by a vague and shadowy danger  there was one little indulgence which abercrombie smith always allowed himself however closely his work might press upon him twice a week on the tuesday and the friday it was his invariable custom to walk over to farlingford the residence of doctor plumptree peterson situated about a mile and a half out of oxford peterson had been a close friend of smiths elder brother francis and as he was a bachelor fairly welltodo with a good cellar and a better library his house was a pleasant goal for a man who was in need of a brisk walk twice a week then the medical student would swing out there along the dark country roads and spend a pleasant hour in petersons comfortable study discussing over a glass of old port the gossip of the varsity or the latest developments of medicine or of surgery  on the day which followed his interview with monkhouse lee smith shut up his books at a quarter past eight the hour when he usually started for his friends house as he was leaving his room however his eyes chanced to fall upon one of the books which bellingham had lent him and his conscience pricked him for not having returned it however repellent the man might be he should not be treated with discourtesy taking the book he walked downstairs and knocked at his neighbours door there was no answer but on turning the handle he found that it was unlocked pleased at the thought of avoiding an interview he stepped inside and placed the book with his card upon the table  the lamp was turned half down but smith could see the details of the room plainly enough it was all much as he had seen it beforethe frieze the animalheaded gods the hanging crocodile and the table littered over with papers and dried leaves the mummy case stood upright against the wall but the mummy itself was missing there was no sign of any second occupant of the room and he felt as he withdrew that he had probably done bellingham an injustice had he a guilty secret to preserve he would hardly leave his door open so that all the world might enter  the spiral stair was as black as pitch and smith was slowly making his way down its irregular steps when he was suddenly conscious that something had passed him in the darkness there was a faint sound a whiff of air a light brushing past his elbow but so slight that he could scarcely be certain of it he stopped and listened but the wind was rustling among the ivy outside and he could hear nothing else  is that you styles he shouted  there was no answer and all was still behind him it must have been a sudden gust of air for there were crannies and cracks in the old turret and yet he could almost have sworn that he heard a footfall by his very side he had emerged into the quadrangle still turning the matter over in his head when a man came running swiftly across the smoothcropped lawn  is that you smith  hullo hastie  for gods sake come at once young lee is drowned heres harrington of kings with the news the doctor is out youll do but come along at once there may be life in him  have you brandy  no  ill bring some theres a flask on my table  smith bounded up the stairs taking three at a time seized the flask and was rushing down with it when as he passed bellinghams room his eyes fell upon something which left him gasping and staring upon the landing  the door which he had closed behind him was now open and right in front of him with the lamplight shining upon it was the mummy case three minutes ago it had been empty he could swear to that now it framed the lank body of its horrible occupant who stood grim and stark with his black shrivelled face towards the door the form was lifeless and inert but it seemed to smith as he gazed that there still lingered a lurid spark of vitality some faint sign of consciousness in the little eyes which lurked in the depths of the hollow sockets so astounded and shaken was he that he had forgotten his errand and was still staring at the lean sunken figure when the voice of his friend below recalled him to himself  come on smith he shouted its life and death you know hurry up now then he added as the medical student reappeared let us do a sprint it is well under a mile and we should do it in five minutes a human life is better worth running for than a pot  neck and neck they dashed through the darkness and did not pull up until panting and spent they had reached the little cottage by the river young lee limp and dripping like a broken waterplant was stretched upon the sofa the green scum of the river upon his black hair and a fringe of white foam upon his leadenhued lips beside him knelt his fellow student harrington endeavouring to chafe some warmth back into his rigid limbs  i think theres life in him said smith with his hand to the lads side put your watch glass to his lips yes theres dimming on it you take one arm hastie now work it as i do and well soon pull him round  for ten minutes they worked in silence inflating and depressing the chest of the unconscious man at the end of that time a shiver ran through his body his lips trembled and he opened his eyes the three students burst out into an irrepressible cheer  wake up old chap youve frightened us quite enough  have some brandy take a sip from the flask  hes all right now said his companion harrington heavens what a fright i got i was reading here and had gone out for a stroll as far as the river when i heard a scream and a splash out i ran and by the time i could find him and fish him out all life seemed to have gone then simpson couldnt get a doctor for he has a gameleg and i had to run and i dont know what id have done without you fellows thats right old chap sit up  monkhouse lee had raised himself on his hands and looked wildly about him  whats up he asked ive been in the water ah yes i remember  a look of fear came into his eyes and he sank his face into his hands  how did you fall in  i didnt fall in  how then  i was thrown in i was standing by the bank and something from behind picked me up like a feather and hurled me in i heard nothing and i saw nothing but i know what it was for all that  and so do i whispered smith  lee looked up with a quick glance of surprise  youve learned then he said you remember the advice i gave you  yes and i begin to think that i shall take it  i dont know what the deuce you fellows are talking about said hastie but i think if i were you harrington i should get lee to bed at once it will be time enough to discuss the why and the wherefore when he is a little stronger i think smith you and i can leave him alone now i am walking back to college if you are coming in that direction we can have a chat  but it was little chat that they had upon their homeward path smiths mind was too full of the incidents of the evening the absence of the mummy from his neighbours rooms the step that passed him on the stair the reappearancethe extraordinary inexplicable reappearance of the grisly thingand then this attack upon lee corresponding so closely to the previous outrage upon another man against whom bellingham bore a grudge all this settled in his thoughts together with the many little incidents which had previously turned him against his neighbour and the singular circumstances under which he was first called in to him what had been a dim suspicion a vague fantastic conjecture had suddenly taken form and stood out in his mind as a grim fact a thing not to be denied and yet how monstrous it was how unheard of how entirely beyond all bounds of human experience an impartial judge or even the friend who walked by his side would simply tell him that his eyes had deceived him that the mummy had been there all the time that young lee had tumbled into the river as any other man tumbles into a river and that blue pill was the best thing for a disordered liver he felt that he would have said as much if the positions had been reversed and yet he could swear that bellingham was a murderer at heart and that he wielded a weapon such as no man had ever used in all the grim history of crime  hastie had branched off to his rooms with a few crisp and emphatic comments upon his friends unsociability and abercrombie smith crossed the quadrangle to his corner turret with a strong feeling of repulsion for his chambers and their associations he would take lees advice and move his quarters as soon as possible for how could a man study when his ear was ever straining for every murmur or footstep in the room below he observed as he crossed over the lawn that the light was still shining in bellinghams window and as he passed up the staircase the door opened and the man himself looked out at him with his fat evil face he was like some bloated spider fresh from the weaving of his poisonous web  goodevening said he wont you come in  no cried smith fiercely  no you are busy as ever i wanted to ask you about lee i was sorry to hear that there was a rumour that something was amiss with him  his features were grave but there was the gleam of a hidden laugh in his eyes as he spoke smith saw it and he could have knocked him down for it  youll be sorrier still to hear that monkhouse lee is doing very well and is out of all danger he answered your hellish tricks have not come off this time oh you neednt try to brazen it out i know all about it  bellingham took a step back from the angry student and halfclosed the door as if to protect himself  you are mad he said what do you mean do you assert that i had anything to do with lees accident  yes thundered smith you and that bag of bones behind you you worked it between you i tell you what it is master b they have given up burning folk like you but we still keep a hangman and by george if any man in this college meets his death while you are here ill have you up and if you dont swing for it it wont be my fault youll find that your filthy egyptian tricks wont answer in england  youre a raving lunatic said bellingham  all right you just remember what i say for youll find that ill be better than my word  the door slammed and smith went fuming up to his chamber where he locked the door upon the inside and spent half the night in smoking his old briar and brooding over the strange events of the evening  next morning abercrombie smith heard nothing of his neighbour but harrington called upon him in the afternoon to say that lee was almost himself again all day smith stuck fast to his work but in the evening he determined to pay the visit to his friend doctor peterson upon which he had started the night before a good walk and a friendly chat would be welcome to his jangled nerves  bellinghams door was shut as he passed but glancing back when he was some distance from the turret he saw his neighbours head at the window outlined against the lamplight his face pressed apparently against the glass as he gazed out into the darkness it was a blessing to be away from all contact with him if but for a few hours and smith stepped out briskly and breathed the soft spring air into his lungs the halfmoon lay in the west between two gothic pinnacles and threw upon the silvered street a dark tracery from the stonework above there was a brisk breeze and light fleecy clouds drifted swiftly across the sky olds was on the very border of the town and in five minutes smith found himself beyond the houses and between the hedges of a mayscented oxfordshire lane  it was a lonely and little frequented road which led to his friends house early as it was smith did not meet a single soul upon his way he walked briskly along until he came to the avenue gate which opened into the long gravel drive leading up to farlingford in front of him he could see the cosy red light of the windows glimmering through the foliage he stood with his hand upon the iron latch of the swinging gate and he glanced back at the road along which he had come something was coming swiftly down it  it moved in the shadow of the hedge silently and furtively a dark crouching figure dimly visible against the black background even as he gazed back at it it had lessened its distance by twenty paces and was fast closing upon him out of the darkness he had a glimpse of a scraggy neck and of two eyes that will ever haunt him in his dreams he turned and with a cry of terror he ran for his life up the avenue there were the red lights the signals of safety almost within a stonesthrow of him he was a famous runner but never had he run as he ran that night  the heavy gate had swung into place behind him but he heard it dash open again before his pursuer as he rushed madly and wildly through the night he could hear a swift dry patter behind him and could see as he threw back a glance that this horror was bounding like a tiger at his heels with blazing eyes and one stringy arm outthrown thank god the door was ajar he could see the thin bar of light which shot from the lamp in the hall nearer yet sounded the clatter from behind he heard a hoarse gurgling at his very shoulder with a shriek he flung himself against the door slammed and bolted it behind him and sank halffainting on to the hall chair  my goodness smith whats the matter asked peterson appearing at the door of his study  give me some brandy  peterson disappeared and came rushing out again with a glass and a decanter  you need it he said as his visitor drank off what he poured out for him why man you are as white as a cheese  smith laid down his glass rose up and took a deep breath  i am my own man again now said he i was never so unmanned before but with your leave peterson i will sleep here tonight for i dont think i could face that road again except by daylight its weak i know but i cant help it  peterson looked at his visitor with a very questioning eye  of course you shall sleep here if you wish ill tell mrs burney to make up the spare bed where are you off to now  come up with me to the window that overlooks the door i want you to see what i have seen  they went up to the window of the upper hall whence they could look down upon the approach to the house the drive and the fields on either side lay quiet and still bathed in the peaceful moonlight  well really smith remarked peterson it is well that i know you to be an abstemious man what in the world can have frightened you  ill tell you presently but where can it have gone ah now look look see the curve of the road just beyond your gate  yes i see you neednt pinch my arm off i saw some one pass i should say a man rather thin apparently and tall very tall but what of him and what of yourself you are still shaking like an aspen leaf  i have been within handgrip of the devil thats all but come down to your study and i shall tell you the whole story  he did so under the cheery lamplight with a glass of wine on the table beside him and the portly form and florid face of his friend in front he narrated in their order all the events great and small which had formed so singular a chain from the night on which he had found bellingham fainting in front of the mummy case until this horrid experience of an hour ago  there now he said as he concluded thats the whole black business it is monstrous and incredible but it is true  doctor plumptree peterson sat for some time in silence with a very puzzled expression upon his face  i never heard of such a thing in my life never he said at last you have told me the facts now tell me your inferences  you can draw your own  but i should like to hear yours you have thought over the matter and i have not  well it must be a little vague in detail but the main points seem to me to be clear enough this fellow bellingham in his eastern studies has got hold of some infernal secret by which a mummyor possibly only this particular mummycan be temporarily brought to life he was trying this disgusting business on the night when he fainted no doubt the sight of the creature moving had shaken his nerve even though he had expected it you remember that almost the first words he said were to call out upon himself as a fool well he got more hardened afterwards and carried the matter through without fainting the vitality which he could put into it was evidently only a passing thing for i have seen it continually in its case as dead as this table he has some elaborate process i fancy by which he brings the thing to pass having done it he naturally bethought him that he might use the creature as an agent it has intelligence and it has strength for some purpose he took lee into his confidence but lee like a decent christian would have nothing to do with such a business then they had a row and lee vowed that he would tell his sister of bellinghams true character bellinghams game was to prevent him and he nearly managed it by setting this creature of his on his track he had already tried its powers upon another mannortontowards whom he had a grudge it is the merest chance that he has not two murders upon his soul then when i taxed him with the matter he had the strongest reasons for wishing me out of the way before i could convey my knowledge to any one else he got his chance when i went out for he knew my habits and where i was bound for i have had a narrow shave peterson and it is mere luck you didnt find me on your doorstep in the morning im not a nervous man as a rule and i never thought to have the fear of death put upon me as it was tonight  my dear boy you take the matter too seriously said his companion your nerves are out of order with your work and you make too much of it how could such a thing as this stride about the streets of oxford even at night without being seen  it has been seen there is quite a scare in the town about an escaped ape as they imagine the creature to be it is the talk of the place  well its a striking chain of events and yet my dear fellow you must allow that each incident in itself is capable of a more natural explanation  what even my adventure of tonight  certainly you come out with your nerves all unstrung and your head full of this theory of yours some gaunt halffamished tramp steals after you and seeing you run is emboldened to pursue you your fears and imagination do the rest  it wont do peterson it wont do  and again in the instance of your finding the mummy case empty and then a few moments later with an occupant you know that it was lamplight that the lamp was half turned down and that you had no special reason to look hard at the case it is quite possible that you may have overlooked the creature in the first instance  no no it is out of the question  and then lee may have fallen into the river and norton been garrotted it is certainly a formidable indictment that you have against bellingham but if you were to place it before a police magistrate he would simply laugh in your face  i know he would that is why i mean to take the matter into my own hands  eh  yes i feel that a public duty rests upon me and besides i must do it for my own safety unless i choose to allow myself to be hunted by this beast out of the college and that would be a little too feeble i have quite made up my mind what i shall do and first of all may i use your paper and pens for an hour  most certainly you will find all that you want upon that sidetable  abercrombie smith sat down before a sheet of foolscap and for an hour and then for a second hour his pen travelled swiftly over it page after page was finished and tossed aside while his friend leaned back in his armchair looking across at him with patient curiosity at last with an exclamation of satisfaction smith sprang to his feet gathered his papers up into order and laid the last one upon petersons desk  kindly sign this as a witness he said  a witness of what  of my signature and of the date the date is the most important why peterson my life might hang upon it  my dear smith you are talking wildly let me beg you to go to bed  on the contrary i never spoke so deliberately in my life and i will promise to go to bed the moment you have signed it  but what is it  it is a statement of all that i have been telling you tonight i wish you to witness it  certainly said peterson signing his name under that of his companion there you are but what is the idea  you will kindly retain it and produce it in case i am arrested  arrested for what  for murder it is quite on the cards i wish to be ready for every event there is only one course open to me and i am determined to take it  for heavens sake dont do anything rash  believe me it would be far more rash to adopt any other course i hope that we wont need to bother you but it will ease my mind to know that you have this statement of my motives and now i am ready to take your advice and to go to roost for i want to be at my best in the morning                                       abercrombie smith was not an entirely pleasant man to have as an enemy slow and easytempered he was formidable when driven to action he brought to every purpose in life the same deliberate resoluteness which had distinguished him as a scientific student he had laid his studies aside for a day but he intended that the day should not be wasted not a word did he say to his host as to his plans but by nine oclock he was well on his way to oxford  in the high street he stopped at cliffords the gunmakers and bought a heavy revolver with a box of centralfire cartridges six of them he slipped into the chambers and halfcocking the weapon placed it in the pocket of his coat he then made his way to hasties rooms where the big oarsman was lounging over his breakfast with the sporting times propped up against the coffeepot  hullo whats up he asked have some coffee  no thank you i want you to come with me hastie and do what i ask you  certainly my boy  and bring a heavy stick with you  hullo hastie stared heres a hunting crop that would fell an ox  one other thing you have a box of amputating knives give me the longest of them  there you are you seem to be fairly on the war trail anything else  no that will do smith placed the knife inside his coat and led the way to the quadrangle we are neither of us chickens hastie said he i think i can do this job alone but i take you as a precaution i am going to have a little talk with bellingham if i have only him to deal with i wont of course need you if i shout however up you come and lam out with your whip as hard as you can lick do you understand  all right ill come if i hear you bellow  stay here then i may be a little time but dont budge until i come down  im a fixture  smith ascended the stairs opened bellinghams door and stepped in bellingham was seated behind his table writing beside him among his litter of strange possessions towered the mummy case with its sale number 249 still stuck upon its front and its hideous occupant stiff and stark within it smith looked very deliberately round him closed the door and then stepping across to the fireplace struck a match and set the fire alight bellingham sat staring with amazement and rage upon his bloated face  well really now you make yourself at home he gasped  smith sat himself deliberately down placing his watch upon the table drew out his pistol cocked it and laid it in his lap then he took the long amputating knife from his bosom and threw it down in front of bellingham  now then said he just get to work and cut up that mummy  oh is that it said bellingham with a sneer  yes that is it they tell me that the law cant touch you but i have a law that will set matters straight if in five minutes you have not set to work i swear by the god who made me that i will put a bullet through your brain  you would murder me  bellingham had half risen and his face was the colour of putty  yes  and for what  to stop your mischief one minute has gone  but what have i done  i know and you know  this is mere bullying  two minutes are gone  but you must give reasons you are a madmana dangerous madman why should i destroy my own property it is a valuable mummy  you must cut it up and you must burn it  i will do no such thing  four minutes are gone  smith took up the pistol and he looked towards bellingham with an inexorable face as the secondhand stole round he raised his hand and the finger twitched upon the trigger  there there ill do it screamed bellingham  in frantic haste he caught up the knife and hacked at the figure of the mummy ever glancing round to see the eye and the weapon of his terrible visitor bent upon him the creature crackled and snapped under every stab of the keen blade a thick yellow dust rose up from it spices and dried essences rained down upon the floor suddenly with a rending crack its backbone snapped asunder and it fell a brown heap of sprawling limbs upon the floor  now into the fire said smith  the flames leaped and roared as the dried and tinderlike debris was piled upon it the little room was like the stokehole of a steamer and the sweat ran down the faces of the two men but still the one stooped and worked while the other sat watching him with a set face a thick fat smoke oozed out from the fire and a heavy smell of burned rosin and singed hair filled the air in a quarter of an hour a few charred and brittle sticks were all that was left of lot no 249  perhaps that will satisfy you snarled bellingham with hate and fear in his little grey eyes as he glanced back at his tormentor  no i must make a clean sweep of all your materials we must have no more devils tricks in with all these leaves they may have something to do with it  and what now asked bellingham when the leaves also had been added to the blaze  now the roll of papyrus which you had on the table that night it is in that drawer i think  no no shouted bellingham dont burn that why man you dont know what you do it is unique it contains wisdom which is nowhere else to be found  out with it  but look here smith you cant really mean it ill share the knowledge with you ill teach you all that is in it or stay let me only copy it before you burn it  smith stepped forward and turned the key in the drawer taking out the yellow curled roll of paper he threw it into the fire and pressed it down with his heel bellingham screamed and grabbed at it but smith pushed him back and stood over it until it was reduced to a formless grey ash  now master b said he i think i have pretty well drawn your teeth youll hear from me again if you return to your old tricks and now goodmorning for i must go back to my studies  and such is the narrative of abercrombie smith as to the singular events which occurred in old college oxford in the spring of 84 as bellingham left the university immediately afterwards and was last heard of in the soudan there is no one who can contradict his statement but the wisdom of men is small and the ways of nature are strange and who shall put a bound to the dark things which may be found by those who seek for them     xi  de profundis   so long as the oceans are the ligaments which bind together the great broadcast british empire so long will there be a dash of romance in our minds for the soul is swayed by the waters as the waters are by the moon and when the great highways of an empire are along such roads as these so full of strange sights and sounds with danger ever running like a hedge on either side of the course it is a dull mind indeed which does not bear away with it some trace of such a passage and now britain lies far beyond herself for the threemile limit of every seaboard is her frontier which has been won by hammer and loom and pick rather than by arts of war for it is written in history that neither king nor army can bar the path to the man who having twopence in his strong box and knowing well where he can turn it to threepence sets his mind to that one end and as the frontier has broadened the mind of britain has broadened too spreading out until all men can see that the ways of the island are continental even as those of the continent are insular  but for this a price must be paid and the price is a grievous one as the beast of old must have one young human life as a tribute every year so to our empire we throw from day to day the pick and flower of our youth the engine is worldwide and strong but the only fuel that will drive it is the lives of british men thus it is that in the grey old cathedrals as we look round upon the brasses on the walls we see strange names such names as they who reared those walls had never heard for it is in peshawur and umballah and korti and fort pearson that the youngsters die leaving only a precedent and a brass behind them but if every man had his obelisk even where he lay then no frontier line need be drawn for a cordon of british graves would ever show how high the angloceltic tide had lapped  this then as well as the waters which join us to the world has done something to tinge us with romance for when so many have their loved ones over the seas walking amid hillmens bullets or swamp malaria where death is sudden and distance great then mind communes with mind and strange stories arise of dream presentiment or vision where the mother sees her dying son and is past the first bitterness of her grief ere the message comes which should have broken the news the learned have of late looked into the matter and have even labelled it with a name but what can we know more of it save that a poor stricken soul when hardpressed and driven can shoot across the earth some tenthousandmiledistant picture of its trouble to the mind which is most akin to it far be it from me to say that there lies no such power within us for of all things which the brain will grasp the last will be itself but yet it is well to be very cautious over such matters for once at least i have known that which was within the laws of nature seem to be far upon the further side of them  john vansittart was the younger partner of the firm of hudson and vansittart coffee exporters of the island of ceylon threequarters dutchman by descent but wholly english in his sympathies for years i had been his agent in london and when in 72 he came over to england for a three months holiday he turned to me for the introductions which would enable him to see something of town and country life armed with seven letters he left my offices and for many weeks scrappy notes from different parts of the country let me know that he had found favour in the eyes of my friends then came word of his engagement to emily lawson of a cadet branch of the hereford lawsons and at the very tail of the first flying rumour the news of his absolute marriage for the wooing of a wanderer must be short and the days were already crowding on towards the date when he must be upon his homeward journey they were to return together to colombo in one of the firms own thousandton barquerigged sailing ships and this was to be their princely honeymoon at once a necessity and a delight  those were the royal days of coffeeplanting in ceylon before a single season and a rotting fungus drove a whole community through years of despair to one of the greatest commercial victories which pluck and ingenuity ever won not often is it that men have the heart when their one great industry is withered to rear up in a few years another as rich to take its place and the teafields of ceylon are as true a monument to courage as is the lion at waterloo but in 72 there was no cloud yet above the skyline and the hopes of the planters were as high and as bright as the hillsides on which they reared their crops vansittart came down to london with his young and beautiful wife i was introduced dined with them and it was finally arranged that i since business called me also to ceylon should be a fellowpassenger with them on the eastern star which was timed to sail on the following monday  it was on the sunday evening that i saw him again he was shown up into my rooms about nine oclock at night with the air of a man who is bothered and out of sorts his hand as i shook it was hot and dry  i wish atkinson said he that you could give me a little limejuice and water i have a beastly thirst upon me and the more i take the more i seem to want  i rang and ordered a caraffe and glasses you are flushed said i you dont look the thing  no im clean off colour got a touch of rheumatism in my back and dont seem to taste my food it is this vile london that is choking me im not used to breathing air which has been used up by four million lungs all sucking away on every side of you he flapped his crooked hands before his face like a man who really struggles for his breath  a touch of the sea will soon set you right  yes im of one mind with you there thats the thing for me i want no other doctor if i dont get to sea tomorrow ill have an illness there are no two ways about it he drank off the tumbler of limejuice and clapped his two hands with his knuckles doubled up into the small of his back  that seems to ease me said he looking at me with a filmy eye now i want your help atkinson for i am rather awkwardly placed  as how  this way my wifes mother got ill and wired for her i couldnt goyou know best yourself how tied i have beenso she had to go alone now ive had another wire to say that she cant come tomorrow but that she will pick up the ship at falmouth on wednesday we put in there you know though i count it hard atkinson that a man should be asked to believe in a mystery and cursed if he cant do it cursed mind you no less he leaned forward and began to draw a catchy breath like a man who is poised on the very edge of a sob  then first it came into my mind that i had heard much of the harddrinking life of the island and that from brandy came these wild words and fevered hands the flushed cheek and the glazing eye were those of one whose drink is strong upon him sad it was to see so noble a young man in the grip of that most bestial of all the devils  you should lie down i said with some severity  he screwed up his eyes like a man who is striving to wake himself and looked up with an air of surprise  so i shall presently said he quite rationally i felt quite swimmy just now but i am my own man again now let me see what was i talking about oh ah of course about the wife she joins the ship at falmouth now i want to go round by water i believe my health depends upon it i just want a little clean firstlung air to set me on my feet again i ask you like a good fellow to go to falmouth by rail so that in case we should be late you may be there to look after the wife put up at the royal hotel and i will wire her that you are there her sister will bring her down so that it will be all plain sailing  ill do it with pleasure said i in fact i would rather go by rail for we shall have enough and to spare of the sea before we reach colombo i believe too that you badly need a change now i should go and turn in if i were you  yes i will i sleep aboard tonight you know he continued as the film settled down again over his eyes ive not slept well the last few nights ive been troubled with theololologthat is to say theolologicalhang it with a desperate effort with the doubts of theolologicians wondering why the almighty made us you know and why he made our heads swimmy and fixed little pains into the small of our backs maybe ill do better tonight he rose and steadied himself with an effort against the corner of the chair back  look here vansittart said i gravely stepping up to him and laying my hand upon his sleeve i can give you a shakedown here you are not fit to go out you are all over the place youve been mixing your drinks  drinks he stared at me stupidly  you used to carry your liquor better than this  i give you my word atkinson that i have not had a drain for two days its not drink i dont know what it is i suppose you think this is drink he took up my hand in his burning grasp and passed it over his own forehead  great lord said i  his skin felt like a thin sheet of velvet beneath which lies a closepacked layer of small shot it was smooth to the touch at any one place but to a finger passed along it rough as a nutmeggrater  its all right said he smiling at my startled face ive had the prickly heat nearly as bad  but this is never prickly heat  no its london its breathing bad air but tomorrow itll be all right theres a surgeon aboard so i shall be in safe hands i must be off now  not you said i pushing him back into a chair this is past a joke you dont move from here until a doctor sees you just stay where you are  i caught up my hat and rushing round to the house of a neighbouring physician i brought him back with me the room was empty and vansittart gone i rang the bell the servant said that the gentleman had ordered a cab the instant that i had left and had gone off in it he had told the cabman to drive to the docks  did the gentleman seem ill i asked  ill the man smiled no sir he was singin his ardest all the time  the information was not as reassuring as my servant seemed to think but i reflected that he was going straight back to the eastern star and that there was a doctor aboard of her so that there was nothing which i could do in the matter none the less when i thought of his thirst his burning hands his heavy eye his tripping speech and lastly of that leprous forehead i carried with me to bed an unpleasant memory of my visitor and his visit  at eleven oclock next day i was at the docks but the eastern star had already moved down the river and was nearly at gravesend to gravesend i went by train but only to see her topmasts far off with a plume of smoke from a tug in front of her i would hear no more of my friend until i rejoined him at falmouth when i got back to my offices a telegram was awaiting me from mrs vansittart asking me to meet her and next evening found us both at the royal hotel falmouth where we were to wait for the eastern star ten days passed and there came no news of her  they were ten days which i am not likely to forget on the very day that the eastern star had cleared from the thames a furious easterly gale had sprung up and blew on from day to day for the greater part of a week without the sign of a lull such a screaming raving longdrawn storm has never been known on the southern coast from our hotel windows the sea view was all banked in haze with a little rainswept halfcircle under our very eyes churned and lashed into one tossing stretch of foam so heavy was the wind upon the waves that little sea could rise for the crest of each billow was torn shrieking from it and lashed broadcast over the bay clouds wind sea all were rushing to the west and there looking down at this mad jumble of elements i waited on day after day my sole companion a white silent woman with terror in her eyes her forehead pressed ever against the window her gaze from early morning to the fall of night fixed upon that wall of grey haze through which the loom of a vessel might come she said nothing but that face of hers was one long wail of fear  on the fifth day i took counsel with an old seaman  i should have preferred to have done so alone but she saw me speak with him and was at our side in an instant with parted lips and a prayer in her eyes  seven days out from london said he and five in the gale well the channels swept clear by this wind theres three things for it she may have popped into port on the french side thats like enough  no no he knew we were here he would have telegraphed  ah yes so he would well then he might have run for it and if he did that he wont be very far from madeira by now thatll be it marm you may depend  or else you said there was a third chance  did i marm no only two i think i dont think i said anything of a third your ships out there depend upon it away out in the atlantic and youll hear of it time enough for the weather is breaking now dont you fret marm and wait quiet and youll find a real blue cornish sky tomorrow  the old seaman was right in his surmise for the next day broke calm and bright with only a low dwindling cloud in the west to mark the last trailing wreaths of the stormwrack but still there came no word from the sea and no sign of the ship three more weary days had passed the weariest that i have ever spent when there came a seafaring man to the hotel with a letter i gave a shout of joy it was from the captain of the eastern star as i read the first lines of it i whisked my hand over it but she laid her own upon it and drew it away i have seen it said she in a cold quiet voice i may as well see the rest too       dear sir said the letter       mr vansittart is down with the smallpox and we are blown so far      on our course that we dont know what to do he being off his head      and unfit to tell us by dead reckoning we are but three hundred      miles from funchal so i take it that it is best that we should      push on there get mr v into hospital and wait in the bay until      you come theres a sailingship due from falmouth to funchal in a      few days time as i understand this goes by the brig marian of      falmouth and five pounds is due to the master       yours respectfully       jno hines  she was a wonderful woman that only a chit of a girl fresh from school but as quiet and strong as a man she said nothingonly pressed her lips together tight and put on her bonnet  you are going out i asked  yes  can i be of use  no i am going to the doctors  to the doctors  yes to learn how to nurse a smallpox case  she was busy at that all the evening and next morning we were off with a fine tenknot breeze in the barque rose of sharon for madeira for five days we made good time and were no great way from the island but on the sixth there fell a calm and we lay without motion on a sea of oil heaving slowly but making not a foot of way  at ten oclock that night emily vansittart and i stood leaning on the starboard railing of the poop with a full moon shining at our backs and casting a black shadow of the barque and of our own two heads upon the shining water from the shadow a broadening path of moonshine stretched away to the lonely skyline flickering and shimmering in the gentle heave of the swell we were talking with bent heads chatting of the calm of the chances of wind of the look of the sky when there came a sudden plop like a rising salmon and there in the clear light john vansittart sprang out of the water and looked up at us  i never saw anything clearer in my life than i saw that man the moon shone full upon him and he was but three oars length away his face was more puffed than when i had seen him last mottled here and there with dark scabs his mouth and eyes open as one who is struck with some overpowering surprise he had some white stuff streaming from his shoulders and one hand was raised to his ear the other crooked across his breast i saw him leap from the water into the air and in the dead calm the waves of his coming lapped up against the sides of the vessel then his figure sank back into the water again and i heard a rending crackling sound like a bundle of brushwood snapping in the fire on a frosty night there were no signs of him when i looked again but a swift swirl and eddy on the still sea still marked the spot where he had been how long i stood there tingling to my fingertips holding up an unconscious woman with one hand clutching at the rail of the vessel with the other was more than i could afterwards tell i had been noted as a man of slow and unresponsive emotions but this time at least i was shaken to the core once and twice i struck my foot upon the deck to be certain that i was indeed the master of my own senses and that this was not some mad prank of an unruly brain as i stood still marvelling the woman shivered opened her eyes gasped and then standing erect with her hands upon the rail looked out over the moonlit sea with a face which had aged ten years in a summer night  you saw his vision she murmured  i saw something  it was he it was john he is dead  i muttered some lame words of doubt  doubtless he died at this hour she whispered in hospital at madeira i have read of such things his thoughts were with me his vision came to me oh my john my dear dear lost john  she broke out suddenly into a storm of weeping and i led her down into her cabin where i left her with her sorrow that night a brisk breeze blew up from the east and in the evening of the next day we passed the two islets of los desertos and dropped anchor at sundown in the bay of funchal the eastern star lay no great distance from us with the quarantine flag flying from her main and her jack halfway up her peak  you see said mrs vansittart quickly she was dryeyed now for she had known how it would be  that night we received permission from the authorities to move on board the eastern star the captain hines was waiting upon deck with confusion and grief contending upon his bluff face as he sought for words with which to break this heavy tidings but she took the story from his lips  i know that my husband is dead she said he died yesterday night about ten oclock in hospital at madeira did he not  the seaman stared aghast no marm he died eight days ago at sea and we had to bury him out there for we lay in a belt of calm and could not say when we might make the land  well those are the main facts about the death of john vansittart and his appearance to his wife somewhere about lat 35 n and long 15 w a clearer case of a wraith has seldom been made out and since then it has been told as such and put into print as such and endorsed by a learned society as such and so floated off with many others to support the recent theory of telepathy for myself i hold telepathy to be proved but i would snatch this one case from amid the evidence and say that i do not think that it was the wraith of john vansittart but john vansittart himself whom we saw that night leaping into the moonlight out of the depths of the atlantic it has ever been my belief that some strange chanceone of those chances which seem so improbable and yet so constantly occurhad becalmed us over the very spot where the man had been buried a week before for the rest the surgeon tells me that the leaden weight was not too firmly fixed and that seven days bring about changes which fetch a body to the surface coming from the depth to which the weight would have sunk it he explains that it might well attain such a velocity as to carry it clear of the water such is my own explanation of the matter and if you ask me what then became of the body i must recall to you that snapping crackling sound with the swirl in the water the shark is a surface feeder and is plentiful in those parts     xii  the lift   flightcommander stangate should have been happy he had come safely through the war without a hurt and with a good name in the most heroic of services he had only just turned thirty and a great career seemed to lie ahead of him above all beautiful mary maclean was walking by his side and he had her promise that she was there for life what could a young man ask for more and yet there was a heavy load upon his heart  he could not explain it himself and endeavoured to reason himself out of it there was the blue sky above him the blue sea in front the beautiful gardens with their throngs of happy pleasureseekers around above all there was that sweet face turned upon him with questioning concern why could he not raise himself to so joyful an environment he made effort after effort but they were not convincing enough to deceive the quick instinct of a loving woman  what is it tom she asked anxiously i can see that something is clouding you do tell me if i can help you in any way  he laughed in shamefaced fashion  it is such a sin to spoil our little outing he said i could kick myself round these gardens when i think of it dont worry my darling for i know the cloud will roll off i suppose i am a creature of nerves though i should have got past that by now the flying service is supposed either to break you or to warrant you for life  it is nothing definite then  no it is nothing definite thats the worst of it you could fight it more easily if it was its just a dead heavy depression here in my chest and across my forehead but do forgive me dear girl what a brute i am to shadow you like this  but i love to share even the smallest trouble  well its gonevamosedvanished we will talk about it no more  she gave him a swift penetrating glance  no no tom your brow shows as well as feels tell me dear have you often felt like this you really look very ill sit here dear in the shade and tell me of it  they sat together in the shadow of the great latticed tower which reared itself six hundred feet high beside them  i have an absurd faculty said he i dont know that i have ever mentioned it to any one before but when imminent danger is threatening me i get these strange forebodings of course it is absurd today in these peaceful surroundings it only shows how queerly these things work but it is the first time that it has deceived me  when had you it before  when i was a lad it seized me one morning i was nearly drowned that afternoon i had it when the burglar came to morton hall and i got a bullet through my coat then twice in the war when i was overmatched and escaped by a miracle i had this strange feeling before ever i climbed into my machine then it lifts quite suddenly like a mist in the sunshine why it is lifting now look at me cant you see that it is so  she could indeed he had turned in a minute from a haggard man to a laughing boy she found herself laughing in sympathy a rush of high spirits and energy had swept away his strange foreboding and filled his whole soul with the vivid dancing joy of youth  thank goodness he cried i think it is your dear eyes that have done it i could not stand that wistful look in them what a silly foolish nightmare it all has been theres an end for ever in my belief in presentiments now dear girl we have just time for one good turn before luncheon after that the gardens get so crowded that it is hopeless to do anything shall we have a side show or the great wheel or the flying boat or what  what about the tower she asked glancing upwards surely that glorious air and the view from the top would drive the last wisps of cloud out of your mind  he looked at his watch  well its past twelve but i suppose we could do it all in an hour but it doesnt seem to be working what about it conductor  the man shook his head and pointed to a little knot of people who were assembled at the entrance  theyve all been waiting sir its hung up but the gear is being overhauled and i expect the signal every minute if you join the others i promise it wont be long  they had hardly reached the group when the steel face of the lift rolled asidea sign that there was hope in the future the motley crowd drifted through the opening and waited expectantly upon the wooden platform they were not numerous for the gardens are not crowded until the afternoon but they were fair samples of the kindly goodhumoured northcountry folk who take their annual holiday at northam their faces were all upturned now and they were watching with keen interest a man who was descending the steel framework it seemed a dangerous precarious business but he came as swiftly as an ordinary mortal upon a staircase  my word said the conductor glancing up jim has got a move on this morning  who is he asked commander stangate  thats jim barnes sir the best workman that ever went on a scaffold he fair lives up there every bolt and rivet are under his care hes a wonder is jim  but dont argue religion with him said one of the group  the attendant laughed  ah you know him then said he no dont argue religion with him  why not asked the officer  well he takes it very hard he does hes the shining light of his sect  it aint hard to be that said the knowing one ive heard there are only six folk in the fold hes one of those who picture heaven as the exact size of their own back street conventicle and every one else left outside it  better not tell him so while hes got that hammer in his hand said the conductor in a hurried whisper hallo jim how goes it this morning  the man slid swiftly down the last thirty feet and then balanced himself on a crossbar while he looked at the little group in the lift as he stood there clad in a leather suit with his pliers and other tools dangling from his brown belt he was a figure to please the eye of an artist the man was very tall and gaunt with great straggling limbs and every appearance of giant strength his face was a remarkable one noble and yet sinister with dark eyes and hair a prominent hooked nose and a beard which flowed over his chest he steadied himself with one knotted hand while the other held a steel hammer dangling by his knee  its all ready aloft said he ill go up with you if i may he sprang down from his perch and joined the others in the lift  i suppose you are always watching it said the young lady  that is what i am engaged for miss from morning to night and often from night to morning i am up here there are times when i feel as if i were not a man at all but a fowl of the air they fly round me the creatures as i lie out on the girders and they cry to me until i find myself crying back to the poor soulless things  its a great charge said the commander glancing up at the wonderful tracery of steel outlined against the deep blue sky  aye sir and there is not a nut nor a screw that is riot in my keeping heres my hammer to ring them true and my spanner to wrench them tight as the lord over the earth so am ieven iover the tower with power of life and power of death aye of death and of life  the hydraulic machinery had begun to work and the lift very slowly ascended as it mounted the glorious panorama of the coast and bay gradually unfolded itself so engrossing was the view that the passengers hardly noticed it when the platform stopped abruptly between stages at the five hundred foot level barnes the workman muttered that something must be amiss and springing like a cat across the gap which separated them from the trelliswork of metal he clambered out of sight the motley little party suspended in midair lost something of their british shyness under such unwonted conditions and began to compare notes with each other one couple who addressed each other as dolly and billy announced to the company that they were the particular stars of the hippodrome bill and kept their neighbours tittering with their rather obvious wit a buxom mother her precocious son and two married couples upon holiday formed an appreciative audience  youd like to be a sailor would you said billy the comedian in answer to some remark of the boy look ere my nipper youll end up as a blooming corpse if you aint careful see im standin at the edge at this hour of the morning i cant bear to watch it  whats the hour got to do with it asked a stout commercial traveller  my nerves are worth nothin before midday why lookin down there and seem those folks like dots puts me all in a twitter my family is all alike in the mornin  i expect said dolly a highcoloured young woman that theyre all alike the evening before  there was a general laugh which was led by the comedian  you got it across that time dolly its ko for battling billystill senseless when last heard of if my family is laughed at ill leave the room  its about time we did said the commercial traveller who was a redfaced choleric person its a disgrace the way they hold us up ill write to the company  wheres the bellpush said billy im goin to ring  what forthe waiter asked the lady  for the conductor the chauffeur whoever it is that drives the old bus up and down have they run out of petrol or broke the mainspring or what  we have a fine view anyhow said the commander  well ive had that remarked billy im done with it and im for getting on  im getting nervous cried the stout mother i do hope there is nothing wrong with the lift  i say hold on to the slack of my coat dolly im going to look over and chance it oh lord it makes me sick and giddy theres a horse down under and it aint bigger than a mouse i dont see any one lookin after us wheres old isaiah the prophet who came up with us  he shinned out of it mighty quick when he thought trouble was coming  look here said dolly looking very perturbed this is a nice thing i dont think here we are five hundred foot up and stuck for the day as like as not im due for the matinée at the hippodrome im sorry for the company if they dont get me down in time for that im billed all over the town for a new song  a new one whats that dolly  a real pot o ginger i tell you its called on the road to ascot ive got a hat four foot across to sing it in  come on dolly lets have a rehearsal while we wait  no no the young lady here wouldnt understand  id be very glad to hear it cried mary maclean please dont let me prevent you  the words were written to the hat i couldnt sing the verses without the hat but theres a nailin good chorus to it    if you want a little mascot   when youre on the way to ascot   try the lady with the cartwheel hat  she had a tuneful voice and a sense of rhythm which set every one nodding try it now all together she cried and the strange little haphazard company sang it with all their lungs  i say said billy that ought to wake somebody up what lets try a shout all together  it was a fine effort but there was no response it was clear that the management down below was quite ignorant or impotent no sound came back to them  the passengers became alarmed the commercial traveller was rather less rubicund billy still tried to joke but his efforts were not well received the officer in his blue uniform at once took his place as rightful leader in a crisis they all looked to him and appealed to him  what would you advise sir you dont think theres any danger of it coming down do you  not the least but its awkward to be stuck here all the same i think i could jump across on to that girder then perhaps i could see what is wrong  no no tom for goodness sake dont leave us  some people have a nerve said billy fancy jumping across a fivehundredfoot drop  i dare say the gentleman did worse things in the war  well i wouldnt do it myselfnot if they starred me in the bills its all very well for old isaiah its his job and i wouldnt do him out of it  three sides of the lift were shut in with wooden partitions pierced with windows for the view the fourth side facing the sea was clear stangate leaned as far as he could and looked upwards as he did so there came from above him a peculiar sonorous metallic twang as if a mighty harpstring had been struck some distance upa hundred feet perhapshe could see a long brown corded arm which was working furiously among the wire cordage above the form was beyond his view but he was fascinated by this bare sinewy arm which tugged and pulled and sagged and stabbed  its all right he said and a general sigh of relief broke from his strange comrades at his words there is some one above us setting things right  its old isaiah said billy stretching his neck round the corner i cant see him but its his arm for a dollar whats he got in his hand looks like a screwdriver or something no by george its a file  as he spoke there came another sonorous twang from above there was a troubled frown upon the officers brow  i say dash it all thats the very sound our steel hawser made when it parted strand by strand at dixmude what the deuce is the fellow about hey there what are you trying to do  the man had ceased his work and was now slowly descending the iron trellis  all right hes coming said stangate to his startled companions its all right mary dont be frightened any of you its absurd to suppose he would really weaken the cord that holds us  a pair of high boots appeared from above then came the leathern breeches the belt with its dangling tools the muscular form and finally the fierce swarthy eagle face of the workman his coat was off and his shirt open showing the hairy chest as he appeared there came another sharp snapping vibration from above the man made his way down in leisurely fashion and then balancing himself upon the crossgirder and leaning against the side piece he stood with folded arms looking from under his heavy black brows at the huddled passengers upon the platform  hallo said stangate whats the matter  the man stood impassive and silent with something indescribably menacing in his fixed unwinking stare  the flying officer grew angry  hallo are you deaf he cried how long do you mean to have us stuck here  the man stood silent there was something devilish in his appearance  ill complain of you my lad said billy in a quivering voice this wont stop here i can promise you  look here cried the officer we have ladies here and you are alarming them why are we stuck here has the machinery gone wrong  you are here said the man because i have put a wedge against the hawser above you  you fouled the line how dared you do such a thing what right have you to frighten the women and put us all to this inconvenience take that wedge out this instant or it will be the worse for you  the man was silent  do you hear what i say why the devil dont you answer is this a joke or what weve had about enough of it i tell you  mary maclean had gripped her lover by the arm in agony of sudden panic  oh tom she cried look at his eyeslook at his horrible eyes the man is a maniac  the workman stirred suddenly into sinister life his dark face broke into writhing lines of passion and his fierce eyes glowed like embers while he shook one long arm in the air  behold he cried those who are mad to the children of this world are in very truth the lords anointed and the dwellers in the inner temple lo i am one who is prepared to testify even to the uttermost for of a verity the day has now come when the humble will be exalted and the wicked will be cut off in their sins  mother mother cried the little boy in terror  there there its all right jack said the buxom woman and then in a burst of womanly wrath what dyou want to make the child cry for youre a pretty man you are  better he should cry now than in the outer darkness let him seek safety while there is yet time  the officer measured the gap with a practised eye it was a good eight feet across and the fellow could push him over before he could steady himself it would be a desperate thing to attempt he tried soothing words once more  see here my lad youve carried this joke too far why should you wish to injure us just shin up and get that wedge out and we will agree to say no more about it  another rending snap came from above  by george the hawser is going cried stangate here stand aside im coming over to see to it  the workman had plucked the hammer from his belt and waved it furiously in the air  stand back young man stand back or comeif you would hasten your end  tom tom for gods sake dont spring help help  the passengers all joined in the cry for aid the man smiled malignantly as he watched them  there is no one to help they could not come if they would you would be wiser to turn to your own souls that ye be not cast to the burning lo strand by strand the cable snaps which holds you there is yet another and with each that goes there is more strain upon the rest five minutes of time and all eternity beyond  a moan of fear rose from the prisoners in the lift stangate felt a cold sweat upon his brow as he passed his arm round the shrinking girl if this vindictive devil could only be coaxed away for an instant he would spring across and take his chance in a handtohand fight  look here my friend we give you best he cried we can do nothing go up and cut the cable if you wish go ondo it now and get it over  that you may come across unharmed having set my hand to the work i will not draw back from it  fury seized the young officer  you devil he cried what do you stand there grinning for ill give you something to grin about give me a stick one of you  the man waved his hammer  come then come to judgment he howled  hell murder you tom oh for gods sake dont if we must die let us die together  i wouldnt try it sir cried billy hell strike you down before you get a footing hold up dolly my dear faintin wont elp us you speak to him miss maybe hell listen to you  why should you wish to hurt us said mary what have we ever done to you surely you will be sorry afterwards if we are injured now do be kind and reasonable and help us to get back to the ground  for a moment there may have been some softening in the mans fierce eyes as he looked at the sweet face which was upturned to him then his features set once more into their grim lines of malice  my hand is set to the work woman it is not for the servant to look back from his task  but why should this be your task  because there is a voice within me which tells me so in the nighttime i have heard it and in the daytime too when i have lain out alone upon the girders and seen the wicked dotting the streets beneath me each busy on his own evil intent john barnes john barnes said the voice you are here that you may give a sign to a sinful generationsuch a sign as shall show them that the lord liveth and that there is a judgment upon sin who am i that i should disobey the voice of the lord  the voice of the devil said stangate what is the sin of this lady or of these others that you should seek their lives  you are as the others neither better nor worse all day they pass me load by load with foolish cries and empty songs and vain babble of voices their thoughts are set upon the things of the flesh too long have i stood aside and watched and refused to testify but now the day of wrath is come and the sacrifice is ready think not that a womans tongue can turn me from my task  it is useless mary cried useless i read death in his eyes  another cord had snapped  repent repent cried the madman one more and it is over  commander stangate felt as if it were all some extraordinary dreamsome monstrous nightmare could it be possible that he after all his escapes of death in warfare was now in the heart of peaceful england at the mercy of a homicidal lunatic and that his dear girl the one being whom he would shield from the very shadow of danger was helpless before this horrible man all his energy and manhood rose up in him for one last effort  here we wont be killed like sheep in the shambles he cried throwing himself against the wooden wall of the lift and kicking with all his force come on boys kick it beat it its only matchboarding and it is giving smash it down well done once more all together there she goes now for the side out with it splendid  first the back and then the side of the little compartment had been knocked out and the splinters dropped down into the abyss barnes danced upon his girder his hammer in the air  strive not he shrieked it avails not the day is surely come  its not two feet from the side girder cried the officer get across quick quick all of you ill hold this devil off he had seized a stout stick from the commercial traveller and faced the madman daring him to spring across  your turn now my friend he hissed come on hammer and all im ready for you  above him he heard another snap and the frail platform began to rock glancing over his shoulder he saw that his companions were all safe upon the side girder a strange line of terrified castaways they appeared as they clung in an ungainly row to the trelliswork of steel but their feet were on the iron support with two quick steps and a spring he was at their side at the same instant the murderer hammer in hand jumped the gap they had one vision of him therea vision which will haunt their dreamsthe convulsed face the blazing eyes the windtossed raven locks for a moment he balanced himself upon the swaying platform the next with a rending crash he and it were gone there was a long silence and then far down the thud and clatter of a mighty fall                                       with white faces the forlorn group clung to the cold steel bars and gazed down into the terrible abyss it was the commander who broke the silence  theyll send for us now its all safe he cried wiping his brow but by jove it was a close call
