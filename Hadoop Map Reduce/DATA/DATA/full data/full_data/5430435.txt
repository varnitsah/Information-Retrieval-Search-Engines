the signpost      don’t talk nonsense     an odd freak   speaking o’ money said the nightwatchman thoughtfully as he selected an empty soapbox on the wharf for a seat the whole world would be different if we all ’ad more of it it would be a brighter and a ’appier place for everybody  he broke off to open a small brass tobaccobox and place a little quid of tobacco tenderly into a pouch in his left cheek critically observing at the same time the efforts of a somewhat large steamer to get alongside the next wharf without blocking up more than three parts of the river he watched it as though the entire operation depended upon his attention and the steamer fast he turned his eyes back again and resumed his theme  of course it’s the being short that sharpens people he admitted thoughtfully the sharpest man i ever knew never ’ad a ha’penny in ’is pocket and the ways ’e had o’ getting other chaps to pay for ’is beer would ha’ made ’is fortin at the law if ’e’d only ’ad the eddication playful little chap ’e was i’ve seen men wot didn’t know ’im stand ’im a pot o’ beer and then foller ’im up the road to see ’im knock down a policeman as ’e’d promised they’d foller ’im to the fust policeman ’e met an’ then ’e’d point them out and say they were goin’ to half kill ’im an’ the policeman ’ud just stroll up an’ ask ’em wot they were ’anging about for but i never ’eard of a chap telling ’im they used to go away struck all of a ’eap he died in the accident ward of the london horsepittle poor chap  he shook his head thoughtfully and ignoring the statement of a watchman at the next wharf that it was a fine evening shifted his quid and laughed rumblingly  the funniest way o’ raising the wind i ever ’eard of he said in explanation was one that ’appened about fifteen years ago i’d just taken my discharge as ab from the north star trading between here and the australian ports and the men wot the thing ’appened to was shipmates o’ mine although on’y firemen  i knows it’s a true story becos i was in it a little bit myself and the other part i ’ad from all of ’em and besides they didn’t see anything funny in it at all or anything out of the way it seemed to them quite a easy way o’ making money and i dessay if it ’ad come off all right i should have thought so too  in about a week arter we was paid off at the albert docks these chaps was all cleaned out and they was all in despair with a thirst wot wasn’t half quenched and a spree wot was on’y in a manner o’ speaking just begun and at the end of that time they came round to a room wot i ’ad to see wot could be done there was four of ’em in all old sam small ginger dick peter russet and a orphan nevy of sam’s whose father and mother was dead the mother ’ad been ’alf nigger an’ ’alf malay when she was living and sam was always pertickler careful to point out that his nevy took arter ’er it was enough to make the pore woman turn in ’er grave to say so but sam used to say that ’e owed it to ’is brother to explain  ’wot’s to be done’ ses peter russet arter they’d all said wot miserable chaps they was an’ ’ow badly sailormen was paid ’we’re all going to sign on in the land’s end but she doesn’t sail for a fortnight wot’s to be done in the meantime for to live’  ’there’s your watch peter’ ses old sam dreamylike ’and there’s ginger’s ring it’s a good job you kep’ that ring ginger we’re all in the same boat mates an’ i on’y wish as i’d got something for the general good it’s ’aving an orphan nevy wot’s kep’ me pore’  ’stow it’ ses the nevy shortlike  ’everything’s agin us’ ses old sam there’s them four green parrots i brought from brazil all dead’  ’so are my two monkeys’ ses peter russet shaking ’is ’ead ’they used to sleep with me too’  they all shook their ’eads then and russet took sam up very sharp for saying that p’r’aps if he ’adn’t slep’ with the monkeys they wouldn’t ha’ died he said if sam knew more about monkeys than wot ’e did why didn’t ’e put ’is money in them instead o’ green parrots wot pulled their feathers out and died of cold  ’talking about monkeys’ ses ginger dick interrupting old sam suddenly ’wot about young beauty here’  ’well wot about him’ ses the nevy in a nasty sort o’ way  ’w’y ’e’s worth forty monkeys an’ millions o’ green parrots’ ses ginger starting up ’an’ here ’e is awasting of ’is opportunities going about dressed like a christian open your mouth beauty and stick your tongue out and roll your eyes a bit’  ’w’y not leave well alone ginger’ ses russet and i thought so too young beauty was quite enough for me without that  ’ter ’blige me’ ses ginger anxiously ’just make yourself as ugly as wot you can beauty’  ’leave ’im alone’ ses old sam as his nevy snarled at ’em ’you ain’t everybody’s money yourself ginger’  ’i tell you mates’ ses ginger speaking very slow and solemn ’there’s a fortin in ’im i was lookin’ at ’im just now trying to think who ’e reminded me of at fust i thought it was that big stuffed monkey we saw at melbourne then i suddenly remembered it was a wild man of borneo i see when i was a kid up in sunderland when i say ’e was a ’andsome good’arted looking gentleman alongside o’ you beauty do you begin to get my meaning’  ’wot’s the idea ginger’ ses sam getting up to lend me and russet a ’and with ’is nevy  ’my idea is this’ ses ginger ’take ’is cloes off ’im and dress ’im up in that there winderblind or something o’ the kind tie ’im up with a bit o’ line and take ’im round to ted reddish in the ’ighway and sell ’im for a ’undered quid as a wild man of borneo’  ’wot’ screams beauty in an awful voice ’let go peter let go d’ye hear’  ’’old your noise beauty while your elders is speaking’ ses ’is uncle and i could see ’e was struck with the idea  ’you jest try dressing me up in a winderblind’ ses his nevy halfcrying with rage  listen to reason beauty’ ses ginger ’you’ll ’ave your share of the tin it’ll only be for a day or two and then when we’ve cleared out you can make your escape and there’ll be twentyfive pounds for each of us’  ’’ow do you make that out ginger’ ses sam in a cold voice  ’fours into a ’undered’ ses ginger  ’ho’ ses sam ’ho indeed i wasn’t aweer that ’e was your nevy ginger’  ’share and share alike’ ses russet ’it’s a very good plan o’ yours ginger’  ginger holds ’is ’ead up and looks at ’im ’ard  ’i thought o’ the plan’ ’e ses speaking very slow and deliberate ’sam’s ’is uncle and ’e’s the wild man threes into a ’undered go—’  ’you needn’t bother your fat ’ead adding up sums ginger’ ses russet very polite ’i’m going to ’ave my share else i’ll split to ted reddish’  none of ’em said a word about me two of ’em was sitting on my bed ginger was using a ’ankerchief o’ mine wot ’e found in the fireplace and peter russet ’ad ’ad a drink out o’ the jug on my washstand and yet they never even mentioned me that’s firemen all over and that’s ’ow it is they get themselves so disliked  it took ’em best part of an ’our to talk round young beauty an’ the langwidge they see fit to use made me thankful to think that the parrots didn’t live to larn it  you never saw anything like beauty when they ’ad finished with ’im if ’e was bad in ’is cloes ’e was a perfeck horror without ’em ginger dick faked ’im up beautiful but there was no pleasing ’im fust he found fault with the winderblind which ’e said didn’t fit then ’e grumbled about going barefoot then ’e wanted somethink to ’ide ’is legs which was natural considering the shape of ’em ginger dick nearly lost ’is temper with ’im and it was all old sam could do to stop himself from casting ’im off forever he was finished at last and arter peter russet ’ad slipped downstairs and found a bit o’ broken clothesprop in the yard and ’e’d been shown ’ow to lean on it and make a noise ginger said as ’ow if ted reddish got ’im for a ’undered pounds ’e’d get ’im a bargain  ’we must ’ave a cab’ ses old sam  ’cab’ ses ginger ’what for’  ’we should ’ave half wapping following us’ ses sam ’go out and put your ring up ginger and fetch a cab’  ginger started grumbling but he went and presently came back with the cab and the money and they all went downstairs leading the wild man by a bit o’ line they only met one party coming up and ’e seemed to remember somethink ’e’d forgotten wot ought to be fetched at once  ginger went out fust and opened the cabdoor and then stood there waiting becos at the last moment the wild man said the winderblind was slipping down they got ’im out at last but before ’e could get in the cab was going up the road at ten miles an hour with ginger ’anging on to the door calling to it to stop  it came back at about a mile an’ a ’alf an hour an’ the remarks of the cabman was eggstrordinary even when he got back ’e wouldn’t start till ’e’d got double fare paid in advance but they got in at last and drove off  there was a fine scene at ted reddish’s door ginger said that if there was a bit of a struggle it would be a good advertisement for ted reddish and they might p’r’aps get more than a ’undered and all the three of ’em could do they couldn’t get the wild man out o’ that cab and the cabman was hopping about ’arf crazy every now and then they’d get the wild man ’arf out and then he’d get in agin and snarl ’e didn’t seem to know when to leave off and ginger and the others got almost as sick of it as the cabman it must ha’ taken two years’ wear out o’ that cab but they got ’im out at last and reddish’s door being open to see what the row was about they went straight in  ’wot’s all this’ ses reddish who was a tall thin man with a dark moustache  it’s a wild man o’ borneo’ ses ginger panting ’we caught ’im in a forest in brazil an’ we’ve come ’ere to give you the fust offer’  ted reddish was so surprised ’e couldn’t speak at fust the wild man seemed to take ’is breath away and ’e looked in a ’elpless kind o’ way at ’is wife who’d just come down she was a nicelookin’ woman fat with a lot o’ yaller hair and she smiled at ’em as though she’d known ’em all their lives  ’come into the parlour’ she ses kindly just as ted was beginning to get ’is breath  they followed ’em in and the wild man was just going to make hisself comfortable in a easychair when ginger give ’im a look an’ ’e curled up on the ’earthrug instead  ’’e ain’t a very fine specimen’ ses ted reddish at last  ’it’s the red sidewhiskers i don’t like’ ses his wife ’besides who ever ’eard of a wild man in a collar an’ necktie’  ’you’ve got hold o’ the wrong one’ ses ted reddish afore ginger dick could speak up for hisself  ’oh i beg your pardin’ ses mrs reddish to ginger very polite ’i thought it was funny a wild man should be wearing a collar it’s my mistake that’s the wild man i s’pose on the ’earthrug’  that’s ’im mum’ ses old sam very short  ’he don’t look wild enough’ ses reddish  ’no ’e’s much too tame’ ses ’is wife shaking her yaller curls  the chaps all looked at each other then and the wild man began to think it was time he did somethink and the nearest thing ’andy being ginger’s leg ’e put ’is teeth into it anybody might ha’ thought ginger was the wild man then the way ’e went on and mrs reddish said that even if he so far forgot hisself as to use sich langwidge afore ’er ’e oughtn’t to before a poor ’eathen animal  ’how much do you want for ’im’ ses ted reddish arter ginger ’ad got ’is leg away and taken it to the winder to look at it  ’one ’undered pounds’ ses old sam  ted reddish looked at ’is wife and they both larfed as though they’d never leave orf  ’why the market price o’ the best wild men is only thirty shillings’ ses reddish wiping ’is eyes ’i’ll give you a pound for ’im’  old sam looked at russet and russet looked at ginger and then they all larfed  ’well there’s no getting over you i can see that’ ses reddish at last ’is he strong’  ’strong strong ain’t the word for it’ ses sam  ’bring ’im to the back and let ’im ’ave a wrestle with one o’ the brown bears ted’ ses ’is wife  ’’e’d kill it’ ses old sam hastily  ’never mind’ ses reddish getting up ’brown bears is cheap enough’  they all got up then none of ’em knowing wot to do except the wild man that is and he got ’is arms tight round the leg o’ the table  ’well’ ses ginger ’we’ll be pleased for ’im to wrestle with the bear but we must ’ave the ’undered quid fust in case ’e injures ’isself a little’  ted reddish looked ’ard at ’im and then he looked at ’is wife agin  i’ll just go outside and talk it over with the missus’ he ses at last and they both got up and went out  ’it’s all right’ ses old sam winking at ginger  ’fair cop’ ses ginger who was still rubbing his leg ’i told you it would be but there’s no need for beauty to overdo it he nearly ’ad a bit out o’ my leg’  ’a’right’ ses the wild man shifting along the ’earthrug to where peter was sitting ’but it don’t do for me to be too tame you ’eard wot she said’  ’how are you feeling old man’ ses peter in a kind voice as ’e tucked ’is legs away under ’is chair  ’gurr’ ses the wild man going on all fours to the back of the chair ’gur—wug—wug——’  ’don’t play the fool beauty’ ses peter with a uneasy smile as he twisted ’is ’ead round ’call ’im off sam’  ’gurr’ ses the wild man sniffing at ’is legs ’gurr’  ’easy on beauty it’s no good biting ’im till they come back’ ses old sam  ’i won’t be bit at all’ ses russet very sharp ’mind that sam it’s my belief beauty’s gone mad’  ’hush’ ses ginger and they ’eard ted reddish and ’is wife coming back they came in sat down agin and after ted ’ad ’ad another good look at the wild man and prodded ’im all over an’ looked at ’is teeth he spoke up and said they’d decided to give a ’undered pun for ’im at the end o’ three days if ’e suited  ’i s’pose’ ses sam looking at the others ’that we could ’ave a bit of it now to go on with’  ’it’s agin our way of doing business’ ses ted reddish ’if it ’ud been a lion or a tiger we could but wild men we never do’  ’the thing is’ ses mrs reddish as the wild man started on russet’s leg and was pulled off by sam and ginger ’where to put ’im’  ’why not put ’im in with the black leopard’ ses her ’usband  ’there’s plenty o’ room in his cage’ says ’is wife thoughtfully ’and it ’ud be company for ’im too’  ’i don’t think the wild man ’ud like that’ ses ginger  ’i’m sartain sure ’e wouldn’t’ says old sam shaking ’is ’ead  ’well we must put ’im in a cage by hisself i s’pose’ ses reddish ’but we can’t be put to much expense i’m sure the money we spent in cat’s meat for the last wild man we ’ad was awful’  ’don’t you spend too much money on cat’s meat for ’im’ ses sam ’’e’d very likely leave it bringing ’im ’ome we used to give ’im the same as we ’ad ourselves and he got on all right’  ’it’s a wonder you didn’t kill ’im’ ses reddish severely ’he’ll be fed very different ’ere i can tell you you won’t know ’im at the end o’ three days’  ’don’t change ’im too sudden’ ses ginger keeping ’is ’ead turned away from the wild man wot wos trying to catch ’is eye ’cook ’is food at fust ’cos ’e’s been used to it’  ’i know wot to give ’im’ ses reddish offhandedly ’i ain’t been in the line twentyseven years for nothink bring ’im out to the back an’ i’ll put ’im in ’is new ’ome’  they all got up and taking no notice of the wild man’s whispers follered ted reddish and ’is wife out to the back where all the wild beasts in the world seemed to ’ave collected to roar out to each other what a beastly place it was  ’i’m going to put ’im in ’appy cottage for a time’ says reddish ’lend a hand ’ere william’ he says beckoning to one of ’is men  ’is that ’appy cottage’ ses old sam sniffing as they got up to a nasty empty cage with a chain and staple in the wall  ted reddish said it was  ’wot makes you call it that’ ses sam  reddish didn’t seem to ’ear ’im and it took all ginger’s coaxing to get beauty to go in  ’it’s on’y for a day or two’ he whispers  ’but ’ow am i to escape when you’ve got the brass’ ses the wild man  ’we’ll look arter that’ ses ginger who ’adn’t got the least idea  the wild man ’ad a little show for the last time jist to impress ted reddish an’ it was pretty to see the way william ’andled ’im the look on the wild man’s face showed as ’ow it was a revelashun to ’im then ’is three mates took a last look at ’im and went off  for the fust day sam felt uneasy about ’im and used to tell us tales about ’is dead brother which made us think beauty was lucky to take arter ’is mother but it wore off and the next night in the admiral cochrane ’e put ’is ’ead on ginger’s shoulder and wep’ for ’appiness as ’e spoke of ’is nevy’s home at ’’appy cottage’  on the third day sam was for going round in the morning for the money but ginger said it wasn’t advisable to show any ’aste so they left it to the evening and peter russet wrote sam a letter signed ’barnum’ offering ’im two ’undered for the wild man in case ted reddish should want to beat ’em down they all ’ad a drink before they went in and was smiling with good temper to sich an extent that they ’ad to wait a minute to get their faces straight afore going in  ’come in’ ses reddish and they follered ’im into the parler where mrs reddish was sitting in a armchair shaking ’er’ ead and looking at the carpet very sorrowful  ’i was afraid you’d come’ she ses in a low voice  ’so was i’ ses reddish  ’what for’ ses old sam it didn’t look much like money and ’e felt cross  ’we’ve ’ad a loss’ ses mrs reddish she touched ’erself and then they see she was all in black and that ted reddish was wearing a black tie and a bit o’ crape round ’is arm  ’sorry to ’ear it mum’ ses old sam  ’it was very sudden too’ ses mrs reddish wiping ’er eyes  ’that’s better than laying long’ ses peter russet comforting like  ginger dick gives a cough ’twentyfive pounds was wot ’e’d come for not to ’ear this sort o’ talk’  ’we’ve been in the wildbeast line sevenan’twenty years’ ses mrs reddish ’and it’s the fust time anythink of this sort ’as ’appened’  ’’ealthy family i s’pose’ ses sam staring  tell ’im ted’ ses mrs reddish in a ’usky whisper  ’no you’ ses ted  ’it’s your place’ ses mrs reddish  ’a woman can break it better’ ses ’er ’usband  ’tell us wot’ ses ginger very snappish  ted reddish cleared ’is throat  ’it wasn’t our fault’ he ses slowly while mrs reddish began to cry agin ’gin’rally speakin’ animals is afraid o’ wild men and night before last as the wild man wot you left on approval didn’t seem to like ’appy cottage’’ we took ’im out an’ put ’im in with the tiger’  ’put him in with the wot’ ses the unfort’nit man’s uncle jumping off ’is chair  ’the tiger’ ses reddish ’we ’eard something in the night but we thought they was only ’aving a little bit of a tiff like in the morning i went down with a bit o’ cold meat for the wild man and i thought at first he’d escaped but looking a little bit closer—’  ’don’t ted’ ses ’is wife ’i can’t bear it’  ’do you mean to tell me that the tiger ’as eat ’im’ screams old sam  ’most of ’im’ ses ted reddish ’but ’e couldn’t ha’ been much of a wild man to let a tiger get the better of ’im i must say i was surprised’  ’we both was’ ses mrs reddish wiping ’er eyes  you might ha’ ’eard a pin drop old sam’s eyes was large and staring peter russet was sucking ’is teeth an’ ginger was wondering wot the law would say to it—if it ’eard of it  ’it’s an unfortunit thing for all parties’ ses ted reddish at last getting up and standing on the ’earthrug  ’’orrible’ ses sam ’uskily ’you ought to ha’ known better than to put ’im in with a tiger wot could you expect w’y it was a mad thing to do’  ’crool thing’ ses peter russet  ’you don’t know the bisness properly’ ses ginger ’that’s about wot it is ’you should ha’ known better than that’  ’well it’s no good making a fuss about it’ ses reddish it was only a wild man arter all and he’d ha’ died anyway cos ’e wouldn’t eat the raw meat we gave ’im and ’is pan o’ water was scarcely touched he’d ha’ starved himself anyhow i’m sorry as i said before but i must be off i’ve got an appointment down at the docks’  he moved towards the door ginger dick gave russet a nudge and whispered something and russet passed it on to sam  what about the ’undered quid’ ses pore beauty’s uncle catching ’old o’ reddish as ’e passed ’im  ’eh’ ses reddish surprised—’oh that’s off’  ’ho’ says sam ’ho is it we want a ’undered quid off of you an’ wot’s more we mean to ’ave it’  ’but the tiger’s ate ’im’ says mrs reddish explaining  ’i know that’ ses sam sharply ’but ’e was our wild man and we want to be paid for ’im you should ha’ been more careful we’ll give you five minutes and if the money ain’t paid by that time we’ll go straight off to the policestation’  ’well go’ ses ted reddish  sam got up very stern and looked at ginger  ’you’ll be ruined if we do’ ses ginger  ’all right’ ses ted reddish comfortably  i’m not sure they can’t ’ang you’ ses russet  ’i ain’t sure either’ says reddish ’and i’d like to know ’ow the law stands in case it ’appens agin’  ’come on sam’ ses ginger ’come straight to the policestation’  he got up and moved towards the door ted reddish didn’t move a muscle but mrs reddish flopped on her knees and caught old sam round the legs and ’eld him so’s ’e couldn’t move  ’spare ’im’ she ses crying  ’lea’ go o’ my legs mum’ ses sam  ’come on sam’ ses ginger ’come to the police’  old sam made a desperit effort and mrs reddish called ’im a crool monster and let go and ’id ’er face on ’er husband’s shoulder as they all moved out of the parlour larfing like a mad thing with hysterics  they moved off slowly not knowing wot to do as of course they knew they daren’t go to the police about it ginger dick’s temper was awful but peter russet said they mustn’t give up all ’ope—he’d write to ted reddish and tell ’im as a friend wot a danger ’e was in old sam didn’t say anything the loss of his nevy and twentyfive pounds at the same time being almost more than ’is ’art could bear and in a slow melancholy fashion they walked back to old sam’s lodgings  ’well what the blazes is up now’ ses ginger dick as they turned the corner  there was three or four ’undered people standing in front of the ’ouse and women’s ’eads out of all the winders screaming their ’ardest for the police and as they got closer they ’eard a incessant knocking it took ’em nearly five minutes to force their way through the crowd and then they nearly went crazy as they saw the wild man with ’alf the winderblind missing but otherwise well and ’arty standing on the step and giving ratatattats at the door for all ’e was worth  they never got to know the rights of it beauty getting so excited every time they asked ’im ’ow he got on that they ’ad to give it up but they began to ’ave a sort of idea at last that ted reddish ’ad been ’aving a game with ’em and that mrs reddish was worse than wot ’e was     a garden plot   the ablebodied men of the village were at work the children were at school singing the multiplicationtable lullaby while the wives and mothers at home nursed the baby with one hand and did the housework with the other at the end of the village an old man past work sat at a rough deal table under the creaking signboard of the cauliflower gratefully drinking from a mug of ale supplied by a chance traveller who sat opposite him  the shade of the elms was pleasant and the ale good the traveller filled his pipe and glancing at the dusty hedges and the white road baking in the sun called for the mugs to be refilled and pushed his pouch towards his companion after which he paid a compliment to the appearance of the village  it ain’t what it was when i was a boy quavered the old man filling his pipe with trembling fingers i mind when the grindstone was stuck just outside the winder o’ the forge instead o’ being one side as it now is and as for the shop winder—it’s twice the size it was when i was a young ’un  he lit his pipe with the scientific accuracy of a smoker of sixty years’ standing and shook his head solemnly as he regarded his altered birthplace then his colour heightened and his dim eye flashed  it’s the people about ’ere ’as changed more than the place ’as he said with sudden fierceness there’s a set o’ men about here nowadays as are no good to anybody reg’lar raskels and if you’ve the mind to listen i can tell you of one or two as couldn’t be beat in london itself  there’s tom adams for one he went and started wot ’e called a benevolent club threepence a week each we paid agin sickness or accident and tom was secretary three weeks arter the club was started he caught a chill and was laid up for a month he got back to work a week and then ’e sprained something in ’is leg and arter that was well ’is inside went wrong we didn’t think much of it at first not understanding figures but at the end o’ six months the club hadn’t got a farthing and they was in tom’s debt one pound seventeenandsix  he isn’t the only one o’ that sort in the place either there was herbert richardson he went to town and came back with the idea of a goose club for christmas we paid twopence a week into that for pretty near ten months and then herbert went back to town agin and all we ’ear of ’im through his sister is that he’s still there and doing well and don’t know when he’ll be back  but the artfullest and worst man in this place—and that’s saying a good deal mind you—is bob pretty deep is no word for ’im there’s no way of being up to ’im it’s through ’im that we lost our flower show and if you’d like to ’ear the rights o’ that i don’t suppose there’s anybody in this place as knows as much about it as i do—barring bob hisself that is but ’e wouldn’t tell it to you as plain as i can  we’d only ’ad the flower show one year and little anybody thought that the next one was to be the last the first year you might smell the place a mile off in the summer and on the day of the show people came from a long way round and brought money to spend at the cauliflower and other places  it was started just after we got our new parson and mrs pawlett the parson’s wife ’is name being pawlett thought as she’d encourage men to love their ’omes and be better ’usbands by giving a prize every year for the best cottage garden three pounds was the prize and a metal teapot with writing on it  as i said we only ’ad it two years the fust year the garden as got it was a picter and bill chambers ’im as won the prize used to say as ’e was out o’ pocket by it taking ’is time and the money ’e spent on flowers not as we believed that you understand ’specially as bill did ’is very best to get it the next year too ’e didn’t get it and though p’r’aps most of us was glad ’e didn’t we was all very surprised at the way it turned out in the end  the flower show was to be ’eld on the 5th o’ july just as a’most everything about here was at its best on the 15th of june bill chambers’s garden seemed to be leading but peter smith and joe gubbins and sam jones and henery walker was almost as good and it was understood that more than one of ’em had got a surprise which they’d produce at the last moment too late for the others to copy we used to sit up here of an evening at this cauliflower publichouse and put money on it i put mine on henery walker and the time i spent in ’is garden ’elping ’im is a sin and a shame to think of  of course some of ’em used to make fun of it and bob pretty was the worst of ’em all he was always a lazy goodfornothing man and ’is garden was a disgrace he’d chuck down any rubbish in it old bones old tins bits of an old bucket anything to make it untidy he used to larf at ’em awful about their gardens and about being took up by the parson’s wife nobody ever see ’im do any work real ’ard work but the smell from ’is place at dinnertime was always nice and i believe that he knew more about game than the parson hisself did  it was the day arter this one i’m speaking about the 16th o’ june that the trouble all began and it came about in a very eggstrordinary way george english a quiet man getting into years who used when ’e was younger to foller the sea and whose only misfortin was that ’e was a brotherinlaw o’ bob pretty’s his sister marrying bob while ’e was at sea and knowing nothing about it ’ad a letter come from a mate of his who ’ad gone to australia to live he’d ’ad letters from australia before as we all knew from miss wicks at the postoffice but this one upset him altogether he didn’t seem like to know what to do about it  while he was wondering bill chambers passed he always did pass george’s ’ouse about that time in the evening it being on ’is way ’ome and he saw george standing at ’is gate with a letter in ’is ’and looking very puzzled  ’evenin’ george’ ses bill  ’evenin’’ ses george  ’not bad news i ’ope’ ses bill noticing ’is manner and thinking it was strange  ’no’ ses george ’i’ve just ’ad a very eggstrordinary letter from australia’ he ses ’that’s all’  bill chambers was always a very inquisitive sort o’ man and he stayed and talked to george until george arter fust making him swear oaths that ’e wouldn’t tell a soul took ’im inside and showed ’im the letter  it was more like a storybook than a letter george’s mate john biggs by name wrote to say that an uncle of his who had just died on ’is deathbed told him that thirty years ago he ’ad been in this very village staying at this ’ere very cauliflower whose beer we’re drinking now in the night when everybody was asleep he got up and went quietlike and buried a bag of five hundred and seventeen sovereigns and one halfsovereign in one of the cottage gardens till ’e could come for it agin he didn’t say ’ow he come by the money and when bill spoke about that george english said that knowing the man he was afraid ’e ’adn’t come by it honest but anyway his friend john biggs wanted it and wot was more ’ad asked ’im in the letter to get it for ’im  ’and wot i’m to do about it bill’ he ses i don’t know all the directions he gives is that ’e thinks it was the tenth cottage on the right’and side of the road coming down from the cauliflower he thinks it’s the tenth but ’e’s not quite sure do you think i’d better make it known and offer a reward of ten shillings say to any one who finds it’  ’no’ ses bill shaking ’is ’ead ’i should hold on a bit if i was you and think it over i shouldn’t tell another single soul if i was you’  ’i be’leeve you’re right’ ses george ’john biggs would never forgive me if i lost that money for ’im you’ll remember about keeping it secret bill’  bill swore he wouldn’t tell a soul and ’e went off ’ome and ’ad his supper and then ’e walked up the road to the cauliflower and back and then up and back again thinking over what george ’ad been telling ’im and noticing what ’e ’d never taken the trouble to notice before that ’is very house was the tenth one from the cauliflower  mrs chambers woke up at two o’clock next morning and told bill to get up further and then found ’e wasn’t there she was rather surprised at first but she didn’t think much of it and thought what happened to be true that ’e was busy in the garden it being a light night she turned over and went to sleep again and at five when she woke up she could distinctly ’ear bill working ’is ’ardest then she went to the winder and nearly dropped as she saw bill in his shirt and trousers digging away like mad a quarter of the garden was all dug up and she shoved open the winder and screamed out to know what ’e was doing  bill stood up straight and wiped ’is face with his shirtsleeve and started digging again and then his wife just put something on and rushed downstairs as fast as she could go  ’what on earth are you adoing of bill’ she screams  ’go indoors’ ses bill still digging  ’have you gone mad’ she ses halfcrying  bill just stopped to throw a lump of mould at her and then went on digging till henery walker who also thought ’e ’ad gone mad and didn’t want to stop ’im too soon put ’is ’ead over the ’edge and asked ’im the same thing  ’ask no questions and you’ll ’ear no lies and keep your ugly face your own side of the ’edge’ ses bill ’take it indoors and frighten the children with’ he ses ’i don’t want it staring at me’  henery walked off offended and bill went on with his digging he wouldn’t go to work and ’e ’ad his breakfast in the garden and his wife spent all the morning in the front answering the neighbours’ questions and begging of ’em to go in and say something to bill one of ’em did go and came back a’most directly and stood there for hours telling diff’rent people wot bill ’ad said to ’er and asking whether ’e couldn’t be locked up for it  by teatime bill was deadbeat and that stiff he could ’ardly raise ’is bread and butter to his mouth several o’ the chaps looked in in the evening but all they could get out of ’im was that it was a new way o’ cultivating ’is garden ’e ’ad just ’eard of and that those who lived the longest would see the most by nighttime ’e’d nearly finished the job and ’is garden was just ruined  afore people ’ad done talking about bill i’m blest if peter smith didn’t go and cultivate ’is garden in exactly the same way the parson and ’is wife was away on their ’oliday and nobody could say a word the curate who ’ad come over to take ’is place for a time and who took the names of people for the flower show did point out to ’im that he was spoiling ’is chances but peter was so rude to ’im that he didn’t stay long enough to say much  when joe gubbins started digging up ’is garden people began to think they were all bewitched and i went round to see henery walker to tell ’im wot a fine chance ’e’d got and to remind ’im that i’d put another ninepence on ’im the night before all ’e said was ’more fool you’ and went on digging a ’ole in his garden big enough to put a ’ouse in  in a fortnight’s time there wasn’t a garden worth looking at in the place and it was quite clear there’d be no flower show that year and of all the silly badtempered men in the place them as ’ad dug up their pretty gardens was the wust  it was just a few days before the day fixed for the flower show and i was walking up the road when i see joe and henery walker and one or two more leaning over bob pretty’s fence and talking to ’im i stopped too to see what they were looking at and found they was watching bob’s two boys aweeding of ’is garden it was a disgraceful untidy sort of place as i said before with a few marigolds and nasturtiums and sichlike put in anywhere and bob was walking up and down smoking of ’is pipe and watching ’is wife hoe atween the plants and cut off dead marigold blooms  ’that’s a pretty garden you’ve got there bob’ ses joe grinning  i’ve seen wuss’ ses bob  ’going in for the flower show bob’ ses henery with a wink at us  ’o’ course i am’ ses bob ’olding ’is’ ead up ’my marigolds ought to pull me through’ he ses  henery wouldn’t believe it at first but when he saw bob show ’is missus ’ow to pat the path down with the back o’ the spade and hold the nails for ’er while she nailed a climbing nasturtium to the fence he went off and fetched bill chambers and one or two others and they all leaned over the fence breathing their ’ardest and asaying of all the nasty things to bob they could think of  ’it’s the bestkep’ garden in the place’ ses bob ’i ain’t afraid o’ your new way o’ cultivating flowers bill chambers oldfashioned ways suit me best i learnt ’ow to grow flowers from my father’  ’you ain’t ’ad the cheek to give your name in bob’ ses sam jones staring  bob didn’t answer ’im tick those bits o’ grass out o’ the path old gal’ he ses to ’is wife ’they look untidy and untidiness i can’t abear’  he walked up and down smoking ’is pipe and pretending not to notice henery walker wot ’ad moved farther along the fence and was staring at some drabbletailedlooking geraniums as if ’e’d seen ’em afore but wasn’t quite sure where  ’admiring my geraniums henery’ ses bob at last  ’where’d you get ’em’ ses henery ’ardly able to speak  ’my florist’s’ ses bob in a offhand manner  ’your wot asks henery  ’my florist’ ses bob  ’and who might ’e be when ’e’s at home’ asked henery  ’’tain’t so likely i’m going to tell you that’ ses bob ’be reasonable henery and ask yourself whether it’s likely i should tell you ’is name why i’ve never seen sich fine geraniums afore i’ve been nursing ’em inside all the summer and just planted ’em out’  ’about two days arter i threw mine over my back fence’ ses henery walker speaking very slowly  ’ho’ ses bob surprised ’i didn’t know you ’ad any geraniums henery i thought you was digging for gravel this year’  henery didn’t answer ’im not because ’e didn’t want to mind you but because he couldn’t  ’that one’ ses bob pointing at a broken geranium with the stem of ’is pipe ’is a dook o’ wellington and that white one there is wot i’m going to call pretty’s pride that fine marigold over there wot looks like a sunflower is called golden dreams’  ’come along henery’ ses bill chambers bursting ’come and get something to take the taste out of your mouth’  ’i’m sorry i can’t offer you a flower for your button’ole’ ses bob perlitely ’but it’s getting so near the flower show now i can’t afford it if you chaps only knew wot pleasure was to be ’ad sitting among your innercent flowers you wouldn’t want to go to the publichouse so often’  he shook ’is ’ead at ’em and telling his wife to give the ’dook o’ wellington’ a mug of water sat down in the chair agin and wiped the sweat off ’is brow  bill chambers did a bit o’ thinking as they walked up the road and by and by ’e turns to joe gubbins and ’e ses  ’seen anything o’ george english lately joe’  ’yes’ ses joe  ’seems to me we all ’ave’ ses sam jones  none of ’em liked to say wot was in their minds ’aving all seen george english and swore pretty strong not to tell his secret and none of ’em liking to own up that they’d been digging up their gardens to get money as ’e’d told ’em about but presently bill chambers ses  ’without telling no secrets or breaking no promises joe supposing a certain ’ouse was mentioned in a certain letter from forrin parts wot ’ouse was it’  ’supposing it was so’ ses joe careful too ’the second ’ouse counting from the cauliflower’  ’the ninth ’ouse you mean’ ses henery walker sharply  ’second ’ouse in mill lane you mean’ ses sam jones wot lived there  then they all see ’ow they’d been done and that they wasn’t in a manner o’ speaking referring to the same letter they came up and sat ’ere where we’re sitting now all dazedlike it wasn’t only the chance o’ losing the prize that upset ’em but they’d wasted their time and ruined their gardens and got called mad by the other folks henery walker’s state o’ mind was dreadful for to see and he kep’ thinking of ’orrible things to say to george english and then being afraid they wasn’t strong enough  while they was talking who should come along but george english hisself he came right up to the table and they all sat back on the bench and stared at ’im fierce and henery walker crinkled ’is nose at him  ’evening’ he ses but none of ’em answered im they all looked at henery to see wot ’e was going to say  ’wot’s up’ ses george in surprise  ’gardens’ ses henery  ’so i’ve ’eard’ ses george  he shook ’is ’ead and looked at them sorrowful and severe at the same time  ’so i ’eard and i couldn’t believe my ears till i went and looked for myself’ he ses ’and wot i want to say is this you know wot i’m referring to if any man ’as found wot don’t belong to him ’e knows who to give it to it ain’t wot i should ’ave expected of men wot’s lived in the same place as me for years talk about honesty’ ’e ses shaking ’is ’ead agin ’i should like to see a little of it’  peter smith opened his mouth to speak and ’ardly knowing wot ’e was doing took a pull at ’is beer at the same time and if sam jones ’adn’t been by to thump ’im on the back i b’lieve he’d ha’ died there and then  ’mark my words’ ses george english speaking very slow and solemn ’there’ll be no blessing on it whoever’s made ’is fortune by getting up and digging ’is garden over won’t get no real benefit from it he may wear a black coat and new trousers on sunday but ’e won’t be ’appy i’ll go and get my little taste o’ beer somewhere else’ ’e ses ’i can’t breathe here’  he walked off before any one could say a word bill chambers dropped ’is pipe and smashed it henery walker sat staring after ’im with ’is mouth wide open and sam jones who was always one to take advantage drank ’is own beer under the firm belief that it was joe’s  ’i shall take care that mrs pawlett ’ears o’ this’ ses henery at last  ’and be asked wot you dug your garden up for’ ses joe ’and ’ave to explain that you broke your promise to george why she’d talk at us for years and years’  ’and parson ’ud preach a sermon about it’ ses sam ’where’s your sense henery’  ’we should be the larfingstock for miles round’ ses bill chambers ’if anybody wants to know i dug my garden up to enrich the soil for next year and also to give some other chap a chance of the prize’  peter smith ’as always been a unfortunit man he’s got the name for it he was just ’aving another drink as bill said that and this time we all thought ’e’d gorn he did hisself  mrs pawlett and the parson came ’ome next day an’ ’er voice got that squeaky with surprise it was painful to listen to her all the chaps stuck to the tale that they’d dug their garden up to give the others a chance and henery walker ’e went further and said it was owing to a sermon on unselfishness wot the curate ’ad preached three weeks afore he ’ad a nice little redcovered ’ymnbook the next day with ’from a friend’ wrote in it  all things considered mrs pawlett was for doing away with the flower show that year and giving two prizes next year instead but one or two other chaps encouraged by bob’s example ’ad given in their names too and they said it wouldn’t be fair to their wives all the gardens but one was worse than bob’s they not having started till later than wot ’e did and not being able to get their geraniums from ’is florist the only better garden was ralph thomson’s who lived next door to ’im but two nights afore the flower show ’is pig got walking in its sleep ralph said it was a mystery to ’im ’ow the pig could ha’ got out it must ha’ put its foot through a hole too small for it and turned the button of its door and then climbed over a fourfoot fence he told bob ’e wished the pig could speak but bob said that that was sinful and unchristian of ’im and that most likely if it could it would only call ’im a lot o’ bad names and ask ’im why he didn’t feed it properly  there was quite a crowd on flower show day following the judges first of all to bill chambers’s astonishment and surprise they went to ’is place and stood on the ’eaps in ’is garden judging ’em while bill peeped at ’em through the kitchen winder ’arfcrazy they went to every garden in the place until one of the young ladies got tired of it and asked mrs pawlett whether they was there to judge cottage gardens or earthquakes  everybody ’eld their breaths that evening in the school room when mrs pawlett got up on the platform and took a slip of paper from one of the judges she stood a moment waiting for silence and then ’eld up her ’and to stop what she thought was clapping at the back but which was two or three wimmen who ’ad ’ad to take their crying babies out trying to quiet ’em in the porch then mrs pawlett put ’er glasses on her nose and just read out short and sweet that the prize of three sovereigns and a metal teapot for the bestkept cottage garden ’ad been won by mr robert pretty  one or two people patted bob on the back as ’e walked up the middle to take the prize then one or two more did and bill chambers’s pat was the ’eartiest of ’em all bob stopped and spoke to ’im about it  you would ’ardly think that bob ’ud have the cheek to stand up there and make a speech but ’e did he said it gave ’im great pleasure to take the teapot and the money and the more pleasure because ’e felt that ’e had earned ’em he said that if ’e told ’em all ’e’d done to make sure o’ the prize they’d be surprised he said that ’e’d been like ralph thomson’s pig up early and late  he stood up there talking as though ’e was never going to leave off and said that ’e hoped as ’is example would be of benefit to ’is neighbours some of ’em seemed to think that digging was everything but ’e could say with pride that ’e ’adn’t put a spade to ’is garden for three years until a week ago and then not much  he finished ’is remarks by saying that ’e was going to give a teaparty up at the cauliflower to christen the teapot where ’e’d be pleased to welcome all friends quite a crowd got up and followed ’im out then instead o’ waiting for the dissolving views and came back ’arf an hour arterwards saying that until they’d got as far as the cauliflower they’d no idea as bob was so pertikler who ’e mixed with  that was the last flower show we ever ’ad in claybury mrs pawlett and the judges meeting the teaparty coming ’ome and ’aving to get over a gate into a field to let it pass what with that and mrs pawlett tumbling over something further up the road which turned out to be the teapot smelling strong of beer the flower show was given up and the parson preached three sundays running on the sin of beerdrinking to children who’d never ’ad any and wimmen who couldn’t get it     private clothes   at halfpast nine the crew of the merman were buried in slumber at nine thirtytwo three of the members were awake with heads protruding out of their bunks trying to peer through the gloom while the fourth dreamt that a teatray was falling down a neverending staircase on the floor of the forecastle something was cursing prettily and rubbing itself  did you ’ear anything ted inquired a voice in an interval of silence  who is it demanded ted ignoring the question wot d’yer want  i’ll let you know who i am said a thick and angry voice i’ve broke my blarsted back  light the lamp bill said ted  bill struck a tandsticker match and carefully nursing the tiny sulphurous flame with his hand saw dimly some highcoloured object on the floor  he got out of his bunk and lit the lamp and an angry and very drunken member of her majesty’s foot forces became visible  wot are you doin’ ’ere inquired ted sharply this ain’t the guardroom  who knocked me over demanded the soldier sternly take your co—coat off lik’ a man  he rose to his feet and swayed unsteadily to and fro  if you keep your li’l’ ’eads still he said gravely to bill i’ll punch ’em  by a stroke of good fortune he selected the real head and gave it a blow which sent it crashing against the woodwork for a moment the seaman stood gathering his scattered senses then with an oath he sprang forward and in the lightest of fighting trim waited until his adversary who was by this time on the floor again should have regained his feet  he’s drunk bill said another voice don’t ’urt ’im he’s a chap wot said ’e was coming aboard to see me—i met ’im in the green man this evening you was coming to see me mate wasn’t you  the soldier looked up stupidly and gripping hold of the injured bill by the shirt staggered to his feet again and advancing towards the last speaker let fly suddenly in his face  sort man i am he said autobiographically feel my arm  the indignant bill took him by both and throwing himself upon him suddenly fell with him to the floor the intruder’s head met the boards with a loud crash and then there was silence  you ain’t killed ’im bill said an old seaman stooping over him anxiously  course not was the reply give us some water  he threw some in the soldier’s face and then poured some down his neck but with no result then he stood upright and exchanged glances of consternation with his friends  i don’t like the way he’s breathing he said in a trembling voice  you always was pertikler bill said the cook who had thankfully got to the bottom of his staircase if i was you—  he was not allowed to proceed any further footsteps and a voice were heard above and as old thomas hastily extinguished the lamp the mate’s head was thrust down the scuttle and the mate’s voice sounded a profane reveillé  wot are we goin’ to do with it inquired ted as the mate walked away  i’m ted said bill nervously he’s alive all right  if we put ’im ashore an’ ’e’s dead said old thomas there’ll be trouble for somebody better let ’im be and if ’e’s dead why we don’t none of us know nothing about it  the men ran up on deck and bill being the last to leave put a boot under the soldier’s head before he left ten minutes later they were under way and standing about the deck discussed the situation in thrilling whispers as opportunity offered  at breakfast by which time they were in a dirty tumbling sea with the nore lightship a brown forlornlooking object on their beam the soldier who had been breathing stertorously raised his heavy head from the boot and with glassy eyes and tightly compressed lips gazed wonderingly about him  wot cheer mate said the delighted bill ’ow goes it  where am i inquired private harry bliss in a weak voice  brig merman said bill bound for bystermouth  well i’m damned said private bliss it’s a blooming miracle open the winder it’s a bit stuffy down here who—who brought me here  you come to see me last night said bob an’ fell down i s’pose then you punched bill ’ere in the eye and me in the jor  mr bliss still feeling very sick and faint turned to bill and after critically glancing at the eye turned on him for inspection transferred his regards to the other man’s jaw  i’m a devil when i’m boozed he said in a satisfied voice well i must get ashore i shall get cells for this i expect  he staggered to the ladder and with unsteady haste gained the deck and made for the side the heaving waters made him giddy to look at and he gazed for preference at a thin line of coast stretching away in the distance  the startled mate who was steering gave him a hail but he made no reply a little fishingboat was jumping about in a way to make a seasick man crazy and he closed his eyes with a groan  then the skipper aroused by the mate’s hail came up from below and walking up to him put a heavy hand on his shoulder  what are you doing aboard this ship he demanded austerely  go away said private bliss faintly take your paw off my tunic you’ll spoil it  he clung miserably to the side leaving the incensed skipper to demand explanations from the crew the crew knew nothing about him and said that he must have stowed himself away in an empty bunk the skipper pointed out coarsely that there were no empty bunks whereupon bill said that he had not occupied his the previous evening but had fallen asleep sitting on the locker and had injured his eye against the corner of a bunk in consequence in proof whereof he produced the eye  look here old man said private bliss who suddenly felt better he turned and patted the skipper on the back you just turn to the left a bit and put me ashore will you  i’ll put you ashore at bystermouth said the skipper with a grin you’re a deserter that’s what you are and i’ll take care you’re took care of  you put me ashore roared private bliss with a very fine imitation of the sergeantmajor’s parade voice  get out and walk said the skipper contemptuously over his shoulder as he walked off  here said mr bliss unbuckling his belt hold my tunic one of you i’ll learn ’im  before the paralysed crew could prevent him he had flung his coat into bill’s arms and followed the master of the merman aft as a lightweight he was rather fancied at the gymnasium and in the all too brief exhibition which followed he displayed fine form and a knowledge of anatomy which even the skipper’s tailor was powerless to frustrate  the frenzy of the skipper as ted assisted him to his feet and he saw his antagonist struggling in the arms of the crew was terrible to behold strong men shivered at his words but mr bliss addressing him as whiskers told him to call his crew off and to come on and shaping as well as two pairs of brawny arms round his middle would permit endeavoured in vain to reach him  this said the skipper bitterly as he turned to the mate is what you an’ me have to pay to keep up i wouldn’t let you go now my lad not for a fi’ pun’ note deserter that’s what you are  he turned and went below and private bliss after an insulting address to the mate was hauled forward struggling fiercely and seated on the deck to recover the excitement passed he lost his colour again and struggling into his tunic went and brooded over the side  by dinnertime his faintness had passed and he sniffed with relish at the smell from the galley the cook emerged bearing dinner to the cabin then he returned and took a fine smoking piece of boiled beef flanked with carrots down to the forecastle private bliss eyed him wistfully and his mouth watered  for a time pride struggled with hunger then pride won a partial victory and he descended carelessly to the forecastle  can any o’ you chaps lend me a pipe o’ baccy he asked cheerfully  bill rummaged in his pocket and found a little tobacco in a twist of paper  bad thing to smoke on a empty stomach he said with his mouth full  ’tain’t my fault it’s empty said private bliss pathetically  tain’t mine said bill  i’ve ’eard said the cook who was a tenderhearted man as ’ow it’s a good thing to go for a day or so without food sometimes  who said so inquired private bliss hotly  diff’rent people replied the cook  you can tell ’em from me they’re blamed fools said mr bliss  there was an uncomfortable silence mr bliss lit his pipe but it did not seem to draw well  did you like that pot o’ sixhalf i stood you last night he inquired somewhat pointedly of bob  bob hesitated and looked at his plate  no it was a bit flat he said at length  well i won’t stop you chaps at your grub said private bliss bitterly as he turned to depart  you’re not stopping us said ted cheerfully i’d offer you a bit only—  only what demanded the other  skipper’s orders said ted he ses we’re not to he ses if we do it’s helping a deserter and we’ll all get six months  but you’re helping me by having me on board said private bliss besides i don’t want to desert  we couldn’t ’elp you coming aboard said bill that’s wot the old man said but ’e ses we can ’elp giving of him vittles he ses  well have i got to starve demanded the horrorstricken mr bliss  look ’ere said bill frankly go and speak to the old man it’s no good talking to us go and have it out with him  private bliss thanked him and went on deck old thomas was at the wheel and a pleasant clatter of knives and forks came up through the open skylight of the cabin ignoring the old man who waved him away he raised the open skylight still higher and thrust his head in  go away bawled the skipper pausing with his knife in his fist as he caught sight of him  i want to know where i’m to have my dinner bawled back the thoroughly roused mr bliss  your dinner said the skipper with an air of surprise why i didn’t know you ’ad any  private bliss took his head away and holding it very erect took in his belt a little and walked slowly up and down the deck then he went to the watercask and took a long drink and an hour later a generous message was received from the skipper that he might have as many biscuits as he liked  on this plain fare private bliss lived the whole of that day and the next snatching a few hours’ troubled sleep on the locker at nights his peace of mind was by no means increased by the information of ted that bystermouth was a garrison town and feeling that in spite of any explanation he would be treated as a deserter he resolved to desert in good earnest at the first opportunity that offered  by the third day nobody took any notice of him and his presence on board was almost forgotten until bob going down to the forecastle created a stir by asking somewhat excitedly what had become of him  he’s on deck i s’pose said the cook who was having a pipe  he’s not said bob solemnly  he’s not gone overboard i s’pose said bill starting up  touched by this morbid suggestion they went up on deck and looked round private bliss was nowhere to be seen and ted who was steering had heard no splash he seemed to have disappeared by magic and the cook after a hurried search ventured aft and descending to the cabin mentioned his fears to the skipper  nonsense said that gentleman sharply i’ll lay i’ll find him  he came on deck and looked round followed at a respectful distance by the crew but there was no sign of mr bliss  then an idea a horrid idea occurred to the cook the colour left his cheeks and he gazed helplessly at the skipper  what is it bawled the latter  the cook incapable of speech raised a trembling hand and pointed to the galley the skipper started and rushing to the door drew it hastily back  mr bliss had apparently finished though he still toyed languidly with his knife and fork as though loath to put them down a halfemptied saucepan of potatoes stood on the floor by his side and a bone with a small fragment of meat adhering was between his legs on a saucepan lid which served as a dish  rather underdone cook he said severely as he met that worthy’s horrorstricken gaze  is that the cabin’s or the men’s he’s eaten vociferated the skipper  cabin’s replied mr bliss before the cook could speak it looked the best now has anybody got a nice seegar  he drew back the door the other side of the galley as he spoke and went out that way a move was made towards him but he backed and picking up a handspike swung it round his head  let him be said the skipper in a choking voice let him be he’ll have to answer for stealing my dinner when i get ’im ashore cook take the men’s dinner down into the cabin i’ll talk to you by and by  he walked aft and disappeared below while private bliss still fondling the handspike listened unmoved to a lengthy vituperation which bill called a plain and honest opinion of his behaviour  it’s the last dinner you’ll ’ave for some time he concluded spitefully it’ll be skilly for you when you get ashore  mr bliss smiled and fidgeting with his tongue asked him for the loan of his toothpick  you won’t be using it yourself he urged now you go below all of you and start on the biscuits there’s good men it’s no use standing there saying a lot o’ bad words what i left off when i was four years old  he filled his pipe with some tobacco he had thoughtfully borrowed from the cook before dinner and dropping into a negligent attitude on the deck smoked placidly with his eyes halfclosed the brig was fairly steady and the air hot and slumberous and with an easy assurance that nobody would hit him while in that position he allowed his head to fall on his chest and dropped off into a light sleep  it became evident to him the following afternoon that they were nearing bystermouth the skipper contented himself with eyeing him with an air of malicious satisfaction but the crew gratified themselves by painting the horrors of his position in strong colors private bliss affected indifference but listened eagerly to all they had to say with the air of a general considering his enemy’s plans  it was a source of disappointment to the crew that they did not arrive until after nightfall and the tide was already too low for them to enter the harbour they anchored outside and private bliss despite his position felt glad as he smelt the land again and saw the twinkling lights and houses ashore he could even hear the clatter of a belated vehicle driving along the seafront lights on the summits of the heights in the background indicated so bill said the position of the fort  to the joy of the men he partly broke down in the forecastle that night and in tropical language severally blamed his parents the school board and the army for not having taught him to swim the last thing that bill heard ere sleep closed his lids was a pious resolution on the part of mr bliss to the effect that all his children should be taught the art of natation as soon as they were born  bill woke up just before six and hearing a complaining voice thought at first that his military friend was still speaking the voice got more and more querulous with occasional excursions into the profane and the seaman rubbing his eyes turned his head and saw old thomas groping about the forecastle  wot’s the matter with you old ’un he demanded  i can’t find my trousis grumbled the old man  did you ’ave ’em on larst night inquired bill who was still half asleep  course i did you fool said the other snappishly  be civil said bill calmly be civil are you sure you haven’t got ’em on now  the old man greeted this helpful suggestion with such a volley of abuse that bill lost his temper  p’r’aps somebody’s got ’em on their bed thinking they was a patchwork quilt he said coldly it’s a mistake anybody might make have you got the jacket  i ain’t got nothing replied the bewildered old man ’cept wot i stand up in  that ain’t much said bill frankly where’s that blooming sojer he demanded suddenly  i don’t know where ’e is and i don’t care replied the old man on deck i s’pose  p’r’aps ’e’s got ’em on said the unforgiving bill ’e didn’t seem a very pertikler sort of chap  the old man started and hurriedly ascended to the deck he was absent two or three minutes and when he returned consternation was writ large upon his face  he’s gone he spluttered there ain’t a sign of ’im about and the lifebelt wot hangs on the galley ’as gone too wot am i to do  well they was very old cloes said bill soothingly an’ you ain’t a bad figger not for your time o’ life thomas  there’s many a woodenlegged man ’ud be glad to change with you affirmed ted who had been roused by the noise you’ll soon get over the feeling o’ shyness thomas  the forecastle laughed encouragingly and thomas who had begun to realise the position joined in he laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks and his excitement began to alarm his friends  don’t be a fool thomas said bob anxiously  i can’t help it said the old man struggling hysterically it’s the best joke i’ve heard  he’s gone dotty said ted solemnly i never ’eard of a man larfing like that a ’cos he’d lorst ’is cloes  i’m not larfing at that said thomas regaining his composure by a great effort i’m larfing at a joke wot you don’t know of yet  a deadly chill struck at the hearts of the listeners at these words then bill after a glance at the foot of his bunk where he usually kept his clothes sprang out and began a hopeless search the other men followed suit and the air rang with lamentations and profanity even the spare suits in the men’s chests had gone and bill a prey to acute despair sat down and in a striking passage consigned the entire british army to perdition  ’e’s taken one suit and chucked the rest overboard i expect so as we sha’n’t be able to go arter ’im said thomas i expect he could swim arter all bill  bill still busy with the british army paid no heed  we must go an’ tell the old man said ted  better be careful cautioned the cook ’im an’ the mate ’ad a go at the whisky last night an’ you know wot ’e is next morning  the men went up slowly on deck the morning was fine but the air chill with a breeze from the land had them at a disadvantage ashore a few people were early astir  you go down thomas you’re the oldest said bill  i was thinking o’ ted going said thomas ’e’s the youngest  ted snorted derisively oh was you he remarked helpfully  or bob said the old man don’t matter which  toss up for it said the cook  bill who was keeping his money in his hand as the only safe place left to him produced a penny and spun it in the air  wait a bit said ted earnestly wot time was you to call the old man he asked turning to the cook  toss up for it repeated that worthy hurriedly  six o’clock said bob speaking for him it’s that now cookie better go an’ call ’im at once  i dassent go like this said the trembling cook  well you’ll ’ave to said bill if the old man misses the tide you know wot you’ve got to expect  let’s follow ’im down said ted come along cookie we’ll see you righted  the cook thanked him and followed by the others led the way down to interview the skipper the clock ticked on the mantlepiece and heavy snoring proceeded both from the mate’s bunk and the stateroom on the door of the latter the cook knocked gently then he turned the handle and peeped in  the skipper raising a heavy head set in matted hair and disordered whiskers glared at him fiercely  what d’ye want he roared  if you please sir— began the cook  he opened the door as he spoke and disclosed the lightlyclad crowd behind the skipper’s eyes grew large and his jaw dropped while inarticulate words came from his parched and astonished throat and the mate who was by this time awake sat up in his bunk and cursed them roundly for their indelicacy  get out roared the skipper recovering his voice  we came to tell you interposed bill as ’ow——  get out roared the skipper again how dare you come to my stateroom and like this too  all our clothes ’ave gone and so ’as the sojer chap said bill  serve you damned well right for letting him go cried the skipper angrily hurry up george and get alongside he called to the mate we’ll catch him yet clear out you—you—ballet girls  the indignant seamen withdrew slowly and reaching the foot of the companion stood there in mutinous indecision then as the cook placed his foot on the step the skipper was heard calling to the mate again  george he said in an odd voice  well was the reply  i hope you’re not forgetting yourself and playing larks said the skipper with severity  larks repeated the mate as the alarmed crew fled silently on deck and stood listening openmouthed at the companion of course i ain’t you don’t mean to tell me—  all my clothes have gone every stitch i’ve got replied the skipper desperately as the mate sprang out i shall have to borrow some of yours if i catch that infernal—  you’re quite welcome said the mate bitterly only somebody has borrowed ’em already that’s what comes of sleeping too heavy  the merman sailed bashfully into harbour half an hour later the uniforms of its crew evoking severe comment from the people on the quay at the same time mr harry bliss walking along the road some ten miles distant was trying to decide upon his future career his present calling of shipwrecked sailor being somewhat too hazardous even for his bold spirit     the bully of the cavendish   talking of prizefighters sir said the nightwatchman who had nearly danced himself over the edge of the wharf in illustrating one of mr corbett’s most trusted blows and was now sitting down taking in sufficient air for three they ain’t wot they used to be when i was a boy they advertise in the papers for months and months about their fights and when it does come off they do it with gloves and they’re all right agin a day or two arter  i saw a picter the other day o’ one punching a bag wot couldn’t punch back for practice why i remember as a young man sinker pitt as used to ’ave the king’s arms ’ere in ’is old age when ’e wanted practice ’is plan was to dress up in a soft ’at and black coat like a chapel minister or something and go in a pub and contradict people sailormen for choice he’d ha’ no more thought o’ hitting a pore ’armless bag than i should ha’ thought of hitting ’im  the strangest prizefighter i ever come acrost was one wot shipped with me on the cavendish he was the most eggstrordinary fighter i’ve ever seen or ’eard of and ’e got to be such a nuisance afore ’e’d done with us that we could ’ardly call our souls our own he shipped as an ordinary seaman—a unfair thing to do as ’e was anything but ordinary and ’ad no right to be there at all  we’d got one terror on board afore he come and that was bill bone one o’ the biggest and strongest men i’ve ever seen down a ship’s fo’c’s’le and that’s saying a good deal built more like a bull than a man ’e was and when he was in his tantrums the best thing to do was to get out of ’is way or else get into your bunk and keep quiet oppersition used to send ’im crazy a’most an’ if ’e said a red shirt was a blue one you ’ad to keep quiet it didn’t do to agree with ’im and call it blue even cos if you did he’d call you a liar and punch you for telling lies  he was the only drawback to that ship we ’ad a nice old man good mates and good grub you may know it was a1 when i tell you that most of us ’ad been in ’er for several v’y’ges  but bill was a drawback and no mistake in the main he was a ’earty goodtempered sort o’ shipmate as you’d wish to see only as i said afore oppersition was a thing he could not and would not stand it used to fly to his ’ed direckly  the v’y’ge i’m speaking of—we used to trade between australia and london—bill came aboard about an hour afore the ship sailed the rest of us was already aboard and down below some of us stowing our things away and the rest sitting down and telling each other lies about wot we’d been doing bill came lurching down the ladder and tom baker put ’is ’and to ’im to steady ’im as he got to the bottom  ’who are you putting your ’ands on’ ses bill glaring at ’im  ’only ’olding you up bill’ ses tom smiling  ’oh’ ses bill  he put ’is back up agin a bunk and pulled hisself together  ’’olding of me—up—was you’ he ses ’whaffor if i might be so bold as to arsk’  ’i thought your foot ’ad slipped bill old man’ ses tom ’but i’m sorry if it ’adn’t’  bill looks at ’im agin ’ard  ’sorry if my foot didn’t slip’ he ses  ’you know wot i mean bill’ ses tom smiling a uneasy smile  ’don’t laugh at me’ roars bill  ’i wasn’t laughing bill old pal’ ses tom  ’’e’s called me a liar’ ses bill looking round at us ’called me a liar ’old my coat charlie and i’ll split ’im in halves’  charlie took the coat like a lamb though he was tom’s pal and tom looked round to see whether he couldn’t nip up the ladder and get away but bill was just in front of it then tom found out that one of ’is bootlaces was undone and he knelt down to do it up and this young ordinary seaman joe simms by name put his ’ead out of his bunk and he ses quietlike  ’you ain’t afraid of that thing mate are you’  ’wot’ screams bill starting  ’don’t make such a noise when i’m speaking’ ses joe ’where’s your manners you great ’ulking rascal’  i thought bill would ha’ dropped with surprise at being spoke to like that his face was purple all over and ’e stood staring at joe as though ’e didn’t know wot to make of ’im and we stared too joe being a smallish sort o’ chap and not looking at all strong  ’go easy mate’ whispers tom ’you don’t know who you’re talking to’  ’bosh’ ses joe ’he’s no good he’s too fat and too silly to do any ’arm he sha’n’t ’urt you while i’m ’ere’  he just rolled out of ’is bunk and standing in front of bill put ’is fists up at ’im and stared ’im straight in the eye  ’you touch that man’ he ses quietly pointing to tom ’and i’ll give you such a dressingdown as you’ve never ’ad afore mark my words now’  ’i wasn’t going to ’it him’ ses bill in a strange mild voice  ’you’d better not’ ses the young ’un shaking his fist at ’im ’you’d better not my lad if there’s any fighting to be done in this fo’c’s’le i’ll do it mind that’  it’s no good me saying we was staggered becos staggered ain’t no word for it to see bill put ’is hands in ’is pockets and try and whistle and then sit down on a locker and scratch ’is head was the most amazing thing i’ve ever seen presently ’e begins to sing under his breath  ’stop that ’umming’ ses joe ’when i want you to ’um i’ll tell you’  bill left off ’umming and then he gives a little cough behind the back of ’is ’and and arter fidgeting about a bit with ’is feet went up on deck again  ’strewth’ ses tom looking round at us ’’ave we shipped a bloomin’ prizefighter’  ’wot did you call me’ ses joe looking at ’im  ’nothing mate’ ses tom drawing back  ’you keep a quiet tongue in your ’ed’ ses joe ’and speak when you’re spoken to my lad’  he was a ordinary seaman mind talking to a b’s like that men who’d been up aloft and doing their little bit when ’e was going about catching cold in ’is little petticuts still if bill could stand it we supposed as we’d better  bill stayed up on deck till we was under way and ’is spirit seemed to be broke he went about ’is work like a man wot was walking in ’is sleep and when breakfast come ’e ’ardly tasted it  joe made a splendid breakfast and when he’d finished ’e went to bill’s bunk and chucked the things out all over the place and said ’e was going to ’ave it for himself and bill sat there and took it all quiet and byandby he took ’is things up and put them in joe’s bunk without a word  it was the most peaceful fust day we ’ad ever ’ad down that fo’c’s’le bill usually being in ’is tantrums the fust day or two at sea and wanting to know why ’e’d been born if you talked you was noisy and worriting and if you didn’t talk you was sulky but this time ’e sat quite still and didn’t interfere a bit it was such a pleasant change that we all felt a bit grateful and at teatime tom baker patted joe on the back and said he was one o’ the right old sort  ’you’ve been in a scrape or two in your time i know’ he ses admiring like ’i knew you was a bit of a one with your fists direckly i see you’  ’oh ’ow’s that’ asks joe  ’i could see by your nose’ ses tom  you never know how to take people like that the words ’ad ’ardly left tom’s lips afore the other ups with a basin of ’ot tea and heaves it all over ’im  ’take that you insulting rascal’ he ses as tom jumped up spluttering and wiping ’is face with his coat ’how dare you insult me’  ’get up’ ses tom dancing with rage ’get up prizefighter or no prizefighter i’ll mark you’  ’sit down’ ses bill turning round  i’m going to ’ave a go at ’im bill’ ses tom ’if you’re afraid of ’im i ain’t’  ’sit down’ ses bill starting up ’’ow dare you insult me like that’  ’like wot’ ses tom staring  ’if i can’t lick ’im you can’t’ ses bill ’that’s ’ow it is mate’  ’but i can try’ ses tom  ’all right’ ses bill ’me fust then if you lick me you can ’ave a go at ’im if you can’t lick me ’ow can you lick ’im’  ’sit down both of you’ ses young joe drinking bill’s tea to make up for ’is own ’and mind you i’m cock o’ this fo’c’s’le and don’t you forget it sit down both of you afore i start on you’  they both sat down but tom wasn’t quick enough to please bill and he got a wipe o’ the side o’ the ’ead that made it ring for an hour afterwards  that was the beginning of it and instead of ’aving one master we found we’d got two owing to the eggstrordinry way bill had o’ looking at things he gave joe best without even ’aving a try at him and if anybody else wanted to ’ave a try it was a insult to bill we couldn’t make ’ed or tail of it and all we could get out of bill was that ’e had one time ’ad a turnup with joe simms ashore which he’d remember all ’is life it must ha’ been something of a turn too the way bill used to try and curry favour with ’im  in about three days our life wasn’t worth living and the fo’c’s’le was more like a sundayschool class than anything else in the fust place joe put down swearing he wouldn’t ’ave no bad langwidge he said and he didn’t neither if a man used a bad word joe would pull ’im up the fust time and the second he’d order bill to ’it ’im being afraid of ’urting ’im too much ’imself ’arf the men ’ad to leave off talking altogether when joe was by but the way they used to swear when he wasn’t was something shocking harry moore got clergyman’s sore throat one arternoon through it  then joe objected to us playing cards for money and we ’ad to arrange on the quiet that brace buttons was ha’pennies and coat buttons pennies and that lasted until one evening tom baker got up and danced and nearly went off ’is ’ead with joy through havin’ won a few dozen that was enough for joe and bill by his orders took the cards and pitched ’em over the side  sweet’earting and that sort o’ thing joe couldn’t abear and ned davis put his foot into it finely one arternoon through not knowing he was lying in ’is bunk smoking and thinking and by and by he looked across at bill who was ’arf asleep and ’e ses  ’i wonder whether you’ll see that little gal at melbourne agin this trip bill’  bill’s eyes opened wide and he shook ’is fist at ned as ned thought playfullike  ’all right i’m alooking at you bill’ ’e ses ’i can see you’  ’what gal is that ned’ ses joe who was in the next bunk to him and i saw bill’s eyes screw up tight and ’e suddenly fell fast asleep  ’i don’t know ’er name’ ses ned ’but she was very much struck on bill they used to go to the theayter together’  pretty gal’ ses joe leading ’im on  ’rather’ ses ned trust bill for that ’e always gets the prettiest gal in the place—i’ve known as many as six and seven to—’  ’wot’ screams bill waking up out of ’is sleep and jumping out of ’is bunk  ’keep still bill and don’t interfere when i’m talking’ ses joe very sharp  ’’e’s insulted me’ ses bill ’talking about gals when everybody knows i ’ate ’em worse than pison’  ’hold your tongue’ ses joe ’now ned what’s this about this little gal what’s ’er name’  ’it was only a little joke o’ mine’ ses ned who saw ’e’d put ’is foot in it ’bill ’ates ’em worse than—worse than—pison’  ’you’re telling me a lie’ ses joe sternly ’who was it’  ’it was only my fun joe’ ses ned  ’oh very well then i’m going to ’ave a bit of fun now’ ses joe ’bill’  ’yes’ ses bill  ’i won’t ’it ned myself for fear i shall do ’im a lasting injury’ ses joe ’so you just start on ’im and keep on till ’e tells all about your goings on with that gal’  ’hit ’im to make ’im tell about me ses bill staring ’is ’ardest  ’you ’eard wot i said’ ses joe ’don’t repeat my words you a married man too i’ve got sisters of my own and i’m going to put this sort o’ thing down if you don’t down ’im i will’  ned wasn’t much of a fighter and i ’alf expected to see ’im do a bolt up on deck and complain to the skipper he did look like it for a moment then he stood up looking a bit white as bill walked over to ’im and the next moment ’is fist flew out and afore we could turn round i’m blest if bill wasn’t on the floor ’e got up as if ’e was dazed like struck out wild at ned and missed ’im and the next moment was knocked down agin we could ’ardly believe our eyes and as for ned ’e looked as though ’e’d been doing miracles by mistake  when bill got up the second time ’e was that shaky ’e could ’ardly stand and ned ’ad it all ’is own way until at last ’e got bill’s ’ead under ’is arm and punched at it till they was both tired  ’all right’ ses bill ’i’ve ’ad enough i’ve met my master’  ’wot’ ses joe staring  ’i’ve met my master’ ses bill going and sitting down ’ned ’as knocked me about crool’  joe looked at ’im speechless and then without saying another word or ’aving a go at ned himself as we expected ’e went up on deck and ned crossed over and sat down by bill  ’i ’ope i didn’t hurt you mate’ he ses kindly  ’hurt me’ roars bill ’you you ’urt me you you little bag o’ bones wait till i get you ashore by yourself for five minits ned davis and then you’ll know what ’urting means’  ’i don’t understand you bill’ ses ned ’you’re a mystery that’s what you are but i tell you plain when you go ashore you don’t have me for a companion’  it was a mystery to all of us and it got worse and worse as time went on bill didn’t dare to call ’is soul ’is own although joe only hit ’im once the whole time and then not very hard and he excused ’is cowardice by telling us of a man joe ’ad killed in a fight down in one o’ them westend clubs  wot with joe’s sundayschool ways and bill backing ’em up we was all pretty glad by the time we got to melbourne it was like getting out o’ pris’n to get away from joe for a little while all but bill that is and joe took ’im to hear a dissolving views on john bunyan bill said ’e’d be delighted to go but the language he used about ’im on the quiet when he came back showed what ’e thought of it i don’t know who john bunyan is or wot he’s done but the things bill said about ’im i wouldn’t soil my tongue by repeating  arter we’d been there two or three days we began to feel a’most sorry for bill night arter night when we was ashore joe would take ’im off and look arter ’im and at last partly for ’is sake but more to see the fun tom baker managed to think o’ something to put things straight  ’you stay aboard tonight bill’ he ses one morning ’and you’ll see something that ’ll startle you’  ’worse than you’ ses bill whose temper was getting worse and worse  ’there’ll be an end o’ that bullying joe’ ses tom taking ’im by the arm ’we’ve arranged to give ’im a lesson as’ll lay ’im up for a time’  ’oh’ ses bill looking ’ard at a boat wot was passing  ’we’ve got dodgy pete coming to see us tonight’ ses tom in a whisper ’there’ll only be the second officer aboard and he’ll likely be asleep dodgy’s one o’ the best lightweights in australia and if ’e don’t fix up mister joe it’ll be a pity’  ’you’re a fair treat tom’ ses bill turning round ’that’s what you are a fair treat’  ’i thought you’d be pleased bill’ ses tom  pleased ain’t no name for it tom’ answers bill ’you’ve took a load off my mind’  the fo’c’s’le was pretty full that evening everybody giving each other a little grin on the quiet and looking over to where joe was sitting in ’is bunk putting a button or two on his coat at about ha’past six dodgy comes aboard and the fun begins to commence  he was a nasty lowlooking little chap was dodgy very flylooking and very conceited i didn’t like the look of ’im at all and unbearable as joe was it didn’t seem to be quite the sort o’ thing to get a chap aboard to ’ammer a shipmate you couldn’t ’ammer yourself  ’nasty stuffy place you’ve got down ’ere’ ses dodgy who was smoking a big cigar ’i can’t think ’ow you can stick it’  ’it ain’t bad for a fo’c’s’le’ ses charlie  ’an’ what’s that in that bunk over there’ ses dodgy pointing with ’is cigar at joe  ’hush be careful’ ses tom with a wink ’that’s a prizefighter’  ’oh’ ses dodgy grinning ’i thought it was a monkey’  you might ’ave heard a pin drop and there was a pleasant feeling went all over us at the thought of the little fight we was going to see all to ourselves as joe lays down the jacket he was stitching at and just puts ’is little ’ead over the side o’ the bunk  ’bill’ he ses yawning  ’well’ ses bill all on the grin like the rest of us  ’who is that ’andsome gentlemanlylooking young feller over there smoking a halfcrown cigar’ ses joe  that’s a young gent wot’s come down to ’ave a look round’ ses tom as dodgy takes ’is cigar out of ’is mouth and looks round puzzled  ’wot a terror ’e must be to the gals with them lovely little peepers of ’is’ ses joe shaking ’is’ead ’bill’  ’well’ ses bill agin as dodgy got up  ’take that lovely little gentleman and kick ’im up the fo’c’s’le ladder’ ses joe taking up ’is jacket agin ’and don’t make too much noise over it cos i’ve got a bit of a ’eadache else i’d do it myself’  there was a laugh went all round then and tom baker was near killing himself and then i’m blessed if bill didn’t get up and begin taking off ’is coat  ’wot’s the game’ ses dodgy staring  ’i’m obeying orders’ ses bill ’last time i was in london joe ’ere half killed me one time and ’e made me promise to do as ’e told me for six months i’m very sorry mate but i’ve got to kick you up that ladder’  ’you kick me up’ ses dodgy with a nasty little laugh  ’i can try mate can’t i’ ses bill folding ’is things up very neat and putting ’em on a locker  ’’old my cigar’ ses dodgy taking it out of ’is mouth and sticking it in charlie’s ’i don’t need to take my coat off to ’im’  ’e altered ’is mind though when he saw bill’s chest and arms and not only took off his coat but his waistcoat too then with a nasty look at bill ’e put up ’is fists and just pranced up to ’im  the fust blow bill missed and the next moment ’e got a tap on the jaw that nearly broke it and that was followed up by one in the eye that sent ’im staggering up agin the side and when ’e was there dodgy’s fists were rattling all round ’im  i believe it was that that brought bill round and the next moment dodgy was on ’is back with a blow that nearly knocked his ’ead off charlie grabbed at tom’s watch and began to count and after a little bit called out time’ it was a silly thing to do as it would ’ave stopped the fight then and there if it ’adn’t been for tom’s presence of mind saying it was two minutes slow that gave dodgy a chance and he got up again and walked round bill very careful swearing ’ard at the small size of the fo’c’s’le  he got in three or four at bill afore you could wink a’most and when bill ’it back ’e wasn’t there that seemed to annoy bill more than anything and he suddenly flung out ’is arms and grabbing ’old of ’im flung ’im right across the fo’c’s’le to where fortunately for ’im—dodgy i mean—tom baker was sitting  charlie called time’ again and we let ’em ’ave five minutes while we ’elped tom to bed and then wot ’e called the ’disgusting exhibishun’ was resoomed bill ’ad dipped ’is face in a bucket and ’ad rubbed ’is great arms all over and was as fresh as a daisy dodgy looked a bit tottery but ’e was game all through and very careful and try as bill might he didn’t seem to be able to get ’old of ’im agin  in five minutes more though it was all over dodgy not being able to see plain—except to get out o’ bill’s way—and hitting wild he seemed to think the whole fo’c’s’le was full o’ bills sitting on a locker and waiting to be punched and the end of it was a knockout blow from the real bill which left ’im on the floor without a soul offering to pick ’im up  bill ’elped ’im up at last and shook hands with ’im and they rinsed their faces in the same bucket and began to praise each other up they sat there purring like a couple o’ cats until at last we ’eard a smothered voice coming from joe simms’s bunk  ’is it all over’ he asks  ’yes’ ses somebody  ’how is bill’ ses joe’s voice again  ’look for yourself’ ses tom  joe sat up in ’is bunk then and looked out and he no sooner saw bill’s face than he gave a loud cry and fell back agin and as true as i’m sitting here fainted clean away we was struck all of a ’eap and then bill picked up the bucket and threw some water over ’im and by and by he comes round agin and in a dazed sort o’ way puts his arm round bill’s neck and begins to cry  ’mighty moses’ ses dodgy pete jumping up ’it’s a woman’  ’it’s my wife’ ses bill  we understood it all then leastways the married ones among us did she’d shipped aboard partly to be with bill and partly to keep an eye on ’im and tom baker’s mistake about a prizefighter had just suited her book better than anything how bill was to get ’er home ’e couldn’t think but it ’appened the second officer had been peeping down the fo’c’s’le waiting for ever so long for a suitable opportunity to stop the fight and the old man was so tickled about the way we’d all been done ’e gave ’er a passage back as stewardess to look arter the ship’s cat     the resurrection of mr wiggett   mr sol ketchmaid landlord of the ship sat in his snug bar rising occasionally from his seat by the taps to minister to the wants of the customers who shared this pleasant retreat with him  forty years at sea before the mast had made mr ketchmaid an authority on affairs maritime five years in command of the ship inn with the nearest other licensed house five miles off had made him an autocrat  from his cushioned windsorchair he listened pompously to the conversation sometimes he joined in and took sides and on these occasions it was a foregone conclusion that the side he espoused would win no matter how reasonable the opponent’s argument or how gross his personalities mr ketchmaid in his capacity of host had one unfailing rejoinder—the man was drunk when mr ketchmaid had pronounced that opinion the argument was at an end a nervousness about his license—conspicuous at other times by its absence—would suddenly possess him and opening the little wicket which gave admission to the bar he would order the offender in scathing terms to withdraw  twice recently had he found occasion to warn mr ned clark the village shoemaker the strength of whose head had been a boast in the village for many years on the third occasion the indignant shoemaker was interrupted in the middle of an impassioned harangue on free speech and bundled into the road by the ostler after this nobody was safe  tonight mr ketchmaid meeting his eye as he entered the bar nodded curtly the shoemaker had stayed away three days as a protest and the landlord was naturally indignant at such contumacy  good evening mr ketchmaid said the shoemaker screwing up his little black eyes just give me a small bottle o’ lemonade if you please  mr clark’s cronies laughed and mr ketchmaid after glancing at him to make sure that he was in earnest served him in silence  there’s one thing about lemonade said the shoemaker as he sipped it gingerly nobody could say you was drunk not if you drank bucketsful of it  there was an awkward silence broken at last by mr clark smacking his lips  any news since i’ve been away chaps he inquired or ’ave you just been sitting round as usual listening to the extraordinary adventures what happened to mr ketchmaid whilst afollering of the sea  truth is stranger than fiction ned said mr peter smith the tailor reprovingly  the shoemaker assented but i never thought so till i heard some o’ the things mr ketchmaid ’as been through he remarked  well you know now said the landlord shortly  and the truthfullest of your yarns are the most wonderful of the lot to my mind said mr clark  what do you mean by the truthfullest demanded the landlord gripping the arms of his chair  why the strangest grinned the shoemaker  ah he’s been through a lot mr ketchmaid has said the tailor  the truthfullest one to my mind said the shoemaker regarding the landlord with spiteful interest is that one where henry wiggett the boatswain’s mate ’ad his leg bit off saving mr ketchmaid from the shark and ’is shipmate sam jones the nigger cook was wounded saving ’im from the south sea highlanders  i never get tired o’ hearing that yarn said the affable mr smith  i do said mr clark  mr ketchmaid looked up from his pipe and eyed him darkly the shoemaker smiled serenely  another small bottle o’ lemonade landlord he said slowly  go and get your lemonade somewhere else said the bursting mr ketchmaid  i prefer to ’ave it here rejoined the shoemaker and you’ve got to serve me ketchmaid a licensed publican is compelled to serve people whether he likes to or not else he loses of ’is license  not when they’re the worse for licker he ain’t said the landlord  certainly not said the shoemaker that’s why i’m sticking to lemonade ketchmaid  the indignant mr ketchmaid removing the wire from the cork discharged the missile at the ceiling the shoemaker took the glass from him and looked round with offensive slyness  here’s the ’ealth of henry wiggett what lost ’is leg to save mr ketchmaid’s life he said unctuously also the ’ealth of sam jones who let hisself be speared through the chest for the same noble purpose likewise the health of captain peters who nursed mr ketchmaid like ’is own son when he got knocked up doing the work of five men as was drowned likewise the health o’ dick lee who helped mr ketchmaid capture a chinese junk full of pirates and killed the whole seventeen of ’em by—’ow did you say you killed’em ketchmaid  the landlord who was busy with the taps affected not to hear  killed the whole seventeen of ’em by first telling ’em yarns till they fell asleep and then choking ’em with henry wiggett’s wooden leg resumed the shoemaker  kee—hee said a hapless listener explosively kee—hee—kee——  he checked himself suddenly and assumed an air of great solemnity as the landlord looked his way  you’d better go ’ome jem summers said the fuming mr ketchmaid you’re the worse for liker  i’m not said mr summers stoutly  out you go said mr ketchmaid briefly you know my rules i keep a respectable house and them as can’t drink in moderation are best outside  you should stick to lemonade jem said mr clark you can say what you like then  mr summers looked round for support and then seeing no pity in the landlord’s eye departed wondering inwardly how he was to spend the remainder of the evening the company in the bar gazed at each other soberly and exchanged whispers  understand ned clark said the indignant mr ketchmaid i don’t want your money in this publichouse take it somewhere else  thank’ee but i prefer to come here said the shoemaker ostentatiously sipping his lemonade i like to listen to your tales of the sea in a quiet way i get a lot of amusement out of ’em  do you disbelieve my word demanded mr ketchmaid hotly  why o’ course i do replied the shoemaker we all do you’d see how silly they are yourself if you only stopped to think you and your sharks—no shark would want to eat you unless it was blind  mr ketchmaid allowed this gross reflection on his personal appearance to pass unnoticed and for the first time of many evenings sat listening in torment as the shoemaker began the narration of a series of events which he claimed had happened to a seafaring nephew many of these bore a striking resemblance to mr ketchmaid’s own experiences the only difference being that the nephew had no eye at all for the probabilities  in this fell work mr clark was ably assisted by the offended mr summers side by side they sat and quaffed lemonade and burlesqued the landlord’s autobiography the only consolation afforded to mr ketchmaid consisting in the reflection that they were losing a harmless pleasure in good liquor once and once only they succumbed to the superior attractions of alcohol and mr ketchmaid returning from a visit to his brewer at the large seaport of burnsea heard from the ostler the details of a carouse with which he had been utterly unable to cope  the couple returned to lemonade the following night and remained faithful to that beverage until an event transpired which rendered further selfdenial a mere foolishness  it was about a week later mr ketchmaid had just resumed his seat after serving a customer when the attention of all present was attracted by an odd and regular tapping on the brickpaved passage outside it stopped at the taproom and a murmur of voices escaped at the open door then the door was closed and a loud penetrating voice called on the name of sol ketchmaid  good heavens said the amazed landlord halfrising from his seat and falling back again i ought to know that voice  sol ketchmaid bellowed the voice again where are you shipmate  hennery wiggett gasped the landlord as a small man with ragged whiskers appeared at the wicket it can’t be  the newcomer regarded him tenderly for a moment without a word and then kicking open the door with an unmistakable wooden leg stumped into the bar and grasping his outstretched hand shook it fervently  i met cap’n peters in melbourne said the stranger as his friend pushed him into his own chair and questioned him breathlessly he told me where you was  the sight o’ you hennery wiggett is better to me than diamonds said mr ketchmaid ecstatically how did you get here  a friend of his cap’n jones of the barque venus gave me a passage to london said mr wiggett and i’ve tramped down from there without a penny in my pocket  and sol ketchmaid’s glad to see you sir said mr smith who with the rest of the company had been looking on in a state of great admiration he’s never tired of telling us ’ow you saved him from the shark and ’ad your leg bit off in so doing  i’d ’ave my other bit off for ’im too said mr wiggett as the landlord patted him affectionately on the shoulder and thrust a glass of spirits into his hands cheerful i would the kindest’earted and the bravest man that ever breathed is old sol ketchmaid  he took the landlord’s hand again and squeezing it affectionately looked round the comfortable bar with much approval they began to converse in the low tones of confidence and names which had figured in many of the landlord’s stories fell continuously on the listeners’ ears  you never ’eard anything more o’ pore sam jones i s’pose said mr ketchmaid  mr wiggett put down his glass  i ran up agin a man in rio janeiro two years ago he said mournfully pore old sam died in ’is arms with your name upon ’is honest black lips  enough to kill any man muttered the discomfited mr clark looking round defiantly upon his murmuring friends  who is this puttyfaced swab sol demanded mr wiggett turning a fierce glance in the shoemaker’s direction  he’s our cobbler said the landlord but you don’t want to take no notice of ’im nobody else does he’s a man who as good as told me i’m a liar  wot said mr wiggett rising and stumping across the bar take it back mate i’ve only got one leg but nobody shall run down sol while i can draw breath the finest sailorman that ever trod a deck is sol and the best’earted  hear hear said mr smith own up as you’re in the wrong ned  when i was laying in my bunk in the fo’c’s’le being nursed back to life continued mr wiggett enthusiastically who was it that set by my side ’olding my ’and and telling me to live for his sake—why sol ketchmaid who was it that said that he’d stick to me for life—why sol ketchmaid who was it said that so long as ’e ’ad a crust i should have first bite at it and so long as ’e ’ad a bed i should ’ave first half of it—why sol ketchmaid  he paused to take breath and a flattering murmur arose from his listeners while the subject of his discourse looked at him as though his eloquence was in something of the nature of a surprise even to him  in my old age and on my beamends continued mr wiggett i remembered them words of old sol and i knew if i could only find ’im my troubles were over i knew that i could creep into ’is little harbour and lay snug i knew that what sol said he meant i lost my leg saving ’is life and he is grateful  so he ought to be said mr clark and i’m proud to shake ’ands with a hero  he gripped mr wiggett’s hand and the others followed suit the woodenlegged man wound up with mr ketchmaid and disdaining to notice that that veracious mariner’s grasp was somewhat limp sank into his chair again and asked for a cigar  lend me the box sol he said jovially as he took it from him i’m going to ’and ’em round this is my treat mates pore old henry wiggett’s treat  he passed the box round mr ketchmaid watching in helpless indignation as the customers discarding their pipes thanked mr wiggett warmly and helped themselves to a threepenny cigar apiece mr clark was so particular that he spoilt at least two by undue pinching before he could find one to his satisfaction  closing time came all too soon mr wiggett whose popularity was never for a moment in doubt developing gifts to which his friend had never even alluded he sang comic songs in a voice which made the glasses rattle on the shelves asked some really clever riddles and wound up with a conjuring trick which consisted in borrowing half a crown from mr ketchmaid and making it pass into the pocket of mr peter smith this last was perhaps not quite so satisfactory as the utmost efforts of the tailor failed to discover the coin and he went home under a cloud of suspicion which nearly drove him frantic  i ’ope you’re satisfied said mr wiggett as the landlord having shot the bolts of the front door returned to the bar  you went a bit too far said mr ketchmaid shortly you should ha’ been content with doing what i told you to do and who asked you to ’and my cigars round  i got a bit excited pleaded the other  and you forgot to tell ’em you’re going to start tomorrow to live with that niece of yours in new zealand added the landlord  so i did said mr wiggett smiting his forehead so i did i’m very sorry i’ll tell ’em tomorrow night  mention it casual like tomorrow morning commanded mr ketchmaid and get off in the arternoon then i’ll give you some dinner besides the five shillings as arranged  mr wiggett thanked him warmly and taking a candle withdrew to the unwonted luxury of clean sheets and a soft bed for some time he lay awake in deep thought and then smothering a laugh with the bedclothes he gave a sigh of content and fell asleep  to the landlord’s great annoyance his guest went for a walk next morning and did not return until the evening when he explained that he had walked too far for his crippled condition and was unable to get back much sympathy was manifested for him in the bar but in all the conversation that ensued mr ketchmaid listened in vain for any hint of his departure signals were of no use mr wiggett merely nodding amiably and raising his glass in response and when by considerable strategy he brought the conversation from pigkilling to nieces mr wiggett deftly transferred it to uncles and discoursed on pawnbroking  the helpless mr ketchmaid suffered in silence with his eye on the clock and almost danced with impatience at the tardiness of his departing guests he accompanied the last man to the door and then crimson with rage returned to the bar to talk to mr wiggett  wot d’y’r mean by it he thundered  mean by what sol inquired mr wiggett looking up in surprise  don’t you call me sol ’cos i won’t have it vociferated the landlord standing over him with his fist clenched first thing tomorrow morning off you go  off repeated the other in amazement off whereto  anywhere said the overwrought landlord so long as you get out of here i don’t care where you go  mr wiggett who was smoking a cigar the third that evening laid it carefully on the table by his side and regarded him with tender reproach  you ain’t yourself sol he said with conviction don’t say another word else you might say things you’ll be sorry for  his forebodings were more than justified mr ketchmaid indulging in a few remarks about his birth parentage and character which would have shocked an eastend policeman  first thing tomorrow morning you go he concluded fiercely i’ve a good mind to turn you out now you know the arrangement i made with you  arrangement said the mystified mr wiggett what arrangements why i ain’t seen you for ten years and more if it ’adn’t been for meeting cap’n peters—  he was interrupted by frenzied and incoherent exclamations from mr ketchmaid  sol ketchmaid he said with dignity i ’ope you’re drunk i ’ope it’s the drink and not sol ketchmaid wot i saved from the shark by ’aving my leg bit off talking i saved your life sol an’ i ’ave come into your little harbour and let go my little anchor to stay there till i go aloft to join poor sam jones wot died with your name on ’is lips  he sprang suddenly erect as mr ketchmaid with a loud cry snatched up a bottle and made as though to brain him with it  you rascal said the landlord in a stifled voice you infernal rascal i never set eyes on you till i saw you the other day on the quay at burnsea and just for an innercent little joke like with ned clark asked you to come in and pretend  pretend repeated mr wiggett in a horrorstricken voice pretend have you forgotten me pushing you out of the way and saying ’save yourself sol’ as the shark’s jaw clashed together over my leg have you forgotten ’ow—  look ’ere said mr ketchmaid thrusting an infuriated face close to his there never was a henery wiggett there never was a shark there never was a sam jones  never—was—a—sam jones said the dazed mr wiggett sinking into his chair ain’t you got a spark o’ proper feeling left sol  he fumbled in his pocket and producing the remains of a dirty handkerchief wiped his eyes to the memory of the faithful black  look here said mr ketchmaid putting down the bottle and regarding him intently you’ve got me fair now will you go for a pound  got you said mr wiggett severely i’m ashamed of you sol go to bed and sleep off the drink and in the morning you can take henry wiggett’s ’and but not before  he took a box of matches from the bar and relighting the stump of his cigar contemplated mr ketchmaid for some time in silence and then with a serious shake of his head stumped off to bed mr ketchmaid remained below and for at least an hour sat thinking of ways and means out of the dilemma into which his ingenuity had led him  he went to bed with the puzzle still unsolved and the morning yielded no solution mr wiggett appeared to have forgotten the previous night’s proceedings altogether and steadfastly declined to take umbrage at a manner which would have chilled a rhinoceros he told several fresh anecdotes of himself and sam jones that evening anecdotes which at the immediate risk of choking mr ketchmaid was obliged to indorse  a week passed and mr wiggett still graced with his presence the bar of the ship the landlord lost flesh and began seriously to consider the advisability of making a clean breast of the whole affair mr wiggett watched him anxiously and with a skill born of a lifelong study of humanity realised that his visit was drawing to an end at last one day mr ketchmaid put the matter bluntly  i shall tell the chaps tonight that it was a little joke on my part he announced with grim decision then i shall take you by the collar and kick you into the road  mr wiggett sighed and shook his head  it’ll be a terrible showup for you he said softly you’d better make it worth my while and i’ll tell ’em this evening that i’m going to new zealand to live with a niece of mine there and that you’ve paid my passage for me i don’t like telling any more lies but seeing it’s for you i’ll do it for a couple of pounds  five shillings snarled mr ketchmaid  mr wiggett smiled comfortably and shook his head mr ketchmaid raised his offer to ten shillings to a pound and finally after a few remarks which prompted mr wiggett to state that hard words broke no bones flung into the bar and fetched the money  the news of mr wiggett’s departure went round the village at once the landlord himself breaking the news to the next customer and an overflow meeting assembled that evening to bid the emigrant farewell  the landlord noted with pleasure that business was brisk several gentlemen stood drink to mr wiggett and in return he put his hand in his own pocket and ordered glasses round mr ketchmaid in a state of some uneasiness took the order and then mr wiggett with the air of one conferring inestimable benefits produced a lucky halfpenny which had once belonged to sam jones and insisted upon his keeping it  this is my last night mates he said mournfully as he acknowledged the drinking of his health in many ports i’ve been and many snug pubs i ’ave visited but i never in all my days come across a nicer kinder’earted lot o’ men than wot you are  hear hear said mr clark  mr wiggett paused and taking a sip from his glass to hide his emotion resumed  in my lonely pilgrimage through life crippled and ’aving to beg my bread he said tearfully i shall think o’ this ’appy bar and these friendly faces when i am wrestlin’ with the pangs of ’unger and being moved on by the ’eartless police i shall think of you as i last saw you  but said mr smith voicing the general consternation you’re going to your niece in new zealand  mr wiggett shook his head and smiled a sad sweet smile  i ’ave no niece he said simply i’m alone in the world  at these touching words his audience put their glasses down and stared in amaze at mr ketchmaid while that gentleman in his turn gazed at mr wiggett as though he had suddenly developed horns and a tail  ketchmaid told me hisself as he’d paid your passage to new zealand said the shoemaker he said as ’e’d pressed you to stay but that you said as blood was thicker even than friendship  all lies said mr wiggett sadly i’ll stay with pleasure if he’ll give the word i’ll stay even now if ’e wishes it  he paused a moment as though to give his bewildered victim time to accept this offer and then addressed the scandalised mr clark again  he don’t like my being ’ere he said in a low voice he grudges the little bit i eat i s’pose he told me i’d got to go and that for the look o’ things ’e was going to pretend i was going to new zealand i was too broke’earted at the time to care wot he said—i ’ave no wish to sponge on no man—but seeing your ’onest faces round me i couldn’t go with a lie on my lips—sol ketchmaid old shipmate—goodbye  he turned to the speechless landlord made as though to shake hands with him thought better of it and then with a wave of his hand full of chastened dignity withdrew his stump rang with pathetic insistence upon the brickpaved passage paused at the door and then tapping on the hard road died slowly away in the distance inside the ship the shoemaker gave an ominous order for lemonade     a marked man   tattooing is a gift said the nightwatchman firmly it ’as to be a gift as you can well see a man ’as to know wot ’e is going to tattoo an’ ’ow to do it there’s no rubbing out or altering it’s a gift an’ it can’t be learnt i knew a man once as used to tattoo a cabinboy all over every v’y’gc trying to learn ’e was a slow painstaking sort o’ man and the langwidge those boys used to use while ’e was at work would ’ardly be believed but ’e ’ad to give up trying arter about fifteen years and take to crochetwork instead  some men won’t be tattooed at all being proud o’ their skins or sichlike and for a good many years ginger dick a man i’ve spoke to you of before was one o’ that sort like many red’aired men ’e ’ad a very white skin which ’e was very proud of but at last owing to a unfortnit idea o’ making ’is fortin ’e let hisself be done  it come about in this way him and old sam small and peter russet ’ad been paid off from their ship and was ’aving a very ’appy pleasant time ashore they was careful men in a way and they ’ad taken a room down east india road way and paid up the rent for a month it came cheaper than a lodging’ouse besides being a bit more private and respectable a thing old sam was always very pertickler about  they ’ad been ashore about three weeks when one day old sam and peter went off alone becos ginger said ’e wasn’t going with ’em he said a lot more things too ’ow ’e was going to see wot it felt like to be in bed without ’aving a fat old man groaning ’is ’eart out and another one knocking on the mantelpiece all night with twopence and wanting to know why he wasn’t being served  ginger dick fell into a quiet sleep arter they’d gone then ’e woke up and ’ad a sip from the waterjug—he’d ’a had more only somebody ’ad dropped the soap in it—and then dozed off agin it was late in the afternoon when ’e woke and then ’e see sam and peter russet standing by the side o’ the bed looking at ’im  ’where’ve you been’ ses ginger stretching hisself and yawning  ’bisness’ ses sam sitting down an’ looking very important ’while you’ve been laying on your back all day me an’ peter russet ’as been doing a little ’eadwork’  ’oh’ ses ginger ’wot with’  sam coughed and peter began to whistle an’ ginger he laid still and smiled up at the ceiling and began to feel goodtempered agin  ’well wot’s the business’ he ses at last  sam looked at peter but peter shook ’is ’ead at him  it’s just a little bit ’o bisness we ’appened to drop on’ ses sam at last ’me an’ peter and i think that with luck and management we’re in a fair way to make our fortunes peter ’ere ain’t given to looking on the cheerful side o’ things but ’e thinks so too’  ’i do’ ses peter ’but it won’t be managed right if you go blabbing it to everybody’  ’we must ’ave another man in it peter’ ses sam ’and wot’s more ’e must ’ave gingercoloured ’air that being so it’s only right and proper that our dear old pal ginger should ’ave the fust offer’  it wasn’t often that sam was so affeckshunate and ginger couldn’t make it out at all ever since ’e’d known ’im the old man ’ad been full o’ plans o’ making money without earning it stupid plans they was too but the stupider they was the more old sam liked ’em  ’well wot is it’ asks ginger agin  old sam walked over to the door and shut it then ’e sat down on the bed and spoke low so that ginger could hardly ’ear ’im  ’a little public’ouse’ he ses ’to say nothing of ’ouse properly and a red’aired old landlady wot’s a widder as nice a old lady as any one could wish for for a mother’  for a mother’ ses ginger staring  ’and a lovely barmaid with blue eyes and yellow ’air wot ’ud be the red’edded man’s cousin’ ses peter russet  ’look ’ere’ ses ginger ’are you going to tell me in plain english wot it’s all about or are you not’  ’we’ve been in a little pub down bow way me an’ peter’ ses sam ’and we’ll tell you more about it if you promise to join us an’ go shares it’s kep’ by a widder woman whose on’y son—red’aired son—went to sea twentythree years ago at the age o’ fourteen an’ was never ’eard of arterwards seeing we was sailormen she told us all about it an’ ’ow she still ’opes for him to walk into ’er arms afore she dies’  ’she dreamt a fortnit ago that ’e turned up safe and sound with red whiskers’ ses peter  ginger dick sat up and looked at ’em without a word then ’e got up out o’ bed an’ pushing old sam out of the way began to dress and at last ’e turned round and asked sam whether he was drunk or only mad  ’all right’ ses sam ’if you won’t take it on we’ll find somebody as will that’s all there’s no call to get huffy about it you ain’t the on’y red’edded man in the world’  ginger didn’t answer ’im he went on dressing but every now and then ’e’d look at sam and give a little larf wot made sam’s blood boil  ’you’ve got nothin’ to larf at ginger’ he ses at last ’the landlady’s boy ’ud be about the same age as wot you are now ’e ’ad a scar over the left eyebrow same as wot you’ve got though i don’t suppose he got it by fighting a chap three times ’is size ’e ’ad bright blue eyes a small wellshaped nose and a nice mouth’  ’same as you ginger’ ses peter looking out of the winder  ginger coughed and looked thoughtful  ’it sounds all right mates’ ’e ses at last ’but i don’t see ’ow we’re to go to work i don’t want to get locked up for deceiving’  ’you can’t get locked up’ ses sam ’if you let ’er discover you and claim you ’ow can you get locked up for it we shall go in an’ see her agin and larn all there is to larn especially about the tattoo marks and then—’  ’tattoo marks’ ses ginger  ’that’s the strong p’int’ ses sam ’’er boy ’ad a sailor dancing a ’ornpipe on ’is left wrist an’ a couple o’ dolphins on his right on ’is chest ’e ’ad a fullrigged ship and on ’is back between ’is shoulderblades was the letters of ’is name—crs charles robert smith’  ’well you silly old fool’ ses ginger starting up in a temper ’that spiles it all i ain’t got a mark on me’  old sam smiles at ’im and pats him on the shoulder ’that’s where you show your want of intelleck ginger’ he ses kindly ’why don’t you think afore you speak wot’s easier than to ’ave ’em put on’  ’wot’ screams ginger ’tattoo me spile my skin with a lot o’ beastly blue marks not me not if i know it i’d like to see anybody try it that’s all’  he was that mad ’e wouldn’t listen to reason and as old sam said ’e couldn’t have made more fuss if they’d offered to skin ’im alive an’ peter russet tried to prove that a man’s skin was made to be tattooed on or else there wouldn’t be tattooers same as a man ’ad been given two legs so as ’e could wear trousers but reason was chucked away on ginger an’ ’e wouldn’t listen to ’em  they started on ’im agin next day but all sam and peter could say didn’t move ’im although sam spoke so feeling about the joy of a pore widder woman getting ’er son back agin arter all these years that ’e nearly cried  they went down agin to the pub that evening and ginger who said ’e was curious to see wanted to go too sam who still ’ad ’opes of ’im wouldn’t ’ear of it but at last it was arranged that ’e wasn’t to go inside but should take a peep through the door they got on a tram at aldgate and ginger didn’t like it becos sam and peter talked it over between theirselves in whispers and pointed out likely red’aired men in the road  and ’e didn’t like it when they got to the blue lion and sam and peter went in and left ’im outside peeping through the door the landlady shook ’ands with them quite friendly and the barmaid a finelooking girl seemed to take a lot o’ notice of peter ginger waited about outside for nearly a couple of hours and at last they came out talking and larfing with peter wearing a white rose wot the barmaid ’ad given ’im  ginger dick ’ad a good bit to say about keeping ’im waiting all that time but sam said that they’d been getting valuable information an’ the more ’e could see of it the easier the job appeared to be an’ then him an’ peter wished for to bid ginger goodbye while they went and ’unted up a red’aired friend o’ peter’s named charlie bates  they all went in somewhere and ’ad a few drinks first though and arter a time ginger began to see things in a different light to wot ’e ’ad before an’ to be arf ashamed of ’is selfishness and ’e called sam’s pot a lovingcup an’ kep’ on drinking out of it to show there was no illfeeling although sam kep’ telling him there wasn’t then sam spoke up about tattooing agin and ginger said that every man in the country ought to be tattooed to prevent the smallpox he got so excited about it that old sam ’ad to promise ’im that he should be tattooed that very night before he could pacify ’im  they all went off ’ome with their arms round each other’s necks but arter a time ginger found that sam’s neck wasn’t there an’ ’e stopped and spoke serious to peter about it peter said ’e couldn’t account for it an’ ’e had such a job to get ginger ’ome that ’e thought they would never ha’ got there he got ’im to bed at last an’ then ’e sat down and fell asleep waiting for sam  ginger was the last one to wake up in the morning an’ before ’e woke he kept making a moaning noise his ’ead felt as though it was going to bust ’is tongue felt like a brick and ’is chest was so sore ’e could ’ardly breathe then at last ’e opened ’is eyes and looked up and saw sam an’ peter and a little man with a black moustache  ’cheer up ginger’ ses sam in a kind voice ’it’s going on beautiful’  ’my ’ead’s splittin’’ ses ginger with a groan ’an’ i’ve got pins an’ needles all over my chest’  ’needles’ ses the man with the black moustache ’i never use pins they’d pison the flesh’  ginger sat up in bed and stared at ’im then ’e bent ’is ’ead down and squinted at ’is chest and next moment ’e was out of bed and all three of ’em was holding ’im down on the floor to prevent ’im breaking the tattooer’s neck which ’e’d set ’is ’eart upon doing and explaining to ’im that the tattooer was at the top of ’is profession and that it was only by a stroke of luck ’e had got ’im and sam reminded ’im of wot ’e ’ad said the night before and said he’d live to thank ’im for it  ’’ow much is there done’ ses ginger at last in a desprit voice  sam told ’im and ginger lay still and called the tattooer all the names he could think of which took ’im some time  ’it’s no good going on like that ginger’ ses sam ’your chest is quite spiled at present but if you on’y let ’im finish it’ll be a perfeck picter’  i take pride in it’ ses the tattooer ’working on your skin mate is like painting on a bit o’ silk’  ginger gave in at last and told the man to go on with the job and finish it and ’e even went so far as to do a little bit o’ tattooing ’imself on sam when he wasn’t looking ’e only made one mark becos the needle broke off and sam made such a fuss that ginger said any one would ha’ thought ’e’d hurt ’im  it took three days to do ginger altogether and he was that sore ’e could ’ardly move or breathe and all the time ’e was laying on ’is bed of pain sam and peter russet was round at the blue lion enjoying theirselves and picking up information the second day was the worst owing to the tattooer being the worse for licker drink affects different people in different ways and ginger said the way it affected that chap was to make ’im think ’e was sewing buttons on instead o’ tattooing  ’owever ’e was done at last his chest and ’is arms and ’is shoulders and he nearly broke down when sam borrowed a bit o ’lookingglass and let ’im see hisself then the tattooer rubbed in some stuff to make ’is skin soft agin and some more stuff to make the marks look a bit old  sam wanted to draw up an agreement but ginger dick and peter russet wouldn’t ’ear of it they both said that that sort o’ thing wouldn’t look well in writing not if anybody else happened to see it that is besides which ginger said it was impossible for ’im to say ’ow much money he would ’ave the handling of once the tattooing was done ’e began to take a’most kindly to the plan an’ being an orfin so far as ’e knew he almost began to persuade hisself that the red’aired landlady was ’is mother  they ’ad a little call over in their room to see ’ow ginger was to do it and to discover the weak p’ints sam worked up a squeaky voice and pretended to be the landlady and peter pretended to be the goodlooking barmaid  they went all through it over and over agin the only unpleasantness being caused by peter russet letting off a screech every time ginger alluded to ’is chest wot set ’is teeth on edge and old sam as the landlady offering ginger pots o’ beer which made ’is mouth water  ’we shall go round tomorrow for the last time’ ses sam ’as we told ’er we’re sailing the day arter of course me an’ peter ’aving made your fortin drop out altogether but i dessay we shall look in agin in about six months’ time and then perhaps the landlady will interduce us to you’  ’meantime’ ses peter russet ’you mustn’t forget that you’ve got to send us post office moneyorders every week’  ginger said ’e wouldn’t forget and they shook ’ands all round and ’ad a drink together and the next arternoon sam and peter went to the blue lion for a last visit  it was quite early when they came back ginger was surprised to see ’em and he said so but ’e was more surprised when ’e heard their reasons  it come over us all at once as we’d bin doing wrong’ sam ses setting down with a sigh  ’come over us like a chill it did’ ses peter  ’doing wrong’ ses ginger dick staring ’wot are you talking about’  ’something the landlady said showed us as we was doin’ wrong’ ses old sam very solemn ’it come over us in a flash’  ’like lightning’ ses peter  ’all of a sudden we see wot a cruel ’ard thing it was to go and try and deceive a poor widder woman’ ses sam in a ’usky voice ’we both see it at once’  ginger dick looks at ’em ’ard ’e did and then ’e ses jeering like  ’i ’spose you don’t want any post office moneyorders sent you then’ he ses  ’no’ says sam and peter both together  ’you may have ’em all’ ses sam ’but if you’ll be ruled by us ginger you’ll give it up same as wot we ’ave—you’ll sleep the sweeter for it’  ’give it up’ shouts ginger dancing up an’ down the room ’arter being tattooed all over why you must be crazy sam—wot’s the matter with you’  ’it ain’t fair play agin a woman’ says old sam ’three strong men agin one poor old woman that’s wot we feel ginger’  ’well i don’t feel like it’ ses ginger ’you please yourself and i’ll please myself’  ’e went off in a huff an’ next morning ’e was so disagreeable that sam an’ peter went and signed on board a steamer called the penguin which was to sail the day arter they parted bad friends all round and ginger dick gave peter a nasty black eye and sam said that when ginger came to see things in a proper way agin he’d be sorry for wot ’e’d said and ’e said that ’im and peter never wanted to look on ’is face agin  ginger dick was a bit lonesome arter they’d gone but ’e thought it better to let a few days go by afore ’e went and adopted the red’aired landlady he waited a week and at last unable to wait any longer ’e went out and ’ad a shave and smartened hisself up and went off to the blue lion  it was about three o’clock when ’e got there and the little public’ouse was empty except for two old men in the jugandbottle entrance ginger stopped outside a minute or two to try and stop ’is trembling and then ’e walks into the private bar and raps on the counter  ’glass o’ bitter ma’am please’ he ses to the old lady as she came out o’ the little parlour at the back o’ the bar  the old lady drew the beer and then stood with one ’and holding the beerpull and the other on the counter looking at ginger dick in ’is new blue jersey and cloth cap  ’lovely weather ma’am’ ses ginger putting his left arm on the counter and showing the sailorboy dancing the hornpipe  ’very nice’ ses the landlady catching sight of ’is wrist an’ staring at it ’i suppose you sailors like fine weather’  ’yes ma’am’ ses ginger putting his elbows on the counter so that the tattoo marks on both wrists was showing ’fine weather an’ a fair wind suits us’  ’it’s a ’ard life the sea’ ses the old lady  she kept wiping down the counter in front of ’im over an’ over agin an’ ’e could see ’er staring at ’is wrists as though she could ’ardly believe her eyes then she went back into the parlour and ginger ’eard her whispering and by and by she came out agin with the blueeyed barmaid  ’have you been at sea long’ ses the old lady  ’over twentythree years ma’am’ ses ginger avoiding the barmaid’s eye wot was fixed on ’is wrists ’and i’ve been shipwrecked four times the fust time when i was a little nipper o’ fourteen’  ’pore thing’ ses the landlady shaking ’er ’ead ’i can feel for you my boy went to sea at that age and i’ve never seen ’im since’  ’i’m sorry to ’ear it ma’am’ ses ginger very respectfullike ’i suppose i’ve lost my mother so i can feel for you’  ’suppose you’ve lost your mother’ ses the barmaid ’don’t you know whether you have’  ’no’ ses ginger dick very sad ’when i was wrecked the fust time i was in a open boat for three weeks and wot with the exposure and ’ardly any food i got brainfever and lost my memory’  ’pore thing’ ses the landlady agin  ’i might as well be a orfin’ ses ginger looking down ’sometimes i seem to see a kind ’andsome face bending over me and fancy it’s my mother’s but i can’t remember ’er name or my name or anythink about ’er’  ’you remind me o’ my boy very much’ ses the landlady shaking ’er ’ead ’you’ve got the same coloured ’air and wot’s extraordinary you’ve got the same tattoo marks on your wrists sailorboy dancing on one and a couple of dolphins on the other and ’e ’ad a little scar on ’is eyebrow much the same as yours’  ’good ’evins’ ses ginger dick starting back and looking as though ’e was trying to remember something  ’i s’pose they’re common among seafaring men’ ses the landlady going off to attend to a customer  ginger dick would ha’ liked to ha’seen’er abit more excited but ’e ordered another glass o’ bitter from the barmaid and tried to think ’ow he was to bring out about the ship on his chest and the letters on ’is back the landlady served a couple o’ men and by and by she came back and began talking agin  ’i like sailors’ she ses ’one thing is my boy was a sailor and another thing is they’ve got such feelin’ ’earts there was two of ’em in ’ere the other day who’d been in ’ere once or twice and one of ’em was that kind ’earted i thought he would ha’ ’ad a fit at something i told him’  ’ho’ ses ginger pricking up his ears ’wot for’  ’i was just talking to ’im about my boy same as i might be to you’ ses the old lady ’and i was just telling ’im about the poor child losing ’is finger——’  ’losing ’is wot’ ses ginger turning pale and staggering back  ’finger’ ses the landlady ’e was only ten years old at the time and i’d sent ’im out to—wot’s the matter ain’t you well’  ginger didn’t answer ’er a word he couldn’t ’e went on going backwards until ’e got to the door and then ’e suddenly fell through it into the street and tried to think  then ’e remembered sam and peter and when ’e thought of them safe and sound aboard the penguin he nearly broke down altogether as ’e thought how lonesome he was  all ’e wanted was ’is arms round both their necks same as they was the night afore they ’ad ’im tattooed     to have and to hold   the old man sat outside the cauliflower inn looking crossly up the road he was fond of conversation but the pedestrian who had stopped to drink a mug of ale beneath the shade of the doors was not happy in his choice of subjects he would only talk of the pernicious effects of beer on the constitutions of the aged and he listened with illconcealed impatience to various points which the baffled ancient opposite urged in its favour  conversation languished the traveller rapped on the table and had his mug refilled he nodded courteously to his companion and drank  seems to me said the latter sharply you like it for all your talk  the other shook his head gently and leaning back bestowed a covert wink upon the signboard he then explained that it was the dream of his life to give up beer  you’re another job brown said the old man irritably that’s wot you are another job brown i’ve seen your kind afore  he shifted farther along the seat and taking up his long clay pipe from the table struck a match and smoked the few whiffs which remained then he heard the traveller order a pint of ale with gin in it and a paper of tobacco his dull eyes glistened but he made a feeble attempt to express surprise when these luxuries were placed before him  wot i said just now about you being like job brown was only in joke like he said anxiously as he tasted the brew if job ’ad been like you he’d ha’ been a better man  the philanthropist bowed he also manifested a little curiosity concerning one to whom he had for however short a time suggested a resemblance  he was one o’ the ’ardest drinkers in these parts began the old man slowly filling his pipe  the traveller thanked him  wot i meant was—said the old man hastily—that all the time ’e was drinking ’e was talking agin beer same as you was just now and he used to try all sorts o’ ways and plans of becoming a teetotaler he used to sit up ’ere of a night drinking ’is ’ardest and talking all the time of ways and means by which ’e could give it up he used to talk about hisself as if ’e was somebody else ’e was trying to do good to  the chaps about ’ere got sick of ’is talk they was poor men mostly same as they are now and they could only drink a little ale now and then an’ while they was doing of it they ’ad to sit and listen to job brown who made lots o’ money dealing drinking pint arter pint o’ gin and beer and calling it pison an’ saying they was killing theirselves  sometimes ’e used to get pitiful over it and sit shaking ’is ’ead at ’em for drowning theirselves in beer as he called it when they ought to be giving the money to their wives and families he sat down and cried one night over bill chambers’s wife’s toes being out of ’er boots bill sat struck all of a ’eap and it might ’ave passed off only henery white spoke up for ’im and said that he scarcely ever ’ad a pint but wot somebody else paid for it there was unpleasantness all round then and in the row somebody knocked one o’ henery’s teeth out  and that wasn’t the only unpleasantness and at last some of the chaps put their ’eads together and agreed among theirselves to try and help job brown to give up the drink they kep’ it secret from job but the next time ’e came in and ordered a pint joe gubbins—’aving won the toss—drank it by mistake and went straight off ’ome as ’ard as ’e could smacking ’is lips  he ’ad the best of it the other chaps ’aving to ’old job down in ’is chair and trying their ’ardest to explain that joe gubbins was only doing him a kindness he seemed to understand at last and arter a long time ’e said as ’e could see joe meant to do ’im a kindness but ’e’d better not do any more  he kept a very tight ’old o’ the next pint and as ’e set down at the table he looked round nasty like and asked ’em whether there was any more as would like to do ’im a kindness and henery white said there was and he went straight off ’ome arter fust dropping a handful o’ sawdust into job’s mug  i’m an old man an’ i’ve seen a good many rows in my time but i’ve never seen anything like the one that ’appened then it was no good talking to job not a bit he being that unreasonable that even when ’is own words was repeated to ’im he wouldn’t listen he behaved like a madman an’ the langwidge ’e used was that fearful and that wicked that smith the landlord said ’e wouldn’t ’ave it in ’is house  arter that you’d ha’ thought that job brown would ’ave left off ’is talk about being teetotaler but he didn’t he said they was quite right in trying to do ’im a kindness but he didn’t like the way they did it he said there was a right way and a wrong way of doing everything and they’d chose the wrong  it was all very well for ’im to talk but the chaps said ’e might drink hisself to death for all they cared and instead of seeing ’im safe ’ome as they used to when ’e was worse than usual he ’ad to look arter hisself and get ’ome as best he could  it was through that at last ’e came to offer five pounds reward to anybody as could ’elp ’im to become a teetotaler he went off ’ome one night as usual and arter stopping a few seconds in the parlour to pull hisself together crept quietly upstairs for fear of waking ’is wife he saw by the crack under the door that she’d left a candle burning so he pulled hisself together agin and then turned the ’andle and went in and began to try an’ take off ’is coat  he ’appened to give a ’alflook towards the bed as ’e did so and then ’e started back and rubbed ’is eyes and told ’imself he’d be better in a minute then ’e looked agin for ’is wife was nowhere to be seen and in the bed all fast and sound asleep and snoring their ’ardest was little dick weed the tailor and mrs weed and the baby  job brown rubbed ’is eyes again and then ’e drew hisself up to ’is full height and putting one ’and on the chest o’ drawers to steady hisself stood there staring at ’em and getting madder and madder every second then ’e gave a nasty cough and dick and mrs weed an’ the baby all woke up and stared at ’im as though they could ’ardly believe their eyesight  ’wot do you want’ ses dick weed starting up  ’get up’ ses job ’ardly able to speak i’m surprised at you get up out o’ my bed direckly’  ’your bed’ screams little dick ’you’re the worse for licker job brown can’t you see you’ve come into the wrong house’  ’eh’ ses job staring ’wrong ’ouse well where’s mine then’  ’next door but one same as it always was’ ses dick ’will you go’  ’a’ right’ ses job staring ’well goo’night dick goo’night mrs weed goo’night baby’  ’goodnight’ ses mrs weed from under the bedclothes  ’goo’night baby’ ses job again  ’it can’t talk yet’ ses dick ’will you go  ’can’t talk—why not’ ses job  dick didn’t answer ’im  ’well goo’night dick’ he ses agin  ’goodnight’ ses dick from between ’is teeth  ’goo’night mrs weed’ ses job  mrs weed forced herself to say ’goodnight’ agin  ’goo’night baby’ ses job  ’look ’ere’ ses dick raving ’are you goin’ to stay ’ere all night job brown’  job didn’t answer ’im but began to go downstairs saying ’goo’night’ as ’e went and he’d got pretty near to the bottom when he suddenly wondered wot ’e was going downstairs for instead of up and lading gently at ’is foolishness for making sich a mistake ’e went upstairs agin his surprise when ’e see dick weed and mrs weed and the baby all in ’is bed pretty near took ’is breath away  ’wot are you doing in my bed’ he ses  ’it’s our bed’ ses dick trembling all over with rage ’i’ve told you afore you’ve come into the wrong ’ouse’  ’wrong ’ouse’ ses job staring round the room ’i b’leeve you’re right goo’night dick goo’night mrs weed goo’night baby’  dick jumped out of bed then and tried to push ’im out of the room but ’e was a very small man and job just stood there and wondered wot he was doing mrs weed and the baby both started screaming one against the other and at last dick pushed the window open and called out for help  they ’ad the neighbours in then and the trouble they ’ad to get job downstairs wouldn’t be believed mrs pottle went for ’is wife at last and then job went ’ome with ’er like a lamb asking ’er where she’d been all the evening and saying ’e’d been looking for ’er everywhere  there was such a todo about it in the village next morning that job brown was fairly scared all the wimmen was out at their doors talking about it and saying wot a shame it was and ’ow silly mrs weed was to put up with it then old mrs gumm ’er grandmother who was eightyeight years old stood outside job’s ’ouse nearly all day shaking ’er stick at ’im and daring of ’im to come out wot with mrs gumm and the little crowd watching ’er all day and giving ’er good advice which she wouldn’t take job was afraid to show ’is nose outside the door  he wasn’t like hisself that night up at the cauliflower ’e sat up in the corner and wouldn’t take any notice of anybody and it was easy to see as he was thoroughly ashamed of hisself  ’cheer up job’ says bill chambers at last ’you ain’t the fust man as has made a fool of hisself’  ’mind your own business’ ses job brown ’and i’ll mind mine’  ’why don’t you leave ’im alone bill’ ses henery white ’you can see the man is worried because the baby can’t talk’  ’oh’ ses bill ’i thought ’e was worried because ’is wife could’  all the chaps except job that is laughed at that but job ’e got up and punched the table and asked whether there was anybody as would like to go outside with him for five minutes then ’e sat down agin and said ’ard things agin the drink which ’ad made ’im the larfingstock of all the fools in claybury  ’i’m going to give it up smith’ he ses  ’yes i know you are’ ses smith  ’if i could on’y lose the taste of it for a time i could give it up’ ses job wiping ’is mouth ’and to prove i’m in earnest i’ll give five pounds to anybody as’ll prevent me tasting intoxicating licker for a month’  ’you may as well save your breath to bid people goodnight with job’ ses bill chambers ’you wouldn’t pay up if anybody did keep you off it’  job swore honour bright he would but nobody believed ’im and at last he called for pen and ink and wrote it all down on a sheet o’ paper and signed it and then he got two other chaps to sign it as witnesses  bill chambers wasn’t satisfied then he pointed out that earning the five pounds and then getting it out o’ job brown arterwards was two such entirely different things that there was no likeness between ’em at all then job brown got so mad ’e didn’t know wot ’e was doing and ’e ’anded over five pounds to smith the landlord and wrote on the paper that he was to give it to anybody who should earn it without consulting ’im at all even bill couldn’t think of anything to say agin that but he made a point of biting all the sovereigns  there was quite a excitement for a few days henery white ’e got a ’eadache with thinking and joe gubbins ’e got a ’eadache for drinking job brown’s beer agin there was all sorts o’ wild ways mentioned to earn that five pounds but they didn’t come to anything  arter a week had gone by job brown began to get restless like and once or twice ’e said in smith’s hearing ’ow useful five pounds would be smith didn’t take any notice and at last job told ’im there didn’t seem any likelihood of the five pounds being earned and he wanted it to buy pigs with the way ’e went on when smith said ’e ’adn’t got the power to give it back and ’e’d got to keep it in trust for anybody as might earn it was disgraceful  he used to ask smith for it every night and smith used to give ’im the same answer until at last job brown said he’d go an’ see a lawyer about it that frightened smith a bit and i b’lieve he’d ha’ ’anded it over but two days arterwards job was going upstairs so careful that he fell down to the bottom and broke ’is leg  it was broken in two places and the doctor said it would be a long job owing to ’is drinking habits and ’e gave mrs brown strict orders that job wasn’t to ’ave a drop of anything even if ’e asked for it  there was a lot o’ talk about it up at the cauliflower ’ere and henery white arter a bad ’eadache thought of a plan by which ’e and bill chambers could ’ave that five pounds atween ’em the idea was that bill chambers was to go with henery to see job and take ’im a bottle of beer and jist as job was going to drink it henery should knock it out of ’is ’ands at the same time telling bill chambers ’e ought to be ashamed o’ hisself  it was a good idea and as henery white said if mrs brown was in the room so much the better as she’d be a witness he made bill swear to keep it secret for fear of other chaps doing it arterwards and then they bought a bottle o’ beer and set off up the road to job’s the annoying part of it was arter all their trouble and henery white’s ’eadache mrs brown wouldn’t let ’em in they begged and prayed of ’er to let ’em go up and just ’ave a peep at ’im but she wouldn’t she said she’d go upstairs and peep for ’em and she came down agin and said that ’e was a little bit flushed but sleeping like a lamb  they went round the corner and drank the ale up and bill chambers said it was a good job henery thought ’e was clever because nobody else did as for ’is ’eadaches he put ’em down to overeating  several other chaps called to see job but none of them was allowed to go up and for seven weeks that unfortunate man never touched a drop of anything the doctor tried to persuade ’im now that ’e ’ad got the start to keep it and ’e likewise pointed out that as ’e had been without liquor for over a month he could go and get that five pounds back out o’ smith  job promised that ’e would give it up but the fust day ’e felt able to crawl on ’is crutches he made up ’is mind to go up to the cauliflower and see whether gin and beer tasted as good as it used to the only thing was ’is wife might stop ’im  ’you’re done up with nursing me old gal’ he ses to ’is wife  ’i am a bit tired’ ses she  ’i could see it by your eyes’ ses job ’what you want is a change polly why not go and see your sister at wickham  ’i don’t like leaving you alone’ ses mrs brown ’else i’d like to go i want to do a little shopping’  ’you go my dear’ ses job ’i shall be quite ’appy sitting at the gate in the sun with a glass o’ milk an’ a pipe’  he persuaded ’er at last and in a fit o’ generosity gave ’er three shillings to go shopping with and as soon as she was out o’ sight he went off with a crutch and a stick smiling all over ’is face he met dick weed in the road and they shook ’ands quite friendly and job asked ’im to ’ave a drink then henery white and some more chaps came along and by the time they got to the cauliflower they was as merry a party as you’d wish to see  every man ’ad a pint o’ beer which job paid for not forgetting smith ’isself and job closed ’is eyes with pleasure as ’e took his then they began to talk about ’is accident and job showed ’em is leg and described wot it felt like to be a teetotaler for seven weeks  ’and i’ll trouble you for that five pounds smith’ ’e ses smiling ’i’ve been without anything stronger than milk for seven weeks i never thought when i wrote that paper i was going to earn my own money’  ’none of us did job’ ses smith ’d’ye think that leg’ll be all right agin as good as the other i mean’  ’doctor ses so’ ses job  ’it’s wonderful wot they can do nowadays’ ses smith shaking ’is ’ead  ’’strordinary’ ses job ’where’s that five pounds smith’  ’you don’t want to put any sudden weight or anything like that on it for a time job’ ses smith ’don’t get struggling or fighting whatever you do job’  ’’taint so likely’ ses job ’d’ye think i’m a fool where’s that five pounds smith’  ’ah yes’ ses smith looking as though ’e’d just remembered something ’i wanted to tell you about that to see if i’ve done right i’m glad you’ve come in’  ’eh’ ses job brown staring at ’im  ’has your wife gone shopping today’ ses smith looking at ’im very solemn  job brown put ’is mug down on the table and turned as pale as ashes then ’e got up and limped over to the bar  ’wot d’yer mean’ he ses choking  ’she said she thought o’ doing so’ ses smith wiping a glass ’she came in yesterday and asked for that five pounds she’d won the doctor came in with ’er and said she’d kept you from licker for seven weeks let alone a month so according to the paper i ’ad to give it to ’er i ’ope i done right job’  job didn’t answer ’im a word good or bad he just turned ’is back on him and picking up ’is crutch and ’is stick hobbled off ’ome henery white tried to make ’im stop and ’ave another pint but he wouldn’t he said he didn’t want ’is wife to find ’im out when she returned     brevet rank   the crew of the elisabeth hopkins sat on deck in the gloaming gazing idly at the dusky shapes of the barges as they dropped silently down on the tide or violently discussing the identity of various steamers as they came swiftly past even with these amusements the time hung heavily and they thought longingly of certain cosy bars by the riverside to which they were wont to betake themselves in their spare time  tonight in deference to the wishes of the skipper wishes which approximated closely to those of royalty in their effects they remained on board a new acquaintance of his a brother captain who dabbled in mesmerism was coming to give them a taste of his quality and the skipper sitting on the side of the schooner in the faint light which streamed from the galley was condescendingly explaining to them the marvels of hypnotism  i never ’eard the likes of it said one with a deep breath as the skipper concluded a marvellous example  there’s a lot you ain’t ’eard of bill said another whose temper was suffering from lack of beer but ’ave you seen all this sir  everything said the skipper impressively he wanted to mesmerise me an’ i said ’all right’ i ses ’do it an’ welcome—if you can but i expect my head’s a bit too strong for you’  and it was sir i’ll bet said the man who had been so candid with bill  he tried everything said the skipper then he give it up but he’s coming aboard tonight so any of you that likes can come down the cabin and be mesmerised free  why can’t he do it on deck said the mate rising from the hatches and stretching his gigantic form  ’cos he must have artificial light george said the skipper he lets me a little bit into the secret you know an’ he told me he likes to have the men a bit dazedlike first  voices sounded from the wharf and the nightwatchman appeared piloting captain zingall to the schooner the crew noticed that he came aboard quite like any other man descending the ladder with even more care than usual he was a small man of much dignity with light grey eyes which had been so strained by the exercise of his favourite hobby that they appeared to be starting from his head he chatted agreeably about freights for some time and then at his brother skipper’s urgent entreaty consented to go below and give them a taste of his awful powers  at first he was not very successful the men stared at the discs he put into their hands until their eyes ached but for some time without effect bill was the first to yield and to the astonishment of his friends passed into a soft magnetic slumber from which he emerged to perform the usual idiotic tricks peculiar to mesmerised subjects  it’s wonderful what power you ’ave over em said captain bradd respectfully  captain zingall smiled affably at the present moment he said that man is my unthinkin’ slave an’ whatever i wish him to do he does would any of you like him to do anything  well sir said one of the men ’e owes me ’arf a crown an’ i think it would be a ’ighly interestin’ experiment if you could get ’im to pay me if anything ’ud make me believe in mesmerism that would  an’ he owes me eighteenpence sir said another seaman eagerly  one at a time said the first speaker sharply  an’ ’e’s owed me five shillin’s since i don’t know when said the cook with dishonest truthfulness  captain zingall turned to his subject you owe that man half a crown he said pointing that one eighteenpence and that one five shillings pay them  in the most matteroffact way in the world bill groped in his pockets and producing some greasy coins payed the sums mentioned to the intense delight of everybody  well i’m blest said the mate staring i thought mesmerism was all rubbish now bring him to again  but don’t tell ’im wot ’e’s been doin’ said the cook  zingall with a few passes brought his subject round and with a subdued air he took his place with the others  what’d it feel like bill asked joe can you remember what you did  bill shook his head  don’t try to said the cook feelingly  i should like to put you under the influence said zingall eyeing the mate  you couldn’t said that gentleman promptly  let me try said zingall persuasively  do said the skipper to oblige me george  well i don’t mind much said the mate hesitating but no making me give those chaps money you know  no no said zingall  wot does ’e mean give the chaps money said bill turning with a startled air to the cook  i dunno said the cook airily just watch ’im bill he added anxiously  but bill had something better to do and feeling in his pockets hurriedly strove to balance his cash account it was impossible to do anything else while he was doing it and the situation became so strained and his language so weird that the skipper was compelled in the interest of law and morality to order him from the cabin  look at me said zingall to the mate after quiet had been restored  the mate complied and everybody gazed spellbound at the tussle for supremacy between brute force and occult science slowly very slowly science triumphed being interrupted several times by the bloodcurdling threats of bill as they floated down the companionway then the mate suddenly lurched forward and would have fallen but that strong hands caught him and restored him to his seat  i’m going to show you something now if i can said zingall wiping his brow but i don’t know how it’ll come off because i’m only a beginner at this sort of thing and i’ve never tried this before if you don’t mind cap’n i’m going to tell him he is cap’n bradd and that you are the mate  go ahead said the delighted bradd  captain zingall went ahead full speed with a few rapid passes he roused the mate from his torpor and fixed him with his glittering eye  you are cap’n bradd master o’ this ship he said slowly  ay ay said the mate earnestly  and that’s your mate george said zingall pointing to the deeply interested bradd  ay ay said the mate again with a sigh  take command then said zingall leaving him with a satisfied air and seating himself on the locker  the mate sat up and looked about him with an air of quiet authority  george he said turning suddenly to the skipper with a very passable imitation of his voice  sir said the skipper with a playful glance at zingall  a friend o’ mine named cap’n zingall is coming aboard tonight said the mate slowly get a little whisky for him out o’ my stateroom  ay ay sir said the amused bradd  just a little in the bottom of the bottle ’ll do continued the mate don’t put more in for he drinks like a fish  i never said such a thing cap’n said bradd in an agitated whisper i never thought o’ such a thing  no i know you wouldn’t said zingall who was staring hard at a nearly empty whisky bottle on the table  and don’t leave your baccy pouch lying about george continued the mate in a thrilling whisper  the skipper gave a faint mirthless little laugh and looked at him uneasily  if ever there was a sponger for baccy george it’s him said the mate in a confidential whisper  captain zingall who was at that very moment filling his pipe from the pouch which the skipper had himself pushed towards him laid it carefully on the table again and gazing steadily at his friend took out the tobacco already in his pipe and replaced it in the silence which ensued the mate took up the whisky bottle and pouring the contents into a tumbler added a little water and drank it with relish  he leaned back on the locker and smacked his lips there was a faint laugh from one of the crew and looking up smartly he seemed to be aware for the first time of their presence what are you doin’ down here he roared what do you want  nothin’ sir said the cook only we thought—  get out at once vociferated the mate rising  stay where you are said the skipper sharply  george said the mate in the squeaky voice in which he chose to personate the skipper  bring him round zingall said the skipper irritably i’ve had enough o’ this i’ll let ’im know who’s who  with a confident smile zingall got up quietly from the locker and fixed his terrible gaze on the mate the mate fell back and gazed at him openmouthed  who the devil are you staring at he demanded rudely  still holding him with his gaze zingall clapped his hands together and stepping up to him blew strongly in his face the mate with a perfect scream of rage picked him up by the middle and dumping him heavily on the floor held him there and worried him  help cried zingall in a smothered voice take him off  why don’t you bring him round yelled the skipper excitably what’s the good of playing with him  zingall’s reply which was quite irrelevant consisted almost entirely of adjectives and improper nouns  blow in ’is face agin sir said the cook bending down kindly  take him off yelled zingall he’s killing me  the skipper flew to the assistance of his friend but the mate who was of gigantic strength and stature simply backed and crushed him against a bulkhead then as if satisfied he released the crestfallen zingall and stood looking at him  why—don’t—you—bring—him—round panted the skipper  he’s out of my control said zingall rising nimbly to his feet i’ve heard of such cases before i’m only new at the work you know but i dare say in a couple of years’ time—  the skipper howled at him and the mate suddenly alive again to the obnoxious presence of the crew drove them up the companion ladder and pursued them to the forecastle  this is a pretty kettle o’ fish said bradd indignantly why don’t you bring him round  because i can’t said zingall shortly it’ll have to wear off  wear off repeated the skipper  he’s under a delusion now said zingall an’ o’ course i can’t say how long it’ll last but whatever you do don’t cross him in any way  oh don’t cross him repeated bradd with sarcastic inflection and you call yourself a mesmerist  zingall drew himself up with a little pride well see what i’ve done he said the fact is i was charged full with electricity when i came aboard and he’s got it all now it’s left me weak and until my will wears off him he’s captain o’ this ship  and what about me said bradd  you’re the mate said zingall and mind for your own sake you act up to it if you don’t cross him i haven’t any doubt it’ll be all right but if you do he’ll very likely murder you in a fit of frenzy and—he wouldn’t be responsible goodnight  you’re not going said bradd clutching him by the sleeve  i am said the other he seems to have took a violent dislike to me and if i stay here it’ll only make him worse  he ran lightly up on deck and avoiding an ugly rush on the part of the mate who had been listening sprang on to the ladder and hastily clambered ashore  the skipper worn and scared looked up as the bogus skipper came below  i’m going to bed george said the mate staring at him i feel a bit heavy give me a call just afore high water  where are you goin’ to sleep demanded the skipper  goin’ to sleep said the mate why in my stateroom to be sure  he took the empty bottle from the table and opening the door of the stateroom closed it in the face of its frenzied owner and turned the key in the lock then he leaned over the berth and cramming the pillow against his mouth gave way to his feelings until he was nearly suffocated  any idea that the skipper might have had of the healing effects of sleep were rudely dispelled when the mate came on deck next morning and found that they had taken the schooner out without arousing him his delusion seemed to be stronger than ever and pushing the skipper from the wheel he took it himself and read him a short and sharp lecture on the virtues of obedience  i know you’re a good sort george smith he said leniently nobody could wish for a better but while i’m master of this here ship it don’t become you to take things upon yourself in the way you do  but you don’t understand said the skipper trying to conquer his temper now look me in the eye george  who are you calling george said the mate sharply  well look me in the eye then said the skipper waiving the point  i’ll look at you in a way you won’t like in a minute said the mate ferociously  i want to explain the position of affairs to you said the skipper do you remember cap’n zingall what was aboard last night  little dirtylooking man what kept staring at me demanded the mate  well i don’t know about ’is being dirty said the skipper but that’s the man do you know what he did to you geo—  eh said the mate sharply  he mesmerised you said the skipper hastily now keep quite calm you say you’re benjamin bradd master o’ this vessel don’t you  i do said the mate let me hear anybody say as i ain’t  yesterday said the skipper plucking up courage and speaking very slowly and impressively you were george smith the mate but my friend captain zingall mesmerised you and made you think you were me  i see what it is said the mate severely you’ve been drinking you’ve been up to my whisky  call the crew up and ask ’em then said bradd desperately  call ’em up yourself you lunatic said the mate loudly enough for the men to hear if anybody dares to play the fool with me i won’t leave a whole bone in his body that’s all  in obedience to the summons of captain bradd the crew came up and being requested by him to tell the mate that he was the mate and that he was at present labouring under a delusion stood silently nudging each other and eyeing him uneasily  well said the latter at length why don’t you speak and tell george he’s gone off his ’ead a bit  it ain’t nothing to do with us sir said bill very respectfully  but damn it all man said the mate taking a mighty grip of his collar you know i’m the cap’n don’t you  o’ course i do sir said bill  there you are george said the mate releasing him and turning to the frantic bradd you hear that now look here you listen to me either you’ve been drinking or else your ’ead’s gone a little bit off you go down and turn in and if you don’t give me any more of your nonsense i’ll overlook it for this once  he ordered the crew forward again and being desirous of leaving some permanent mark of his command on the ship had the galley fresh painted in red and blue and a lot of old stores which he had vainly condemned when mate thrown overboard the skipper stood by helplessly while it was done and then went below of his own accord and turned in as being the only way to retain his sanity or at any rate the clearness of head which he felt to be indispensable at this juncture  time instead of restoring the mate to his senses only appeared to confirm him in his folly and the skipper after another attempt to convince him let things drift resolving to have him put under restraint as soon as they got to port  they reached tidescroft in the early afternoon but before they entered the harbour the mate as though he had had some subtle intuition that this would be his last command called the crew to him and read them a touching little homily upon their behaviour when they should land he warned them of publichouses and other dangers and reminded them affectingly of their duties as husbands and fathers always go home to your wife and children my lads he continued with some emotion as i go home to mine  why he ain’t got none whispered bill staring  don’t be a fool bill said the cook he means the cap’n’s don’t you see he’s the cap’n now  it was as clear as noonday and the agitation of the skipper—a perfect othello in his way—was awful he paced the deck incessantly casting fretful glances ashore and as the schooner touched the side of the quay sprang on to the bulwarks and jumped ashore the mate watched him with an illconcealed grin and then having made the vessel snug went below to strengthen himself with a drop of the skipper’s whisky for the crowning scene of his play he came on deck again and taking no heed of the whispers of the crew went ashore  meantime captain bradd had reached his house and was discussing the situation with his astonished spouse she poohpoohed the idea of the police and the medical faculty as being likely to cause complications with the owners and despite the remonstrances of her husband insisted upon facing the mate alone  now you go in the kitchen she said looking from the window here he comes you see how i’ll settle him  the skipper looked out of the window and saw the unhappy victim of captain zingall slowly approaching his wife drew him away and despite his remonstrances pushed him into the next room and closed the door  she sat on the sofa calmly sewing as the mate whose hardihood was rapidly failing him entered her manner gave him no assistance whatever and coming sheepishly in he took a chair  i’ve come home he said at last  so i see ben said mrs bradd calmly  he’s told her said the mate to himself  children all right he inquired after another pause  yes said mrs bradd simply little joe’s boots are almost off his feet though  ah said the mate blankly  i’ve been waiting for you to come ben said mrs bradd after a pause i want you to change a fivepound note uncle dick gave me  can’t do it said the mate briefly the absence of captain bradd was disquieting to a bashful man in such a position and he had looked forward to a stormy scene which was to bring him to his senses again  show me what you’ve got said mrs bradd leaning forward  the mate pulled out an old leather purse and counted the contents two pounds and a little silver  there isn’t five pounds there said mrs bradd but i may as well take last week’s housekeeping while you’ve got it out  before the mate could prevent her she had taken the two pounds and put it in her pocket he looked at her placid face in amazement but she met his gaze calmly and drummed on the table with her thimble  no no i want the money myself said the mate at last he put his hands to his head and began to prepare for the grand transformation scene my head’s gone he said in a gurgling voice what am i doing here where am i  good gracious what’s the matter with the man said mrs bradd with a scream she snatched up a bowl of flowers and flung the contents in his face as her husband burst into the room the mate sprang to his feet spluttering  what am i doing here cap’n bradd he said in his usual voice  he’s come round said bradd ecstatically he’s come round oh george you have been playing the fool don’t you know what you’ve been doing  the mate shook his head and stared round the room i thought we were in london he said putting his hand to his head you said cap’n zingall was coming aboard how did we get here where am i  in a hurried breathless fashion the skipper told him the mate regarding him the while with a stare of fixed incredulity  i can’t understand it he said at length my mind’s a perfect blank  a perfect blank said mrs bradd cheerfully it might have been accident but she tapped her pocket as she spoke and the outwitted mate bit his lip as he realised his blunder and turned to the door the couple watched him as he slowly passed up the street  it’s most extraordinary said the skipper the most extraordinary case i ever heard of  so it is said his wife and what’s more extraordinary still for you ben you’re going to church on sunday and what’s more extraordinary even than that you are going to put two golden sovereigns in the plate     twin spirits   the terrace consisting of eight gaunt houses faced the sea while the back rooms commanded a view of the ancient little town some half mile distant the beach a waste of shingle was desolate and bare except for a ruined bathing machine and a few pieces of linen drying in the winter sunshine in the offing tiny steamers left a trail of smoke while sailingcraft their canvas glistening in the sun slowly melted from the sight on all these things the terrace turned a stolid eye and counting up its gains of the previous season wondered whether it could hold on to the next it was a discontented terrace and had become prematurely soured by a board which refused them a pier a bandstand and illuminated gardens  from the front windows of the third storey of no 1 mrs cox gazing out to sea sighed softly  the season had been a bad one and mr cox had been even more troublesome than usual owing to tightness in the money market and the avowed preference of local publicans for cash transactions to assets in chalk and slate in mr cox’s memory there never had been such a drought and his crop of patience was nearly exhausted  he had in his earlier days attempted to do a little work but his health had suffered so much that his wife had become alarmed for his safety work invariably brought on a cough and as he came from a family whose lungs had formed the staple conversation of their lives he had been compelled to abandon it and at last it came to be understood that if he would only consent to amuse himself and not get into trouble nothing more would be expected of him it was not much of a life for a man of spirit and at times it became so unbearable that mr cox would disappear for days together in search of work returning unsuccessful after many days with nerves shattered in the pursuit  mrs cox’s meditations were disturbed by a knock at the front door and the servants having been discharged for the season she hurried downstairs to open it not without a hope of belated lodgers—invalids in search of an east wind a stout middleaged woman in widow’s weeds stood on the doorstep  glad to see you my dear said the visitor kissing her loudly  mrs cox gave her a subdued caress in return not from any lack of feeling but because she did everything in a quiet and spiritless fashion  i’ve got my uncle joseph from london staying with us continued the visitor following her into the hall so i just got into the train and brought him down for a blow at the sea  a question on mrs cox’s lips died away as a very small man who had been hidden by his niece came into sight  my uncle joseph said mrs berry mr joseph piper she added  mr piper shook hands and after a performance on the doormat protracted by reason of a festoon of hemp followed his hostess into the faded drawingroom  and mr cox inquired mrs berry in a cold voice  mrs cox shook her head he’s been away this last three days she said flushing slightly  looking for work suggested the visitor  mrs cox nodded and placing the tips of her fingers together fidgeted gently  well i hope he finds it said mrs berry with more venom than the remark seemed to require why where’s your marble clock  mrs cox coughed it’s being mended she said confusedly  mrs berry eyed her anxiously don’t mind him my dear she said with a jerk of her head in the direction of mr piper he’s nobody wouldn’t you like to go out on the beach a little while uncle  no said mr piper  i suppose mr cox took the clock for company remarked mrs berry after a hostile stare at her relative  mrs cox sighed and shook her head it was no use pretending with mrs berry  he’ll pawn the clock and anything else he can lay his hands on and when he’s drunk it up come home to be made a fuss of continued mrs berry heatedly that’s you men  her glance was so fiery that mr joseph piper was unable to allow the remark to pass unchallenged  i never pawned a clock he said stroking his little grey head  that’s a lot to boast of isn’t it demanded his niece if i hadn’t got anything better than that to boast of i wouldn’t boast at all  mr piper said that he was not boasting  it’ll go on like this my dear till you’re ruined said the sympathetic mrs berry turning to her friend again what’ll you do then  yes i know said mrs cox i’ve had a bad season too and i’m so anxious about him in spite of it all i can’t sleep at nights for fearing that he’s in some trouble i’m sure i laid awake half last night crying  mrs berry sniffed loudly and mr piper making a remark in a low voice turned on him with ferocity  what did you say she demanded  i said it does her credit said mr piper firmly  i might have known it was nonsense retorted his niece hotly can’t you get him to take the pledge mary  i couldn’t insult him like that said mrs cox with a shiver you don’t know his pride he never admits that he drinks he says that he only takes a little for his indigestion he’d never forgive me when he pawns the things he pretends that somebody has stolen them and the way he goes on at me for my carelessness is alarming he gets worked up to such a pitch that sometimes i almost think he believes it himself  rubbish said mrs berry tartly you’re too easy with him  mrs cox sighed and leaving the room returned with a bottle of wine which was port to the look and redcurrant to the taste and a seedcake of formidable appearance the visitors attacked these refreshments mildly mr piper sipping his wine with an obtrusive carefulness which his niece rightly regarded as a reflection upon her friend’s hospitality  what cox wants is a shock she said you’ve dropped some crumbs on the carpet uncle  mr piper apologised and said he had got his eye on them and would pick them up when he had finished and pick up his niece’s at the same time to prevent her stooping mrs berry in an aside to mrs cox said that her uncle joseph’s tongue had got itself disliked on both sides of the family  and i’d give him one said mrs berry returning again to the subject of mr cox and shocks he has a gentleman’s life of it here and he would look rather silly if you were sold up and he had to do something for his living  it’s putting away the things that is so bad said mrs cox shaking her head that clock won’t last him out i know he’ll come back and take some of the other things every spring i have to go through his pockets for the tickets and get the things out again and i mustn’t say a word for fear of hurting his feelings if i do he goes off again  if i were you said mrs berry emphatically i’d get behind with the rent or something and have the brokers in he’d look rather astonished if he came home and saw a broker’s man sitting in a chair—  he’d look more astonished if he saw him sitting in a flowerpot suggested the caustic mr piper  i couldn’t do that said mrs cox i couldn’t stand the disgrace even though i knew i could pay him out as it is cox is always setting his family above mine  mrs berry without ceasing to stare mr piper out of countenance shook her head and folding her arms again stated her opinion that mr cox wanted a shock and expressed a great yearning to be the humble means of giving him one  if you can’t have the brokers in get somebody to pretend to be one she said sharply that would prevent him pawning any more things at any rate why wouldn’t he do she added nodding at her uncle  anxiety on mrs cox’s face was exaggerated on that of mr piper  let uncle pretend to be a broker’s man in for the rent continued the excitable lady rapidly when mr cox turns up after his spree tell him what his doings have brought you to and say you’ll have to go to the workhouse  i look like a broker’s man don’t i said mr piper in a voice more than tinged with sarcasm  yes said his niece that’s what put it into my head  it’s very kind of you dear and very kind of mr piper said mrs cox but i couldn’t think of it i really couldn’t  uncle would be delighted said mrs berry with a wilful blinking of plain facts he’s got nothing better to do it’s a nice house and good food and he could sit at the open window and sniff at the sea all day long  mr piper sniffed even as she spoke but not at the sea  and i’ll come for him the day after tomorrow said mrs berry  it was the old story of the stronger will mrs cox after a feeble stand gave way altogether and mr piper’s objections were demolished before he had given them full utterance mrs berry went off alone after dinner secretly glad to have got rid of mr piper who was making a selfinvited stay at her house of indefinite duration and mr piper in his new rôle of broker’s man essayed the part with as much help as a clay pipe and a pint of beer could afford him  that day and the following he spent amid the faded grandeurs of the drawingroom gazing longingly at the wide expanse of beach and the tumbling sea beyond the house was almost uncanily quiet an occasional tinkle of metal or crash of china from the basement giving the only indication of the industrious mrs cox but on the day after the quiet of the house was broken by the return of its master whose annoyance when he found the drawingroom clock stolen and a man in possession was alarming in its vehemence he lectured his wife severely on her mismanagement and after some hesitation announced his intention of going through her books mrs cox gave them to him and armed with pen and ink and four square inches of pink blottingpaper he performed feats of balancing which made him a very blondin of finance  i shall have to get something to do he said gloomily laying down his pen  yes dear said his wife  mr cox leaned back in his chair and wiping his pen on the blottingpaper gazed in a speculative fashion round the room have you any money he inquired  for reply his wife rummaged in her pocket and after a lengthy search produced a bunch of keys a thimble a needlecase two pockethandkerchiefs and a halfpenny she put this last on the table and mr cox whose temper had been mounting steadily threw it to the other end of the room  i can’t help it said mrs cox wiping her eyes i’m sure i’ve done all i could to keep a home together i can’t even raise money on anything  mr cox who had been glancing round the room again looked up sharply  why not he inquired  the broker’s man said mrs cox nervously he’s made an inventory of everything and he holds us responsible  mr cox leaned back in his chair this is a pretty state of things he blurted wildly here have i been walking my legs off looking for work any work so long as it’s honest labour and i come back to find a broker’s man sitting in my own house and drinking up my beer  he rose and walked up and down the room and mrs cox whose nerves were hardly equal to the occasion slipped on her bonnet and announced her intention of trying to obtain a few necessaries on credit her husband waited in indignant silence until he heard the front door close behind her and then stole softly upstairs to have a look at the fell destroyer of his domestic happiness  mr piper who was already very tired of his imprisonment looked up curiously as he heard the door pushed open and discovered an elderly gentleman with an appearance of great stateliness staring at him in the ordinary way he was one of the meekest of men but the insolence of this stare was outrageous mr piper opening his mild blue eyes wide stared back whereupon mr cox fumbling in his vest pocket found a pair of folders and putting them astride his nose gazed at the pseudobroker’s man with crushing effect  what do you want here he asked at length are you the father of one of the servants  i’m the father of all the servants in the house said mr piper sweetly  don’t answer me sir said mr cox with much pomposity you’re an eyesore to an honest man a vulture a harpy  mr piper pondered  how do you know what’s an eyesore to an honest man he asked at length  mr cox smiled scornfully  where is your warrant or order or whatever you call it he demanded  i’ve shown it to mrs cox said mr piper  show it to me said the other  i’ve complied with the law by showing it once said mr piper bluffing and i’m not going to show it again  mr cox stared at him disdainfully beginning at his little sleek grey head and travelling slowly downwards to his untidy boots and then back again he repeated this several times until mr piper unable to bear it patiently began to eye him in the same fashion  what are you looking at vulture demanded the incensed mr cox  three spots o’ grease on a dirty weskit replied mr piper readily a pair o’ bow legs in a pair o’ somebody else’s trousers and a shabby coat wore under the right arm with carrying off—he paused a moment as though to make sure—with carrying off of a drawingroom clock  he regretted this retort almost before he had finished it and rose to his feet with a faint cry of alarm as the heated mr cox first locked the door and put the key in his pocket and then threw up the window  vulture he cried in a terrible voice  yes sir said the trembling mr piper  mr cox waved his hand towards the window  fly he said briefly  mr piper tried to form his white lips into a smile and his knees trembled beneath him  did you hear what i said demanded mr cox what are you waiting for if you don’t fly out of the window i’ll throw you out  don’t touch me screamed mr piper retreating behind a table it’s all a mistake all a joke i’m not a broker’s man ha ha  eh said the other not a broker’s man what are you then  in eager trembling tones mr piper told him and gathering confidence as he proceeded related the conversation which had led up to his imposture mr cox listened in a dazed fashion and as he concluded threw himself into a chair and gave way to a terrible outburst of grief  the way i’ve worked for that woman he said brokenly to think it should come to this the deceit of the thing the wickedness of it my heart is broken i shall never be the same man again—never  mr piper made a sympathetic noise  it’s been very unpleasant for me he said but my niece is so masterful  i don’t blame you said mr cox kindly shake hands  they shook hands solemnly and mr piper muttering something about a draught closed the window  you might have been killed in trying to jump out of that window said mr cox fancy the feelings of those two deceitful women then  fancy my feelings said mr piper with a shudder playing with fire that’s what i call it my niece is coming this afternoon it would serve her right if you gave her a fright by telling her you had killed me perhaps it would be a lesson to her not to be so officious  it would serve ’em both right agreed mr cox only mrs berry might send for the police  i never thought of that said mr piper fondling his chin  i might frighten my wife mused the amiable mr cox it would be a lesson to her not to be deceitful again and by jove i’ll get some money from her to escape with i know she’s got some and if she hasn’t she will have in a day or two there’s a little pub at newstead eight miles from here where we could be as happy as fighting cocks with a fiver or two and while we’re there enjoying ourselves my wife’ll be half out of her mind trying to account for your disappearance to mrs berry  it sounds all right said mr piper cautiously but she won’t believe you you don’t look wild enough to have killed anybody  i’ll look wild enough when the time comes said the other nodding you get on to the white horse at newstead and wait for me i’ll let you out at the back way come along  but you said it was eight miles said mr piper  eight miles easy walking rejoined mr cox or there’s a train at three o’clock there’s a signpost at the corner there and if you don’t hurry i shall be able to catch you up goodbye  he patted the hesitating mr piper on the back and letting him out through the garden indicated the road then he returned to the drawingroom and carefully rumpling his hair tore his collar from the stud overturned a couple of chairs and a small table and sat down to wait as patiently as he could for the return of his wife  he waited about twenty minutes and then he heard a key turn in the door below and his wife’s footsteps slowly mounting the stairs by the time she reached the drawingroom his tableau was complete and she fell back with a faint shriek at the frenzied figure which met her eyes  hush said the tragedian putting his finger to his lips  henry what is it cried mrs cox what is the matter  the broker’s man said her husband in a thrilling whisper we had words—he struck me in a fit of fury i—i—choked him  much inquired the bewildered woman  much repeated mr cox frantically i’ve killed him and hidden the body now i must escape and fly the country  the bewilderment on mrs cox’s face increased she was trying to reconcile her husband’s statement with a vision of a trim little figure which she had seen ten minutes before with its head tilted backwards studying the signpost and which she was now quite certain was mr piper  are you sure he’s dead she inquired  dead as a door nail replied mr cox promptly i’d no idea he was such a delicate little man what am i to do every moment adds to my danger i must fly how much money have you got  the question explained everything mrs cox closed her lips with a snap and shook her head  don’t play the fool said her husband wildly my neck’s in danger  i haven’t got anything asseverated mrs cox it’s no good looking like that henry i can’t make money  mr cox’s reply was interrupted by a loud knock at the hall door which he was pleased to associate with the police it gave him a fine opportunity for melodrama in the midst of which his wife rightly guessing that mrs berry had returned according to arrangement went to the door to admit her the visitor was only busy two minutes on the doormat but in that time mrs cox was able in low whispers to apprise her of the state of affairs  that’s my uncle all over said mrs berry fiercely that’s just the mean trick i should have expected of him you leave ’em to me my dear  she followed her friend into the drawingroom and having shaken hands with mr cox drew her handkerchief from her pocket and applied it to her eyes  she’s told me all about it she said nodding at mrs cox and it’s worse than you think much worse it isn’t a broker’s man—it’s my poor uncle joseph piper  your uncle repeated mr cox reeling back the broker’s man your uncle  mrs berry sniffed it was a little joke on our part she admitted sinking into a chair and holding her handkerchief to her face poor uncle but i dare say he’s happier where he is  with its head tilted back studyin mr cox wiped his brow and then leaning his elbow on the mantelpiece stared at her in wellsimulated amazement  see what your joking has led to he said at last i have got to be a wanderer over the face of the earth all on account of your jokes  it was an accident murmured mrs berry and nobody knows he was here and i’m sure poor dear he hadn’t got much to live for  it’s very kind of you to look at it in that way susan i’m sure said mrs cox  i was never one to make mischief said mrs berry it’s no good crying over spilt milk if uncle’s killed he’s killed and there’s an end of it but i don’t think it’s quite safe for mr cox to stay here  just what i say said that gentleman eagerly but i’ve got no money  you get away said mrs berry with a warning glance at her friend and nodding to emphasise her words leave us some address to write to and we must try and scrape twenty or thirty pounds to send you  thirty said mr cox hardly able to believe his ears  mrs berry nodded you’ll have to make that do to go on with she said pondering ’and as soon as yoa get it you had better get as far away as possible before poor uncl’e is discovered where are we to send the money  mr cox affected to consider  the white horse newstead he said at length in a whisper better write it down  mrs berry obeyed and this business being completed mr cox after trying in vain to obtain a shilling or two cash in hand bade them a pathetic farewell and went off down the path for some reason best known to himself on tiptoe  for the first two days messrs cox and piper waited with exemplary patience for the remittance the demands of the landlord a man of coarse fibre being met in the meantime by the latter gentleman from his own slender resources they were both reasonable men and knew from experience the difficulty of raising money at short notice but on the fourth day their funds being nearly exhausted an urgent telegram was dispatched to mrs cox  mr cox was alone when the reply came and mr piper returning to the innparlour was amazed and distressed at his friend’s appearance  twice he had to address him before he seemed to be aware of his presence and then mr cox breathing hard and staring at him strangely handed him the message  eh said mr piper in amaze as he read slowly ’no—need—send—money—uncle—joseph—has—come—back—berry’ what does it mean is she mad  mr cox shook his head and taking the paper from him held it at arm’s length and regarded it at an angle  how can you be there when you’re supposed to be dead he said at length  how can i be there when i’m here rejoined mr piper no less reasonably  both gentlemen lapsed into a wondering silence devoted to the attempted solution of their own riddles finally mr cox seized with a bright idea that the telegram had got altered in transmission went off to the postoffice and dispatched another which went straight to the heart of things  don’t—understand—is—uncle—joseph—alive  a reply was brought to the innparlour an hour later on mr cox opened it gave one glance at it and then with a suffocating cry handed it to the other mr piper took it gingerly and his eyebrows almost disappeared as he read  yes—smoking—in—drawingroom  his first strong impression was that it was a case for the psychical research society but this romantic view faded in favour of a simple solution propounded by mr cox with much crispness that mrs berry was leaving the realms of fact for those of romance his actual words were shorter but the meaning is the same  i’ll go home and ask to see you he said fiercely that’ll bring things to a head i should think  and she’ll say i’ve gone back to london perhaps said mr piper gifted with sudden clearness of vision you can’t show her up unless you take me with you and that’ll show us up that’s her artfulness that’s susan all over  she’s a wicked untruthful woman gasped mr cox  i never did like susan said mr piper with acerbity never  mr cox said he could easily understand it and then as a forlorn hope sat down and wrote a long letter to his wife in which after dwelling at great length on the lamentable circumstances surrounding the sudden demise of mr piper he bade her thank mrs berry for her wellmeant efforts to ease his mind and asked for the immediate dispatch of the money promised  a reply came the following evening from mrs berry herself it was a long letter and not only long but badly written and crossed it began with the weather asked after mr cox’s health and referred to the writer’s described with much minuteness a strange headache which had attacked mrs cox together with a long list of the remedies prescribed and the effects of each and wound up in an outoftheway corner in a vein of cheery optimism which reduced both readers to the verge of madness  dear uncle joseph has quite recovered and in spite of a little nervousness—he was always rather timid—at meeting you again has consented to go to the white horse to satisfy you that he is alive i dare say he will be with you as soon as this letter—perhaps help you to read it  mr cox laid the letter down with extreme care and coughing gently glanced in a sheepish fashion at the goggleeyed mr piper  for some time neither of them spoke mr cox was the first to break the silence and—when he had finished—mr piper said hush  besides it does no good he added  it does me good said mr cox recommencing  mr piper held up his hand with a startled gesture for silence the words died away on his friend’s lips as a familiar voice was heard in the passage and the next moment mrs berry entered the room and stood regarding them  i ran down by the same train to make sure you came uncle she remarked how long have you been here  mr piper moistened his lips and gazed wildly at mr cox for guidance  ’bout—’bout five minutes he stammered  we were so glad dear uncle wasn’t hurt much continued mrs berry smiling and shaking her head at mr cox but the idea of your burying him in the geraniumbed we haven’t got him clean yet  mr piper giving utterance to uncouth noises quitted the room hastily but mr cox sat still and stared at her dumbly  weren’t you surprised to see him inquired his tormentor  not after your letter said mr cox finding his voice at last and speaking with an attempt at chilly dignity nothing could surprise me much after that  mrs berry smiled again  ah i’ve got another little surprise for you she said briskly mrs cox was so upset at the idea of being alone while you were a wanderer over the face of the earth that she and i have gone into partnership we have had a proper deed drawn up so that now there are two of us to look after things eh what did you say  i was just thinking said mr cox     sam’s boy   it was getting late in the afternoon as master jones in a somewhat famished condition strolled up aldgate with a keen eye on the gutter in search of anything that would serve him for his tea too late he wished that he had saved some of the stale bread and damaged fruit which had constituted his dinner  aldgate proving barren he turned up into the quieter minories skilfully dodging the mechanical cuff of the constable at the corner as he passed and watching with some interest the efforts of a stray mongrel to get itself adopted its victim had sworn at it cut at it with his stick and even made little runs at it—all to no purpose finally being a softhearted man he was weak enough to pat the cowering schemer on the head and being frantically licked by the homeless one took it up in his arms and walked off with it  billy jones watched the proceedings with interest not untempered by envy if he had only been a dog the dog passed in the man’s arms and with a whine of ecstasy insisted upon licking his ear they went on their way the dog wondering between licks what sort of table the man kept and the man speculating idly as to a descent which appeared to have included among other things an anteater  ’e’s all right said the orphan wistfully no coppers to chivvy ’im about and as much grub as he wants wish i’d been a dog  he tied up his breeches with a piece of string which was lying on the pavement and his hands being now free placed them in a couple of rents which served as pockets and began to whistle he was not a proud boy and was quite willing to take a lesson even from the humblest surely he was as useful as a dog  the thought struck him just as a stout kindlylooking seaman passed with a couple of shipmates it was a goodnatured face and the figure was that of a man who lived well a moment’s hesitation and master jones with a courage born of despair ran after him and tugged him by the sleeve  halloa said mr samuel brown looking round what do you want  want you father said master jones  the jolly seaman’s face broke into a smile so also did the faces of the jolly seaman’s friends  i’m not your father matey he said goodnaturedly  yes you are said the desperate billy you know you are  you’ve made a mistake my lad said mr brown still smiling here run away  he felt in his trouser pocket and produced a penny it was a gift not a bribe but it had by no means the effect its donor intended master jones now quite certain that he had made a wise choice of a father trotted along a yard or two in the rear  look here my lad exclaimed mr brown goaded into action by intercepting a smile with which mr charles legge had favoured mr harry green you run off home  where do you live now inquired billy anxiously  mr green disdaining concealment slapped mr legge on the back and laughing uproariously regarded master jones with much kindness  you mustn’t follow me said sam severely d’ye hear  all right father said the boy dutifully  and don’t call me father vociferated mr brown  why not inquired the youth artlessly  mr legge stopped suddenly and putting his hand on mr green’s shoulder gaspingly expressed his inability to go any farther mr green patting his back said he knew how he felt because he felt the same and turning to sam told him he’d be the death of him if he wasn’t more careful  if you don’t run away said mr brown harshly as he turned to the boy i shall give you a hiding  where am i to run to whimpered master jones dodging off and on  run ’ome said sam  that’s where i’m going said master jones following  better try and give ’im the slip sam said mr legge in a confidential whisper though it seems an unnatural thing to do  unnatural what d’ye mean demanded his unfortunate friend wot d’ye mean by unnatural  oh if you’re going to talk like that sam said mr legge shortly it’s no good giving you advice as you’ve made your bed you must lay on it  how long is it since you saw ’im last matey inquired mr green  i dunno not very long replied the boy cautiously  has he altered at all since you see ’im last inquired the counsel for the defence motioning the fermenting mr brown to keep still  no said billy firmly not a bit  wot’s your name  billy was the reply  billy wot  billy jones  mr green’s face cleared and he turned to his friends with a smile of joyous triumph sam’s face reflected his own but charlie legge’s was still overcast  it ain’t likely he said impressively it ain’t likely as sam would go and get married twice in the same name is it put it to yourself ’arry—would you  look ’ere exclaimed the infuriated mr brown don’t you interfere in my business you’re a crocodile that’s wot you are as for you you little varmint you run off d’ye hear  he moved on swiftly accompanied by the other two and set an example of looking straight ahead of him which was however lost upon his friends  ’e’s still following of you sam said the crocodile in by no means disappointed tones  sticking like a leech confirmed mr green ’e’s a pretty little chap rather  takes arter ’is mother said the vengeful mr legge  the unfortunate sam said nothing but strode a haunted man down nightingale lane into wapping high street and so to the ketch nancy bell which was lying at shrimpett’s wharf he stepped on board without a word and only when he turned to descend the forecastle ladder did his gaze rest for a moment on the small forlorn piece of humanity standing on the wharf  halloa boy what do you want cried the skipper catching sight of him  want my father sir—sam replied the youth who had kept his ears open  the skipper got up from his seat and eyed him curiously messrs legge and green drawing near explained the situation now the skipper was a worldly man and samuel brown ab when at home played a brass instrument in the salvation army band he regarded the boy kindly and spoke to him fair  don’t run away he said anxiously  i’m not going to sir said master jones charmed with his manner and he watched breathlessly as the skipper stepped forward and peering down the forecastle called loudly for sam  yes sir said a worried voice  your boy’s asking after you said the skipper grinning madly  he’s not my boy sir replied mr brown through his clenched teeth  well you’d better come up and see him said the other are you sure he isn’t sam  mr brown made no reply but coming on deck met master jones’s smile of greeting with an icy stare and started convulsively as the skipper beckoned him aboard  he’s been rather neglected sam said the skipper shaking his head  wot’s it got to do with me said sam violently i tell you i’ve never seen ’im afore this arternoon  you hear what your father says said the skipper—hold your tongue sam where’s your mother boy  dead sir whined master jones i’ve on’y got ’im now  the skipper was a kindhearted man and he looked pityingly at the forlorn little figure by his side and sam was the good man of the ship and a leading light at dimport  how would you like to come to sea with your father he inquired  the grin of delight with which master jones received this proposal was sufficient reply  i wouldn’t do it for everybody pursued the skipper glancing severely at the mate who was behaving foolishly but i don’t mind obliging you sam he can come  obliging repeated mr brown hardly able to get the words out obliging me i don’t want to be obliged  there there interrupted the skipper i don’t want any thanks take him forrard and give him something to eat—he looks halfstarved poor little chap  he turned away and went down to the cabin while the cook whom mr brown had publicly rebuked for his sins the day before led the boy to the galley and gave him a good meal after that was done charlie washed him and harry going ashore begged a muchworn suit of boy’s clothes from a foreman of his acquaintance he also brought back a message from the foreman to mr brown to the effect that he was surprised at him  the conversation that evening after master jones was asleep turned upon bigamy but mr brown snored through it all though mr legge’s remark that the revelations of that afternoon had thrown a light upon many little things in his behaviour which had hitherto baffled him came perilously near to awaking him  at six in the morning they got under way the boy going nearly frantic with delight as sail after sail was set and the ketch with a stiff breeze rapidly left london behind her mr brown studiously ignored him but the other men pampered him to his heart’s content and even the cabin was good enough to manifest a little concern in his welfare the skipper calling mr brown up no fewer than five times that day to complain about his son’s behaviour  i can’t have somersaults on this ’ere ship sam he remarked shaking his head it ain’t the place for ’em  i wonder at you teaching ’im such things said the mate in grave disapprobation  me said the hapless sam trembling with passion  he must ’ave seen you do it said the mate letting his eye rove casually over sam’s ample proportions you must ha’ been leading a double life altogether sam  that’s nothing to do with us interrupted the skipper impatiently i don’t mind sam turning cartwheels all day if it amuses him but they mustn’t do it here that’s all it’s no good standing there sulking sam i can’t have it  he turned away and mr brown unable to decide whether he was mad or drunk or both walked back and squeezing himself up in the bows looked miserably over the sea behind him the men disported themselves with master jones and once looking over his shoulder he actually saw the skipper giving him a lesson in steering  by the following afternoon he was in such a state of collapse that when they put in at the small port of withersea to discharge a portion of their cargo he obtained permission to stay below in his bunk work proceeded without him and at nine o’clock in the evening they sailed again and it was not until they were a couple of miles on their way to dimport that mr legge rushed aft with the announcement that he was missing  don’t talk nonsense said the skipper as he came up from below in response to a hail from the mate  it’s a fact sir said mr legge shaking his head  what’s to be done with the boy demanded the mate blankly  sam’s a unsteady unreliable tricky old man exclaimed the skipper hotly the idea of going and leaving a boy on our hands like that i’m surprised at him i’m disappointed in sam—deserting  i expect ’e’s larfing like anything sir remarked mr legge  get forrard said the skipper sharply get forrard at once d’ye hear  but what’s to be done with the boy—that’s what i want to know said the mate  what d’ye think’s to be done with him bawled the skipper we can’t chuck him overboard can we  i mean when we get to dimport growled the mate  well the men’ll talk said the skipper calming down a little and perhaps sam’s wife’ll come and take him if not i suppose he’ll have to go to the workhouse anyway it’s got nothing to do with me i wash my hands of it altogether  he went below again leaving the mate at the wheel a murmur of voices came from the forecastle where the crew were discussing the behaviour of their late colleague the bereaved master jones whose face was streaky with the tears of disappointment looked on from his bunk  what are you going to do billy inquired the cook  i dunno said the boy miserably  he sat up in his bunk in a brown study ever and anon turning his sharp little eyes from one to another of the men then with a final sniff to the memory of his departed parent he composed himself to sleep  with the buoyancy of childhood he had forgotten his trouble by the morning and ran idly about the ship as before until in the afternoon they came in sight of dimport mr legge who had a considerable respect for the brain hidden in that small head pointed it out to him and with some curiosity waited for his remarks  i can see it said master jones briefly  that’s where sam lives said his friend pointedly  yes said the boy nodding all of you live there don’t you  it was an innocent enough remark in all conscience but there was that in master jones’s eye which caused mr legge to move away hastily and glance at him in some disquietude from the other side of the deck the boy unconscious of the interest excited by his movements walked restlessly up and down  boy’s worried said the skipper aside to the mate cheer up sonny  billy looked up and smiled and the cloud which had sat on his brow when he thought of the coldblooded desertion of mr brown gave way to an expression of serene content  well what’s he going to do inquired the mate in a low voice  that needn’t worry us said the skipper  let things take their course that’s my motto  he took the wheel from harry the little town came closer the houses separated and disclosed roads and the boy discovered to his disappointment that the church stood on ground of its own and not on the roof of a large red house as he had supposed he ran forward as they got closer and perching up in the bows until they were fast to the quay looked round searchingly for any signs of sam  the skipper locked up the cabin and then calling on one of the shore hands to keep an eye on the forecastle left it open for the convenience of the small passenger harry charlie and the cook stepped ashore the skipper and mate followed and the latter looking back from some distance called his attention to the desolate little figure sitting on the hatch  i s’pose he’ll be all right said the skipper uneasily there’s food and a bed down the fo’c’s’le you might just look round tonight and see he’s safe i expect we’ll have to take him back to london with us  they turned up a small road in the direction of home and walked on in silence until the mate glancing behind at an acquaintance who had just passed uttered a sharp exclamation the skipper turned and a small figure which had just shot round the corner stopped in midcareer and eyed them warily the men exchanged uneasy glances  father cried a small voice  he—he’s adopted you now said the skipper huskily  or you said the mate i never took much notice of him  he looked round again master jones was following briskly about ten yards in the rear and twenty yards behind him came the crew who having seen him quit the ship had followed with the evident intention of being in at the death  father cried the boy again wait for me  one or two passersby stared in astonishment and the mate began to be uneasy as to the company he was keeping  let’s separate he growled and see who he’s calling after  the skipper caught him by the arm shout out to him to go back he cried  it’s you he’s after i tell you said the mate who do you want billy  i want my father cried the youth and to prevent any mistake indicated the raging skipper with his finger  who do you want bellowed the latter in a frightful voice  want you father chirrupped master jones  wrath and dismay struggled for supremacy in the skipper’s face and he paused to decide whether it would be better to wipe master jones off the face of the earth or to pursue his way in all the strength of conscious innocence he chose the latter course and a shade more erect than usual walked on until he came in sight of his house and his wife who was standing at the door  you come along o’ me jem and explain he whispered to the mate then he turned about and hailed the crew the crew flattered at being offered front seats in the affair came forward eagerly  what’s the matter inquired mrs hunt eyeing the crowd in amazement as it grouped itself in anticipation  nothing said her husband offhandedly  who’s that boy cried the innocent woman  it’s a poor little mad boy began the skipper he came aboard—  i’m not mad father interrupted master jones  a poor little mad boy continued the skipper hastily who came aboard in london and said poor old sam brown was his father  no—you father cried the boy shrilly  he calls everybody his father said the skipper with a smile of anguish that’s the form his madness takes he called jem here his father  no he didn’t said the mate bluntly  and then he thought charlie was his father  no sir said mr legge with respectful firmness  well he said sam brown was said the skipper  yes that’s right sir said the crew where is sam inquired mrs hunt looking round expectantly  he deserted the ship at withersea said her husband  i see said mrs hunt with a bitter smile and these men have all come up prepared to swear that the boy said sam was his father haven’t you  yes mum chorused the crew delighted at being understood so easily  mrs hunt looked across the road to the fields stretching beyond then she suddenly brought her gaze back and looking full at her husband uttered just two words—  oh joe  ask the mate cried the frantic skipper  yes i know what the mate’ll say said mrs hunt i’ve no need to ask him  charlie and harry were with sam when the boy came up to them protested the skipper  i’ve no doubt said his wife oh joe joe joe  there was an uncomfortable silence during which the crew standing for the most part on one leg in sympathy with their chief’s embarrassment nudged each other to say something to clear the character of a man whom all esteemed  you ungrateful little devil burst out mr legge at length arter the kind way the skipper treated you too  did he treat him kindly inquired the captain’s wife in conversational tones  like a fa—like a uncle mum said the thoughtless mr legge gave ’im a passage on the ship and fairly spoilt ’im we was all surprised at the fuss ’e made of ’im wasn’t we harry  he turned to his friend but on mr green’s face there was an expression of such utter scorn and contempt that his own fell he glanced at the skipper and was almost frightened at his appearance  the situation was ended by mrs hunt entering the house and closing the door with an ominous bang the men slunk off headed by mr legge and the mate after a few murmured words of encouragement to the skipper also departed captain hunt looked first at the small cause of his trouble who had drawn off to some distance and then at the house then with a determined gesture he turned the handle of the door and walked in his wife who was sitting in an armchair with her eyes on the floor remained motionless  look here polly— he began  don’t talk to me was the reply i wonder you can look me in the face  the skipper ground his teeth and strove to maintain an air of judicial calm  if you’ll only be reasonable— he remarked severely  i thought there was something secret going on said mrs hunt i’ve often looked at you when you’ve been sitting in that chair with a worried look on your face and wondered what it was but i never thought it was so bad as this i’ll do you the credit to say that i never thought of such a thing as this what did you say what  i said ’damn’ said the skipper explosively  yes i’ve no doubt said his wife fiercely you think you’re going to carry it off with a high hand and bluster but you won’t bluster me my man i’m not one of your meek and mild women who’ll put up with anything i’m not one of your—  i tell you said the skipper that the boy calls everybody his father i dare say he’s claimed another by this time  even as he spoke the handle turned and the door opening a few inches disclosed the anxious face of master jones mrs hunt catching the skipper’s eye pointed to it in an ecstasy of silent wrath there was a breathless pause broken at last by the boy  mother he said softly  mrs hunt stiffened in her chair and her arms fell by her side as she gazed in speechless amazement master jones opening the door a little wider gently insinuated his small figure into the room the skipper gave one glance at his wife and then turning hastily away put his hand over his mouth and with protruding eyes gazed out of the window  mother can i come in said the boy  oh polly sighed the skipper mrs hunt strove to regain the utterance of which astonishment had deprived her  i what joe don’t be a fool  yes i’ve no doubt said the skipper theatrically oh polly polly polly  he put his hand over his mouth again and laughed silently until his wife coming behind him took him by the shoulders and shook him violently  this said the skipper choking this is what—you’ve been worried about—— this is the secret what’s—  he broke off suddenly as his wife thrust him by main force into a chair and standing over him with a fiery face dared him to say another word then she turned to the boy  what do you mean by calling me ’mother’ she demanded i’m not your mother  yes you are said master jones  mrs hunt eyed him in bewilderment and then roused to a sense of her position by a renewed gurgling from the skipper’s chair set to work to try and thump that misguided man into a more serious frame of mind failing in this she sat down and after a futile struggle began to laugh herself and that so heartily that master jones smiling sympathetically closed the door and came boldly into the room  the statement generally believed that captain hunt and his wife adopted him is incorrect the skipper accounting for his continued presence in the house by the simple explanation that he had adopted them an explanation which mr samuel brown for one finds quite easy of acceptance     jerry bundler   it wanted a few nights to christmas a festival for which the small market town of torchcster was making extensive preparations the narrow streets which had been thronged with people were now almost deserted the cheapjack from london with the remnant of breath left him after his evening’s exertions was making feeble attempts to blow out his naphtha lamp and the last shops open were rapidly closing for the night  in the comfortable coffeeroom of the old boar’s head half a dozen guests principally commercial travellers sat talking by the light of the fire the talk had drifted from trade to politics from politics to religion and so by easy stages to the supernatural three ghost stories never known to fail before had fallen flat there was too much noise outside too much light within the fourth story was told by an old hand with more success the streets were quiet and he had turned the gas out in the flickering light of the fire as it shone on the glasses and danced with shadows on the walls the story proved so enthralling that george the waiter whose presence had been forgotten created a very disagreeable sensation by suddenly starting up from a dark corner and gliding silently from the room that’s what i call a good story said one of the men sipping his hot whisky of course it’s an old idea that spirits like to get into the company of human beings a man told me once that he travelled down the great western with a ghost and hadn’t the slightest suspicion of it until the inspector came for tickets my friend said the way that ghost tried to keep up appearances by feeling for it in all its pockets and looking on the floor was quite touching ultimately it gave it up and with a faint groan vanished through the ventilator  that’ll do hirst said another man  it’s not a subject for jesting said a little old gentleman who had been an attentive listener i’ve never seen an apparition myself but i know people who have and i consider that they form a very interesting link between us and the afterlife there’s a ghost story connected with this house you know  never heard of it said another speaker and i’ve been here some years now  it dates back a long time now said the old gentleman you’ve heard about jerry bundler george  well i’ve just ’eard odds and ends sir said the old waiter but i never put much count to ’em there was one chap ’ere what said ’e saw it and the gov’ner sacked ’im prompt  my father was a native of this town said the old gentleman and knew the story well he was a truthful man and a steady churchgoer but i’ve heard him declare that once in his life he saw the appearance of jerry bundler in this house  and who was this bundler inquired a voice  a london thief pickpocket highwayman—anything he could turn his dishonest hand to replied the old gentleman and he was run to earth in this house one christmas week some eighty years ago he took his last supper in this very room and after he had gone up to bed a couple of bow street runners who had followed him from london but lost the scent a bit went upstairs with the landlord and tried the door it was stout oak and fast so one went into the yard and by means of a short ladder got onto the windowsill while the other stayed outside the door those below in the yard saw the man crouching on the sill and then there was a sudden smash of glass and with a cry he fell in a heap on the stones at their feet then in the moonlight they saw the white face of the pickpocket peeping over the sill and while some stayed in the yard others ran into the house and helped the other man to break the door in it was difficult to obtain an entrance even then for it was barred with heavy furniture but they got in at last and the first thing that met their eyes was the body of jerry dangling from the top of the bed by his own handkerchief  which bedroom was it asked two or three voices together  the narrator shook his head that i can’t tell you but the story goes that jerry still haunts this house and my father used to declare positively that the last time he slept here the ghost of jerry bundler lowered itself from the top of his bed and tried to strangle him  that’ll do said an uneasy voice i wish you’d thought to ask your father which bedroom it was  what for inquired the old gentleman  well i should take care not to sleep in it that’s all said the voice shortly  there’s nothing to fear said the other i don’t believe for a moment that ghosts could reallyhurt one in fact my father used to confess that it was only the unpleasantness of the thing that upset him and that for all practical purposes jerry’s fingers might have been made of cottonwool for all the harm they could do  that’s all very fine said the last speaker again a ghost story is a ghost story sir but when a gentleman tells a tale of a ghost in the house in which one is going to sleep i call it most ungentlemanly  pooh nonsense said the old gentleman rising ghosts can’t hurt you for my own part i should rather like to see one good night gentlemen  good night said the others and i only hope jerry’ll pay you a visit added the nervous man as the door closed  bring some more whisky george said a stout commercial i want keeping up when the talk turns this way  shall i light the gas mr malcolm said george  no the fire’s very comfortable said the traveller now gentlemen any of you know any more  i think we’ve had enough said another man we shall be thinking we see spirits next and we’re not all like the old gentleman who’s just gone  old humbug said hirst i should like to put him to the test suppose i dress up as jerry bundler and go and give him a chance of displaying his courage  bravo said malcolm huskily drowning one or two faint noes just for the joke gentlemen  no no drop it hirst said another man  only for the joke said hirst somewhat eagerly i’ve got some things upstairs in which i am going to play in the rivals—kneebreeches buckles and all that sort of thing it’s a rare chance if you’ll wait a bit i’ll give you a fulldress rehearsal entitled ’jerry bundler or the nocturnal strangler’  you won’t frighten us said the commercial with a husky laugh  i don’t know that said hirst sharply it’s a question of acting that’s all i’m pretty good ain’t i somers  oh you’re all right—for an amateur said his friend with a laugh  i’ll bet you a level sov you don’t frighten me said the stout traveller  done said hirst i’ll take the bet to frighten you first and the old gentleman afterwards these gentlemen shall be the judges  you won’t frighten us sir said another man because we’re prepared for you but you’d better leave the old man alone it’s dangerous play  well i’ll try you first said hirst springing up no gas mind  he ran lightly upstairs to his room leaving the others most of whom had been drinking somewhat freely to wrangle about his proceedings it ended in two of them going to bed  he’s crazy on acting said somers lighting his pipe thinks he’s the equal of anybody almost it doesn’t matter with us but i won’t let him go to the old man and he won’t mind so long as he gets an opportunity of acting to us  well i hope he’ll hurry up said malcolm yawning it’s after twelve now  nearly half an hour passed malcolm drew his watch from his pocket and was busy winding it when george the waiter who had been sent on an errand to the bar burst suddenly into the room and rushed towards them  ’e’s comin’ gentlemen he said breathlessly  why you’re frightened george said the stout commercial with a chuckle  it was the suddenness of it said george sheepishly and besides i didn’t look for seein’ ’im in the bar there’s only a glimmer of light there and ’e was sitting on the floor behind the bar i nearly trod on ’im  oh you’ll never make a man george said malcolm  well it took me unawares said the waiter not that i’d have gone to the bar by myself if i’d known ’e was there and i don’t believe you would either sir  nonsense said malcolm i’ll go and fetch him in  you don’t know what it’s like sir said george catching him by the sleeve it ain’t fit to look at by yourself it ain’t indeed it’s got the—what’s that  they all started at the sound of a smothered cry from the staircase and the sound of somebody running hurriedly along the passage before anybody could speak the door flew open and a figure bursting into the room flung itself gasping and shivering upon them  what is it what’s the matter demanded malcolm why it’s mr hirst he shook him roughly and then held some spirit to his lips hirst drank it greedily and with a sharp intake of his breath gripped him by the arm  light the gas george said malcolm  the waiter obeyed hastily hirst a ludicrous but pitiable figure in kneebreeches and coat a large wig all awry and his face a mess of grease paint clung to him trembling  now what’s the matter asked malcolm  i’ve seen it said hirst with a hysterical sob o lord i’ll never play the fool again never  seen what said the others  him—it—the ghost—anything said hirst wildly  rot said malcolm uneasily  i was coming down the stairs said hirst just capering down—as i thought—it ought to do i felt a tap—  he broke off suddenly and peered nervously through the open door into the passage  i thought i saw it again he whispered  look—at the foot of the stairs can you see anything  no there’s nothing there said malcolm whose own voice shook a little go on you felt a tap on your shoulder—  i turned round and saw it—a little wicked head and a white dead face pah  that’s what i saw in the bar said george ’orrid it was—devilish  hirst shuddered and still retaining his nervous grip of malcolm’s sleeve dropped into a chair  well it’s a most unaccountable thing said the dumbfounded malcolm turning round to the others it’s the last time i come to this house  i leave tomorrow said george i wouldn’t go down to that bar again by myself no not for fifty pounds  it’s talking about the thing that’s caused it i expect said one of the men we’ve all been talking about this and having it in our minds practically we’ve been forming a spiritualistic circle without knowing it  hang the old gentleman said malcolm heartily upon my soul i’m half afraid to go to bed it’s odd they should both think they saw something  i saw it as plain as i see you sir said george solemnly p’raps if you keep your eyes turned up the passage you’ll see it for yourself  they followed the direction of his finger but saw nothing although one of them fancied that a head peeped round the corner of the wall  who’ll come down to the bar said malcolm looking round  you can go if you like said one of the others with a faint laugh we’ll wait here for you  the stout traveller walked towards the door and took a few steps up the passage then he stopped all was quite silent and he walked slowly to the end and looked down fearfully towards the glass partition which shut off the bar three times he made as though to go to it then he turned back and glancing over his shoulder came hurriedly back to the room  did you see it sir whispered george  don’t know said malcolm shortly i fancied i saw something but it might have been fancy i’m in the mood to see anything just now how are you feeling now sir  oh i feel a bit better now said hirst somewhat brusquely as all eyes were turned upon him  i dare say you think i’m easily scared but you didn’t see it  not at all said malcolm smiling faintly despite himself  i’m going to bed said hirst noticing the smile and resenting it will you share my room with me somers  i will with pleasure said his friend provided you don’t mind sleeping with the gas on full all night  he rose from his seat and bidding the company a friendly goodnight left the room with his crestfallen friend the others saw them to the foot of the stairs and having heard their door close returned to the coffeeroom  well i suppose the bet’s off said the stout commercial poking the fire and then standing with his legs apart on the hearthrug though as far as i can see i won it i never saw a man so scared in all my life sort of poetic justice about it isn’t there  never mind about poetry or justice said one of his listeners who’s going to sleep with me  i will said malcolm affably  and i suppose we share a room together mr leek said the third man turning to the fourth  no thank you said the other briskly i don’t believe in ghosts if anything comes into my room i shall shoot it  that won’t hurt a spirit leek said malcolm decisively  well the noise’ll be like company to me said leek and it’ll wake the house too but if you’re nervous sir he added with a grin to the man who had suggested sharing his room george’ll be only too pleased to sleep on the doormat inside your room i know  that i will sir said george fervently and if you gentlemen would only come down with me to the bar to put the gas out i could never be sufficiently grateful  they went out in a body with the exception of leek peering carefully before them as they went george turned the light out in the bar and they returned unmolested to the coffeeroom and avoiding the sardonic smile of leek prepared to separate for the night  give me the candle while you put the gas out george said the traveller  the waiter handed it to him and extinguished the gas and at the same moment all distinctly heard a step in the passage outside it stopped at the door and as they watched with bated breath the door creaked and slowly opened malcolm fell back openmouthed as a white leering face with sunken eyeballs and closecropped bullet head appeared at the opening  for a few seconds the creature stood regarding them blinking in a strange fashion at the candle then with a sidling movement it came a little way into the room and stood there as if bewildered  not a man spoke or moved but all watched with a horrible fascination as the creature removed its dirty neckcloth and its head rolled on its shoulder for a minute it paused and then holding the rag before it moved towards malcolm  the candle went out suddenly with a flash and a bang there was a smell of powder and something writhing in the darkness on the floor a faint choking cough and then silence malcolm was the first to speak matches he said in a strange voice george struck one then he leapt at the gas and a burner flamed from the match malcolm touched the thing on the floor with his foot and found it soft he looked at his companions they mouthed inquiries at him but he shook his head he lit the candle and kneeling down examined the silent thing on the floor then he rose swiftly and dipping his handkerchief in the waterjug bent down again and grimly wiped the white face then he sprang back with a cry of incredulous horror pointing at it leek’s pistol fell to the floor and he shut out the sight with his hands but the others crowding forward gazed spellbound at the dead face of hirst  before a word was spoken the door opened and somers hastily entered the room his eyes fell on the floor good god he cried you didn’t—  nobody spoke  i told him not to he said in a suffocating voice i told him not to i told him—  he leaned against the wall deathly sick put his arms out feebly and fell fainting into the traveller’s arms     false colours   of course there is a deal of bullying done at sea at times said the nightwatchman thoughtfully ’the men call it bullying an’ the officers call it discipline but it’s the same thing under another name still it’s fair in a way it gets passed on from one to another everybody aboard a’most has got somebody to bully except perhaps the boy he ’as the worst of it unless he can manage to get the ship’s cat by itself occasionally  i don’t think sailormen mind being bullied i never ’eard of its putting one off ’is feed yet and that’s the main thing arter all’s said and done  fust officers are often worse than skippers in the fust place they know they ain’t skippers an’ that alone is enough to put ’em in a bad temper especially if they’ve ’ad their certifikit a good many years and can’t get a vacancy  i remember a good many years ago now i was lying at calcutta one time in the peewit as fine a barque as you’d wish to see an’ we ’ad a fust mate there as was a disgrace to ’is sects a nasty bullying violent man who used to call the hands names as they didn’t know the meanings of and what was no use looking in the dictionary for  there was one chap aboard bill cousins as he used to make a partikler mark of bill ’ad the misfortin to ’ave red ’air and the way the mate used to throw that in ’is face was disgraceful fortunately for us all the skipper was a very decent sort of man so that the mate was only at ’is worst when he wasn’t by  we was sitting in the fo’c’s’le at tea one arternoon when bill cousins came down an’ we see at once ’e’d ’ad a turn with the mate he sat all by hisself for some time simmering an’ then he broke out ’one o’ these days i’ll swing for ’im mark my words’  ’don’t be a fool bill’ ses joe smith  ’if i could on’y mark ’im’ ses bill catching his breath ’just mark ’im fair an’ square if i could on’y ’ave ’im alone for ten minutes with nobody standing by to see fair play but o’ course if i ’it ’im it’s mutiny’  ’you couldn’t do it if it wasn’t bill’ ses joe smith again  ’he walks about the town as though the place belongs to ’im’ said ted hill ’most of us is satisfied to shove the niggers out o’ the way but he ups fist and ’its ’em if they comes within a yard of ’im’  ’why don’t they ’it ’im back’ ses bill ’i would if i was them’  joe smith grunted ’well why don’t you’ he asked  ’’cos i ain’t a nigger’ ses bill  ’well but you might be’ ses joe very softly ’black your face an’ ’ands an’ legs and dress up in them cotton things and go ashore and get in ’is way’  ’if you will i will bill’ ses a chap called bob pullin  well they talked it over and over and at last joe who seemed to take a great interest in it went ashore and got the duds for ’em they was a tight fit for bill hindoos not being as wide as they might be but joe said if ’e didn’t bend about he’d be all right and pullin who was a smaller man said his was fust class  after they were dressed the next question was wot to use to colour them with coal was too scratchy an’ ink bill didn’t like then ted hill burnt a cork and started on bill’s nose with it afore it was cool an’ bill didn’t like that  ’look ’ere’ ses the carpenter ’nothin’ seems to please you bill—it’s my opinion you’re backing out of it’  ’you’re a liar’ ses bill  ’well i’ve got some stuff in a can as might be boileddown hindoo for all you could tell to the difference’ ses the carpenter ’and if you’ll keep that ugly mouth of yours shut i’ll paint you myself’  well bill was a bit flattered the carpenter being a very superior sort of a man and quite an artist in ’is way an’ bill sat down an’ let ’im do ’im with some stuff out of a can that made ’im look like a hindoo what ’ad been polished then bob pullin was done too an’ when they’d got their turbins on the change in their appearance was wonderful  ’feels a bit stiff’ ses bill working ’is mouth  ’that’ll wear off’ ses the carpenter ’it wouldn’t be you if you didn’t ’ave a grumble bill’  ’and mind and don’t spare ’im bill’ ses joe ’there’s two of you an’ if you only do wot’s expected of you the mate ought to ’ave a easy time abed this v’y’ge’  ’let the mate start fust’ ses ted hill ’he’s sure to start on you if you only get in ’is way lord i’d like to see his face when you start on ’im  well the two of ’em went ashore arter dark with the best wishes o’ all on board an’ the rest of us sat down in the fo’c’s’le spekerlating as to what sort o’ time the mate was goin’ to ’ave he went ashore all right because ted hill see ’im go an’ he noticed with partikler pleasure as ’ow he was dressed very careful  it must ha’ been near eleven o’clock i was sitting with smith on the port side o’ the galley when we heard a ’ubbub approaching the ship it was the mate just coming aboard he was without ’is ’at ’is necktie was twisted round ’is ear and ’is shirt and ’is collar was all torn to shreds the second and third officers ran up to him to see what was the matter and while he was telling them up comes the skipper  ’you don’t mean to tell me mr fingall’ ses the skipper in surprise ’that you’ve been knocked about like that by them mild and meek hindoos’  ’hindoos sir’ roared the mate ’certainly not sir i’ve been assaulted like this by five german sailormen and i licked ’em all’  ’i’m glad to hear that’ ses the skipper and the second and third pats the mate on the back just like you pat a dog you don’t know  ’big fellows they was’ ses he ’an’ they give me some trouble look at my eye’  the second officer struck a match and looked at it and it cert’n’y was a beauty  ’i hope you reported this at the police station’ ses the skipper  ’no sir’ ses the mate holding up ’is ’ead ’i don’t want no p’lice to protect me five’s a large number but i drove ’em off and i don’t think they’ll meddle with any british fust officers again’  ’you’d better turn in’ ses the second leading him off by the arm  the mate limped off with him and as soon as the coast was clear we put our ’eads together and tried to make out how it was that bill cousins and bob ’ad changed themselves into five german sailormen  ’it’s the mate’s pride’ ses the carpenter ’he didn’t like being knocked about by hindoos’  we thought it was that but we had to wait nearly another hour afore the two came aboard to make sure there was a difference in the way they came aboard too from that of the mate they didn’t make no noise and the fust thing we knew of their coming aboard was seeing a bare black foot waving feebly at the top of the fo’c’s’le ladder feelin’ for the step  that was bob he came down without a word and then we see ’e was holding another black foot and guiding it to where it should go that was bill an’ of all the ’orrid limplooking blacks that you ever see bill was the worst when he got below he just sat on a locker all of a heap and held ’is ’ead which was swollen up in ’is hands bob went and sat beside ’im and there they sat for all the world like two wax figgers instead o’ human beings  ’well you done it bill’ ses joe after waiting a long time for them to speak ’tell us all about it’  ’nothin’ to tell’ ses bill very surly ’we knocked ’im about’  ’and he knocked us about’ ses bob with a groan ’i’m sore all over and as for my feet—’  ’wot’s the matter with them’ ses joe  ’trod on’ ses bob very short ’if my bare feet was trod on once they was a dozen times i’ve never ’ad such a doing in all my life he fought like a devil i thought he’d ha’ murdered bill’  ’i wish ’e ’ad’ ses bill with a groan ’my face is bruised and cut about cruel i can’t bear to touch it’  ’do you mean to say the two of you couldn’t settle ’im’ ses joe staring  ’i mean to say we got a hiding’ ses bill ’we got close to him fust start off and got our feet trod on arter that it was like fighting a windmill with sledgehammers for sails’  he gave a groan and turned over in his bunk and when we asked him some more about it he swore at us they both seemed quite done up and at last they dropped off to sleep just as they was without even stopping to wash the black off or to undress themselves  i was awoke rather early in the morning by the sounds of somebody talking to themselves and a little splashing of water it seemed to go on a long while and at last i leaned out of my bunk and see bill bending over a bucket and washing himself and using bad langwidge  ’wot’s the matter bill’ ses joe yawning and sitting up in bed  ’my skin’s that tender i can hardly touch it’ ses bill bending down and rinsing ’is face ’is it all orf’  ’orf’ ses joe ’no o’ course it ain’t why don’t you use some soap’  ’soap’ answers bill madlike ’why i’ve used more soap than i’ve used for six months in the ordinary way’  that’s no good’ ses joe ’give yourself a good wash’  bill put down the soap then very careful and went over to ’im and told him all the dreadful things he’d do to him when he got strong agin and then bob pullin got out of his bunk an’ ’ad a try on his face him an’ bill kept washing and then taking each other to the light and trying to believe it was coming off until they got sick of it and then bill ’e up with his foot and capsized the bucket and walked up and down the fo’c’s’le raving  ’well the carpenter put it on’ ses a voice ’make ’im take it orf’  you wouldn’t believe the job we ’ad to wake that man up he wasn’t fairly woke till he was hauled out of ’is bunk an’ set down opposite them two pore black fellers an’ told to make ’em white again  ’i don’t believe as there’s anything will touch it’ he says at last ’i forgot all about that’  ’do you mean to say’ bawls bill ’that we’ve got to be black all the rest of our life’  ’cert’nly not’ ses the carpenter indignantly ’it’ll wear off in time shaving every morning ’ll ’elp it i should say’  ’i’ll get my razor now’ ses bill in a awful voice ’don’t let ’im go bob i’ll ’ack ’is head orf’  he actually went off an’ got his razor but o’ course we jumped out o’ our bunks and got between ’em and told him plainly that it was not to be and then we set ’em down and tried everything we could think of from butter and linseed oil to cold tealeaves used as a poultice and all it did was to make ’em shinier an’ shinier  ’it’s no good i tell you’ ses the carpenter ’it’s the most lasting black i know if i told you how much that stuff is a can you wouldn’t believe me’  ’well you’re in it’ ses bill his voice all of a tremble ’you done it so as we could knock the mate about whatever’s done to us’ll be done to you too’  ’i don’t think turps’ll touch it’ ses the carpenter getting up ’but we’ll ’ave a try’  he went and fetched the can and poured some out on a bit o’ rag and told bill to dab his face with it bill give a dab and the next moment he rushed over with a scream and buried his head in a shirt what simmons was wearing at the time and began to wipe his face with it then he left the flustered simmons an’ shoved another chap away from the bucket and buried his face in it and kicked and carried on like a madman then ’e jumped into his bunk again and buried ’is face in the clothes and rocked hisself and moaned as if he was dying  ’don’t you use it bob’ he ses at last  ’’tain’t likely’ ses bob ’it’s a good thing you tried it fust bill’  ’’ave they tried holystone’ ses a voice from a bunk  ’no they ain’t’ ses bob snappishly ’and what’s more they ain’t goin’ to’  both o’ their tempers was so bad that we let the subject drop while we was at breakfast the orkard persition of affairs could no longer be disregarded fust one chap threw out a ’int and then another gradually getting a little stronger and stronger until bill turned round in a uncomfortable way and requested of us to leave off talking with our mouths full and speak up like englishmen wot we meant  ’you see it’s this way bill’ ses joe softlike ’as soon as the mate sees you there’ll be trouble for all of us’  ’for all of us’ repeats bill nodding  ’whereas’ ses joe looking round for support ’if we gets up a little collection for you and you should find it convenient to desart’  ’’ear ’ear’ ses a lot o’ voices ’bravo joe’  ’oh desart is it’ ses bill ’an’ where are we goin’ to desart to’  ’well that we leave to you’ ses joe ’there’s many a ship short’anded as would be glad to pick up sich a couple of prime sailormen as you an’ bob’  ’ah an’ wot about our black faces’ ses bill still in the same sneering ungrateful sort o’ voice  ’that can be got over’ ses joe  ’ow’ ses bill and bob together  ’ship as nigger cooks’ ses joe slapping his knee and looking round triumphant  it’s no good trying to do some people a kindness joe was perfectly sincere and nobody could say but wot it wasn’t a good idea but o’ course mr bill cousins must consider hisself insulted and i can only suppose that the trouble he’d gone through ’ad affected his brain likewise bob pullin’s anyway that’s the only excuse i can make for ’em to cut a long story short nobody ’ad any more breakfast and no time to do anything until them two men was scrouged up in a corner an’ ’eld there unable to move  ’i’d never ’ave done ’em’ ses the carpenter arter it was all over ’if i’d know they was goin’ to carry on like this they wanted to be done’  the mate’ll half murder ’em’ ses ted hill  ’he’ll ’ave ’em sent to gaol that’s wot he’ll do’ ses smith ’it’s a serious matter to go ashore and commit assault and battery on the mate’  ’you’re all in it’ ses the voice o’ bill from the floor ’i’m going to make a clean breast of it joe smith put us up to it the carpenter blacked us and the others encouraged us’  ’joe got the clothes for us’ ses bob ’i know the place he got ’em from too’  the ingratitude o’ these two men was sich that at first we decided to have no more to do with them but better feelings prevailed and we held a sort o’ meeting to consider what was best to be done an’ everything that was suggested one o’ them two voices from the floor found fault with and wouldn’t ’ave and at last we ’ad to go up on deck with nothing decided upon except to swear ’ard and fast as we knew nothing about it  the only advice we can give you’ ses joe looking back at ’em ’is to stay down ’ere as long as you can’  a’most the fust person we see on deck was the mate an’ a pretty sight he was he’d got a bandage round ’is left eye and a black ring round the other his nose was swelled and his lip cut but the other officers were making sich a fuss over ’im that i think he rather gloried in it than otherwise  ’where’s them other two ’ands’ he ses by and by glaring out of ’is black eye  ’down below sir i b’lieve’ ses the carpenter all of a tremble  ’go an’ send ’em up’ ses the mate to smith  ’yessir’ ses joe without moving  ’well go on then’ roars the mate  ’they ain’t over and above well sir this morning’ ses joe  ’send ’em up confound you’ ses the mate limping towards ’im  well joe give ’is shoulders a ’elpless sort o’ shrug and walked forward and bawled down the fo’c’s’le  ’they’re coming sir’ he ses walking bade to the mate just as the skipper came out of ’is cabin  we all went on with our work as ’ard as we knew ’ow the skipper was talking to the mate about ’is injuries and saying unkind things about germans when he give a sort of a shout and staggered back staring we just looked round and there was them two blackamoors coming slowly towards us  ’good heavens mr fingall’ ses the old man ’what’s this’  i never see sich a look on any man’s face as i saw on the mate’s then three times ’e opened ’is mouth to speak and shut it agin without saying anything the veins on ’is forehead swelled up tremendous and ’is cheeks was all blown out purple  that’s bill cousins’s hair’ ses the skipper to himself ’it’s bill cousins’s hair it’s bill cous—’  bob walked up to him with bill lagging a little way behind and then he stops just in front of ’im and fetches up a sort o’ little smile  ’don’t you make those faces at me sir’ roars the skipper ’what do you mean by it what have you been doing to yourselves’  ’nothin’ sir’ ses bill ’umbly ’it was done to us’  the carpenter who was just going to cooper up a cask which ’ad started a bit shook like a leaf and gave bill a look that would ha’ melted a stone  ’who did it’ ses the skipper  ’we’ve been the wictims of a cruel outrage sir’ ses bill doing all ’e could to avoid the mate’s eye which wouldn’t be avoided  ’so i should think’ ses the skipper ’you’ve been knocked about too’  ’yessir’ ses bill very respectful ’me and bob was ashore last night sir just for a quiet look round when we was set on to by five furriners’  ’what’ ses the skipper and i won’t repeat what the mate said  ’we fought ’em as long as we could sir’ ses bill ’then we was both knocked senseless and when we came to ourselves we was messed up like this ’ere’  what sort o’ men were they’ asked the skipper getting excited  ’sailormen sir’ ses bob putting in his spoke ’dutchies or germans or something o’ that sort’  ’was there one tall man with a fair beard’ ses the skipper getting more and more excited  ’yessir’ ses bill in a surprised sort o’ voice  ’same gang’ ses the skipper ’same gang as knocked mr fingall about you may depend upon it mr fingall it’s a mercy for you you didn’t get your face blacked too’  i thought the mate would ha’ burst i can’t understand how any man could swell as he swelled without bursting  ’i don’t believe a word of it’ he ses at last  ’why not’ ses the skipper sharply  ’well i don’t’ ses the mate his voice trembling with passion ’i ’ave my reasons’  ’i s’pose you don’t think these two poor fellows went and blacked themselves for fun do you’ ses the skipper  the mate couldn’t answer  ’and then went and knocked themselves about for more fun’ ses the skipper very sarcastic  the mate didn’t answer he looked round helpless like and see the third officer swopping glances with the second and all the men looking sly and amused and i think if ever a man saw ’e was done ’e did at that moment  he turned away and went below and the skipper arter reading us all a little lecture on getting into fights without reason sent the two chaps below agin and told ’em to turn in and rest he was so good to ’em all the way ’ome and took sich a interest in seeing ’em change from black to brown and from light brown to spotted lemon that the mate daren’t do nothing to them but gave us their share of what he owed them as well as an extra dose of our own                                    ————
