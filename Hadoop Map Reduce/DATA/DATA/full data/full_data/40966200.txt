40966200	the story of the rock by rm ballantyne   in this book ballantyne has brilliantly woven the story of a family that worked on the building of the eddystone lighthouse with the story of the actual building  three successive attempts were made to build a lighthouse on this dangerous rock which lies several miles off the south coast of devon and on which so many fine ships making their way up the english channel to the north sea ports of europe had been wrecked  the first attempt was made in the early years of the eighteenth century but that lighthouse did not last long  the second was made by rudyerd and was very well made and strong but its upperworks were made of timber and the whole thing was destroyed by fire after having shown a light for over a third of a century  there was an amusing episode during the construction of the rudyerd lighthouse when a french warship took all the construction workers prisoner and made off with them to france  luckily louis the king of france heard of this and was quite incensed ordering the british prisoners to be released and treated as hospitably as possible while the captain of the warship was to be cast into the prison  the final construction was by a mathematical instrument maker of all people called smeaton  his lighthouse was even more soundly founded than even rudyerds had been and he used the fact that stone is heavier than timber to add weight to the building thus rendering it more resistant to the forces of wind and water  it was not only succesful as a lighthouse but it has lasted to this day well over two centuries and has ever since it was completed been a highlyregarded example of the art of lighthouse building   the story of the rock by rm ballantyne    chapter one  wreck of winstanleys lighthouse  at mischief again of course always at it  mrs potter said this angrily and with much emphasis as she seized her son by the arm and dragged him out of a pool of dirty water into which he had tumbled  always at mischief of one sort or another he is continued mrs potter with increasing wrath morning noon and nighthe is tumblin about an smashin things for ever he does hell break my heart at lasthe will  there take that  that which poor little tommy was desired to take was a sounding box on the ear accompanied by a violent shake of the arm which would have drawn that limb out of its socket if the childs bones and muscles had not been very tightly strung together  mrs potter was a woman of large body and small brain  in respect of reasoning power she was little better than the wooden cuckoo which came out periodically from the interior of the clock that stood over her own fireplace and announced the hours  she entertained settled convictions on a few subjects in regard to which she resembled a musical box  if you set her going on any of these she would harp away until she had played the tune out and then begin over again but she never varied reasons however good or facts however weighty were utterly powerless to penetrate her skull her settled convictions were not to be unsettled by any such means  men might change their minds philosophers might see fit to alter their opinions weaklings of both sexes and all ages might trim their sails in accordance with the gales of advancing knowledge but mrs potterno never her colours were nailed to the mast  like most people who unite a strong will with an empty head she was wiser in her own conceit than eleven men that can render a reason in brief she was obstinate  one of her settled convictions was that her little son tommy was as full of mischief as a hegg is full of meat  another of these convictions was that children of all ages are tough that it does them good to pull them about in a violent manner at the risk even of dislocating their joints  it mattered nothing to mrs potter that many of her female friends and acquaintances held a different opinion  some of these friends suggested to her that the hearts of the poor little things were tender as well as their muscles and bones and sinews that children were delicate flowers or rather buds which required careful tending and gentle nursing  mrs potters reply was invariably fiddlesticks she knew better  they were obstinate and selfwilled little brats that required constant banging  she knew how to train em up she did and it was of no manner of use it wasnt to talk to her upon that point  she was right  it was of no use  as well might one have talked to the wooden cuckoo already referred to in mrs potters timepiece  come martha said a tall broadshouldered deepvoiced man at her elbow dont wop the poor cheeld like that  what has he been doin  mrs potter turned to her husband with a half angry half ashamed glance  just look at im john she replied pointing to the small culprit who stood looking guilty and drenched with muddy water from hands to shoulders and toes to nose  look at im see what mischief hes always gittin into  john whose dress bespoke him an artisan and whose grave earnest face betokened him a kind husband and a loving father said  tumblin into dirty water aint necessarily mischief  come lad speak up for yourself  how did it happen  i felled into the water when i wos layin the foundations faither replied the boy pointing to a small pool in the centre of which lay a pile of bricks  what sort o foundations dye mean boy  the lightouse on the eddystun replied the child with sparkling eyes  the man smiled and looked at his son with interest  thats a brave boy he said quietly patting the childs head  get ee into thouse tommy an ill show ee the right way to lay the foundations o the eddystun after supper  come martha he added as he walked beside his wife to their dwelling near plymouth docks dont be so hard on the cheeld its not mischief that ails him  its engineerin that hes hankerin after  depend upon it that if he is spared to grow up hell be a credit to us  mrs potter being of the same opinion still felt inclined to say fiddlesticks but she was a good soul although somewhat highly spiced in the temper and respected her husband sufficiently to hold her tongue  john she said after a short silence youre late tonight  yes answered john with a sigh  my work at the docks has come to an end an mr winstanley has got all the men he requires for the repair of the lightouse  i saw him just before he went off to the rock tonight an i offered to engage but he said he didnt want me  what exclaimed mrs potter with sudden indignation didnt want youyou who has served im off an on at that lightouse for the last six year an more while it wor a buildin  ah thats gratitood that is thats the way some folk shows wot their consciences is made of treats you like a pair of old shoes they does an casts you off wen youre not wanted hah  mrs potter entered her dwelling as she spoke and banged the door violently by way of giving emphasis to her remark  dont be cross old girl said john patting her shoulder i hope you wont cast me off like a pair of old shoes when youre tired of me  but after all i have no reason to complain  you know i have laid by a good lump of money while i was at work on the eddystone besides we cant expect men to engage us when they dont require us and if i had got employed it would not have bin for long being only a matter of repairs  mr winstanley made a strange speech by the way as the boat was shoving off with his men  i was standin close by when a friend o his came up an said he thowt the lightouse was in a bad way an couldnt last long  mr winstanley who is uncommon sure o the strength of his work he replies says hei only wish to be there in the greatest storm that ever blew under the face of heaven to see what the effect will be  thems his very words anit did seem to me an awful wishall the more that the sky looked at the time very like as if dirty weather was brewin up somewhere  i ope he may ave is wish said mrs potter firmly an that the waves may  martha said john in a solemn voice holding up his finger think what youre sayin  well i dont mean no ill but butfetch the kettle tommy dye hear an let alone the cats tail you mischievous little  thats a smart boy exclaimed john rising and catching the kettle from his sons and just as he was on the point of tumbling over a stool there now lets all have a jolly supper and then tommy ill show you how the real foundation of the eddystun was laid  the building to which john potter referred and of which he gave a graphic account and made a careful drawing that night for the benefit of his hopeful son was the first lighthouse that was built on the wild and almost submerged reef of rocks lying about fourteen miles to the southwest of plymouth harbour  the highest part of this reef named the eddystone is only a few feet above water at high tide and as it lies in deep water exposed to the full swell of the ocean the raging of the sea over it in stormy weather is terrible beyond conception  lying as it does in the track of vessels coasting up and down the english channel it was as we may easily believe a source of terror as well as of danger to mariners until a lighthouse was built upon it  but a lighthouse was talked of long before any attempt was made to erect one  important though this object was to the navies of the world the supposed impossibility of the feat and the danger apprehended in the mere attempt deterred any one from undertaking the task until the year 1696 when a country gentleman of essex named henry winstanley came forward and having obtained the necessary legal powers began the great work of building on the wavelashed rock  winstanley was an eccentric as well as a bold man  he undoubtedly possessed an ingenious mechanical mind which displayed itself very much in practical joking  it is said of him that he made a machine the spring of which was attached to an old slipper which lay apparently by chance on the floor of his bedroom  if a visitor kicked this out of his way a phantom instantly arose from the floor  he also constructed a chair which seized every one who sat down in it with its arms and held them fast and in his garden he had an arbour which went afloat in a neighbouring canal when any one entered it  as might have been expected winstanleys lighthouse was a curious affair not well adapted to withstand the fury of the waves  it was highly ornamented and resembled a chinese pagoda much more than a lighthouse  nevertheless it must be said to the credit of this bold man that after facing and overcoming during six years difficulties and dangers which up to that time had not been heard of he finished his lighthouse proved hereby the possibility of that which had been previously deemed impossible and gave to mankind a noble example of enterprise daring and perseverance  our friend john potter had from the commencement rendered able assistance in the dangerous work as a stone cutter and he could not help feeling as if he had been deserted by an old friend that night when the boat went off to the rock without him  it was in november 1703 when winstanley expressed the wish that he might experience in his lighthouse the greatest storm that ever blew on the 26th of that month his wish was granted  that night there arose one of the fiercest gales that ever strewed our shores with wrecks and corpses  the day before the storm there were indications of its approach so john potter went down to the shore to look with some anxiety at the lighthouse  there it stood as the sun went down like a star on the horizon glimmering above the waste of foaming water  when the dark pall and the driving sprays of that terrible night hid it from view john turned his back on the sea and sought the shelter of his humble home  it was a cheery home though a poor one for mrs potter was a good housewife despite her sharp temper and the threatening aspect of the weather had subdued her somewhat  you wouldnt like to be a lighthousekeeper on a night like this john would you asked mrs potter as she busied herself with supper  may be not but i would be content to take things as they are sent anyhow i mean to apply for the situation because i like the notion of the quiet life and the wage will be good as well as sure which will be a matter of comfort to you old girl  you often complain you know of the uncertainty of my present employment  ay but id rather ave that uncertainty than see you run the risk of bein drownded in a lightouse said mrs potter glancing uneasily at the window which rattled violently as the fury of the gale increased  oh faither exclaimed tommy pausing with a potato halfway to his mouth as he listened partly in delight and partly in dread to the turmoil without i wish i was a man that i might go with ee to live in the lightouse  wot fun it would be to hear the gale roarin out there an to see the big waves so close an to feel the house shake andoh  the last syllable expressed partly his inability to say more and partly his horror at seeing the fire blown almost into the room  for some time past the smoke had poured down the chimney but the last burst convinced john potter that it was high time to extinguish the fire altogether  this accomplished he took down an old family bible from a shelf and had worship for he was a man who feared and loved god  earnestly did he pray for he had a son in the coasting trade whom he knew to be out upon the raging sea that night and he did not forget his friends upon the eddystone rock  get thee to bed lass he said when he had concluded  ill sit up an read the word  my eyes could not close this night  poor mrs potter meekly obeyed  how strangely the weather had changed her  even her enemiesand she had manywould have said there was some good in her after all if they had seen her with a tear trickling down her ruddy cheek as she thought of her sailor boy  day broke at last  the gale still raged with an excess of fury that was absolutely appalling  john potter wrapped himself in a tarpaulin coat and souwester preparatory to going out  ill go with ee john said his wife touching him on the shoulder  you couldnt face it martha said john  i thowt ye had bin asleep  no ive bin thinkin of our dear boy  i can face it well enough  come then but wrap well up  let tommy come too i see hes gettin ready  presently the three went out  the door almost burst off its hinges when it was opened and it required johns utmost strength to reclose it  numbers of people chiefly men were already hurrying to the beach clouds of foam and salt spray were whirled madly in the air and carried far inland and slates and cans were dashing on the pavements men tried to say to each other that they had never seen such a storm but the gale caught their voices away and seemed to mingle them all up in one prolonged roar  on gaining the beach they could see nothing at first but the heavings of the maddened sea whose billows mingled their thunders with the wind  sand gravel and spray almost blinded them but as daylight increased they caught glimpses of the foam above the rock  god help us said john solemnly as he and his wife and child sought shelter under the lee of a wall the lightouse is gone  it was too true  the eddystone lighthouse had been swept completely away with the unfortunate winstanley and all his men not a vestige save a fragment of chaincable remained on the fatal rock to tell that such a building had ever been    chapter two  beginning of rudyerds lighthouse  the terrible gale which swept away the first lighthouse that was built on the eddystone rock gave ample proof of the evils resulting from the want of such a building  just after the structure fell a vessel named the winchelsea homeward bound approached the dreaded rock trusting doubtless to the light which had been destroyed so recently she held on her course struck split in two and went down with every soul on board  the necessity for building another tower was thus made as it were urgently obvious nevertheless nearly four years elapsed before any one was found with sufficient courage and capacity to attempt the dangerous and difficult enterprise  during this period our friend john potter being a steady able man found plenty of work at the docks of plymouth but he often cast a wistful glance in the direction of the rock and sighed to think of the tower that had perished and the numerous wrecks that had occurred in consequence for not only had some vessels struck on the rock itself but others keeping too far off its dreaded locality were wrecked on the coast of france  john potters sigh it must be confessed was also prompted in part by the thought that his dreams of a retired and peaceful life as a lightkeeper were now destined never to be realised  returning home one evening somewhat wearied he flung his huge frame into a stout arm chair by the fireside and exclaimed heigho  deary me john what ails you tonight asked the faithful martha who was as of yore busy with the supper  nothin partikler martha only ive had a hard day of it an im glad to sit down  was isaac dorkin here today  no e wasnt  i wonder you keep company with that man replied mrs potter testily hes for ever quarrelling with ee john  no doubt he is martha but we always make it up again an it dont do for a man to give up his comrades just because they have sharp words now and then  why old girl you and i are always havin a spurt o that sort off and on yet i dont ever talk of leavin ye on that account  to this martha replied fiddlesticks and said that she didnt believe in the friendship of people who were always fighting and making it up again that for her part she would rather have no friends at all she wouldnt and that she had a settled conviction she had that isaac dorkin would come to a bad end at last  i hope not martha but in the meantime he has bin the means of gettin me some work to do that is quite to my liking  what may that be john asked mrs potter in surprise  ill tell you when were at supper said john with a smile for he knew from experience that his better half was in a fitter state to swallow unpleasant news when engaged in swallowing her meals than at any other time  where is tommy he added looking round at the quantity of chips which littered the floor  where is e repeated mrs potter in a tone of indignation  where would you expect im to be but after mischief  es at the modl of course always at it never at hanythingk else amost  no exclaimed john in affected surprise  wasnt he at school today  o yes of course e was at school  an did he git his lessons for tomorrow after comin ome  i suppose e did  ah then he does something else sometimes eh  mrs potters reply was interrupted by tommy himself emerging from a closet which formed his workshop and in which he was at that time busy with a model of winstanleys lighthouse executed from the drawings and descriptions by his father improved by his own brilliant fancy  four years make a marked difference on a boy in the early stage of life he was now nearly ten and well grown both intellectually and physically for his age  well tommy how dee git on wi the lightouse asked his father  pretty well faither but it seems to me that mr winstanley had too many stickinout poles an curlywurleys an things o that sort about it  listen to that now said mrs potter with a look of contempt as they all sat down to supper what ever does the boy mean by curlywurleys  youve seed isaac dorkins nose mother  of course i ave what then  well it goes in at the top and out at the middle and curls up at the end thats curlywurley said tommy with a grin as he helped himself to a large potato  the boy is right martha said john laughing for a lighthouse should be as round an as smooth as a ships bow with nothin for wind or water to lay hold on  but now ill tell ee of this noo situation  both mother and son looked inquiringly up but did not speak being too busy and hungry  well this is how it came about  i met isaac dorkin on my way to the docks this mornin an he says to me says he john i met a gentleman who is makin very partikler inquiries about the eddystone rock his name he says is rudyerd and he wants to hire a lot o firstrate men to begin a new  a noo lightouse exclaimed mrs potter with sudden energy bringing her fist down on the table with such force that the dishes rattled again  i knowd it i did  ive ad a settled conviction that if ever they begun to put up another ouse on that there rock you would ave your finger in it  and now itll be the old story over again out in all weathers gettin yer limbs bruised if yer neck aint broke comin ome like a drownded rat no regular hours or meals  oh john john  mrs potter stopped at this point to recover breath and make up her mind whether to storm or weep  heaving a deep sigh she did neither but went on with her supper in sad silence  dont take on like that duckey said john stretching his long arm across the table and patting his wifes shoulder  it wont be so bad as that comes to and it will bring steady work besides lots o money  go on with the story faither said tommy through a potato while his eyes glittered with excitement  it aint a story lad  however to make it short i may come to the pint at once  isaac got engaged himself and mentioned my name to mr rudyerd who took the trouble to ferret me out in the docks andand in fact engaged me for the work which is to begin next week  capital exclaimed tommy  oh how i wish i was old enough to go too  time enough lad every dog shall have his day as the proverb says  mrs potter said nothing but sighed and sought comfort in another cup of tea  meanwhile john continued his talk in an easy off hand sort of way between bite  this mr rudyerd you must know pass the loaf tommy thank ee is a cornish manand fine straightforward goahead fellows them cornish men are though im not one myself  ah you neednt turn up your pretty nose mrs potter i would rather have bin born in cornwall than any other county in england if id had my choice  howsever that aint possible now  well it seems that mr rudyerd is a remarkable sort of man  he came of poor an dishonest parents from whom he runned away in his young days an got employed by a plymouth gentleman who became a true father to him and got him a good edication in readin writin an mathematics  ah tommy my son many a time have i had cause for to regret that nobody gave me a good edication  fiddlesticks exclaimed mrs potter rousing up at this  youve got edication enough for your station in life and a deal more than most men in the same trade  you oughtnt for to undervally yourself john  id back you against all your acquaintance in the matter of edication i would so dont talk any more nonsense like that  mrs potter concluded by emphatically stabbing a potato with her fork and beginning to peel it  john smiled sadly and shook his head but he was too wise a man to oppose his wife on such a point  however tommy he continued ill not let you have the same regrets in after life my son god helping me you shall have a good edication  well as i was sayin john rudyerd the runaway boy became mister rudyerd the silkmercer on ludgate hill london and now hes goin to build a noo lightouse on the eddystun  hed do better to mind his shop said mrs potter  he must be a strange man observed tommy to be both a silkmercer and an engineer  tommy was right mr rudyerd was indeed a strange man for the lighthouse which he ultimately erected on the eddystone rock proved that although not a professional engineer and although he never attempted any other great work of the kind he nevertheless possessed engineering talent of the highest order a fact which must of course have been known to captain lovet the gentleman who selected him for the arduous undertaking  the corporation of the trinity house who managed the lighthouses on the english coast had let the right to build on the eddystone for a period of 99 years to this captain lovet who appointed mr rudyerd to do the work  it was a clear calm morning in july 1706 when the boat put off for the first time to the rock with the men and materials for commencing the lighthouse  our friend john potter sat at the helm  opposite to him sat his testy friend isaac dorkin pulling the stroke oar  mr rudyerd and his two assistant engineers sat on either hand conversing on the subject that filled the thoughts of all  it was a long hard pull even on a calm day but stout oars and strong arms soon carried them out to the rock  being low water at the time a good deal of it was visible besides several jagged peaks of the black forbidding ridge of which the eddystone forms a part  but calm though it was the party could plainly see that the work before them would be both difficult and dangerous  a slight swell from the open sea caused a long smooth glassy wave to roll solemnly forward every minute or two and launch itself in thunder on the weather side sending its spray right over the rock at times so that a landing on that side would have been impossible  on the lee side however the boat found a sort of temporary harbour  here they landed but not altogether without mishap  isaac dorkin who had made himself conspicuous during the row out for caustic remarks and a tendency to contradict slipped his foot on a piece of seaweed and fell into the water to the great glee of most of his comrades  ah then sarves you right cried teddy maroon a little irishman one of the joiners  the others laughed and so did john potter but he also stretched out a helping hand and pulled dorkin out of the sea  this little incident tended to increase the spirits of the party as they commenced preliminary operations  the form of the little mass of rock on which they had to build was very unfavourable  not only was it smallso small that the largest circle which it was possible to draw on it was only twentyfive feet six inches in diameter but its surface sloped so much as to afford a very insecure foundation for any sort of building even if the situation had been an unexposed one  the former builder winstanley had overcome this difficulty by fastening a circle of strong iron posts into the solid rock but the weight of his building coupled with the force of the sea had snapped these and thus left the structure literally to slide off its foundation  the ends of these iron posts and a bit of chain firmly imbedded in a cleft of the rock were all that the new party of builders found remaining of the old lighthouse  rudyerd determined to guard against a similar catastrophe by cutting the rock into a succession of flat steps or terraces so that the weight of his structure should rest perpendicularly on its foundation  stormy weather interrupted and delayed him but he returned with his men again and again to the work and succeeded in advancing it very considerably during the first yearthat is to say during the few weeks of the summer of that year in which winds and waves permitted the work to go on  many adventures both ludicrous and thrilling had these enterprising men while they toiled by snatches as it were sometimes almost under water and always under difficulties but we are constrained to pass these by in silence in order to devote our space to the more important and stirring incidents in the history of this the second lighthouse on the eddystoneone of which incidents bade fair to check the progress of the building for an indefinite period of time and wellnigh brought the career of our hero john potter and his mates to an abrupt close    chapter three  a violent interruption  the incident referred to in our last chapter occurred on the afternoon of a calm summer day  early that morning shortly after daybreak mr rudyerd with his engineers and workmen put off in the boat to resume operations on the rock after a lapse of nearly a week during which period rough weather had stopped the work  they landed without difficulty the calm being so complete that there was only a little sea caused by the heavy swell on the southwest side of the eddystone rock the leeside being as quiet as a pond  its not often we have weather like this sir observed john potter to mr rudyerd as the heavilyladen boat approached the landing place  true john a few weeks like this would enable us almost to complete the courses replied the engineer  easy lads easy  if you run her up so fast youll stave in the planks  stand by with the fender teddy  ay ay sir cried the man springing up and seizing a stuffed canvas ball which he swung over the gunwale just in time to prevent the boats side from grazing the rock  there now jump out wi the painter man alive said teddy addressing himself to isaac dorkin who was naturally slow in his movements youll go souse between the boat an the rock av ye dont be smarter nor that  dorkin made some grumbling reply as he stepped upon the rock and fastened the painter to a ringbolt  his comrades sprang after him and while some began to heave the tools from the boat others busied themselves round the base of the column which had by that time risen to a considerable height  it looked massive enough to bid defiance to wind and waves however fierce their fury  some such thought must have passed through mr rudyerds mind just then for a satisfied smile lighted up his usually grave features as he directed the men to arrange the tackle of the crane by which the stones were to be removed from the boat to their place on the building  they were all quickly at work for they knew from experience how suddenly their operations might be cut short by a gale  in order that the reader may fully understand the details of the event which occurred that afternoon it is necessary that he should know the nature of the structure and the height to which at that time it had proceeded and while we are on the subject we may as well state a few facts connected with the foundation and superstructure which cannot fail to interest all who take pleasure in contemplating mans efforts to overcome almost insuperable difficulties  as we have said the sloping foundation of the building was cut into a series of terraces or steps  there were seven of these  the first operation was the cutting of thirtysix holes in the solid rock into which iron holdfasts were securely fixed  the cutting of these holes or sockets was ingeniously managed  first three small holes were drilled into the rock and then these were broken into one large hole which was afterwards smoothed enlarged and undercut so as to be of dovetail form the size of each being 7 and a half inches broad and 2 and a half inches wide at the top and an inch broader at the bottom they were about sixteen inches deep  thirtysix massive malleable iron holdfasts were then inserted and wedged into the places thus prepared for them besides being filled up with lead so that no force of any kind could draw them out  the next proceeding was to place beams of solid oak timber lengthwise on the first step thus bringing it level with the second step  timbers of the same kind were then placed above and across these bringing the level up to the third step  the next course of timbers was again laid lengthwise bringing the level to the fourth step and so on to the seventh above which two completely circular timber courses were laid thus making a perfectly flat and solid foundation on which the remainder of the column might rest  the building therefore had no tendency to slide even although it had not been held in its place by the thirtysix holdfasts before mentioned in addition to this the various courses of timber were fastened to the rock and to each other by means of numerous iron cramps and bolts and wooden trenails  it was well known to mr rudyerd however that it was not possible to fit his timbers so perfectly to the rock and to each other as to exclude water altogether and that if the water should manage to find entrance it would exert a tremendous lifting power which coupled with the weight of the falling billows would be apt to sweep his foundation away  he resolved therefore to counteract this by means of weight and in order to do this he next piled five courses of cornish moorstone above the timber courses  the stones were huge blocks which when laid and fastened in one solid stratum weighed 120 tons they were not laid in cement but each block was fastened to its fellow by joints and similar to the first  the whole of this fabric was built round a strong central mast or pole which rose from the rock  the two timber courses above described terminated the solid part of the lighthouse  it rose to the height of about fourteen feet from the rock at the centre of the building  at this point in the structure namely at the top of the solid the door was begun on the east side and a central wellhole was left where the stair leading to the rooms above was ultimately built  the door itself was reached by a strong iron stair of open work outside through which the sea could easily wash  after the solid was completed other five courses of moorstone were laid which weighed about eightysix tons  it was in these that the doorway and wellhole were made  two more courses of wood followed covering the doorhead and on these four more courses of stone weighing sixtyseven tons then several courses of timber with a floor of oak plank three inches thick over all forming the floor of the first apartment which was the storeroom  this first floor was thirtythree feet above the rock  the upper part of the column containing its four rooms was by no means so strong as the lower part being composed chiefly of the timber uprights in which the building was encased from top to bottom  these uprights numbering seventyone were massive beams about a foot broad and nine inches thick at the bottom and diminishing towards the top their seams were caulked like those of a ship and they gave to the lighthouse when finished the appearance of an elegant fluted column the top of the column on which rested the lantern rose when finished to about sixtythree feet above the highest part of the rock  we have thought proper to give these details in this place but at the time of which we write none of the outside timbers had been set up and the edifice had only reached that point immediately above the solid where the doorway and the wellhole began  here a large crane had been fixed and two of the men were up there working the windlass by which the heavy blocks of moorstone were raised to their places  the signal had been given to hoist one of these when isaac dorkin who stood beside the stone suddenly uttered a loud cry and shouted hold on  ease off up there  hold ooon  dye hear  arrah howld yer noise an ill hear better cried teddy maroon looking over the top edge of the lighthouse  my thumbs caught i the chain yelled dorkin  ease it off  och poor thing exclaimed teddy springing back and casting loose the chain  are ye aisy now he cried again looking down at his friend  all right hoist away shouted stobbs another of the men who could scarce refrain from laughing at the rueful countenance of his comrade as he surveyed his crushed thumb  up went the stone and while it was ascending some of the men brought forward another to follow it  there comes the boat observed mr rudyerd to one of his assistant engineers as he shut up a pocket telescope with which he had been surveying the distant shore  i find it necessary to leave you today mr franks rather earlier than usual but that matters little as things are going smoothly here  see that you keep the men at work as long as possible  if the swell that is beginning to rise should increase it may compel you to knock off before dark but i hope it wont  it would be well sir i think said franks to make john potter overseer in place of williamson he is a better and steadier man  if you have no objection  none in the least replied rudyerd  i have thought of promoting potter for some time past  make the change by all means  please sir said williamson approaching at that moment ive just been at the top of the building an observed a french schooner bearing down from the southwest  well what of that demanded rudyerd  why sir said williamson with some hesitation in his manner praps its a manofwar sir  and if it be so what then said rudyerd with a smile you dont suppose theyll fire a broadside at an unfinished lighthouse do you or are you afraid theyll take the eddystone rock in tow and carry you into a french port  i dont know sir replied williamson with an offended look i only thought that as we are at war with france just now it was my duty to report what i had seen  quite right quite right replied rudyerd goodhumouredly ill record the fact in our journal  meanwhile see that the men dont have their attention taken up with it  by this time the small boat which the chief engineer had ordered to come off to take him on shore was alongside the rock  the swell had risen so much that although there was not a breath of wind the surf was beating violently on the southwest side and even in the sheltered nook which was styled by courtesy the harbour there was sufficient commotion to render care in fending off with the boathook necessary meanwhile the men wrought like tigers taking no note of their chiefs departureall except williamson being either ignorant of or indifferent to the gradual approach of the french schooner which drifted slowly towards them with the tide  thus work and time went on quietly  towards the afternoon teddy maroon wiped the perspiration from his heated brow and looked abroad upon the sea while the large hook of his crane was descending for another stone an expression of intense earnestness wrinkled his visage as he turned suddenly to stobbs his companion at the windlass and exclaimed  sure thats a frenchman over there  thats wot it is ted an no mistake said stobbs  i had amost forgot about the war and the mounseers  ah then its not goin to attack us ye are is it  never exclaimed teddy in surprise observing that two boats had been lowered from the schooners davits into which men were crowding  the question was answered in a way that could not be misunderstood  a puff of white smoke burst from the vessels side and a cannon shot went skipping over the sea close past the lighthouse at the same time the french flag was run up and the two boats pushing off made straight for the rock  teddy and his comrade ran down to the foot of the building where the other men were arming themselves hastily with crowbars and large chips of stone  marshalling the men together the assistant engineer who was a fiery little fellow explained to them how they ought to act  my lads said he the surf has become so strong by good luck that it is likely to capsize the enemys boats before they get here  in which case theyll be comfortably drowned and we can resume our work but if they manage to reach the rock well retire behind the lighthouse to keep clear of their musket balls and when they attempt to land rush at em and heave em all into the sea  its like enough that theyre more numerous than we but you all know that one englishman is a match for three frenchmen any day  a general laugh and cheer greeted this address and then they all took shelter behind the lighthouse  meanwhile the two boats drew near  the lightest one was well in advance  on it came careering on the crest of a large glassy wave  now was the time for broachingto and upsetting but the boat was cleverly handled  it was launched into the harbour on a sea of foam  most of the englishmen on seeing this ran to oppose the landing  surrender shouted an officer with a large moustache standing up in the bow of the boat  never replied mr franks defiantly  hooray yelled teddy maroon flourishing his crowbar  at this the officer gave an order the frenchmen raised their muskets and the englishmen scampered back to their place of shelter laughing like schoolboys engaged in wild play  teddy maroon whose fertile brain was always devising some novelty or other ran up to his old post at the windlass intending to cast a large mass of stone into the boat when it neared the rock hoping thereby to knock a hole through its bottom but before he reached his perch a breaker burst into the harbour and overturned the boat leaving her crew to struggle towards the rock  some of them were quickly upon it grappling with the englishmen who rushed forward to oppose the landing  seeing this teddy hurled his mass of stone at the head of an unfortunate frenchman whom he narrowly missed and then uttering a howl ran down to join in the fray  the french commander a powerful man was met kneedeep in the water by isaac dorkin whom he struck down with the hilt of his sword and poor isaacs grumbling career would certainly have come to an end then and there had not john potter who had already hurled two frenchmen back into the sea run to the rescue and catching his friend by the hair of the head dragged him on the rock  at that moment teddy maroon dashed at the french officer caught his uplifted swordarm by the wrist and pushed him back into the sea just as he was in the act of making a savage cut at john potter  before the latter had dragged his mate quite out of danger he was grappled with by another frenchman and they fell struggling to the ground while a third came up behind teddy with a boathook and almost took him by surprise but teddy turned in time caught the boathook in his left hand and flattening the frenchmans nose with his right tumbled him over and ran to assist in repelling another party of the invaders who were making good their landing at the other side of the rock  thus the skrimmage as john potter styled it became general although outnumbered the englishmen were getting the best of it when the second boat plunged into the socalled harbour and in a few seconds the rock was covered with armed men  of course the englishmen were overpowered  their tools were collected and put into the boat  with some difficulty the first boat was righted  the englishmen were put into it with a strong guard of marines and then the whole party were carried on board the french schooner which turned out to be a privateer  thus were the builders of the eddystone lighthouse carried off as prisoners of war to france and their feelings may be gathered from the last remark of teddy maroon who as the white cliffs of england were fading from his view exclaimed bitterly och hone  ill never see owld ireland no more  note  it may be as well to state at this point that the incidents here related and indeed all the important incidents of our tale are founded on we believe well authenticated facts    chapter four  unlookedfor deliverance  behold then our lighthousebuilders entering a french port teddy maroon looking over the side of the vessel at the pier to which they are drawing near and grumbling sternly at his sad fate john potter beside him with his arms crossed his eyes cast down and his thoughts far away with the opinionated martha and the ingenious tommy mr franks and the others standing near all dismal and silent  you not seem for like ver moche to see la belle france said the french officer with the huge moustache addressing teddy  its little teddy maroon cares whether he sees bell france or betsy france replied the irishman impudently  no thanks to you aither for givin me the chance  sure its the likes o you that bring war into disgrace intirely goin about the say on yer own hook plunderin right an left  its pirate and not privateers ye should be called an its myself that would string ye all at the yardarm av i only had me own way  hah exclaimed the frenchman with a scowl but by goot fortune you not have your own vay  perhaps you change you mind ven you see de inside of french prisons ha  perhaps i wont ha cried teddy mimicking his captor  go away wid yez an attind to yer own business  the frenchman turned angrily away  in a few seconds more they were alongside the pier and a gangway was run on board  the first man who stepped on this gangway was a tall powerful gendarme with a huge cocked hat and a long cavalry sabre the steel scabbard of which clattered magnificently as he stalked along  now it chanced that this dignified official slipped his foot on the gangway and to the horror of all observers fell into the water  impulsiveness was a part of teddy maroons enthusiastic nature  he happened to be gazing in admiration at the gendarme when he fell  in another moment he had plunged overboard after him caught him by the collar and held him up  the gendarme could not swim  in the first agony of fear he threw about his huge limbs and almost drowned his rescuer  be aisy wont ee shouted ted holding him at arms length and striving to keep out of his grasp  at the same time he dealt him a hearty cuff on the ear  the words and the action appeared to have a sedative effect on the gendarme who at once became passive and in a few minutes the rescuer and the rescued stood dripping on the schooners deck  thank ee my friend said the gendarme in english extending his hand  och yere an irishman exclaimed teddy eagerly as he grasped the offered hand  but sure he added in an altered tone dropping the hand and glancing at the mans uniform ye must be a poorspirited craitur to forsake yer native land an become a mounseer  ireland is not my native land and i am not an irishman said the gendarme with a smile  my mother was irish but my father was french and i was born in paris  it is true that i spent many years in ireland among my mothers relations so that i speak your language but i am more french than irish  humph mores the pity said teddy  if there was but wan drop o me blood irish an all the rest o me french id claim to be an irishman if id known what ye was id have let ye sink i would  go along i dont think much of yez  perhaps not replied the gendarme twirling his long moustache with a goodhumoured smile nevertheless i think a good deal of you my fine fellow  farewell i shall see you again  ye neednt trouble yerself replied teddy flinging off testily  it was quite evident that the unfortunate irishman found it hard to get reconciled to his fate  he could scarcely be civil to his mates in misfortune and felt a strong disposition to wrench the sword from his captors hand cut off his moustached head and then in the language of desperate heroes of romance sell his life dearly  he refrained however and was soon after marched along with his mates to the stronghold of the port at the door of which the french commander handed them over to the jailor wishing teddy all health and happiness with a broad grin as he bid him farewell  our unfortunates crossed a stone court with walls that appeared to rise into the clouds then they traversed a dark stone passage at the end of which stood an open door with a small stone cell beyond  into this they were desired to walk and as several bayonet points glittered in the passage behind them they felt constrained to obey  then locks were turned and bars were drawn and bolts were shot  the heavy heels of the jailer and guard were heard retiring  more locks and bars and bolts were turned and drawn and shot at the farther end of the stone passage after which all remained still as the grave  och hone groaned teddy looking round at his companions as he sat on a stone seat the picture of despair to be kilt is a trifle to fight is a pleasure to be hanged is only a little trying to the narves  but to be shut up in a stone box in a furrin land  words failed him here but another groan told eloquently of the bitterness of the spirit within  we must just try to be as cheery as we can mates said john potter the lord can deliver us out o worse trouble than this if he sees fit  oh its all very well for you to talk like that growled isaac dorkin but i dont believe the almighty is goin to pull down stone walls and iron gates to set us free an you know that we havent a friend in all france to help us  i dont know that isaac  it certainly seems very unlikely that any one should start up to befriend us here but with god all things are possible  at the worst i know that if we are to remain here its his will that we should  humph  i wish ye much comfort o the thought it doesnt give much to me remarked stobbs  here mr franks who had hitherto sat in sad silence brightened up and said well well lads dont let us make things worse by disputing  surely each man is entitled to draw comfort from any source he chooses  for my part i agree with john potter in this at all eventsthat we should try to be as cheery as we can and make the best of it  hear hear exclaimed the others  acting on this advice they soon began to feel a little less miserable  they had straw to sleep on and were allowed very poor fare but there was a sufficiency of it  the first night passed and the second day after which another fit of despair seized some of the party  then john potter managed to cheer them up a bit and as he never went about without a small testament in his pocket he was able to lighten the time by reading portions of it aloud  after that they took to relating their lives and adventures to each other and then the inventive spirits among them took to spinning longwinded yarns  thus a couple of weeks passed away during which these unfortunate prisoners of war went through every stage of feeling between hope and despair over and over again  during one of his despairing moods teddy maroon declared that he had now given up all hope and that the first chance he got he would kill himself for he was quite certain that nobody would ever be able to find out where they were much less get them out of that fig  but teddy was wrong as the sequel will show  let us leap now good reader to the tuileriesinto the apartments of louis xiv  from a prison to a palace is an unusual leap no doubt though the reverse is by no means uncommon  the old king is pacing his chamber in earnest thought addressing an occasional remark to his private secretary  the subject that occupies him is the war and the name of england is frequently on his lips  the secretary begs leave to bring a particular letter under the notice of the king  the secretary speaks in french of course but there is a peculiarly rich tone and emphasis in his voice which a son of the green isle would unhesitatingly pronounce to be the brogue  read it says the king hurriedly but first tell me who writes  a gendarme sire a poor relation of mine  ha an irishman  no sire but his mother was irish  well read says the king  the secretary reads dear terrence will you do me the favour to bring a matter before the king  the commander of a french privateer has done an act worthy of a buccaneer he has attacked the men who were rebuilding the famous eddystone lighthouse and carried them prisoners of war into this port  i would not trouble you or the king about this did i not know his majesty too well to believe him capable of countenancing such a deed  what exclaims the king turning abruptly with a flush of anger on his countenance the eddystone lighthouse which so stands as to be of equal service to all nations having occasion to navigate the channel  the same sire and the officer who has done this expects to be rewarded  ha he shall not be disappointed he shall have his reward exclaims the king  let him be placed in the prison where the english men now lie to remain there during our pleasure and set the builders of the eddystone free  let them have gifts and all honourable treatment to repay them for their temporary distress and send them home without delay in the same vessel which brought them hither  we are indeed at war with england but not with mankind  the commands of kings are as a rule promptly obeyed  even although there were neither railways nor telegraphs in those days many hours had not elapsed before the tall gendarme stood in the prisoncell where john potter and his friends were confined  there was a peculiar twinkle in his eye as he ordered a band of soldiers to act as a guard of honour in conducting the englishmen to the best hotel in the town where a sumptuous collation awaited them  arrived there the circumstances of their case were explained to them by the chief magistrate who was in waiting to receive them and present them with certain gifts by order of louis xiv  the fortunate men looked on at all that was done ate their feast and received their gifts in speechless amazement until at length the gendarme who acted as interpreter and seemed to experience intense enjoyment at the whole affair asked if they were ready to embark for england  to which teddy maroon replied by turning to john potter and saying i say john just give me a dig in the ribs will ee a good sharp one  its of no use at all goin on draimin like this  itll only make it the worse the longer i am o wakin up  john potter smiled and shook his head but when he and his friends were conducted by their guard of honour on board of the schooner which had brought them there and when they saw the moustached commander brought out of his cabin and led ashore in irons and heard the click of the capstan as the vessel was warped out of harbour and beheld the tall gendarme take off his cocked hat and wish them bon voyage as they passed the head of the pier they at length became convinced that it was all true and teddy declared with enthusiastic emphasis that the mounseers were not such bad fellows after all  oh john john exclaimed mrs potter about thirty hours after that as she stood gazing in wild delight at a magnificent cashmere shawl which hung on her husbands arm while tommy was lost in admiration at the sight of a splendid inlaid ivory workbox where ever got ee such a helegant shawl  from king louis of france lass said john with a peculiar smile  never said mrs potter emphatically and then she gave it forth as one of her settled convictions that kings wasnt such fools as to go makin presents like that to poor working men  however john potter who had only just then presented himself before the eyes of his astonished spouse stoutly asserted that it was true and said that if she would set about getting something to eat for he was uncommonly hungry and if tommy would leave off opening his mouth and eyes to such an unnecessary extent he would tell them all about it so mrs potter was convinced and for once had her settled convictions unsettled and the men returned to their work on the eddystone and a manofwar was sent to cruise in the neighbourhood to guard them from misfortune in the future and finally the rudyerd lighthouse was completed  its total height from the lowest side to the top of the ball on the lantern was ninetytwo feet and its greatest diameter twentythree feet four inches  it took about three years to build having been commenced in 1706 the first light was put up in 1708 and the whole was completed in 1709  teddy maroon was one of the first keepers but he soon left to take charge of a lighthouse on the irish coast  thereupon john potter made application for the post  he was successful over many competitors and at last obtained the darling wish of his heart he became principal keeper his surly comrade isaac dorkin strange to say obtaining the post of second keeper  mrs potter didnt like the change at first as a matter of course  but youll come to like it martha john would say when they referred to the subject absence you know makes the heart grow fonder well think all the more of each other when we meet during my spells ashore at the end of every two months  tommy also objected very much at first but he could not alter his fathers intentions so john potter went off to the eddystone rock and for a long time took charge of the light that cast its friendly beams over the sea every night thereafter through storm and calm for upwards of sixandforty years  that johns life in the lighthouse was not all that he had hoped for will become apparent in the next chapter    chapter five  a terrible situation  there were four rooms and a lantern in rudyerds lighthouse  the second room was that which was used most by john potter and his mate isaac dorkin it was the kitchen dining room and parlour all in one immediately below it was the storeroom and just above it the dormitory  the general tenor of the life suited john exactly he was a quietspirited meditative religious man and although quite willing to face difficulties dangers and troubles like a man when required to do so he did not see it to be his duty to thrust himself unnecessarily into these circumstances  there were plenty of men he was wont to say who loved bustle and excitement and there were plenty of situations of that sort for them to fill for his part he loved peace and quiet the eddystone lighthouse offered both and why should he not take advantage of the opportunity especially when by so doing he would secure a pretty good and regular income for his wife and family  john gave vent to an opinion which contained deeper truths than at that time he thought of  god has given to men their varied powers and inclinations in order that they may use these powers and follow these inclinations  working rightly man is a perfect machine it is only the fall which has twisted all things awry  there is no sin in feeling an intense desire for violent physical action or in gratifying that desire when we can do so in accordance with the revealed will of god but there is sin in gratifying it in a wrong way in committing burglary for instance or in prizefighting or in helping others to fight in a cause with which we have no right to interfere  again it is not wrong to desire peace and quiet and to wish for mental and spiritual and physical repose but it is decidedly wrong to stand by with your hands in your pockets when an innocent or helpless one is being assaulted by ruffians to sit quiet and do nothing when your neighbours house is on fire to shirk an unpleasant duty and leave some one else to do it or to lie abed when you should be up and at work  all our powers were given to be used our inclinations were intended to impel us in certain directions and gods will and glory were meant to be our guide and aim  so the scripture teaches we think in the parable of the talents and in the words whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might and whether therefore ye eat or drink or whatsoever ye do do all to the glory of god  our great fault lies in not consulting gods plan of arrangement  how often do we find that in adopting certain lines of action men consult only the pecuniary or social advantage ignoring powers or want of powers and violating inclinations and this even among professing christians while among the unbelieving gods will and glory are not thought of at all  and yet we wonder that so many welllaid plans miscarry that so many promising young men and women come to grief forgetting that the right man or woman in the right place is an essential element in thorough success  but to return to john potter  his conscience was easy as to his duty in becoming a lightkeeper and the lighthouse was all that he could wish or had hoped for  there was no disturbance from without for the thick walls and solid foundation defied winds or waves to trouble him save only in the matter of smoke which often had a strong tendency to traverse the chimney in the wrong direction but that was not worth mentioning  john found however that sin in the person of his mate marred his peace and destroyed his equanimity  isaac dorkin did not find the life so much to his taste as he had expected  he became more grumpy than ever and quarrelled with his friend on the slightest provocation insomuch that at last john found it to be his wisest plan to let him alone  sometimes in consequence of this pacific resolve the two men would spend a whole month without uttering a word to each other the one in the sulks the other waiting until he should come out of them  their duties were light but regular  during the day they found a sufficiency of quiet occupation in cooking their food cleaning  the lighting apparatuswhich consisted of a framework full of tallow candlesand in keeping the building clean and orderly  at night they kept watch each four hours at a time while the other slept  while watching john read his bible and several books which had been given to him by mr rudyerd or in fine weather paced round and round the gallery just outside the lantern in profound meditation  dorkin also during his watches meditated much he likewise grumbled a good deal and smoked continuously  he was not a bad fellow at bottom however and sometimes he and potter got on very amicably  at such seasons john tried to draw his mate into religious talk but without success  thus from day to day and year to year these two men stuck to their post until eleven years had passed away  one day about the end of that period john potter who having attained to the age of fiftytwo was getting somewhat grey though still in full strength and vigour sat at his chimney corner beside his buxom and still blooming wife  his fireside was a better one than in days of yorethanks to tommy who had become a flourishing engineer mrs potters costume was likewise much better in condition and quality than it used to be thanks again to tommy who was a grateful and loving son  well martha ive had a pleasant month ashore lass i wish that i hadnt to go off on relief tomorrow  why not leave it altogether then john  youve no occasion to continue a lightkeeper now that youve laid by so much and tommy is so well off and able to help us an willin toogod bless him  amen to that martha  i have just bin thinkin over the matter and ive made up my mind that this is to be my last trip off to the rock  i spoke to the superintendent last week and its all settled  who dye think is to take my place  i never could guess nothink john who  teddy maroon no less  what an im a older man than yourself  ah but it aint the same teddy  its his eldest son named after himself an so like what his father was when i last saw him that i dont think id be able to tell which was which  well john im glad to ear it an be sure that ye git ome next relief before the thirtyfirst of october for thats tommys wedding day an you know we fixed it a purpose to suit your time of being at ome  a sweet pair theyll make  nora was born to be a lady nobody would think but she is one with er pretty winsome ways and tommy who was twentyfive is very last birthday is one of the andsomest men in plymouth  ive a settled conviction john that hell live to be a great man  you once had a settled conviction that he would come to a bad end said potter with an arch smile  go along with you john retorted mrs potter  im just going said john rising and kissing his wife as he put on his hat and you may depend on it that ill not miss dancing at our tommys wedding if i can help it  that night saw john potter at his old post againsnuffing the candles on the eddystone and chatting with his old mate dorkin beside the kitchen fire  one evening towards the end of october john potter and isaac having lighted up sat down to a game of draughts  it was blowing hard outside and heavy breakers were bursting on the rock and sending thin spray as high as the lantern but all was peace and comfort inside even isaacs grumpy spirit was calmer than usual  you seem dull tonight mate observed john as they rearranged the pieces for another game  i dont feel very well said dorkin passing his hand over his brow languidly  youd better turn in then an ill take half of your watch as well as my own  thank ee kindly said dorkin in a subdued voice ill take yer advice  perhaps he added slowly youll read me a bit out o the book  this was the first time that isaac had expressed a desire to touch on religious subjects or to hear the bible read and john you may be sure was only too glad to comply  after his mate had lain down he read a small portion but observing that he seemed very restless he closed the bible and contented himself with quoting the following words of our lord jesus come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and i will give you rest and the blood of jesus christ gods son cleanseth us from all sin  then in a sentence or two he prayed fervently that the holy spirit might apply these words  john had a suspicion that his mate was on the verge of a serious illness and he was not wrong  next day dorkin was stricken with a raging fever and john potter had not only to nurse him day and night but to give constant attention to the lantern as well  fortunately the day after that the relief boat would be out so he consoled himself with that thought but the gale which had been blowing for some days increased that night until it blew a perfect hurricane  the sea round the eddystone became a tremendous whirlpool of foam and all hope of communication with the shore was cut off  of course the unfortunate lighthousekeeper hung out a signal of distress although he knew full well that it could not be replied to  meanwhile a wedding party assembled in plymouth  the bride was blooming and young the bridegroomstrong and happy but there was a shade upon his brow as he approached a stout elderly female and said sadly i cant tell you mother how grieved i am that father is not with us today  i would be quite willing to put it off and so would nora for a few days but there is no appearance of the storm abating and indeed if even it stopped this moment i dont think the reliefboat could get off in less than a week  i know it tommy  it seemed ridiculous to call a strapping curlyhaired bewhiskered sixfoot man tommy i know it tommy but it aint of no use puttin of it off  ive always ad a settled conviction that anythink as is put off is as good as given up altogether  no no my son go on with the weddin  so the wedding went on and nora vining a darkhaired plymouth maiden became mrs thomas potter and the breakfast was eaten and the healths were drunk and the speeches made and mrs potter senior wept profusely for joy nearly all the time into a white cotton handkerchief which was so large and strong that some of the guests entertained the belief to the end of their lives that the worthy woman had had it manufactured for her own special use on that great occasion  meanwhile the father whose absence was regretted so much and whose heart would have rejoiced so much to have been there remained in his lonely dwelling out among the mad whirlpools in the wildest past of the raging sea  all day and every day his signal of distress streamed horizontally in the furious gale and fishermen stood on the shore and wondered what was wrong and wished so earnestly that the gale would go down but no one not even the boldest among them all imagined for a moment that a boat could venture to leave the shore much less encounter the seething billows on the eddystone  as each night drew on one by one the lights glimmered out above the rock until the bright beams of the fully illuminated lantern poured like a flood through the murky air and then men went home to their firesides relieved to know that whatever might be wrong the keepers were at all events able to attend to their important duties  day after day isaac dorkin grew worse he soon became delirious and strong though he was john potter was scarcely able to hold him down in bed  when the delirium first came on john chanced to be in the lantern just commencing to light up  when he was about to apply the light he heard a noise behind him and turning hastily round beheld the flushed face and blazing eyes of his mate rising through the trap door that communicated with the rooms below  leaving his work john hastened to his friend and with some difficulty persuaded him to return to his bed but no sooner had he got him into it and covered him up than a new paroxysm came on and the sick man arose in the strength of his agony and hurled his friend to the other side of the apartment  john sprang up and grappled with him while he was rushing towards the door  it was an awful struggle that ensued  both were large and powerful men the one strong in a resolute purpose to meet boldly a desperate case the other mad with fever  they swayed to and fro and fell on and smashed the homely furniture of the place sometimes the one and sometimes the other prevailing while both gasped for breath and panted vehemently suddenly dorkin sank down exhausted  he appeared to collapse and john lifted him with difficulty again into his bed but in a few seconds he attempted to renew the struggle while the whole building was filled with his terrific cries  while this was going on the shades of night had been falling fast and john potter remembered that none of the candles had been lit and that in a few minutes more the rock would be a source of greater danger to shipping than if no lighthouse had been there because vessels would be making for the light from all quarters of the world in the full faith of its being kept up  filled with horror at the thought that perhaps even at that moment vessels might be hurrying on to their doom he seized a piece of rope that lay at hand and managed to wind it so firmly round his mate as to render him helpless  bounding back to the lantern he quickly lighted it up but did not feel his heart relieved until he had gazed out at the snowy billows below and made sure that no vessel was in view  then he took a long draught of water wiped his brow and returned to his friend  two days after that isaac dorkin died  and now john potter found himself in a more horrible situation than before  the storm continued no sooner did one gale abate than another broke out so as to render approach to the rock impossible while day after day and night after night the keeper had to pass the dead body of his mate several times in attending to the duties of the lantern  and still the signal of distress continued to fly from the lighthouse and still the people on shore continued to wonder what was wrong to long for moderate weather and to feel relief when they saw the faithful light beam forth each evening at sunset  at last the corpse began to decay and john felt that it was necessary to get rid of it but he dared not venture to throw it into the sea  it was well known that dorkin had been a quarrelsome man and he feared that if he could not produce the body when the relief came he might be deemed a murderer  he therefore let it lie until it became so overpoweringly offensive that the whole building from foundation to cupola was filled with the horrible stench  the feelings of the solitary man can neither be conceived nor described  well was it for john that he had the word of god in his hand and the grace of god in his heart during that awful period  for nearly a month his agony lasted  at last the weather moderated the boat came off the relief was effected and poor dorkins body which was in such a condition that it could not be carried on shore was thrown into the sea  then john potter returned home and left the lighthouse service for ever  from that time forward it has been the custom to station not fewer than three men at a time on all outlying lighthouses of the kingdom  note  reader we have not drawn here on our imagination  this story is founded on unquestionable fact    chapter six  the end of rudyerds lighthouse  thirtyfour years passed away and still rudyerds lighthouse stood firm as the rock on which it was founded  true during that period it had to undergo occasional repairs because the timber uprights at the base where exposed to the full violence of the waves had become weatherworn and required renewing in part but this was only equivalent to a ship being overhauled and having some of her planks renewed  the main fabric of the lighthouse remained as sound and steadfast at the end of that long period as it was at the beginning and it would in all probability have remained on the eddystone rock till the present day had not a foe assailed it whose nature was very different indeed from that with which it had been built to contend  the lighthouse was at this time in charge of teddy maroon not the teddy who had bewailed his fate so disconsolately in the french prison in days gone by but his youngest son who was now getting to be an elderly man we may however relieve the mind of the sympathetic reader by saying that teddy senior was not dead  he was still alive and hearty though bent nearly double with extreme age and dwelt on the borders of one of the irish bogs at the head of an extensive colony of maroons  one night teddy the younger ascended to the lantern to trim the candles he snuffed them all round and returned to the kitchen to have a pipe his two mates being abed at the time  no one now knows how the thing happened but certain it is that teddy either dropped some of the burning snuff on the floor or in some other way introduced more light into his lantern that night than it had ever been meant to contain so that while he and his mates were smoking comfortably below the lighthouse was smoking quietly but ominously above  on shore late that night an elderly gentleman stood looking out of the window of a charmingly situated cottage in the village of cawsand bay near plymouth which commanded a magnificent prospect of the channel  father he said turning to a very old man seated beside the fire who although shrunken and wrinkled and bald was ruddy in complexion and evidently in the enjoyment of a green old age father the lighthouse is beautifully bright tonight shall i help you to the window to look at it  yes tommy im fond o the old light  it minds me of days gone by when you and i were young martha  the old man gave a chuckle as he looked across the hearthstone where in a chair similar to his own sat a very stout and very deaf and very old lady smoothing the head of her grandchild a little girl who was the youngest of a family of ten  old martha did not hear john potters remark but she saw his kindly smile and nodded her head with much gravity in reply  martha had grown intellectually slow when she partially lost her hearing and although she was not sad she had evidently become solemn  an english dictionary and the bible were the only books that martha would look at now  she did not use the former as a help to the understanding of the latter  no one knew why she was so partial to the dictionary but as she not unfrequently had it on her knee upside down while poring over it her grandchild little nora took up the idea that she had resolved to devote the latter days of her life to learning to read backwards perhaps the fact that the dictionary had once belonged to her son james who was wrecked and drowned on the norfolk coast may have had something to do with it  with the aid of his sons arm and a stick old john managed to hobble to the window  it is very bright  why tommy he exclaimed with a start its too bright the lighthouse must be on fire  at that moment tommys wife now fat fair and fifty or thereabouts entered the room hurriedly exclaiming oh tom what can be the matter with the lighthouse i never saw it so bright before  tom who had hastily placed his father in a chair so that he could see the eddystone seized his hat and exclaiming ill go and see my dear ran out and proceeded to the shore  whats the matter cried mrs potter in a querulous voice when little nora rushed from her side  nora senior went to her at once and bending down said in a musical voice that retained much of its clearness and all its former sweetness i fear that the lighthouse is on fire grandma  mrs potter gazed straight before her with vacant solemnity and nora supposing that she had not heard repeated the information  still mrs potter made no reply but after a few moments she turned her eyes on her daughterinlaw with owlish gravity and said i knew it  i said long ago to your father my dear i had a settled conviction that that lighthouse would come to a bad end  it did indeed appear as though old marthas prophecy were about to come true  out at the lighthouse teddy maroon having finished his pipe went up to the lantern to trim the candles again  he had no sooner opened the hatch of the lantern than a dense cloud of smoke burst out  he shouted to his comrades one of whom henry hall was old and not fit for much violent exertion the other james wilkie was a young man but a heavy sleeper  they could not be roused as quickly as the occasion demanded teddy ran to the storeroom for a leathern bucket but before he could descend to the rock fill it and reascend the flames had got a firm hold of the cupola  he dashed the water into the lantern just as his horrified comrades appeared  fetch bucketfulls as fast as ye can  och be smart boys if iver ye was he shouted while perspiration streamed down his face  pulling off his coat while his mates ran down for water teddy dashed wildly into the lantern and holding the coat by its arms laid about him violently but smoke and fire drove him but almost immediately  the buckets were long of coming and when they did arrive their contents were as nothing on the glowing cupola  then teddy went out on the balcony and endeavoured to throw the water up but the height was too great  while he was doing this wilkie ran down for more water but hall stood gazing upwards openmouthed with horror at the raging flames  at that moment the leaden covering of the roof melted and rushed down on halls head and shoulders  he fell with a loud shriek while teddy tried to drag him down to the room below he exclaimed that some of the melted lead had gone down his throat  he was terribly burned about the neck but his comrades had to leave him in his bed while they strove wildly to check the flames  it was all in vain  the woodwork around the lantern from years of exposure to the heat of twentyfour large candles burning at once had become like tinder and the fire became so fierce that the timber courses composing the top of the column soon caught  then the keepers saw that any further efforts would be useless  the great exertions made to carry up even a few bucketsfull of water soon exhausted their strength and they were driven from room to room as the fire descended  at last the heat and smoke became so intense that they were driven out of the lighthouse altogether and sought shelter in a cavern or hollow under the ladder on the east side of the rock  fortunately it was low water at the time and the weather was calm  had it been otherwise the rock would have been no place of refuge  meanwhile mr thomas potter our old friend tommynow as we have said an elderly gentleman went off in a large boat with a crew of stout fishermen from cawsand bay having a smaller boat in tow  when they reached the rock a terrific spectacle was witnessed  the lighthouse was enveloped in flames nearly to the bottom for the outside planking being caulked and covered with pitch was very inflammable  the top glowed against the dark sky and looked in the midst of the smoke like a fiery meteor  the eddystone rock was suffused with a dull red light as if it were becoming red hot and the surf round it appeared to hiss against the fire while in the dark shadow of the cave the three lighthouse keepers were seen cowering in terroras they well might seeing that melted lead and flaming masses of wood and other substances were falling thickly round them  to get them out of their dangerous position was a matter of extreme difficulty because although there was little or no wind the swell caused a surf on the rock which absolutely forbade the attempt to land in this emergency they fell upon a plan which seemed to afford some hope of success  they anchored the large boat to the westward and veered down towards the rock as far as they dared venture  then three men went into the small boat which was eased off and sent farther in by means of a rope  when as near as it was possible to approach a coil of rope was thrown to the rock  it was caught by teddy maroon and although in extreme danger and anxiety the men in the boat could not help giving vent to a ringing cheer  teddy at once tied the end of the rope round the waist of old henry hall and half persuaded half forced him into the surf through which he was hauled into the boat in safety  wilkie went next and teddy followed  thus they were rescued put on board the large boat and carried on shore but no sooner did the keel grate on the sand than wilkie who had never spoken a word and who appeared half stupefied bounded on shore and ran off at full speed  it is a curious fact which no one has ever been able to account for that this man was never more heard of  as it is quite certain that he did not cause the fire and also that he did his utmost to subdue it the only conclusion that could be come to was that the excitement and terror had driven him mad  at all events that was the last of him  another curious fact connected with the fire is that henry hall actually did swallow a quantity of melted lead  he lingered for twelve days after the accident and then died  afterwards his body was opened and an oval lump of lead which weighed upwards of seven ounces was found in his stomach  this extraordinary fact is authenticated by the credible testimony of a respectable medical man and several eyewitnesses  meanwhile the lighthouse continued to burn despite the most strenuous efforts made to save it  had a storm arisen the seas would speedily have quenched the fire but unfortunately the weather continued fine and comparatively calm for several days while the wind was just strong enough to fan the fury of the flames and at the same time to cause a surf sufficiently high to render a landing on the rock impossible  but indeed even if this had been effected the efforts that could have been made with the small fireengines at that time in use would have been utterly useless  the fire gradually descended to the different courses of solid timber the wellhole of the staircase assisting the draught and the outside timbers and inside mast or wooden core forming a double connecting link whereby the devouring element was carried to the very bottom of the building with a heat so intense that the courses of cornish moorstone were made red hot  admiral west with part of the fleet happened to be at that time in plymouth sound  he at once sent a sloop with a fireengine to the rock they attempted to land in a boat but could not  so violent was the surf that the boat was at one time thrown bodily upon the rock by one wave and swept off again by the next  the escape on this occasion was almost miraculous the men therefore did not venture to make another attempt but contented themselves with endeavouring to work the engine from the boat in doing which they broke it and thus all hope of doing anything further was gone  but indeed the engine they had would have availed nothing even though it had been twice as powerful against such a mighty conflagration  as well might they have tried to extinguish vesuvius with a teakettle  for four days and nights did that massive pillar of fire burn  at last it fell in ruins before the most irresistible element with which man or matter has to contend after having braved the fury of the winds and waves for nearly half a century  thus perished the second lighthouse that was built on the eddystone rock in december of the year 1755 and thus once again were those black reefs left unguarded  once more that dread of mariners ancient and modern became a trap on the south coast of englanda trap now rendered doubly dangerous by the fact that for so long a period ships had been accustomed to make for it instead of avoiding it in the full expectation of receiving timely warning from its friendly light    chapter seven  old friends in new circumstances  we open the story of the third and still existing lighthouse on the eddystone with the reintroduction of teddy maroonthat teddy who acted so prominent a part at the burning of rudyerds tower in december 1755  mens activities seem to have been quickened at this period of time for only about six months were allowed to elapse between the destruction of the old and the commencement of operations for the new lighthouse  it was a calm evening in the autumn 1756 when teddy maroon smoking a little black pipe sauntered towards the residence of old john potter on reaching the door he extinguished the little pipe by the summary process of thrusting the point of his blunt forefinger into the bowl and deposited it hot in his vest pocket  his tap was answered by a small servant girl with a very red and ragged head of hair who ushered him into the presence of the aged couple  they were seated in the two chairsone on each side of the fireplacewhich they might almost be said to inhabit  little nora was stirring a few embers of coal into a cheery flame for she knew the old people loved the sight of the fire even in summer  on a chair beside old martha lay the open bible from which nora had been reading and on old marthas knee was the valued dictionary upside down as usual  glad to see you lad said old john with a pleasant smile as he extended his hand it does us good to see you it minds us so of old times  ah then ive got to tell ee whatll mind you more of owld times than the mere sight o me face said teddy as he patted old martha on the shoulder and sat down beside her  how are ee owld ooman  ay replied martha in a tremulous voice youre uncommon like your fatheras like as two peas  faix av ye saw the dear owld gintleman now said teddy with a laugh yed think there was a difference  howsever its o no use repaitin me question for any man could see that youre in the best o health youre bloomin like a cabbage rose  the latter part of this complimentary speech was shouted into old marthas ear and she responded by shaking her head and desiring the flatterer to go along  well john said the visitor turning to his fathers old friend youll be glad to hear that ive been engaged to work at the new lighthouse an moreover weve got fairly begun  you dont say so cried john potter with some of the old fire sparkling in his eyes well now that is pleasant noos  why it makes me amost wish to be young again  of course i heard that theyve bin hard at the preparations for a good while but few people comes to see me now they think im too old to be interested in anything i suppose an i didnt know that it was fairly begun or that you were on the work id like to hear what your old father would say to it teddy  i dont know what hed say to it responded the irishman but i know what he threatens to do for i wrote him the other day tellin him all about it an he bade my sister kathleen write back that hes more nor half a mind to come and superintend the operations  what is it all about nora demanded old martha who had been gazing intently at her husbands countenance during the conversation  nora put her pretty lips to her grandmothers ear and gave the desired information whereupon the old lady looked solemnly at her spouse and laying her hand on the dictionary said with strong though quivering emphasis now john mark my words i ave a settled conviction that that lightouse will come to a bad end  its sure to be burnt or blowd over  having given vent to which prophecy she relapsed into herself and appeared to ruminate on it with peculiar satisfaction  and whats the name of the architect demanded john  smeaton replied teddy maroon  never heerd of im before returned john  no more did i said teddy  the two friends appeared to find food for meditation in this point of ignorance for they fell into a state of silence for a few minutes which was interrupted by the sudden entrance of mr thomas potter  he looked a little wearied as he sat down beside his mother whose face lighted up with an expression of intense delight as she said come away tommy where have you been my boy  ive been out on the sea mother after mischief as usual replied tommy whose bald head and wrinkled brow repudiated while his open hearty smile appeared to justify the juvenile name  what they avent engaged you on the noo lightouse ave they said old martha in horror  no no mother dont fear that said her son hastening to relieve her mind but you know the new engineer is gathering information from all quarters and he naturally applied to me because i am of his own profession and have known and studied the rock since i was a little boy  knowd an studied it exclaimed martha with more than her wonted vigour ay an if youd said youd amost broke your old mothers heart with it youd ave said no more than the truth tommy  its a wonder as that rock hasnt brought me to a prematoor grave  however it aint likely to do so now an im glad they have not inveigled you into it my boy for its an awful place for wettin of your feet an dirtin of your hands and pinafores an  the old lady relapsing here into early reminiscences once more retired within herself while  teddy maroon and john potter mentioning their ignorance as to the architect who had undertaken the great work demanded of mister thomas if he could enlighten them  of course i can he replied for he is well known to his friends as a most able man and will become better known to the world if i may venture to prophesy as the builder of what is sure to be the most famous lighthouse on the english coast  his name is smeaton and he is not an engineer  not an engineer echoed teddy and old john in surprise  no hes a mathematical instrument maker  well now said john potter gazing meditatively into the fireplace where nora had evoked a tiny flame that is strange  this eddystun rock seems to have what i may call a pecooliar destiny  the builder of the first lightouse was a country gentleman of the second a silkmercer and now as you say the third is to be put up by a maker o mathymatical instruments  i only hope continued john shaking his head gravely at the fireplace that he wont make a mess of it like the others did  come now father returned his son dont say that the others made a mess of it  we must remember that winstanley began his building in what we may call total darkness  no other man before him had attempted such a work so that he had no predecessor whose good points he might imitate or whose failures he might avoid  many a trained engineer might have made a worse mess of it and to my mind it says much for poor winstanleys capacity all things considered that his lighthouse stood so long as the six or seven years of its building  then as to rudyerds one it was in reality a great success  it stood firm for nigh fifty years and but for the fire might have stood for any number of years to come  it cannot be justly said that he made a mess of it as well might you say that the builders of a firstrate ship made a mess of it because someone set her alight after she had sailed the ocean for half a century  true tommy true said old john nodding acquiescence emphatically on seeing this old martha knowing nothing about the matter because of her deafness nodded emphatically also and said thats so tommy i always ad a settled conviction that you was right except she added as if to guard herself except wen you was after mischief  well but tommy continued old john you was agoin to tell us somethin about this mister smeaton  what sort of a man is he  as far as i can judge on short acquaintance replied potter he seems to be a man who has got a mind and a will of his own and looks like one who wont be turned out of his straight course by trifles  his name is john which is a good bible name besides being yours father and he comes from leeds a highly respectable place which has produced men of note before now  his age is thirtytwo which is about the most vigorous period of a mans life and he has come to his present business in spite of all opposition a fact which is favourable to the prospects of the lighthouse  in short hes a natural genius and a born engineer his father an attorney wished him to follow his own profession but it was soon clear that that was out of the question for the boys whole soul was steeped from earliest childhood in mechanics  i once knew a boy said john potter with a smile whose whole soul was steeped in the same thing  and in mischief added old martha suddenly much to every ones surprise  the old womans deafness was indeed of a strangely intermittent type  well continued potter with a laugh and a nod to his mother no doubt smeaton had a spice of mischief in him among other qualities for it is said of him that when quite a little fellow he made a force pump with which he emptied his fathers fishpond of water to the detriment not to say consternation of the fish  the upshot of it all was that the lad was apprenticed to a maker of mathematical instruments and soon proved himself to be an inventive genius of considerable power  ere long he commenced business on his own account and has now undertaken the task of building the third lighthouse on the eddystone  i was in london lately and saw the beautiful models of the intended structure which smeaton has made with his own hands and it seems to me that hes just the man to do the work  at the mention of models old john potters eyes lighted up for it brought the memory of former days vividly before him  he means to build it of stone said the son  stone say ee thats right tommy thats right said old john with a nod of strong approval ive always thought that the weak point in the old lightouses was want of weight  on such a slope of a foundation you know it requires great weight to prevent the seas washin a lighthouse clean away  ive thought the same thing father but what you and i only thought of smeaton has stated and intends to act upon  he means to build a tower so solid that it will defy the utmost fury of winds and waves  he is going to cut the sloping foundation into a series of steps or shelves which will prevent the possibility of slipping  the shape of the building is to be something like the trunk of an oak tree with a wider base than the lighthouse of rudyerd  the first twenty feet or so of it is to be built solid each stone to be made in the shape of a dovetail and all the stones circling round a central key to which they will cling as well as to each other besides being held by bolts and cement so that the lower part of the building will be as firm as the rock on which it stands  but i daresay father continued his son with a glance at teddy maroon our friend here being engaged on the work has told you all about this already  not i said maroon quickly ive bin too busy to come here until today and though ive got me own notions o what mr smeaton intends by obsarvin whats goin on i hant guessed the quarter o what youve towld me sur  howsever i can spake to whats bin already done  you must know said teddy with a great affectation of being particular mr smeaton has wisely secured his workmen by howldin out pleasant prospects to em  in the first place weve got good regular wages an additional pay whin were on the rock  in the second place extra work on shore is paid for over an above the fixed wages  in the third place each man has got his appinted dooty ans kep close at it  in the fourth place the rules is uncommon stringent and instant dismissal follers the breakin of em  in the fifth place  never mind the fifth place teddy interrupted old john like yer father ye was ever too fond o waggin yer tongue  just tell us straight off if ye can whats been already done at the rock  well well said maroon with a deprecatory smile owld father an mes always bin misonderstud more or less but no matter  av coorse weve had the usual difficulties to fight agin for the owld eddystone rock aint agoin to change its natur to please nobody  as me father described it in his day so i finds it in mine  on most of our first visits we got wet skins but little or no work done for though it might be ever so calm here at plymouth it always seemed to be blowin a private gale out at the rockleastwise av it warnt blowin there was swell enough most days to make the landin troublesome  so we got wan hours work at wan time an two hours or may be three at another off an on  as the saison advanced we got on better sometimes got five and six hours on the rock right on ind and whin the tide sarved we wint at it by torchlight  wan week we got no less than sixtyfour an a half hours on it an we was all in great sperrits intirely over that for you see mister potter were all picked men an takes a pride in the workto say nothin of havin a good master  av coorse weve had the usual botherations wid the sharp rocks cuttin the cable of our attendinsloop an gales suddinly gettin up whin we was at the rock wantin to land as well as suddinly goin down whin we wasnt at the rock so that we missed our chances  but such sorrows was what we expicted more or less  the wust disappointment weve had has bin wi the noo storeship the neptune buss  i wish it was the neptune bust i do for its wus than a tub an gives us more trouble than its all worth  now the saisons drawin to a close its clear that well do no more this year than cut the foundations  an thats not a bad seasons work lad said old john  aint it not tommy  not bad indeed father for there are always unusual and vexatious delays at the beginning of a great work besides some of the greatest difficulties in connexion with such buildings are encountered in the preparation of the foundations  i suppose mr smeaton means to dress the stones on shore ready for laying continued potter the younger turning to maroon who had risen and was buttoning up his monkeyjacket  why yes sur havent you bin down at the yard  not yet  ive only just arrived in town and must be off again tomorrow  you cant think how disappointed i am at being prevented by business from taking part in the building of the new lighthouse  whats that you say tommy interrupted old martha putting her hand to her ear and wrinkling her brow interrogatively  that im grieved mother at not being able to help in building the new lighthouse shouted her son in a voice that might have split an ordinary ear  old marthas visage relaxed into a faint smile as she turned towards the fire and looked earnestly at it as if for explanation or consolation  ay ay she muttered it would have bin strange if you hadnt wished that you was always up to mischief tommy always or else wishin to be up to it although you might know as well as i know myself that if you did get leave to go hout to the rock which youre for ever wantin to do it would be wet feet an dirty pinafores mornin noon an night which its little you care for that you bad boy though it causes me no end of washin an dryinay ay  the old woman looked up in the smiling countenance of her stalwart son and becoming apparently a little confused by reminiscences of the past and evidences of the present retired within herself and relapsed into silence  well sur continued teddy just give a look down if you can its worth your while  mr smeaton means to have every stone cut in the yard here on shore and to lay down each course in the yard too to be sure that it all fits for well have no time out at the rock to correct mistakes or make alterations  itll be sharps the word boys and look alive o all through ship the stones off to the rock land em in hot haste clap on the cement down wi the blocks work like blazesor irishmen which is much the same thing make all fast into the boats again sailors shoutin look alive me hearties squall bearin down right abaft of the lee stunsl gangwayor somethin like that up sail an hooroo boys for the land weather permittin if not out to say an take things aisy or av ye cant be aisy be as aisy as ye can  a pleasant prospect truly said mr t  potter laughing as he shook the irishmans horny hand  goodbye john  goodbye nora me darlin goodbye owld ooman  hold your noise lad said old martha looking gravely into her visitors face  thats just what i manes to do mavoorneen replied teddy maroon with a pleasant nod for ill be off to the rock tomorrow by daybreak weather permittin an its little help any noise from me would give to the waves that kape gallivantin wid the reefs out there like mad things from sunday to saturday all the year round  when the door shut on the noisy irishman it seemed as though one of the profound calms so much needed and desired out at the eddystone rock had settled down in old john potters homea calm which was not broken for some minutes thereafter except by old martha muttering softly once or twice while she gravely shook her head hold your noise teddy hold your noise lad youre very like your father hold your noise    chapter eight  experiences difficulties and dangers of the first season  while the building of the new lighthouse was being thus calmly discussed on shore out at the eddystone the wild waves were lashing themselves into fierce fury as if they had got wind of what was being done and had hurried from all ends of the sea to interdict proceedings  in hurrying to the field of battle these wild waves indulged in a little of their favourite pastime  they caught up two unfortunate vesselsa large west indiaman and a manofwars tenderand bore them triumphantly towards the fatal rock  it seemed as though the waves regarded these as representative vessels and meant thus to cast the royal and the merchant navies on the eddystone by way as it were of throwing down the gauntlet to presumptuous man  for want of the famous light the vessels bore straight down upon the rock and the wild waves danced and laughed and displayed their white teeth and their seething ire as if in exultation at the thought of the shattered hulls and mangled corpses which they hoped ere long to toss upon their crests  fortunately man was on the look out  the buss was tugging at her moorings off the rock and some of the seamen and hands were perambulating the deck wishing for settled weather and trying to pierce the gloom by which they were surrounded  suddenly the two vessels were seen approaching  the alarm was given  those on board the doomed ships saw their danger when too late and tried to sheer off the fatal spot but their efforts were fruitless  the exulting waves hurried them irresistibly on  in this extremity the eddystone men leaped into their yawl pushed off and succeeded in towing both vessels out of danger at once demonstrating the courage of english hearts and the need there was for english hands to complete the work on which they were then engaged  next day mr smeaton came off to visit the rock and the news of the rescue served him for a text on which to preach a laysermon as to the need of every man exerting himself to the uttermost in a work which was so obviously a matter of life and death  it was however scarcely necessary to urge these men for they were almost all willing  but not all in nearly every flock there is a black sheep or so that requires weeding out  there were two such sheep among the builders of the eddystone  being good at everything smeaton was a good weeder  he soon had them up by the roots and cast out  a foreman proved to be disorderly and tried to make the men promise that if he should be discharged they would all follow him  smeaton at once assembled the men and gave orders that such of them as had any dependence on or attachment to the refractory foreman should take up his tools and follow him  only one did sothe rest stood firm  at this time the weather was very unsettled and the work progressed slowly  once or twice it was still further retarded by men who should have known better in the following manner  one evening one of the lighthouse boats was boarded by a cutter the officer in charge of which proceeded to impress several of the men into the navy  its to be pressed we are murmured teddy maroon to one of his mates in a vexed tone sure the taterheads might know weve got an admiralty protection  whether the officer knew this or not it was evident that he had overheard the remark for after selecting two of the best men he turned and pointing to maroon said aloud  let that taterhead also jump on board  hes not worth much but the service is in want of powdermonkeys just now  perhaps hell do  if not ill send him back  thus was the poor irishman carried off with his two mates to fight the battles of his country  in a few days however they were all sent back and the indiscreet officer who had impressed them got a reprimand for his pains  after the first season they had no further interruptions from this source  large mainsails were given them for their boats with a lighthouse painted on each and every man obtained besides a silver medal of exemption from impressment  but this was only the commencement of poor teddys throubles at that time  he had scarcely returned to his work when a new one overtook him this was however in the way of business  teddy my fine fellow said richardson the foreman as they stood on the deck of the buss holding on to the mizzen shrouds its quite clear to me that with the wind dead against them like this the relief boat with hills company wont be able to get off and as were short of provisions i mean to take the big yawl and go ashore with my gang  as the best men are always chosen for posts of danger i shall leave you in charge of the buss with two handssmart and bowdenboth stanch fellows as you know  im your servant sir said teddy only if the best men are wanted here hadnt you better stop yourself an ill take the rest ashore  richardson did not see his way to this though he acknowledged the compliment and that evening teddy found himself in command of the despised buss with half a gale blowing and as he observed more where that came from  teddy was right more did come and kept him and his mates idle prisoners for a week  indeed the whole of that month had been so stormy that from the 16th to the 30th only twenty hours work had been done on the rock  during six days the three men stuck to their post but at the end of that time teddy called a council of war  gintlemen said he for men in our pursition must be purlite to sich other its our dooty to stick by this here tub so longs its of any use to do so but as she seems to be well able to look after herself an our purvisions has come down to the last ounce its my opinion founded on profound meditations over me last pipethat wed better go ashore  to this speech john bowden replied im agreeable for its not my dooty to starve myself  william smart however intimated that he was disagreeable  because said he its blowin great guns an looks as if it meant to go on which is not a state of weather suitable for goin over a dozen miles of sea in a small open boat without even a mast or a rag of sail to bless herself with  pooh exclaimed maroon contemptuously a blanketll make the best of sails  ay added bowden and an oar will do well enough for a mastanyhow well try for most votes carry in all wellregulated meetins  this plan although attended with considerable danger was finally agreed to and forthwith acted on  that afternoon the men on shore observed a very robinsoncrusoelike boat coming in from the sea with an oarmast and a blanketsail from which landed captain teddy maroon and his two mates  the same evening however the wind moderated and shifted a little so that the relief boat with provisions and the gang of men whose turn it was to do duty in the storeship succeeded in getting off and reaching their buss in safety  the weather became so bad soon after this that smeaton thought it wise to bring his operations for that season to a close  accordingly on the 7th november he visited the rock which had been cut into a regular floor of successive terraces or steps and was considerably larger in circumference than the foundation on which rudyerds building had rested  on the 15th the buss sailed into plymouth the men having run out of provisions and having been unable to do anything on the rock  a great storm raged on the 22nd  on the previous day smeaton had gone off in the buss to attach a buoy to the mooring chains for that winter  the task was laborious and when it was completed they found it impossible to return to plymouth owing to the miserable sailing qualities of their vessel  there was nothing for it but to cast loose and run before the wind  while doing so they snapt the painter of the yawl and lost it  thus they were as it were cast adrift upon the sea with neither maps charts books nor instruments to guide them  no alarm however was felt the neighbouring headlands being bold and all on board having previously been at fowey to which port smeaton now gave orders to steer  wet and worn out with labour he then went below to snatch a few hours repose  in the night he was awakened by a tremendous noise overhead the men were rushing about the deck and shouting wildly  he sprang up without dressing  a voice exclaiming for gods sake heave hard on that rope if you want to save yourselves saluted him as he gained the deck  roaring wind a deluge of rain and pitch darkness held revel on the sea but above the din was heard the dreaded sound of breakers close under their lee  the jib was split the mainsail halflowered and the vessel running gunwale under  by vigorous and welldirected action in which john bowden proved himself to be one of those men who are towers of strength in emergencies the head of the buss was brought round and the immediate danger averted but they had no idea where they were and when day broke on the 23rd they found themselves out of sight of land  their last boat also had filled while towing astern and had to be cut adrift  at noon however they sighted the lands endthe wind blowing hard from the noreast  no chance o making a british port in this wind with such a vessel sir said john bowden touching his cap respectfully to mr smeaton  as well try to bate to winard in me grandmothers washtub remarked teddy maroon in a disrespectful tone  smeaton agreeing with them layto the whole of the 24th and then casting anchor debated whether it were better to make for the coast of france or try to reach the scilly islands  fortunately a change of wind on the 25th enabled them to weigh anchor and run back to plymouth rejoicing and vowing as john bowden said never more to venture out to sea in a buss  they reached the harbour at six in the morning to the intense relief of their friends who had given them up for lost  thus ended the first season1756    chapter nine  account of the war continued  now then my lads said smeaton on the 12th of june 1757 we shall lay the foundation today so let us go to work with a will  faix then whispered teddy maroon to john bowden as they proceeded to the wharf where the readycut stones were being put on board the eddystone boat its little good well do av we dont go to work wid a will  i believe you my boy replied john heartily  john bowden said and did everything heartily  an we wont be long he continued about laying the first course its such a small one  hallo shouted the man in charge of the boat as they came in sight of it come along lads were all ready  according to directions they ran down and jumped on board with a will  smeaton took his place in the stern  they pushed off with a will sailed and pulled out the fourteen miles with a will jumped on the rock landed the heavy stones went immediately into action cleaned the bed and laid the first stone of the great workall under the same vigorous impulse of the will  this was at eight in the morning  by the evening tide the first course which formed but a small segment of a circle was fitted with the utmost despatch bedded in mortar and trenailed down  next day the second course was partly landed on the rock the men still working with a will for moments out there were more precious than hours or days in ordinary buildingbut before they got the whole course landed old ocean also began to work with a will and eventually proved himself stronger than his adversaries by driving them in a terrific storm from the rock  they reached the buss with difficulty and lay there idle while the mad waves revelled round the rocks and danced through their works deridingly  it seemed however as though they were only in fun for on returning to work after the gale abated it was found that no harm had been done  as if however to check any premature felicitations old ocean again sent a sudden squall on the 18th which drove the men once more off the rock without allowing time to chain the stones landed so that five of them were lost  this was a serious disaster  the lost stones could only be replaced by new ones being cut from the distant quarries  prompt in all emergencies smeaton hurried away and set two men to work on each stone night and day nevertheless despite his utmost efforts seconded by willing men the incident caused the loss of more than a week  fogs now stepped in to aid and abet the winds and waves in their mad efforts to stop the work  stop it  they little knew what indomitable spirits some men have got  as well might they have attempted to stop the course of time  they succeeded however in causing vexatious delays and in july had the audacity to fling a wreck in the very teeth of the builders as if to taunt them with the futility of their labours  it happened thus on the night of the 5th a vessel named the charming sally about 130 tons burden and hailing from biddeford came sailing over the main  a bright lookout was kept on board of her of course for the wind was moderately high and the fog immoderately thick  the sally progressed charmingly till midnight when the lookout observed something right ahead  he thought the something looked like fishingboats and being an unusually bright fellow he resolved to wait until he should be quite sure before reporting what he saw  with a jovial swirl the waves bore the charming sally to her doom  rocks ahead roared the bright lookout rather suddenly  rocks under her bottom thought the crew of seven hands as they leaped on deck and felt the outlying reefs of the eddystone playing pitch and toss with their keel  dire was the confusion on board and cruel were the blows dealt with ungallant and unceasing violence at the hull of the charming sally and black black as the night would have been the fate of the hapless seamen on that occasion if the builders of the eddystone had not kept a brighter lookout on board their sheltering buss  john bowden had observed the vessel bearing down on the rocks and gave a startling alarm  without delay a boat was launched and pulled to the rescue meanwhile the vessel filled so fast that their boat floated on the deck before the crew could get into it and the whole affair had occurred so suddenly that some of the men when taken off were only in their shirts  that night the rescued men were hospitably entertained in the buss by the builders of the new lighthouse and soon after the ribs of the charming sally were torn to pieces by the farfamed teeth of the eddystoneanother added to the countless thousands of wrecks which had been demonstrating the urgent need there was for a lighthouse there since the earliest days of navigation  having enacted this pleasant little episode the indefatigable builders set to work again to do battle with the winds and waves  that the battle was a fierce one is incidentally brought out by the fact that on the 8th of august the sea was said for the first time to have refrained from going over the works during a whole tide  on the 11th of the same month the building was brought to a level with the highest point of the rock  this was a noteworthy epoch inasmuch as the first completely circular course was laid down and the men had more space to move about  mr smeaton indeed seems to have moved about too much  possibly the hilarious state of his mind unduly affected his usually sedate body  at all events from whatever cause he chanced to tumble off the edge of the building and fell on the rocks below at the very feet of the amazed teddy maroon who happened to be at work there at the time  och is it kilt ye are sur demanded the irishman  not quite replied smeaton rising and carefully examining his thumb which had been dislocated  sure now its a sargeon ye should have bin said teddy as his commander jerked the thumb into its place as though it had been the disabled joint of a mathematical instrument and quietly returned to his labours  about this time also the great shears by means of which the stones were raised to the top of the building were overturned and fell with a crash amongst the men fortunately however no damage to life or limb resulted though several narrow escapes were made  being now on a good platform they tried to work at night with the aid of links but the enemy came down on them in the form of wind and constantly blew the links out  the builders determined not to be beaten made a huge bonfire of their links  the enemy growing furious called up reinforcements of the waves and not only drowned out the bonfire but drove the builders back to the shelter of their fortress the buss and shut them up there for several days while the waves coming constantly up in great battalions broke high over the reerected shears and did great damage to the machinery and works but failed to move the sturdy root of the lighthouse which had now been fairly planted though the attack was evidently made in force this being the worst storm of the season  it lasted fifteen days  on the 1st september the enemy retired for a little repose and the builders instantly sallying out went to work again with a will and secured eighteen days of uninterrupted progress  then the ocean as if refreshed renewed the attack and kept it up with such unceasing vigour that the builders drew off and retired into winter quarters on the 3rd of october purposing to continue the war in the following spring  during this campaign of 1757 the column of the lighthouse had risen four feet six inches above the highest point of the eddystone rock  thus ended the second season and the wearied but dauntless men returned to the workyard on shore to carve the needful stones and otherwise to prepare ammunition for the coming struggle  sitting one night that winter at john potters fireside smoking his pipe in company with john bowden teddy maroon expressed his belief that building lighthouses was about the hardest and the greatest work that man could undertake that the men who did undertake such work ought not only to receive double pay while on duty but also half pay for the remainder of their natural lives that the thanks of the king lords and commons inscribed on vellum should be awarded to each man and that gold medals should be struck commemorative of such great events all of which he said with great emphasis discharging a sharp little puff of smoke between every two or three words and winding up with a declaration that them was his sentiments  to all this old john potter gravely nodded assent and old marthabeing quite deaf to sound as well as reasonshook her head so decidedly that her cap quivered again  john bowden ventured to differ  hefiring off little cloudlets of smoke between words in emulation of his friendgave it as his opinion that war was wuss an opinion which he founded on the authority of his departed father who had fought all through the peninsular campaign and who had been in the habit of entertaining his friends and family with such graphic accounts of storming breaches bombarding fortresses lopping off heads arms and legs screwing bayonets into mens gizzards and livers and otherwise agonising human frames and demolishing human handiwork that the hair of his auditors heads would certainly have stood on end if that capillary proceeding had been at all possible  but teddy maroon did not admit the force of his friends arguments  he allowed indeed that war was a great work inasmuch as it was a great evil whereas lighthousebuilding was a great blessing and he contended that while the first was a cause of unmitigated misery and productive of nothing better than widows orphans and national debts the second was the source of immense happiness and of salvation to life limb and property  to this john bowden objected and teddy maroon retorted whereupon a war of words began which speedily waged so hot that the pipes of both combatants went out and old john potter found it necessary to assume the part of peacemaker in which being himself a keen debater he failed and there is no saying what might have been the result of it if old martha had not brought the action to a summary close by telling her visitors in shrill tones to hold their noise  this they did after laughing heartily at the old womans fierce expression of countenance  before parting however they all agreed without deciding the question at issuethat lighthousebuilding was truly a noble work    chapter ten  the campaign of 1758  the contrast was pleasant repose after toilfor stonecutting in the yard on shore was rest compared with the labour at the rock  steady regular quiet progress stone after stone added to the great pile tested and ready for shipment at the appointed time  the commanderinchief planning experimenting superintending  the men busy as bees and last but not least delightful evenings with friends and recountings of the incidents of the war  such is the record of the winter  the spring of 1758 came summer advanced  the builders assumed the offensive and sent out skirmishers to the rock where they found that the enemy had taken little or no rest during the winter and were as hard at it as ever  little damage however had been done  the attacking party suffered some defeats at the outset  they found that their buoy was lost and the mooring chain of the buss had sunk during the winter  it was fished up however but apparently might as well have been let lie for it could not hold the buss which broke loose during a gale and had to run for plymouth sound  again on 3rd june another buoy was lost and bad weather continued till july  then however a general and vigorous assault was made the result being great progress so that on the 8th of august a noteworthy point was reached  on that day the fourteenth course was laid and this completed the solid part of the lighthouse  it rose 35 feet above the foundation  from this point the true house may be said to have commenced for just above this course the opening for the door was left and the little space in the centre for the spiral staircase which was to lead to the first room  as if to mark their disapproval of this event the angry winds and waves during the same month raised an unusually furious commotion while one of the yawls went into the gut or pool which served as a kind of harbour to aid one of the stone boats  she wont get out o that this night said john bowden alluding to the yawl as he stood on the top of the solid where his comrades were busy working the winds gettin up from the eastard  if she dont replied one of the men well have to sleep where we are  slape exclaimed maroon looking up from the great stone whose joints he had been carefully cementing its little slape youll do here boys  av were not washed off entirely well have to howld on by our teeth and nails  its a cowld lookout  teddy was right  the yawl being unable to get out of the gut the men in it were obliged to lie on their oars all night and those on the top of the building where there was scarcely shelter for a fly felt both the lookout and the lookin so cowld that they worked all night as the only means of keeping themselves awake and comparatively warm  it was a trying situation a hard night as it were in the trenchesbut it was their first and last experience of the kind  thus foot by footoften baffled but never conqueredsmeaton and his men rose steadily above the waves until they reached a height of thirtyfive feet from the foundation and had got as far as the storeroom the first apartment of the building  this was on the 2nd of october on which day all the stones required for that season were put into this storeroom but on the 7th of the same month the enemy made a grand assault in force and caused these energetic labourers to beat a retreat  it was then resolved that they should again retire into winter quarters  everything on the rock was therefore made taut and secure against the foe and the workers returned to the shore whence they beheld the waves beating against their tower with such fury that the sprays rose high above it  the season could not close however without an exhibition of the peculiar aptitude of the buss for disastrous action  on the 8th that inimitable vesselstyled by teddy maroon a tub and by the other men variously a bumboat a puncheon and a brute began to tug with tremendous violence at her cable  ah then darlin cried maroon apostrophising her av ye go on like that much longer its snappin yer cable yell be after  it wouldnt be the first time growled john bowden as he leaned against the gale and watched with gravity of countenance a huge billow whose crest was blown off in sheets of spray as it came rolling towards them  howld on cried teddy maroon in anxiety  if his order was meant for the buss it was flatly disobeyed for that charming example of naval architecture presenting her bluff bows to the billow snapt the cable and went quietly off to leeward  all hands ahoy roared william smart as he rushed to the foresail halyards  the summons was not needed  all the men were present and each knew exactly what to do in the circumstances  but what avails the strength and capacity of man when his weapon is useless  shell never beat into plymouth sound wi the wind in this direction observed one of the masons when sail had been set  beat exclaimed another contemptuously she cant beat with the wind in any direction  an yit boys cried maroon she may be said to be a firstrate baiter for she always baits us complaitly  i never no i never did see such a scow said john bowden with a deepening growl of indignation shes more like an irish pig than a  ah then dont be hard upon the poor pigs of owld ireland interrupted maroon pathetically  bah continued bowden i only wish we had the man that planned her on board that we might keelhaul him  ive sailed in amost every kind of craft that floatsfrom a chinese junk to a british threedecker and between the two extremes theres a pretty extensive choice of washintubs but the equal o this here buss i never did seeno never take another haul on the foretopsl halyards boys and shut your potatotraps for fear the wind blows your teeth overboard  look alive  that the buss deserved the character so emphatically given to her was proved by the fact that after an unsuccessful attempt to reach the sound she was finally run into dartmouth roads and shortly afterwards her ungainly tossings for that season came to a close    chapter eleven  the last campaignand victory  the campaign of 1759 opened on the 3rd of july with an attack commanded by smeaton in person in the old buss  previous to this on march 21st the coast was visited by a gale of such severity that immense mischief was done on shore  ships in the port houses etcetera at plymouth were greatly damaged nevertheless the unfinished tower out upon the exposed eddystone reef stood fast having defied the utmost fury of winds and waves  it was found however that some loss had been sustained the buoy of the mooring chain as usual was gone but worse than that one of the stones left in the storeroom a mass which weighed four and a half hundredweight was missing  it had been washed out of the storeroom entry by the water  this was a serious loss as it obliged the men to retire to the buss where they were constrained to spin yarns and twirl their thumbs in idleness till the lost stone was replaced by another  then they went to work according to custom with a will and on the 21st of july completed the second floor a whole room with a vaulted roof having been built in seven days  at this point they proceeded to fit in the entry and storeroom doors and here another vexatious check appeared imminent  it was found that the blocktin with which the doorhooks were to be fastened had been forgotten  doubtless mr smeaton felt inclined to emulate the weather by storming on this occasion but that would have been of no use  neither was it of any avail that teddy maroon scratched his head and wrinkled his visage like that of a chimpanzee monkey  the tin was not the hooks would not hold without it and to send ashore for it would have involved great delay  mr smeaton proved equal to the occasion  off with you lads to the buss he cried and bring hither every pewter plate and dish on board  think o that now exclaimed maroon his wrinkles expanding into a bland smile of admiration  dont think of it but do it returned smeaton with a laugh  the thing was done at once  the plate of the buss was melted down and mixed with lead the hooks were fixed into the jambs and the doors were hung in triumph  solid doors they were too not slender things with wooden panels but thick ironplated affairs somewhat resembling the armour of a modern shipofwar and fitted to defy the oceans most powerful batteringrams  progress thereafter was steady and rapid  there were points here and there in the work which served as landmarks  on the 6th of august smeaton witnessed a strange sighta bright halo round the top of the building  it was no miracle though it looked like one  doubtless some scientific men could give a satisfactory explanation of it and prove that it was no direct interposition of the hand of god  so could they give a satisfactory account of the rainbow though the rainbow is a direct sign to man  whatever the cause there the glory circled like a sign of blessing on the work and a fitting emblem of the lifegiving because deathwarding beams which were soon to be sent streaming from that tower by the hand of man  three days afterwards they began to lay the balcony floor on the 17th the main column was completed and on the 26th the masonry was finished it only remained that the lantern should be set up  but this lantern was a mighty mass of metal and glass made with great care and of immense strength and weight  of course it had to be taken off to the rock in pieces and we may almost say of course the ocean offered opposition  then as if everything had conspired to test the endurance and perseverance of the builders the first and second coppersmiths fell ill on the 4th september  skilled labour such as theirs could not readily be replaced in the circumstances and every hour of the now far advanced season had become precious  smeaton had set his heart on showing a light that year  in this difficulty being a skilled mechanic himself he threw off his coat and set to work with the men  the materials of the lantern were landed on the 16th and fitted together and the cupola was hoisted to its place on the 17th  this latter operation was extremely hazardous the cupola being upwards of half a ton in weight and it had to be raised outside the building and kept carefully clear of it the while  it seemed as if the elements themselves favoured this critical operation or rather as though they stood aghast and breathlessly still while this the crowning evidence of their defeat was being put on  it was accomplished in less than half an hour and strange to say no sooner was the tackling loosed and the screws that held the cupola fixed than up got wind and sea once more in an uproarious gale of consternation from the east  on the 18th a huge gilt ball was screwed on the top by smeatons own hand and thus the building of the eddystone lighthouse was finished  there still remained however a good deal of copper and woodwork to be done in the interior but there was now no doubt in smeatons mind that the light would be exhibited that season  he therefore removed his bed and stores from the buss to the lighthouse and remained there the better to superintend the completion of the work  one evening he looked into the upper storeroom where some bars were being heated over a charcoal fire  he became giddy with the fumes staggered and fell down insensible  assuredly poor smeatons labours would have terminated then and there if it had not been that one of the men had providentially followed him  a startled cry was heardone of those cries full of meaning which cause men to leap half involuntarily to the rescue  och somebodys kilt cried maroon flinging away his pipe and springing up the staircase followed by others wather wather look alive there  some bore smeaton to the room below and others ran down for seawater which they dashed over their master unmercifully  whether or not it was the best treatment we cannot say but it sufficed for smeaton soon recovered consciousness and found himself lying like a half drowned rat on the stone floor  at last on the 1st of october the lantern was lighted for trial during the day with 24 candles  they burned well though a gale was blowing on the 4th an express was sent to the corporation of the trinity house to say that all was ready  a short delay was made to allow of the lightingup being advertised and finally on the 16th of october 1759 the new eddystone lighthouse cast its first benignant rays over the troubled sea  it chanced on that day that an appropriate storm raged as if to inaugurate the great event  owing to this smeaton could not get off to be at the lightingup of his own building  from the shore however he beheld its initiative gleam as it opened its bright eye to the reality of its grand position and we can well believe that his hardy persevering spirit exulted that night over the success of his labours we can well believe also that there was in him a deeper and higher feeling than that of mere joy if we may judge of the cast of his mind by the inscriptions put by him upon his work during progress and at completion  round the upper storeroom on the course under the ceiling he chiselled the words  except the lord build the house they labour in vain that build it  and on the last stone set over the door of the lantern was carved  praise god  the lighthouse thus happily completed rose to a height of seventy feet and consisted of fortysix courses of masonry  the internal arrangements will be understood at once by reference to our engraving which exhibits a section of the tower  there was first the solid part 35 feet in height and 16 feet 8 inches in diameter at the top the base being much wider  then came the still very solid portion with the entrancedoor and the spiral staircase  above that the first storeroom which had no windows  next the second storeroom with two windows  next the kitchen followed by the bedroom both of which had four windows and last the lantern  the rooms were 12 feet 4 inches in diameter with walls 2 feet 2 inches thick and the whole fabric from top to bottom was so dovetailed trenailed cemented interconnected and bound together that it formed and still continues a unique and immoveable mass of masonry  there were others besides smeaton who watched that night with deep interest the opening of the eddystones bright eye  in a humble apartment in the village of cawsand bay an aged man stood supported by an elderly man at a window gazing seaward with an expression of intense expectation while a very aged woman sat crooning over the fire holding the hand of a fair girl just verging on early womanhood  dee see it yet tommy asked the old man eagerly  no not yet replied tommy notyesthere  ah thats it i see it cried old john potter with a faint gleam of his old enthusiasm  there it goes brighter than ever  a blessed light and much wanted tommy much much wanted  he leaned heavily on his sons arm and after gazing for some time asked to be taken back to his chair opposite old martha  what is it inquired martha bending her ear towards a pretty little mouth  grandfather has just seen the new eddystone lighted up for the first time replied nora  ay ay said martha in a moralising tone as she turned her eyes towards the fire ay ay so soon  i always had a settled conviction that that lighthouse would be burnt  its not burnt grannie said nora smiling its only lighted up  well well my dear returned martha with a solemn shake of the head there ant much difference atween lightedup an burntup  its just as i always said to your father my dearto your grandfather i mean depend upon it john i used to say that lightouse will either be burnt up or blowed over  ay ay dear me  she subsided into silent meditation and thus good reader we shall bid her farewell merely remarking that she and her honest husband did not die for a considerable time after that  as she grew older and blinder old martha became more and more attached to the bible and the dictionary as well as to dear good blooming nora who assisted her in the perusal of the former her sweet ringing voice being the only one at last that the old woman could hear  but although it was evident that martha had changed in many ways her opinions remained immoveable  she feebly maintained these and held her settled convictions to the last gasp  as for teddy maroon he returned to ireland after the lighthouse was finished and quietly got married and settled on the margin of the bog where the teddy from whom he sprang still lingered among his numerous descendants the life of his juvenile kindred and an oracle on lighthouses  time with its relentless scythe at last swept all the actors in our tale away generations after them came and went  the world grew older and more learned whether more wise is still an open question  knowledge increased science and art advanced apace  electricity steam iron gold muscle and brain all but wrought miracles and almost everything underwent change more or less but amid all the turmoil of the worlds progress and all the storms of elemental strife one object remained unaltered and apparently unalterablethe eddystone lighthouse  true indeed its lantern underwent vast improvements the argand lamp and lens replacing the old candle and causing its crown to shine with a whiter light and an intensified glory as it grew older but as regards its sturdy frame there it has stood on the rugged rocks amid the tormented surges presenting its bold and battered but undamaged front to the utmost fury of blast and billow for upwards of a hundred years
