housewives now may say   for now foul sluts in dairies   may fare as well as they                      bp corbet   an ancient leafless stump of a horsechesnut stood in the middle of a dusty field bordered on the south side by a row of houses of some pretension  against this stump a pretty delicate fair girl of seventeen whose short lilac sleeves revealed slender white arms and her tight plain cap tresses of flaxen hair that many a beauty might have envied was banging a cocoanut mat chanting by way of accompaniment in a sort of cadence   i have found out a gift for my fur   i have found where the woodpigeons breed   but let me the plunder forbear   she will say  hollo ill give you a shilling for em was the unlookedfor conclusion causing her to start aside with a slight scream as there stood beside her a stout blackeyed roundfaced lad his ruddy cheeks and loutish air showing more rusticity than agreed with his keen saucy expression and mechanics dress  so thats what you call beating a mat said he catching it from her hands and mimicking the tender clasp of her little fingers dye think its alive that you use it so gingerly  look here give it him well as he made it resound against the tree and emit a whirlwind of dust  lay it into him with some jolly good song fit to fetch a stroke home with  why i heard my young lord say when shakspeare was a butcher he used to make speeches at the calves as if they was for a sacrifice or ever he could lift a knife to em  shakspeare  he as wrote romeo and juliet and all that  he a butcher  why he was a poet cried the girl indignantly  if you know better than lord fitzjocelyn you may said the boy  i couldnt have thought it sighed the maiden  its the best of it cried the lad eagerly  why charlotte dont ye see he rose hisself  anybody may rise hisself as has a mind to it  yes ive read that in books said charlotte  you can men can tom if you would but educate yourself like edmund in the old english baron  but then you know whose son you are  there cant be no catastrophe  i dont want none said tom  we are all equal by birth so the orator proves without a doubt and well show it one of these days a rare lady ill make of you yet charlotte arnold  o hush tom i can never be a ladyand i cant stand dawdling herenor you neither  tisnt right to want to be out of our station though i do wish i lived in an old castle where the maidens worked tapestry and heard minstrels never had no stairs to scour come give me my mats and thank you kindly  ill take em in said tom shouldering them  tis breakfasthour so i thought id just run up and ax you when my young lord goes up to oxford  he is gone said charlotte he was here yesterday to take leave of missus mr james goes later  gone cried tom  if he didnt say hed come and see me at mr smiths  did you want to speak to him  i wanted to see him particular  theres a thing lays heavy on my mind  you see that place down in ferny delltheres a steep bank down to the water  well my young lord was very keen about building a kind of steps there in the summer and he and i settled the stones and i was to cement em  by comes mr frost and finds faults what i thought hed no call to so i flings down my trowel and wouldnt go on for he  i was so mortal angry i would not go back to the work and i believe my lord forgot itand then he went back to college and frampton and gervas they put on me and you know how twas i come away from ormersfield i was not going to say a word to one of that lot but if i could see lord fitzjocelyn id tell him they stones arnt fixed and if the frost gets into em therell be a pretty go next time theres a tolerablish weight  but thereit is his own lookout  if he never thought it worth his while to keep his promise and come and see me  o tom that isnt right  he only forgoti hear mrs beckett telling him hed forget his own head if it wasnt fixed on and mr james is always at him  forget  aye theres nothing gentlefolks forget like poor folks but ive done with he  let him look outi kept my promises to him long enough but if he dont keep hisn  for shame for shame tom  you dont mean it cried charlotte but oh with a different tone give me the mat theres the old lord and mr poynings riding down the terrace  i aint ashamed of nothing said the lad proudly and as charlotte snatched away the mats and vanished like a frightened hare he stalked along like a village hampden muttering the old tyrant shall see whether im to be trampled on and with both hands in his pockets he gazed straight up into the face of the grave elderly gentleman who never even perceived him  he could merely bandy glances with poynings the groom and he was so far from indifferent that he significantly lifted up the end of his whip  nothing could more have gratified tom who retorted with a grimace and murmur dont you wish you may catch me  you jealous sycwhat is the word sick of uncles or aunts was it that the orator called em  hed say id a good miss of being one of that sort and that my young lord there opened my eyes in time  no better than the rest of em  and the clock striking eight he quickened his pace to return to his work  he had for the two or three previous years been nominally under the gardener at ormersfield but really a sort of follower and favourite to the young heir lord fitzjocelyna position which had brought on him dislike from the superior servants who were not propitiated by his independent and insubordinate temper  faults on every side had led to his dismissal but lord fitzjocelyn had placed him at an ironmongers shop in the town of northwold where he had been just long enough to become accessible to the various temptations of a lad in such a situation  charlotte sped hastily round the end of the block of buildings hurried down the little back garden and flew breathlessly into her own kitchen as a haven of refuge but she found a tall stiff starched elderly woman standing just within the door and heard her last words  well as i said tis no concern of mine only i thought it the part of a friend to give you a warning when i seen it with my own eyes ah here she is as charlotte dropped into a chair  yes yes miss you need not think to deceive me i saw you from miss mercys window  saw what faintly exclaimed charlotte  you know well enough was the return  you may think to blind mrs beckett here but i know what over goodnature to young girls comes to pretty use to make of your fine scholarship to be encouraging followers and sweethearts at that time in the morning too  speak up charlotte said the other occupant of the room a pleasant little brisk woman with soft brown eyes a clear pale skin and a face smooth in spite of nearly sixty years speak up and tell mrs martha the truth that you never encouraged no one  the girls face was all one flame but she rose up and clasping her hands together exclaimedme encourage  i never thought of what mrs martha says  i dont know what it is all about  here jane beckett cried mrs martha dye see what tis to vindicate her  will you take her word against mine that shes been gossiping this half hour with that young rogue as was turned off at ormersfield  tom madison  cried the girl in utter amaze  oh mrs martha  well i cant stop said martha i must get miss faithfulls breakfast but if you was under me miss charlotte i can tell you it would be better for you  youll sup sorrow yet and youll both recollect my advice both of you  wherewith the cassandra departed and charlotte throwing her apron over her face began to cry and sob piteously  my dear what is it now exclaimed her kind companion pulling down her apron and trying to draw down first one then the other of the arms which persisted in veiling the crimson face  surely you dont think missus or i would mistrust you or think youd take up with the likes of him  how could she be so cruelso spiteful sobbed charlotte when he only came to ask one question and did a good turn for me with the mats  i never thought of such a thing  sweetheart indeed  so cruel of her  bless me said jane girls used to think it only civility to say they had a sweetheart  dont mrs beckett  i hate the word  i dont want no such thing i wont never speak to tom madison again if such constructions is to be put on it  well after all charlotte dear that will be the safest way you are young yet and best not to think of settling special if you arent sure of one that is steady and religious and youd better keep yourself up and not get a name for gossipingthough theres no harm done yet so dont make such a work  bless me if i dont hear his lordships voice  he aint never come so early  yes he is said charlotte recovering from her sobs he rode up as i came in  well to be sure he is come to breakfast  i hope nothins amiss with my young lord  i must run up with a cup and plate and you make the place tidy in case mr poynings comes in  youd better run into the scullery and wash your face tis all tears  youre a terrible one to cry charlotte with a kind cheering smile and caress  mrs beckett bustled off leaving charlotte to restore herself to the little handy piece of household mechanism which kind patient motherly training had rendered her  charlotte arnold had been fairly educated at a village school and tenderly brought up at home till left an orphan when she had been taken into her present place  she had much native refinement and imagination which half cultivated produced a curious mixture of romance and simplicity  her insatiable taste for reading was meritorious in the eyes of mrs beckett who unlearned herself thought any book better than gadding about and after hearing her daily portion of the bible listened to the most adventurous romances with a sense of pleasure and duty in keeping the girl to her book she loved the little fragile orphan taught her and had patience with her and trusted the true high sound principle which she recognised in charlotte amid much that she could not fathom and set down alternately to the score of scholarship and youth  taste modesty and timidity were guards to charlotte  a broad stare was terror to her and she had many a fictitious horror as well as betterfounded ones  truly she said she hated the broad words martha had used  one who craved a true knight to be twitted with a sweetheart  martha and tom madison were almost equally distasteful as connected with such a reproach and the little maiden drew into herself promenaded her fancy in castles and tournaments kept under janes wing and was upheld by her as a sensible prudent girl     chapter ii  an old schoolmistress    i praise thee matron and thy due   is praise heroic praise and true   with admiration i behold   thy gladness unsubdued and bold   thy looks and gestures all present   the picture of a life well spent   our human nature throws away   its second twilight and looks gay                              wordsworth   unconscious of charlottes flight and toms affront the earl of ormersfield rode along dynevor terracea row of houses with handsome cemented fronts tragic and comic masks alternating over the downstairs windows and the centre of the block adorned with a pediment and colonnade but there was an air as if something ailed the place the gardens were weedy the glass doors hazy the cement stained and scarred and many of the windows closed and dark like eyes wanting speculation or with merely the dreary words to be let enlivening their blank gloom  at the house where charlotte had vanished he drew his rein and opened the gatenot one of the rusty oneshe entered the garden where all was trim and fresh the shadow of the house lying across the sward and preserving the hoarfrost which in the sunshine was melting into diamond drops on the lingering china roses  without ring or knock he passed into a narrow carpetless vestibule unadorned except by a beautiful blue wedgewood vase and laying down hat and whip mounted the bare staircase long since divested of all paint or polish  avoiding the door of the principal room he opened another at the side and stood in a flood of sunshine pouring in from the window which looked over all the roofs of the town to the coppices and moorlands of ormersfield  on the bright fire sung a kettle a white cat purred on the hearth a canary twittered merrily in the window and the light smiled on a languishing dresden shepherdess and her lover on the mantelpiece and danced on the ceiling reflected from a beautifully chased silver creamjugan inconsistent companion for the homely black teapot and willowpatterned plates though the two cups of rare indian porcelain were not unworthy of it  the furniture was the same mixture of the ordinary and the choice either worn and shabby or such as would suit a virtuoso but the whole arranged with taste and care that made the effect bright pleasant and comfortable lord ormersfield stood on the hearthrug waiting  his face was that of one who had learnt to wait more considerate than acute and bearing the stamp both of toil and suffering as if grief had taken away all mobility of expression and left a stern thoughtful steadfastness  presently a lady entered the room  her hair was white as snow and she could not have seen less than seventyseven years but beauty was not gone from her featuressmiles were still on her lips brightness in her clear hazel eyes buoyancy in her tread and alertness and dignity in her tall slender unbent figure  there was nothing so remarkable about her as the elasticity as well as sweetness of her whole look and bearing as if while she had something to love nothing could be capable of crushing her  you here she exclaimed holding out her hand to her guest  you are come to breakfast  thank you i wished to see you without interrupting your days work have you many scholars at present  only seven and three go into school at easter  jem and clara wish me to undertake no more but i should sorely miss the little fellows i wish they may do me as much credit as sydney calcott  he wrote himself to tell me of his success  i am glad to hear it  he is a very promising young man  i tell him i shall come to honour as the old dame who taught him to spell  my scholars may make a dr busby of me in history  i am afraid your preferment will depend chiefly on james and young calcott  nay louis tells me that he is going to read wonderfully hard and if he chooses he can do more than even sydney calcott  if said the earl  jane here entered with another cup and plate and lord ormersfield sat down to the breakfasttable  after some minutes pause he said have you heard from peru  not by this mail  have you  yes i have  mary is coming home  mary she cried almost springing upmary ponsonby  this is good newsunless as she watched his grave face it is her health that brings her  it is  she has consulted the surgeon of the libra a very able man who tells her that there is absolute need of good advice and a colder climate and ponsonby has consented to let her and her daughter come home in the libra  i expect them in february  my poor mary  but she will get better away from him  i trust he is not coming  not he said lord ormersfield  dear dear mary  i had scarcely dared to hope to see her again cried the old lady with tears in her eyes  i hope she will be allowed to be with us not kept in london with his sister  london does her no good  the very purport of my visit said lord ormersfield was to ask whether you could do me the favour to set aside your scholars and enable me to receive mrs ponsonby at home  thank youoh thank you  there is nothing i should like better but i must consider  clara would find a companion in the younger mary in the holidays and if james would make fitzjocelyn his charge it would complete the obligation  it would be by far the best arrangement for marys comfort and it would be the greatest satisfaction to me to see her with you at ormersfield  i believe it would indeed said the old lady more touched than the outward manner of the earl seemed to warrant  i wouldyou know i would do my very best that you and mary should be comfortable togetherand her voice trembledbut you see i cannot promise all at once  i must see about these little boys  i must talk to jem in short you must not be disappointedand she put her hands before her face trying to laugh but almost overcome  nay i did not mean to press you said lord ormersfield gently but i thought since james has had the fellowship and clara has been at school that you wished to give up your pupils  so i do said the lady but still not yielding absolutely  for the rest i am very anxious that james should accept fitzjocelyn as his pupil  i have always considered their friendship as the best hope and other plans have had so little success that  im not going to hear louis abused she exclaimed gaily  yes said lord ormersfield with a look nearly approaching a smile you are the last person i ought to invite if i wish to keep your nephew unspoiled  i wish there were any one else to spoil him  for his sake then come and make ormersfield cheerful  it will be far better for him  and for you to see more of jem she added  if he were yours what would you say to such hours  the last words were aimed at a young man who came briskly into the room and as he kissed her and shook hands with the earl answered in a quick bright tone shocking aye  all owing to sitting up till one  reading said the earl  reading he answered with a sort of laughing satisfaction in dashing aside the approval expressed in the query but not quite as you suppose  see here as he held up maliciously a railway novel  i am afraid i know where it came from said lord ormersfield  exactly so said james  it was fitzjocelyns desertion of it that excited my curiosity  indeed  i should have thought his desertions far too common to excite any curiosity  by no means  he always has a reason  a plausible one  more than plausible cried james excitement sparkling in his vivid black eyes  it happens that this is the very book that you would most rejoice to see distasteful to himlow morality false principles morbid excitement not a line that ought to please a healthy mind  yet it has interest enough for you  i am not fitzjocelyn  you know how to plead for him  i speak simple truth bluntly answered james running his hand through his black hair to the ruin of the morning smoothness so that it as well as the whole of his quick dark countenance seemed to have undergone a change from sunny south to stormy north in the few moments since his first appearance  after a short silence lord ormersfield turned to him saying i have been begging a favour of my aunt and i have another to ask of you and repeating his explanation begged him to undertake the tutorship of his son  i shall not be at liberty at easter said james i have all but undertaken some men at oxford  oh my dear jem exclaimed the old lady is that settled beyond alteration  im not going to throw them over  then i shall hope for you at midsummer said the earl  we shall see how things stand he returned ungraciously  i shall write to you said lord ormersfield still undaunted and soon after taking his leave  cool cried james as soon as he was gone  to expect you to give up your school at his beck to come and keep house for him as long as it may suit him  nay jem he knew how few boys i have and that i intended to give them up  you dont mean to refuse louis she said imploringly  i shall certainly not take him at easter  it would be a mere farce intended to compensate to us for giving up the school and ill not lend myself to it while i can have real work  at midsummer then  you know he will never let louis spend a long vacation without a tutor  i hate to be at ormersfield proceeded james vehemently to see fitzjocelyn browbeaten and contradicted every moment and myself set up for a model  i may steal a horse while he may not look over the wall did you observe the inconsistencyangry with the poor fellow first for having the book and then for not reading the whole while it became amiable and praiseworthy in me to burn out a candle over it  ah that was my concern  i tell him he would sing another note if you were his son  id soon make him  i would not stand what louis does  the more he is set down and sneered at the more debonnaire he looks till i could rave at him for taking it so easily  i hoped you might have hindered them from fretting each other as they do so often  i should only be a fresh element of discord while his lordship will persist in making me his pattern young man  it makes me hate myself especially as louis is such an unaccountable fellow that he wont  i am sorry you dislike the plan so much  do you mean that you wish for it grandmamma cried he turning full round on her with an air of extreme amazement  if you do theres an end of it but i thought you valued nothing more than an independent home  nor would i give it up on any account said she  i do not imagine this could possibly last for more than a few months or a year at the utmost  but you know dear jem i would do nothing you did not like  thats nothing to the purpose replied james  though it is to be considered whether ormersfield is likely to be the best preparation for claras future life  however i see you wish it  i confess that i do for a few months at least which need interfere neither with clara nor with you  i have not seen lord ormersfield so eager for many years and i should be very sorry to prevent those two from being comfortably together in the old home  and cant that be without a chaperon exclaimed james laughing why his lordship is fiftyfive and she cant be much less  that is a good joke  it is not punctilio said his grandmother looking distressed  it is needful to be on the safe side with such a man as mr ponsonby my fear is that he may send her home with orders not to come near us  she used to be always at ormersfield in the old times  yes when my sister was alive  ah you were too young to know about those matters then  the fact was that things had come to such a pass from mr ponsonbys neglect and unkindness that lord ormersfield standing in the place of her brother thought it right to interfere his mother went to london with him to bring poor mary and her little girl back to ormersfield and there they were till my sisters death when of course they could not remain  mr ponsonby had just got his appointment as british envoy in peru and wished her to go with him it was much against lord ormersfields advice but she thought it her duty poor dear  i believe he positively hates lord ormersfield and as if for a parting unkindness he left his little girl at school with orders to spend her holidays with his sister and never to be with us  that accounts for it said james  i never knew all this nor why we were so entirely cut off from mary ponsonby  i wonder what she is now she was a droll sturdy child in those days  we used to call her downright dunstable  she was almost of the same age as louis and a great deal stouter and used to fight for him and herself too has not she been out in peru  yes she went out at seventeen  i believe she is an infinite comfort to her mother  poor mary  well we children lived in the middle of a tragedy and little suspected it  by the bye what relation are the ponsonbys to us  mrs ponsonby is my niece  my dear sister mary  married mr raymondyes i know  ill make the whole lucid ill draw up a pedigree and louis shall learn it  and with elaborate neatness he wrote as follows filling in the dates from the first leaf of an old bible after his grandmother had left the room  the task lightly undertaken became a mournful one and as he read over his performance his countenance varied from the gentleness of regret to a look of sarcastic pride as though he felt that the world had dealt hardly by him and yet disdained to complain                                                                                 king arthur

thirty years of drudgery  when shall i be able to relieve her  ha  o j f dynevor esquire if it were you who were coming from peru you would find a score to settle  he ran down stairs to assist his grandmother in the latin lessons of her little school the usual employment of his vacations  catharine dynevor had begun life with little prospect of spending nearly half of it as mistress of a school  her father was the last male of the dynevors of cheveleigha family mounting up to the days of the pendragonsand she had been made to take the place of an eldest son inheriting the extensive landed property on condition that her name and arms should be assumed in case of her marriage  her choice was one of the instances in which her affections had the mastery over her next strongest characteristic family pride  she married a highlyeducated and wealthy gentleman of good family but of mercantile connexions such as her father if living would have disdained  her married life was however perfectly unclouded her ample means gave her the power of dispensing joy and her temperament was so blithe and unselfish that no pleasure ever palled upon her  cheveleigh was a proverb for hospitality affording unfailing fetes for all ages full of a graceful ease and freedom that inspired enjoyment  mr frost dynevor was a man of refined taste openhanded even to extravagance liberal in all his appointments and gratifying to the utmost his love of art and decoration while his charities and generous actions were hearty and lavish enough to satisfy even his warmhearted wife  joined with all this was a strong turn for speculations  when the mind has once become absorbed in earthly visions of wealth and prosperity the excitement exercises such a fascination over the senses that the judgment loses balance  bold assumptions are taken as certainties and made the foundation of fresh fabricsthe very power of discerning between fact and possibility departs and in mere goodwill men honest and honourable at heart risk their own and their neighbours property and ruin their character and good name by the very actions most foreign to to their nature ere it had fallen under the strong delusion  mr frost dynevor had the misfortune to live in a country rich in mineral wealth and to have a brotherinlaw easily guided and with more love of figures than power of investigating estimates on a large scale  mines were set on foot companies established and buildings commenced and the results were only to be paralleled by those of the chalybeate springs discovered by mr dynevor at the little town of northwold which were pronounced by his favourite hangeron to be destined literally to cut the throat of bath and cheltenham  some towns are said to have required the life of a child ere their foundations could be laid  many a speculation has swallowed a life and fortune before its time for thriving has come  mr frost dynevor and lord ormersfield were the foremost victims to the cheveleigh iron foundries and the northwold baths  the close of the war brought a commercial crisis that their companies could not stand and mr dynevors death spared him from the sight of the crash which his talent and sagacity might possibly have averted  he had shown no misgivings but no sooner was he removed from the helm than the vessel was found on the brink of destruction  enormous sums had been sunk without tangible return and the liabilities of the companies far surpassed anything that they had realized  lord ormersfield was stunned and helpless  mrs dynevor had but one ideanamely to sacrifice everything to clear her husbands name her sons were mere boys and the only person who proved himself able to act or judge was the heir of ormersfield then about fourandtwenty who came forward with sound judgment and upright dispassionate sense of justice to cope with the difficulties and clear away the involvements  he joined his father in mortgaging land sacrificing timber and reducing the establishment so as to set the estate in the way of finally becoming free though at the expense of rigid economy and selfdenial  cheveleigh could not have been saved even had the heiress not been willing to yield everything to satisfy the just claims of the creditors  she was happy when she heard that it would suffice and that no one would be able to accuse her husband of having wronged him but for this she would hardly have submitted to retain what her nephew succeeded in securing for hernamely an income of about 150 pounds per annum and the row of houses called dynevor terrace one of the building ventures at northwold  this was the sole dependence with which she and her sons quitted the home of their forefathers  never mind mother said henry kissing her to prevent the tears from springing home is wherever we are together never fear mother echoed oliver with knitted brow and clenched hands i will win it back  oliver was a quiet lad of diligent methodical habits and willingly accepted a clerkship in a mercantile house which owed some obligations to his father  at the end of a couple of years he was sent to reside in south america and his parting words to his mother werewhen you see me again cheveleigh shall be yours  oh my boy take care  remember they that haste to be rich shall not be innocent  that was the last time she had seen oliver  her great object was to maintain herself independently and to complete henrys education as a gentleman  with this view she took up her abode in the least eligible of her houses at northwold and dropping the aristocratic name which alone remained of her heiressship opened a school for little boys declaring that she was rejoiced to recall the days when henry and oliver wore frocks and learnt to spell if any human being could sweeten the latin grammar it was mrs frost with the motherliness of a dame and the refinement of a lady unfailing sympathy and buoyant spirits she loved each urchin and each urchin loved her till she had become a sort of adopted grandmamma to all northwold and the neighbourhood  henry went to oxford  he gained no scholarship took no honours but he fell neither into debt nor disgrace he led a goodnatured easy life and made a vast number of friends and when he was not staying with them he and his mother were supremely happy together  he walked with her read to her sang to her and played with her pupils  he had always been brought up as the heirpetted humoured and waited ona post which he filled with goodhumoured easy grace and which he continued to fill in the same manner though he had no one to wait on him but his mother and her faithful servant jane beckett  years passed on and they seemed perfectly satisfied with their division of labourmrs frost kept school and henry played the flute or shot over the ormersfield property  if any one remonstrated henry was always said to be waiting for a government appointment which was to be procured by the ormersfield interest  more for the sake of his mother than of himself the ormersfield interest was at length exerted and the appointment was conferred on him  the immediate consequence was his marriage with the first pretty girl he met poorer than himself and all the ormersfield interest failed to make his mother angry with him  the cholera of 1832 put an end to poor henrys desultory life  his house in a crowded part of london was especially doomed by the deadly sickness and out of the whole family the sole survivors were a little girl of ten months old and a boy of seven years the latter of whom was with his grandmother at northwold  mrs frost was one of the women of whom affection makes unconscious heroines  she could never sink as long as there was aught to need her love and care and though henry had been her darling the very knowledge that his orphans had no one but herself to depend on seemed to brace her energies with fresh life  they were left entirely on her hands her son oliver made no offers of assistance he had risen so as to be a prosperous merchant at lima and he wrote with regularity and dutifulness but he had never proposed coming to england and did not proffer any aid in the charge of his brothers children  if she had expected anything from him she did not say so she seldom spoke of him but never without tenderness and usually as her poor oliver and she abstained from teaching her grandchildren either to look to their rich uncle or to mourn over their lost inheritance  cheveleigh was a winter evenings romance with no one but jane beckett and the grandmother always answered the childrens inquiries by bidding them prove their ancient blood by resolute independence and by that true dignity which wealth could neither give nor take away  of that dignity mrs frost was a perfect model  a singular compound of the gentle and the lofty of tenderness and independence she had never ceased to be the northwold standard of the real lady too mild and gracious to be regarded as proud and poor and yet too dignified for any liberty to be attempted her only fault that touch of pride so ladylike and refined that it was kept out of sight and never offended and everything else so sweet and winning that there was scarcely a being who did not love as well as honour her for the cheerfulness and resignation that had borne her through her many trials  her trustful spirit and warm heart had been an elixir of youth and had preserved her freshness and elasticity long after her sister and brotherinlaw at ormersfield had grown aged and sunk into the grave and even her nephew was fast verging upon more than middle age     chapter iii  louis le debonnaire    i walked by his garden and saw the wild brier   the thorn and the thistle grow broader and higher                                         isc watts   ormersfield park was extensive ranging into fine broken ground rocky and overgrown with brushwood but it bore the marks of retrenchment there was hardly a large timber tree on the estate enclosures had been begun and deserted and the deer had been sold off to make room for farmers cattle which grazed up to the very front door  the house was of the stately era of anne with a heavy portico and clumsy pediment on the garden side all the windows of the suite of rooms opening on a broad stone terrace whence steps descended to the lawn neatly kept but sombre for want of openings in the surrounding evergreens  it was early march and a lady wrapped in a shawl was seated on the terrace enjoying the mild gleam of spring and the freshness of the sunwarmed air which awoke a smile of welcome as it breathed on her faded cheek and her eyes gazed on the scene in fond recognition  it had been the home of mrs ponsonbys childhood and the slopes of turf and belts of dark ilex were fraught with many a recollection of girlish musings youthful visions and later intervals of tranquillity and repose  after fourteen years spent in south america how many threads she had to take up again  she had been as a sister to her cousin lord ormersfield and had shared more of his confidence than any other person during their earlier years but afterwards their intercourse had necessarily been confined to brief and guarded letters she had found him unchanged in his kindness to herself and she was the more led to ponder on the grave stern impassiveness of his manner to others and to try to understand the tone of mind that it indicated  she recalled him as he had been in his first youthreserved sensible thoughtful but with the fire of ambition burning strongly within and ever and anon flashing forth vividly repressed at once as too demonstrative but filling her with enthusiastic admiration she remembered him calmly and manfully meeting the shock of the failure that would he knew fetter and encumber him through lifehow resolutely he had faced the difficulties how unselfishly he had put himself out of the question how uprightly he had dealt by the creditors how considerately by his father and aunt how wise and moderate his proceedings had been throughout  she recollected how she had shared his aspirations and gloried in his consistent and prudent course without perceiving what sorrow had since taught herthat ambition was to him what pleasure was to other young men  what had it not been to her when that ambition began to be gratified when he had become a leading man in parliament and byandby held office  there a change came over the spirit of her dream and though she sighed she could not but smile at the fair picture that rose before her of a young girl of radiant loveliness her golden curls drooping over her neck and her eyes blue as the starry veronica by the hedge side smiling in the sunshine  she thought of the glances of proud delight that her cousin had stolen at her to read in her face that his louisa was more than all he had told her  little was needed to make her love the sweet caressing young creature who had thrown her arms round her and told her that she saw it was all nonsense to tell her she was such a good grave dreadful cousin mary  yet there had been some few misgivings  so short an acquaintance  her cousin too busy for more than being bewitched by the lovely face  the villiers family so gay and fashionable  might not all have been foreseen and yet of what use would foresight have been  the gentleman was deeply attached and the ladys family courted the match the distinction he had won atoning for his encumbered fortune  other scenes arose on her memorylouisa a triumphant beauty living on the homage she received all brilliance grace and enjoyment but there was a darkening background which grew more prominent  poor louisa had little wisdom by nature and her education had been solely directed to enable her to shine in the world not to render her fit for the companionship of a man of domestic tastes accustomed to the society of superior women  there was nothing to fall back upon nothing to make a home she was listless and weary whenever gaiety failed herand he disappointed and baffled too unbending to draw her out too much occupied to watch over her yielded to her tastes and let her pursue her favourite enjoyments unchecked  a time had come when childish vanity and frivolity were verging on levity and imprudence  expostulations fell powerless on her shallowness  painful was the remembrance of the deprecating roguish glance of the beautiful eyes and the coaxing caresses with which she kissed away the lecture and made promises only to forget them  she was like the soulless undine with her reckless gaiety and sweetness so loving and childish that there was no being displeased with her so innocent and devoid of all art or guile in her wilfulness that her faults could hardly bear a harsher name than follies  again mrs ponsonby thought of the days when she herself had been left to stay with her old uncle and aunt  in this very house while her husband was absent abroad when she had assisted them to receive the poor young wife sent home in failing health  she thought of the sad weeks so melancholy in the impossibility of making an impression or of leading poor louisa from her frivolities she recalled the sorrow of hearing her build on future schemes of pleasure the dead blank when her prattle on them failed the tedium of deeper subjects and yet the bewitching sweetness overpowering all vexation at her exceeding silliness  though full oneandtwenty years had passed still the tears thrilled warm into mrs ponsonbys eyes at the thought of louisas fond clinging to her in spite of many an admonition and even exertion of authority for she alone dared to control the spoilt childs selfwill and had far more power than the husband who seemed to act as a check and restraint and whose presence rendered her no longer easy and natural  one confidence had explained the whole  you know mary dear i always was so much afraid of him  if i had had my own way i know who it would have been but there were mamma and anna maria always saying how fortunate i was and that he would be prime minister and all the rest  oh i was far too young and foolish for him  he should have married a sober body such as you mary  why did he not  she wished she had never teased him by going out so much and letting people talk nonsense he had been very kind and she was not half good enough for him  that confession made to him would have been balm for ever but she had not resolution for the effort and the days slid away till the worst fears were fulfilled  nay were they the worst fears  was there not an unavowed sense that it was safer that she should die while innocent of all but wayward folly than be left to perils which she was so little able to resist  the iron expression of grief on her husbands face had forbidden all sympathy all attempt at consolation  he had returned at once to his business in london there to find that poor louisas extravagance had equalled her folly and that he whose pride it had been to redeem his paternal property was thrown back by heavy debts on his own account this had been known to mrs ponsonby but by no word from him he had never permitted the most distant reference to his wife and yet with inconsistency betraying his passionate love he had ordered one of the most beautiful and costly monuments that art could execute for her grave at ormersfield and had sent brief but explicit orders that contrary to all family precedent his infant should bear no name but louis  on this boy mrs ponsonby had founded all her hopes of a renewal of happiness for her cousin but when she had left england there had been little amalgamation between the volatile animated boy and his grave unbending father  she could not conjure up any more comfortable picture of them than the child uneasily perched on his papas knee looking wistfully for a way of escape and his father with an air of having lifted him up as a duty without knowing what to do with him or to say to him  at her earnest advice the little fellow had been placed as a boarder with his great aunt mrs frost when his grandmothers death had deprived him of all that was homelike at ormersfield he had been with her till he was old enough for a public school and she spoke of him as if he were no less dear to her than her own grandchildren but she was one who saw no fault in those whom she loved and mrs ponsonby had been rendered a little anxious by a certain tone of dissatisfaction in lord ormersfields curt mention of his son and above all by his cold manner of announcing that this was the day when he would return from oxford for the easter vacation  could it be that the son was unworthy or had the fathers feelings been too much chilled ever to warm again and all home affections lost in the strife of politics  these had ever since engaged him whether in or out of office leaving little time for society or for any domestic pursuit  her reflections were interrupted by a call of mamma and her daughter came running up the steps  mary ponsonby had too wide a face for beauty and not slightness enough for symmetry but nothing could be more pleasing and trustworthy than the open countenance the steady clear greenishbrown eyes the kind sensible mouth the firm chin broad though rather short forehead and healthy though not highlycoloured cheek and the voicefull soft and cheerfulwell agreed with the expression and always brought gladness and promise of sympathy  see mamma what we have found for you  violets  the very purple ones that used to grow on the orchard bank  so they did  mary knew exactly where to look for them said mrs frost who had followed her up the steps  and there is gervas continued mary so charmed to hear of you that we had almost brought him to see you  mrs ponsonby declared herself so much invigorated by ormersfield air that she would go to see her old friend the gardener  mary hurried to fetch her bonnet and returned while a panegyric was going on upon her abilities as maidofallwork in her mothers difficulties with male housemaidsblack and brownand washerwomen who rode on horseback in white satin shoes  she looked as if it were hardly natural that any one but herself should support her mother when mrs frost tenderly drew mrs ponsonbys arm into her own and it was indeed strange to see the younger lady so frail and broken and the elder so strong vigorous and active as they moved along in the sunshine pausing to note each spring blossom that bordered the gravel and entered the walled kitchengarden where espaliers ran parallel with the walks dividing the vegetables from the narrow flowerbeds illuminated by crocuses opening the depths of their golden hearts to the sunbeams and the revelling bees   old gervas in a patriarchal red waistcoat welcomed mrs ponsonby with more warmth than flattery   bless me maam im right glad to see you but how old you be  i must come home to learn how to grow young gervas said she smiling i hear betty is as youthful as my aunt here  ay maam betty do fight it out tolerablish was the reply to this compliment  why gervas whats all that wilderness  surely those used to be strawberry beds  yes maam the earliest hautboys dont ye mind  my young lord came and begged it of me and bless the lad i cant refuse him nothing  he seems to be no gardener  he said he wanted to make a botany bay sort of garden said the old man and sure enough tis a garden of weeds hes made of it and mine into the bargain  he has a great big thistle here and the down blows right over my beds thick as snow so that it is three womens work to be a match for the weeds but speak to him of pulling it up yed think twas the heart out of him  does he ever work here  at first it was nought else he and that young chap madison always bringing docks and darnel out of the hedges and plants from the nursery gardens and bringing rockwork and letting water in to make a swamp  theres no saying whats in the lads head  but of late hes not done much but by times lying on the bank reading or speaking verses out loud to himself or getting young madison off his work to listen to him  once he got me to hear but maam twas all about fairies and such like putting an asss head on an honest body as had lost his way  i told him twas no good for him or the boy to read such stuff and id ha none of it but if he chose to read me some good book hed be welcomefor the candles baint so good as they used and i cant get no spectacles to suit me  and did he read to you  a bit or two maam if the humour took him  but hes young you see maam  im right glad hell find you here  my old woman says he do want a lady about the place to make him comfortable like  and who is this young madison asked mrs ponsonby when they had turned from the old gardener  to hear jem you would believe that he is the most promising plant rearing for botany bay said mrs frost  he is a boy from that wild place marksedge whom louis took interest in and made more familiar than jem liked or than perhaps was good for him  it did not answer the servants did not like it and it ended in his being sent to work with smith the ironmonger  poor louis he took it sadly to heart for he had taken great pains with the boy  i like to hear the old name louis  i cant help it said mrs frost  he must be his old aunt kittys louis le debonnaire  dont you remember your calling him so when he was a baby  oh yes it has exactly recalled to me the sort of gracious look that he used to havehalf sly half sweetand so very pretty  it suits him as well now  he is the kind of being who must have a pet name and mrs frost hoping he might be already arrived could hardly slacken her eager step so as to keep pace with her nieces feeble movements  she was disappointed the carriage had returned without lord fitzjocelyn  his hat and luggage were come but he himself was missing  mrs frost was very uneasy but his father silenced conjectures by saying that it was his usual way and he would make his appearance before the evening  he would not send to meet another train saying that the penalty of irregularity must be borne and the horses should not suffer for such freaks and he would fain have been utterly indifferent but he was evidently listening to every sound and betrayed his anxiety by the decision with which he checked all expression of his aunts fears  there was no arrival all that evening no explanation in the morning and betty gervas whom mary went to visit in the course of the day began to wonder whether the young lord could be gone for a soldierthe usual fate of all missing village lads  mary was on her way home through the park along a path skirting the top of a wooded ravine a dashing rivulet making a pleasant murmur among the rocks below and glancing here and there through the brushwood that clothed the precipitous banks when with a sudden rustling and crackling a man leaped upon the path with a stone in each hand  mary started but she did not lose her presence of mind and her next glance showed her that the apparition was not alarming and was nearly as much amazed as herself  it was a tall slight young man in a suit of shepherds plaid with a fair face and graceful agile form recalling the word debonnaire as she had yesterday heard it applied in instant conviction that this was the truant she put out her hand by the same impulse that lighted his features with a smile of welcome and the years of separation seemed annihilated as he exclaimed my cousin mary and grasped her hand adding i hope i did not frighten you  oh no but where did you come from  up a hill perpendicular like hotspur he replied in soft low quiet tones which were a strange contrast to the words  no see here and parting the bushes he showed some rude steps half nature half art leading between the ferns and mountainash and looking very inviting  how delightful cried mary  i am glad you appreciate it he exclaimed i will finish it off now and put a rail  i did not care to go on when i had lost the poor fellow who helped me but it saves a world of distance  it must be very pretty amongst those beautiful ferns  you cant conceive anything more charming he continued with the same low distinct utterance but an earnestness that almost took away her breath  there are nine ferns on this bankthat is if we have the scolopendrium loevigatum as i am persuaded  do you know anything of ferns  ah you come from the land of tree ferns  oh  i am so glad to exchange them for our home flowers  primroses look so friendly and natural  these rocks are perfect nests for them and they even overhang the river  this is the best bit of the stream so rapid and foaming that i must throw a bridge across for aunt catharine  which would be most appropriate  i was weighing it as i came upa simple stone or a rustic performance in wood  i should like stone said mary amused by his eagerness  a rough druidical stone  thats it  the idea of rude negligent strength accords with such places and this is a stone country  i know the very stone  do come down and see  tomorrow if you please said mary  mamma must want me andbut i suppose they know of your return at home  no they dont  they have learnt by experience that the right time is the one never to expect me  marys eyes were all astonishment as she said between wonder and reproof is that on purpose  adventures are thrust on some people was the nonchalant reply with shoulders depressed and a twinkle of the eye as if he purposed amazing his auditor  i hope you have had an adventure for nothing else could justify you said mary with some humour but more gravity  only a stray infanterrant cast on my mercy at the junction station nurse between eating and gossiping left behindbell ringsengine squeakstrain startsfitzjocelyn and infant visavis  you dont mean a baby  a child of five years old who soon ceased howling and confided his history to me  he had been visiting grandmamma in london and was going home to illershall so i found the best plan would be to leave the train at the next station and take him home  oh that was quite another thing exclaimed mary gratified at being able to like him  could you find his home  yes he knew his name and address too well to be lost or mislaid i would have come home as soon as i had seen him in at the door but the whole family rushed out on me and conjured me first to dine and then to sleep  they are capital people  dobbs is superintendent of the copper and tin worksa thoroughly rightminded man with a nice ladylike wife the right sort of sound stuff that old englands heart is made of  it was worth anything to have seen it  they do incalculable good with their workpeople  i saw the whole concern  he launched into an explanation of the process producing from his pocket papers of the ore in every stage of manufacture and twisting them up so carelessly that they would have become a mass of confusion had not mary undertaken the repacking  as they approached the house the library window was thrown up and mrs frost came hurrying down with outstretched arms  she was met by her young nephew with an overflow of fond affection before he looked up and beheld his father standing upright and motionless on the highest step  his excuses were made more lightly and easily than seemed to suit such rigid looks but lord ormersfield bent his head as if resigning himself perforce to the explanation and with the softened voice in which he always spoke to mrs ponsonby said here he islouis you remember your cousin  she was positively startled for it was as if his mothers deep blue eyes were raised to hers and there were the same regular delicate features fair transparent complexion and glossy lightbrown hair tinted with goldthe same careless yet deprecating glance the same engaging smile that warmed her heart to him at once in spite of an air which was not that of wisdom  how little altered you are she exclaimed  if you were not taller than your father i should say you were the same louis that i left fourteen years ago  i fear that is the chief change said lord ormersfield  a boy that would be a boy all his life like sir thomas mores son said louis coolly and simply but with a twinkle in the corner of his eye as if he said it on purpose to be provoking and mrs frost interposed by asking where the cousins had met and whether they had known each other  i knew him by what you said yesterday said mary  louis le debonnaire asked mrs frost smiling  no mary not that name he exclaimed  it is what jem calls me when he has nothing more cutting to say  aye because it is exactly what you look when you know you deserve a scoldingwith your shoulders pulled down and your face made up said his aunt patting him  when mrs ponsonby and mary had left the room to dress louis exclaimed and that is mrs ponsonby  how ill she does look  her very voice has broken down though it still has the sweet sound that i could never forget  has she had advice  dr hastings saw her in london said his father  he sent her into the country at once and thinks that there is fair hope that complete rest of spirits may check the disease  will she stay here said louis eagerly  that would be like old times and we could make her very comfortable  i would train those two ponies for her drives  i wish she would remain here said his father but she is bent on becoming my aunts tenant  ha  that is next best  they could do nothing more commendable will they be a windfall for the house beautiful  no said mrs frost  they wish to have a house of their own in case mr ponsonby should come home or miss ponsonby to stay with them  the respected aunt who brought mary up  how long has she been at lima  four years  four years  she has not made use of her opportunities  alas for the illusion dispelled  the spanish walk and mantilla melt away and behold the primitive widemouthed body of fourteen years since  mrs frost laughed but it seemed to be a serious matter with lord ormersfield if you could appreciate sterling worth he said you would be ashamed to speak of your cousin with such conceited disrespect  all the effect was to make louis walk quietly out of the room but his shoulder and eyebrow made a secret telegraph of amazement to mrs frost  the new arrival seemed to have put the earl into a state of constant restless anxiety subdued and concealed with a high hand but still visible to one who knew him so intimately as did mrs ponsonby  she saw that he watched each word and gesture and studied her looks to judge of the opinion they might create in her  now the process was much like weighing and balancing the down of fitzjocelyns own favourite thistle the profusion the unsubstantiality and the volatility being far too similar and there was something positively sad in the solicitous heed taken of such utter heedlessness  the reigning idea was the expedition to illershall and the excellent condition of the workpeople under his new friend the superintendent forgetful that mines were a tender subject the eager speaker became certain that copper must exist in the neighbourhood and what an employment it would afford to all the country round  marksedge must be the very place the soil promises metallic veins the discovery would be the utmost boon to the people  it would lead to industry and civilization and counteract all the evils we have brought on them mary do you remember marksedge the place of exile  not that i know of  no we were too young to understand the iniquity  in the last generation it was not the plan to stone naboth but to remove him great people could not endure little people so by way of kindness our whole population of ormersfield except a few necessary retainers were transported bodily from betwixt the wind and our nobility located on a moor beyond our confines a generous gift to the poorrates of bletchynden away from church away from work away from superintendence away from all amenities of the poor mans life  this was one of the improvements to which mr dynevor had prompted the last earl but louis did not know whom he was cutting as he uttered this tirade with a glow on his cheek and eye but with his usual soft modulated intonation and polished language the distinctness and deliberation taking off all air of rattle and rendering his words more impressive  indeed is there much distress at marksedge said mrs ponsonby  they have gifts with our own poor at christmas said lord ormersfield but they are a defiant ungrateful set always in distress by their own fault  what cause have they for gratitude exclaimed his son  for being turned out of house and home for the three miles walk to their daily work  yes it is the fact  the dozen families left here with edicts against lodgers cannot suffice for the farmers work and all norriss and beechers men have to walk six miles every day of their lives besides the hard days work  they are still farther from their parish they are no ones charge they have neither church nor school and whom should we blame for their being lawless  it used to be thought a very good thing for the parish said mrs frost looking at her niece  i remember being sorry for the poor people but we did not see things in the light in which louis puts it  young men like to find fault with the doings of their elders said lord ormersfield  nothing can make me regard it otherwise than as a wicked sin said louis  nay my dear mildly said aunt catharine if it were mistaken i am sure it was not intentionally cruel  what i call wicked is to sacrifice the welfare of dependents to our own selfish convenience  and you would call it cruel too aunt catharine if you could hear the poor creatures beg as a favour of mr holdsworth to be buried among their kin and know how it has preyed on the minds of the dying that they might not lie here among their own people  change the subject fitzjocelyn said his father the thing is done and cannot be undone  the undoing is my daily thought said louis  if i could have tried my plan of weaving cordage out of cottongrass and thistledown i think i could have contrived for them  mary looked up and met his merry blue eye  was he saying it so gravely to try whether he could take her in  if you could she said and he went off into a hearty laugh and finished by saying so that no one could guess whether it was sport or earnest even taking into account the depredations of the goldfinches it would be an admirable speculation and would confer immeasurable benefits on the owners of waste lands  i mean to take out a patent when i have succeeded in the spinning  a patent for a donkey whispered aunt catharine  he responded with a deferential bow and the conversation was changed by the earl but copper was still the subject uppermost with louis and no sooner was dinner over than he followed the ladies to the library and began searching every book on metals and minerals till he had heaped up a pile of volumes whence be rang the changes on oxide pyrites and carbonate and octohedron crystalsnames which poor mrs frost had heard but too often  at last it came to certainty that he had seen the very masses containing ore he would send one tomorrow to illershall to be analysed and bring his friend dobbs down to view the spot  not in my time interposed lord ormersfield  i would not wish for a greater misfortune than the discovery of a mine on my property  no wonder thought mrs ponsonby as she recollected wheal salamanca and wheal catharine and wheal dynevor and all the other wheals that had wheeled away all cheveleigh and half ormersfield till the last unfortunate wheal failed when the rope broke and there were no funds to buy a new one  no wonder lord ormersfield trembled when he heard his son launch out into those easilyascending conjectural calculations freely working sums in his head so exactly like the old earl his grandfather that she could have laughed but for sympathy with the father and anxiety to see how the son would take the damp so vexatiously cast on his projects  he made the gesture that mrs frost called debonnaireread on for five minutes in silence insisted on teaching his aunt the cause of the colours in peacock ores compared them to a pigeons neck and talked of old betty gervass tame pigeons whence he proceeded to memories of the days that he and mary had spent together and asked which of their old haunts she had revisited  had she been into the nursery  oh yes but i wondered you had sent the old walnut press into that lumberroom  is that satire said louis starting and looking in her face  i dont know what you mean  i have a better right to ask what you mean by stigmatizing my apartment as a lumberroom  it was only what i saw from the door said mary a little confused but rallying and answering with spirit and i must maintain that if you mean the room over the garden entrance it is very like a lumberroom  ah mary you have not outgrown the delusions of your sex  is an englishmans house his castle while housemaids maraud over it ransacking his possessions irritating poor peaceful dust that only wants to be let alone sweeping away cherished cobwebs  oh if you cherish cobwebs said mary  did not the fortunes of scotland hang on a spiders thread  did not a cobweb save the life of mahomet or ali or a mediaeval saintno matter which  was not a spider the solace of the bastille  have not i lain for hours on a summer morning watching the tremulous lines of the beautiful geometrical composition  more shame for you said mary with a sort of dry humorous bluntness  the very answer you would have made in old times cried louis delighted  o mary you bring me back the days of my youth  you never would see the giant who used to live in that press  i remember our great fall from the top of it  oh yes cried louis  jem frost had set us up there bolt upright for sentries and i saw the enemies too soon when you would not allow that they were there  i was going to fire my musket at them but you used violence to keep me steady to my dutypulled my hair did not you  i know you scratched me and we both rolled off together  i wonder we were not both killed  that did not trouble jem  he picked us up and ordered us into arrest under the bed for breach of discipline  i fear jem was a martinet said mrs frost  that he was  a general formed on the model of him who not contented with assaulting a demilune had taken une lune toute entiere  we had a siege of the fort bombadero inaccessible and with mortars firing doublehand grenades  they were dandelion clocks and there were nettles to act the part of poisoned spikes on the breach  i remember the nettles said mary and jems driving you to gather them you standing with your bare legs in the nettlebed when he would make me dig and i could not come to help you  on duty in the trenches  your sense of duty was exemplary  i remember your digging on like a very casablanca all alone in the midst of a thunderstorm because jem had forgotten to call you in crying all the time with fear of the lightning  you came to help me said mary  you came rushing out from the nursery to my rescue  i could not make you stir  we were taken prisoners by a sally from the nursery  for once in your life you were in disgrace  i quite thought i ought to mind jem said mary and never knew whether it was play or earnest  only so could you transgress said louisyou who never cried except as my amateur mungo malagrowther  poor mary what an amazement it was to me to find you breaking your heart over the utmost penalties of the nursery law when to me they only afforded agreeable occasions of showing that i did not care  i must have been intolerable till you and mrs ponsonby took me in hand  i am glad you own your obligations said lord ormersfield  i own myself as much obliged to mary for making me wise as to jem for making me foolish  it is not the cause of gratitude i should have expected said his father  alas if he and clara were but here sighed louis  i entreated him in terms that might have moved a pyramid from its base but the frost was arctic  an iceberg will move but he is past all melting  i respect his steadiness of purpose said the earl i know no young man whom i honour more than james  his aunt and his son were looking towards each other with glistening eyes of triumph and congratulation and mrs frost cleared her voice to say that he was making far too much of her jemmy a very good boy to be sure but if he said so much of him the marys would be disappointed to see nothing but a little fiery welshman     chapter iv  thistledown    lightly soars the thistledown     lightly does it float   lightly seeds of care are sown     little do we note   watch lifes thistles bud and blow     oh tis pleasant folly   but when all lifes paths they strew     then comes melancholy                   poetry past and present   mary ponsonby had led a life of change and wandering that had given her few strong local attachments  the period she had spent at ormersfield when she was from five to seven years old had been the most joyous part of her life and had given her a strong feeling for the place where she had lived with her mother and in an atmosphere of affection free from the shadow of that skeleton in the house which had darkened her childhood more than she understood  the great weakness of mrs ponsonbys life had been her overhasty acceptance of a man whom she did not thoroughly know because her delicacy had taken alarm at foolish gossip about herself and her cousin  it was a folly that had been severely visited  irreligious himself mr ponsonby disliked his wifes strictness he resented her affection for her own family gave way to dissipated habits and made her miserable both by violence and neglect  born late of this unhappy marriage little mary was his only substantial link to his wife and he had never been wanting in tenderness to her but many a storm had raged over the poor childs head and though she did not know why the kind old countess had come to remove her and her mother and papa was still a loved and honoured title she was fully sensible of the calm security at ormersfield  when mr ponsonby had recalled his wife on his appointment at lima mary had been left in england for education under the charge of his sister in london  miss ponsonby was good and kind but of narrow views thinking all titled people fashionable and all fashionable people reprobate jealous of her sisterinlaws love for her own family and though unable to believe her brother blameless holding it as an axiom that married people could not fall out without faults on both sides and charging a large share of their unhappiness on the house of fitzjocelyn  principle had prevented her from endeavouring to weaken the little girls affection to her mother but it had been her great object to train her up in habits of sober judgment and freedom from all the romance poetry and enthusiasm which she fancied had been injurious to mrs ponsonby  the soil was of the very kind that she would have chosen  mary was intelligent but with more sense than fancy more practical than intellectual and preferring the homely to the tasteful  at school study and accomplishments were mere tasks her recreation was found in acts of kindness to her companions and her hopes were all fixed on the going out to peru to be useful to her father and mother  at seventeen she went full of active housewifely habits with a clear head sound heart and cramped mind her spirits even and cheerful but not high nor mirthful after ten years of evenings spent in needlework beside a dry maiden aunt  nor was the home she found at lima likely to foster the joyousness of early girlhood  mr ponsonby was excessively fond of her but his affection to her only marked by contrast the gulf between him and her mother  there was no longer any open misconduct on his part and mrs ponsonby was almost tremblingly attentive to his wishes but he was chill and sarcastic in his manner towards her and her nervous attacks often betrayed that she had been made to suffer in private for differences of opinion  health and spirits were breaking down and though she never uttered a word of complaint the sight of her sufferings was trying for a warmhearted young girl  marys refuge was hearty affection to both parents  she would not reason nor notice where filial tact taught her that it was best to be ignorant she charged all tracasseries on the peruvian republic and set herself simply to ameliorate each vexation as it arose and divert attention from it without generalizing even to herself on the state of the family  the english comfort which she brought into the limenian household was one element of peace and her brisk energetic habits produced an air of ease and pleasantness that did much to make home agreeable to her father and removed many cares which oppressed her mother  to her mary was all the worlddaughter comforter friend and nurse unfailing in deeds of love or words of cheer and removing all sense of dreariness and solitude and mary had found her mother all and more than all she remembered and admired and loved her with a deep quiet glow of intense affection  there was so much call for marys actual exertion of various kinds that there was little opportunity for cultivating or enlarging her mind by books though the scenes and circumstances around her could not but take some effect still at twentyone she was so much what she had been at seventeenso staid sensible and practical that miss ponsonby gladly pronounced her not in the least spoilt  fain would her aunt have kept both her and her mother as her guests but mrs ponsonby had permission to choose whatever residence best suited her and felt that bryanstonsquare and miss ponsonby would be fatal to her harassed spirits  she yearned after the home and companions of her youth and miss ponsonby could only look severe talk of london doctors and take mary aside to warn her against temptations from fashionable people  mary had been looking for the fashionable people ever since and the first sign of them she had seen was the air and figure of her cousin fitzjocelyn  probably good aunt melicent would distrust him and yet his odd startling talk and the arch look of mischief in the corners of his mouth and eyes had so much likeness to the little louis of old times that she could not look on him as a stranger nor as a formidable being but was always recurring to the almost monitorial sense of protection with which she formerly used to regard him when she shared his nursery  her mother had cultivated her love for ormersfield and she was charmed by her visits to old haunts well remembering everything she gladly recognised the little lowbrowed church the dumpy tower and graveyard rising so high that it seemed to intend to bury the church itself and permitted many a view through the lattices of the seats and the fitzjocelyn hatchments and monuments  she lingered after church on sunday afternoon with mrs frost to look at lady fitzjocelyns monument  it was in the chancel a recumbent figure in white marble as if newly fallen asleep and with the lovely features chiselled from a cast taken after death had fixed and ennobled their beauty  it is just like louiss profile said mrs frost as they came out  well said louis who was nearer than she was aware i hope at least no one will make me the occasion of a lion when i am dead  it is very beautiful said mary  may be so but the sentiment is destroyed by its having been six months in the royal academy number 16136 and by seeing it down among the excursions in the northwold guide  louis my dear you should not be satirical on this said mrs frost  i never meant it said louis but i never could love that monument it used to oppress me with a sense of having a white marble mother and seriously it fills up the chancel as if it were its showroom according to our family tradition that the church is dedicated to the fitzjocelyns  living or dead we have taken it all to ourselves  it was a very fair respectable congregation said his aunt  exactly so  that is my complaint  everything belonging to his lordship is respectableexcept his son  take care louis here is mary looking as if she would take you at your word  pray mary do they let no one who is not respectable go to church in peru  i do not think you would change your congregation for the wretched crowds of brown beggars said mary  would i not cried louis  oh if the analogous class here in england could but feel that the church was for themnot driven out and thrust aside by our respectability  marksedge to wit said a goodhumoured voice as mr holdsworth the young vicar appeared at his own wicket with a hearty greeting i never hear those words without knowing where you are fitzjocelyn  i hope to be there literally some day this week said louis  will you walk with me  i want to ask old madison how his grandson goes on i missed going to see after the boy last time i was at home  i fear he has not been going on well and have been sorry for it ever since said the vicar  his master told me that he found him very idle and saucy  people of that sort never know how to speak to a lad said louis it is their own rating that they ought to blame  not tom madison i know said mr holdsworth laughing  but i did not come out to combat that point but to inquire after the commissions you kindly undertook  i have brought you such a set of prizes  red rubrics red margins and for the apparatus i have brought a globe with all the mountains in high reliefyes and an admirable physical atlas and a box of instruments and models for applying mathematics to mechanics  we might give evening lectures and interest the young farmers  pray said the vicar with a sound of dismay where may the bill be i thought the limits were two pounds eighteen  oh  i take all that on myself  we shall see said mr holdsworth not gratefully  was origen sent home in time for you to bring  there cried louis starting origen is lying on the very chair where i put him last january  i will write to jem frost tomorrow to send him to the binder  is it of any use to ask for the music  i assure you mr holdsworth i am very sorry  ill write at once to frost  then i am afraid the parish will not be reformed as you promised last christmas said the vicar turning with a smile to mrs frost  we were to be civilized by weekly concerts in the school  what were you to play louis said mrs frost laughing  i was to imitate all the birds in the air at once said louis beginning to chirp like a melee of sparrows turning it into the croak of a raven and breaking off suddenly with i beg your pardoni forgot it was sunday indeed mr holdsworth i can say no more than that i was a wretch not to remember  next time ill write it all down in the top of my hat with a pathetic entreaty that if my hat be stolen the thief shall fulfil the commissions and punctually send in the bill to the rev w b holdsworth  i shall hardly run the risk said mr holdsworth smiling as he parted with them and disappeared within his clipped yew hedges  poor illused mr holdsworth cried aunt catharine  yes it was base to forget the binding of that book said louis gravely  i wish i knew what amends to make  you owe amends far more for making a present of a commission  i used to do the like to save myself trouble till i came down in the world and then i found it had been a mere air de grand seigneur  i should not dare to serve you or jem so but i thought the school was impersonal and could receive a favour  it is no favour unless you clearly define where the commission ended and the gift began  careless benefits oblige no one  fitzjocelyn received his aunts scoldings very prettily  his manner to her was a becoming mixture of the chivalrous the filial and the playful  mary watched it as a new and pretty picture  all his confidence too seemed to be hers but who could help pouring out his heart to the everindulgent sympathizing aunt catharine  it was evidently the greatest treat to him to have her for his guest and his attention to her extended even to the reading a sermon to her in the evening to spare her eyes a measure so entirely after aunt melicents heart that mary decided that even she would not think her cousin so hopelessly fashionable  goodnatured he was without doubt for as the three ladies were sitting down to a sociable morning of work and reading aloud he came in to say he was going to see after tom madison and to ask if there were any commands for northwold with his checked shootingjacket pockets so puffed out that his aunt began patting and inquiring provisions for the house beautiful he said as forth came on the one side a long rough brown yam  i saw it at a shop in london he said and thought the faithfull sisters would like to be reminded of their west indian feasts  and to make the balance true he had in the other pocket a lambswool shawl of gorgeous dyes with wools to make the like and the receipt in what he called female algebra the long knittingpins under his arm like a ridingwhip  he explained that he thought it would be a winters work for miss salome to imitate it and that she would succour halfadozen families with the proceeds and mrs ponsonby was pleased to hear him speak so affectionately of the two old maiden sisters  they were the nieces of an old gentleman to whom the central and handsomest house of dynevor terrace had been let  he had an annuity which had died with him and they inherited very little but the furniture with which they had lived on in the same house in hopes of lodgers and paying rent to mrs frost when they had any  there was a close friendship and perfect understanding between her and them and as she truly assured them full and constant rent could hardly have done her as much good as their neighbourhood  miss mercy was the sister of charity of all northwold miss salome who was confined to her chair by a complaint in her knee knitted and made fancyworks the sale of which furnished funds for her charities  she was highly educated and had a great knowledge of natural history  fitzjocelyn had given their abode the name of the house beautiful as being redolent of the essence of the pilgrims progress and the title was so fully accepted by their friends that the very postman would soon know it he lingered discoursing on this topic while mary repacked his parcels and his aunt gave him a message to jane beckett to send the carpenter to no 5 before marys visit of inspection but she prophesied that he would forget and in fact it was no good augury that he left the knittingpins behind him on the table and mary was only just in time to catch him with them at the front door  thank you maryyou are the universal memory he said  what rest you must give my fathers methodical spirit  i saw you pile up all those blackwoods of mine this morning just as he was going to fall upon them  if you saw it i should have expected you to do it yourself said mary in her quaint downright manner  never expect me to do what is expected answered he  do you do that because it is not expected said mary feeling almost as if he were beyond the pale of reason as she saw him adjusting a plant of groundsel in his cap  it is for the dickybird at my aunts  theres no lack of it at the terrace but it is an old habit and there always was an illusion that ormersfield groundsel is a superior article  i suppose that is why you grow go much  are you a gardener  some day we will go to work clear the place and separate the botanical from the intrusive  i should like it of all things  ill send the horse round to the stable and begin at once exclaimed louis all eagerness but mary demurred as she had promised to read to her mother and aunt some of their old favourites madame de sevignes letters and his attention flew off to his restless steed which he wanted her to admire  my yeomanry charger he said  we turn out five troopers  i hope you will be here when we go out for going round to northwold brought me into a direful scrape when i went to exhibit myself to the dear old terrace world  my father said it was an unworthy ambition  what would he have thought if he had seen jane stroking me down with the brush on the plea of dust but really on the principle of stroking a dog  good old jane  have you seen her yet  has she talked to you about master oliver  the horse became so impatient that mary had no time for more than a monosyllable before louis was obliged to mount and ride off and he was seen no more till just before dinner when with a shade of french malice mrs frost inquired about jane and the carpenter she had seen the cap still decorated with groundsel lying in the hall and had a shrewd suspicion but the answer went beyond her expectationsah he said it is all the effect of the norman mania  what have you been doing  what is the matter she cried alarmed  the matter is not with me but with the magistrates  my dear louis dont look so very wise and capable or i shall think it a very bad scrape indeed  pray tell me what you have been about  you know sir gilbert brewster and mr shoreland are rabid about the little brook between their estates of which each wishes to arrogate to himself the exclusive fishing  their keepers watch like the austrian guard on the danube in a life of perpetual assault and battery  last saturday march 3rd 1847 one benjamin hodgekin aged fifteen had the misfortune to wash his feet in the debateable water the belligerent powers made common cause and haled the wretch before the petty sessions  his mother met me  she lived in service here till she married a man at marksedge now dead  this poor boy is an admirable son the main stay of the family who must starve if he were imprisoned and she declared with tears in her eyes that she could not bear for a child of hers to be sent to gaol and begged me to speak to the gentlemen  he started up with kindling eyes and vehement manner  i went to the justiceroom  my dear with the groundsel  and the knittingneedles  on rushed the narration unheeding trifles  there was the array mr calcott in the chair and old freeman and captain shaw and fat sir gilbert and all the rest met to condemn this wretched widows son for washing his feet in a gutter  pray what said the indictment asked mrs ponsonby  oh that he had killed an infant trout of the value of three farthings  three giant keepers made oath to it but i had his own mothers word that he was washing his feet  no one could help laughing but fitzjocelyn was far past perceiving any such thing  urge what i would they fined him  i talked to old brewster  i appealed to his generosity if there be room for generosity about a trout no bigger than a gudgeon  i talked to mr calcott who i thought had more sense but justice shallow would have been more practicable  no one took a rational view but ramsbotham of the factory a very sensible man with excellent feeling  when it is recorded in history who will believe that seven moral wellmeaning men agreed in condemning a poor lad of fifteen to a fine of five shillings costs threeandsixpencea sum he could no more pay than i the national debt and with the alternative of three months imprisonment branding and contaminating for life and destroying all selfrespect  i paid the fine so there is one act of destruction the less on the heads of the english squirearchy  act of destruction  the worst destruction is to blast a mans character because the love of adventure is strong within him  he was at this point when lord ormersfield entered and after his daily civil ceremonious inquiries of the ladies whether they had walked or driven out he turned to his son saying i met mr calcott just now and heard from him that he had been sorry to convict a person in whom you took interest a lad from marksedge what did you know of him  i was prompted by common justice and humanity said louis  my protection was claimed for the poor boy as the son of an old servant of ours  indeed  i think you must have been imposed on  mr calcott spoke of the family as notorious poachers  find a poor fellow on the wrong side of a hedge and not a squire but will swear that he is a hardened ruffian  usually with reason said the earl  pray when did this persons parents allege that they had been in my service  it was his mother  her name was blackett and she left us on her marriage with one of the hodgekins  lord ormersfield rang the bell and frampton the butler and confidential servant formed on his own model made his appearance  do you know whether a woman of the name of blackett ever lived in service here  not that i am aware of my lord  i will ascertain the fact  in a few moments frampton returned  yes my lord a girl named blackett was once engaged to help in the scullery but was discharged for dishonesty at the end of a month  did not frampton know that that related to me said louis sotto voce to his aunt  did he not trust that he was reducing me from a sea anemone to a lump of quaking jelly  so far from this consummation lord fitzjocelyn looked as triumphant as don quixote liberating gines de pasamonte  he and his father might have sat for illustrations of            youth is full of pleasance            age is full of care  as they occupied the two ends of the dinnertable the earl concealing anxiety and vexation under more than ordinary punctilious politeness the viscount doing his share of the honours with easy winning grace and attention and rattling on in an undertone of lively conversation with aunt catharine  mary was silently amazed at her encouraging him but perhaps she could not help spoiling him the more because there was a storm impending  at least as soon as she was in the drawingroom she became restless and nervous and said that she wished his father could see that speaking sternly to him never did any good besides it was mere inconsiderateness the excess of chivalrous compassion  mrs ponsonby said she thought young mens ardour more apt to be against than for the poacher  i must confess said aunt catherine with all the reluctance of a highspirited dynevori must confess that louis is no sportsman he was eager about it once till he had become a good shot and then it lost all zest for him and he prefers his own vagaries  he never takes a gun unless james drives him out and oddly enough his father is quite vexed at his indifference as if it were not manly if his father would only understand him  the specimen of that day had almost made mrs ponsonby fear that there was nothing to understand and that only dear aunt kittys affection could perceive anything but amiable folly and it was not much better when the young gentleman reappeared looking very debonnaire and sitting down beside mrs frost said in a voice meant for her alonehenry iv part ii the insult to chief justice gascoigne  my father will presently enter and address you                           o that it could be proved       that some nighttripping fairy had exchanged       in cradlecloths our children as they lay       calld yours fitzjocelynmine frost dynevor   for shame louis  i shall have to call you fitzjocelyn  you are behaving very ill  insulting the english constitution in the person of seven squires  dont my dear  it was the very thing to vex your father that you should have put yourself in such a position  bearding the northwold bench with a groundsel plume and a knittingneedle       with a needle for a sword and a thimble for a hat       wilt thou fight a traverse with the castle cat   the proper champion in such a cause since what cats averse to fish  no louis dear said his aunt struggling like a girl to keep her countenance this is no time for nonsense  one would think you had no feeling for your father  my dear aunt i cant go to gaol like prince hal  i do assure you i did not assault the bench with the knittingpins  what am i to do  not set at nought your fathers displeasure  i cant help it said he almost sadly though half smiling  what would become of me if i tried to support the full weight interfering with institutions ruining reputation blasting bulwarks patronizing poachers vituperating venerated  quite true cried aunt catherine with spirit  you know you had no business there lecturing a set of men old enough to be your grandfathers and talking them all to death no doubt  well aunt kitty if oppression maddens the wise what must it do to the foolish  if you only allow that it was foolish  no i had rather know whether it was wrong  i believe i was too eager and not respectful enough to the old squire and on reflection it might have been a matter of obedience to my father not to interfere with the prejudices of trueborn english magistrates  yes i was wrong i would have owned it sooner but for the shell he fired over my head  and for the rest i dont know how to repent of having protested against tyranny  there was something redeeming in the conclusion and it was a comfort for it was impossible to retain anger with one so gently goodhumouredly polite and attentive  a practical answer to the champion was not long in coming  he volunteered the next day to walk to northwold with mrs frost and mary who wanted to spend the morning in selecting a house in dynevor terrace and to be fetched home byandby when mrs ponsonby took her airing  two miles seemed nothing to aunt catharine who accepted her nephews arm for love and not for need as he discoursed of all the animals that might be naturalized in england obtained from mary an account of the llamas of the andes and rode off upon a scheme of an importation to make the fortune of marksedge by a manufacture of alpaca umbrellas  meantime he must show the beautiful american ducks which he hoped to naturalize on the pond near the keepers lodge but whistle and call as he would nothing showed itself but screaming canada geese  he ran round pulled out a boat half full of water and with a foot on each side paddled across to a bushy island in the centrebut in vain the keepers wife who had the charge over them came out oh my lord i am so sorry  they pretty ducks  ha the foxes  i wish it was my lord but it is they poachers out at marksedge that are so daring they would come anywheresand you see the ducks would roost up in the trees and you said i was not to shut em up at night my master was out up by beech hollow i heerd a gun and looked out i seen a man and a boyid take my oath it was young hodgekin  they do say nanny hodgekin she as was one of the blacketts whose husband was transported took in two ducks next morning to northwold  warren couldnt make nothing of it but if ever he meets that hodgekin again he says he shall catch it  well mrs warren it cant be helpedthank you for the good care you took of the poor ducks said louis kindly and as he walked on through the gate he gave a long sigh and said my dainty ducks so theres an end of them and all their tameness  but the smile could not but return  it is lucky the case does not come before the bench but really that woman deserves a medal for coolness  i suppose said mary she could have paid the fine with the price of the ducks  ah the beauties  i wish mr hodgekin had fallen on the pheasants instead  however i am thankful he and warren did not come to a collision about them  i am always expecting that having made those marksedge people thieves murder will be the next consequence  a few seconds sufficed to bring the ludicrous back  how pat it comes mary did you prime mrs warren or did frampton  i believe you had rather laugh at yourself than at any one else exclaimed his aunt who felt baffled at having thrown away her compassion  of course  one knows how much can be borne  why mary has that set you studyingdo you dissent  i was thinking whether it is the best thing to be always ready to laugh at oneself said mary  does it always help in mending  dont care came to a bad end said louis but on the other hand care killed a catso there are two sides to the question  while mary was feeling disappointed at his light tone he changed it to one that was almost mournful  the worst of it is that dont care is my refuge  whatever i do care about is always thwarted by frampton or somebody and being for ever thrown over i have only to fall as softly as i can  you know my dear said mrs frost that your father has no command of means to gratify you  there are means enough for ourselves said louis that is the needful duty  what merely personal indulgence did i ever ask for that was refused me  if that is all you have to complain of i cant pity you said mary  listen mary  let me wish for a horse there it is  let me wish for a painted window we cant afford it though after all it would not eat but horses are an adjunct of state and propriety  so again the parish feasted last 18th of january because i came of age and it was proper while if i ask that our people may be released from work on good friday or ascension day it is thought outrageous  if i remember right my dear interposed his aunt you wanted no work to be done on any saintsday  was there not a scheme that mr holdsworth called the cricket cure  that may yet be  no one knows the good a few free days would do the poor  but i developed my plan too rapidly  ill try again for their churchgoing on good friday  i think you ought to succeed there  i know how it will be  my father will ring propound the matter to frampton the answer will be quite impracticable my lord and there will be an end of it  perhaps not  at least it will have been considered said mary  true said louis but you little know what it is to have a frampton if he be a fair sample of prime ministers no wonder princes of wales go into the opposition  i thought frampton was a very valuable superior servant  exactly so  that is the worst of it  he is supreme authority and well deserves it  when la grande mademoiselle stood before the gates of orleans calling to the sentinel to open them he never stirred a step but replied merely with profound bows  that is my case  i make a request am answered yes my lord find no results repeat the process and at the fourth time am silenced with quite impracticable my lord  surely frampton is respectful  it is his very essence  he is a thorough aristocrat respecting himself and therefore respecting all others as they deserve  he respects a viscount fitzjocelyn as an appendage nearly as needful as the wyverns on each side of the shield but as to the individual holding that office he regards him much as he would one of the wyverns with a foolscap on  and with those words fitzjocelyn had sprung into the hedge to gather the earliest willowcatkins and came down dilating on their silvery downy buds and golden blossoms and on the pleasure they would give miss faithfull till mary who had been beginning to compassionate him was almost vexed to think her pity wasted on grievances of mere random talk  warm and kindly was his greeting of his aunts good old servant jane beckett whom mary was well pleased to meet as one of the kind friends of her childhood  the refinement that was like an atmosphere around mrs frost seemed to have extended even to her servants for jane though she could hardly read and carried her accounts in her head had manners of a gentle warmth and propriety that had a grace of their own even in her racy bad grammar and there was no withstanding the merry smile that twitched up one side of her mouth while her eyes twinkled in the varied moods prompted by an inexhaustible fund of good temper sympathy and affection but the fulness of her love was for the distant master oliver whose young nurserymaid she had been  her eyes winked between tears and smiles when she heard that miss mary had seen him but five months ago and she inquired after him gloried in his prosperity and talked of his coming home with far less reserve than his mother had done  mary was struck also with the pretty modest looks of the little underling and remarked on them as they proceeded to the inspection of the next house  yes said louis charlotte is something between a wood sorrel and a fiveplume moth  tom madison as usual shows exquisite taste she is a perfect lady of eschalott  now louis said his aunt standing still and really looking annoyed you know i cannot encourage any such thing  poor little charlotte is an orphan and i am all the more responsible for her  theres a chivalry in poor tom  nonsense said his aunt as if resolved not to hear him out because afraid of herself  dont say any more about it  i wish i had never allowed of his bringing your messages  who set him down in the kitchen to drink a cup of beer said louis mischievously  ah well one comfort is that girls never care for boys of the same age replied aunt catharine as she turned the key and admitted them into no 7 when fitzjocelyn confused marys judgment with his recommendations till aunt catharine pointing out the broken shutter and asking if he would not have been better employed in fetching the carpenter than in hectoring the magistrates he promised to make up for it fetched a piece of wood and jamess tools and was quickly at work his aunt only warning him that if he lost jems tools she would not say it was her fault  by the time marys imagination had portrayed what paper paint furniture and habitation might make the house and had discerned how to arrange a pretty little study in case of her fathers return he had completed the repair in a workmanlike manner and putting two fingers to his cap asked any other little job for me maam  of course he forgot the tools till shamed by marys turning back for them and after a merry luncheon served up in haste by jane they betook themselves to number 8 where the miss faithfulls were seated at a dessert of hard biscuits and water of neither of which they ever partook they only adhered to the hereditary institution of sitting for twenty minutes after dinner with their red and purple doileys before them  mary seemed to herself carried back fourteen years and to understand why her childish fancy had always believed christianas mercy a living character when she found herself in the calm happy little household the chief change was that she must now bend down instead of reaching up to receive the kind embraces  even the garments seemed unchanged the dark merino gowns black silk aprons white capribbons the soft little indian shawl worn by the elder sister the ribbon bow by the younger distinctions that used to puzzle her infant speculation not aware that the coloured bow was miss mercys ensign of youth and that its absence would have made miss salome feel aged indeed  the two sisters were much alikebut the younger was the more spare shrivelled up into a cheery nonpareil her bloom changed into something quite as fresh and healthful and her blithe tripping step always active except when her fingers were nimbly taking their turn  miss salome had become more plump her cheek was smoother and paler her eye more placid her air that of a patient invalid and her countenance more intellectual than her sisters she said less about their extreme enjoyment of the yam and while mrs frost and mary held counsel with miss mercy on servants and furniture there was a talk on entomology going on between her and fitzjocelyn  it was very pretty to see him with the old ladies so gently attentive without patronizing and they though evidently doting on him laughing at him and treating him like a spoilt child   he insisted on marys seeing their ordinary sitting room which nature had intended for a housekeepers room but which ladylike inhabitants had rendered what he called the very kernel of the house beautiful there were the stands of flowers in the window the bullfinch scolding in his cage the rare old shells and china on the oldfashioned cabinets that mary so well remembered and the silk patchwork sofacover the old piano and miss faithfulls arm chair by the fire her little table with her beautiful knitting and often a flower or insect that she was copying for she still drew nicely and she smiled and consented as louis pulled out her portfolios lifelong collections of portraits of birds flowers or insects her knitting found a sale at the workshop where the object was well known and the proceeds were diffused by her sister and whether she deserved her name might be guessed by the basket of poor peoples stores beside her chair  miss mercy was well known in every dusky northwold lane or alley where she always found or made a welcome for herself  the kindly counsel and ready hand were more potent than far larger means without them  such neighbours were in themselves a host and mary and her mother both felt as if they had attained a region of unwonted tranquillity and repose when they had agreed to rent no 5 dynevor terrace from the ensuing ladyday and to take possession when carpenters and upholsterers should have worked their will  louis was halfway home when he exclaimed there i have missed tom madison a second time  when shall i ever remember him at the right time  little did louis guess the effect his neglect was taking  charlotte arnold might have told for mrs martha had brought in stories of his unsteadiness and idle habits that confirmed her in her obedience to jane  she never went out alone in his leisure hours never looked for him in returning from churchalas that was not the place to look for him now  and yet she could not believe him such a very bad boy as she was told he had become     chapter v  the two ministers    the creatures neither one nor tother   i caught the animal last night   and viewed him oer by candlelight   i marked him well twas black as jet   you stare but sirs ive got him yet   and can produce him  pray sir do   ill lay my life the thing is blue   and ill be sworn that when youve seen   the reptile youll pronounce him green   well then at once to end the doubt   replies the man ill turn him out   and when before your eyes ive set him   if you dont find him black ill eat him   he saidthen full before their sight   produced the beast and lo twas white                                      merrick   mrs ponsonby had seen in the tropics birds of brilliant hues that even whilst the gazer pronounced them all one beaming tint of gorgeous purple would give one flutter and in another light would flash with golden green or fiery scarlet  no less startling and unexpected were the aspects of lord fitzjocelyn every thing by starts and nothing long sometimes absorbed in study sometimes equally ardent over a childish game wild about philanthropic plans and apparently forgetting them the instant a cold word had fallen on them attempting everything finishing nothing dipping into every kind of book and forsaking it after a cursory glance ever busy yet ever idle full of desultory knowledge ranging through all kinds of reading and natural history and still more full of talk  this last was perhaps his most decided gift  to any one of whatever degree he would talk he could hardly have been silent ten minutes with any human being except frampton or his father and whether deep reflections or arrant nonsense came out of his mouth seemed an even chance though both alike were in the same soft low voice and with the same air of quaint pensive simplicity  he was exceedingly provoking and yet there was no being provoked with him  he was so sincere affectionate and obliging that not to love him was impossible yet that love only made his faults more annoying and mrs ponsonby could well understand his fathers perpetual restless anxiety for his foibles were exactly of the sort most likely to tease such a man as the earl and the most positively unsatisfactory part of his character was the insouciance that he displayed when his trifling or his wild projects had given umbrage  yet even here she could not but feel a hope such as it was that the carelessness might be the effect of want of sympathy and visible affection from his father whose very anxiety made him the more unbending and that what a worse temper might have resented rendered a good one gaily reckless and unheeding  she often wondered whether she should try to give a hintbut lord ormersfield seemed to dread leading to the subject although on all else that interested him he came to her as in old times and seemed greatly refreshed and softened by her companionship  an old friend and former fellowminister had proposed spending a night at ormersfield  he was the person whom the earl most highly esteemed and in his own dignified way he was solicitous that the household should be in more than usually perfect order holding a long conference with the man of whom he was sure frampton  would that he could have been equally sure of his son  he looked at him almost wistfully several times during breakfast and at last as they rose gave an exhortation that he would be punctual to dinner at halfpast seven which would give him ample time and he hoped he would be he paused for a word and his son supplied it  on my good behaviour i understand  with that he walked off leaving lord ormersfield telling mrs ponsonby that it was the first introduction as he had for various reasons thought it undesirable to bring fitzjocelyn early to london and betraying his own anxiety as to the impression he might produce on sir miles oakstead  his own perplexity and despondency showed themselves in his desire to view his son with the eyes of others and he also thought the tenor of fitzjocelyns future life might be coloured by his friends opinion  evening brought the guest  mrs ponsonby was not well enough to appear at dinner but mary and mrs frost pleased to see an historical character were in the drawingroom enjoying sir miless agreeable conversation until they caught certain misgivings reflected in each others looks as time wore on and nothing had been seen or heard of louis  the halfhour struck the earl waited five minutes then rang the bell  is lord fitzjocelyn come in  no my lord  bring in the dinner  mary longed to fly in search of him and spare further vexation  she had assumed all an elder sisters feelings and suffered for him as she used to do when he was in disgrace and would not heed it  she heard no more of the conversation and was insensible to the honour of going in to dinner with the late secretary of state as she saw the empty place at the table  the soup was over when she was aware of a step in the hall and beside her stood a grey figure bespattered with mud shading his eyes with his hand as if dazzled by the lights  i beg your pardon were the words but i was obliged to go to northwold  i have shot a rosecoloured pastor  shot him cried mary  was he much hurt  killed  i took him to miss faithfull to be sketched before he is stuffed  a clearer view of the company a wave of the hand from the earl and the young gentleman was gone  next he opened the library door saying heres my pretty behaviour  louis what is the matter cried mrs ponsonby  i entirely forgot the right honourable and marched into the diningroom to tell aunt catharine that i have killed a rosecoloured pastor  killed what  a bird hardly ever seen in england  i spied him in the firwood went to warren for a gun brought him down and walked on to the house beautiful where miss faithfull was enchanted  she will copy him and send him to the birdstuffer  i looked in to give directions and old jenyns was amazed he never knew one shot here before so early in the year too  he says we must send the account to the ornithological  do you know how wet you are  exclaimed mrs ponsonby seeing rivulets dropping from his coat  i see  it rained all the way home and was so dark i could not see the footpath and when i came in my eyes were blinded by the light and my head so full of the pastor that the other minister never occurred to me and remains under the impression that i have confessed a sacrilegious murder  you really are incorrigible cried mrs ponsonby  why are you not dressing for dinner  because you are going to give me a cup of your tea  certainly not  i shall begin to think you purposely mortified your father when you know he wanted you to be reasonable  the lower species never show off well to strangers said fitzjocelyn coolly but as he lighted his candle he added with more candour i beg your pardonindeed i did not do this on purpose but dont say anything about appearancestheres something in me that is sure to revolt  so noiselessly that the moment was unknown the vacant chair was filled by a gentleman irreproachably attired his face glowing with exercise or with what made him very debonnaire and really silent dining rapidly and unobtrusively and never raising his eyes even to his aunt probably intending thus to remain all the evening but presently sir miles turned to him and said pray satisfy my curiosity  who is the rosecoloured pastor  louis raised his eyes and meeting a pleasing sensible face out beamed his arch look of suppressed fun as he answered he is not at all clerical  he is otherwise called the rosecoloured ouzel or starling  whence is that other startling name  from his attending flocks of sheep on the same mission as jackdaws fulfil herewhich likewise have an ecclesiastical reputation       a great frequenter of the church  fearing alike nonsense and ornithology lord ormersfield changed the subject and louis subsided but when the gentlemen came into the drawingroom mrs ponsonby was surprised to see him taking a fair share and no more of the conversation  some information had been wanted about the terms of labour in the mining districts and louiss visit to illershall enabled him to throw light on the subject with much clearness and accuracy  sir miles had more literature than lord ormersfield and was more used to young men and he began to draw fitzjocelyn out with complete success  louis fully responded to the touch and without a notion that he was showing himself to the best advantage he yielded to the pleasure and for once proved of what he was capablerevealing unawares an unusual amount of intelligence and observation and great power of expression  not even his aunt had ever seen him appear so much like a superior man and the only alloy was his fathers illrepressed dread lest he should fall on dangerous ground and commit himself either to his wildly philanthropical or extravagantly monarchical views whichever might happen to be in the ascendant  however such shoals were not approached nor did louis ever plunge out of his depth  the whole of his manner and demeanour were proofs that in his case much talk sprang from exuberance of ideas not from selfconceit  he was equally good in the morning he had risen early to hunt up some information which sir miles wanted and the clearness and readiness with which he had found it were wonderful  the guest was delighted with him gave him a warm invitation to oakstead and on being left alone with mrs ponsonby whom he had formerly known expressed his admiration of his friends sonas a fine promising young man of great ability and originality and what was still more remarkable of most simple natural manners perfectly free from conceit  he seemed the more amazed when he found what he would hardly believe that fitzjocelyn was twentyone and had nearly finished his university education  the liking was mutual  no sooner had sir miles departed than louis came to the library in a rapture declaring that here was the refreshing sight of a man unspoilt by political life which usually ate out the hearts of people  mary smiled at this and told him that he was talking like an old statesman weary of the world  one may be weary of the world beforehand as well as after said he  that does not seem worth while said mary  no he said but ones own immediate lookout may not be flattering whatever the next turn may bring and he took up the newspaper and began to turn it over  as butleras singlehanded manas clerk and accountant  there those are the lucky men with downright work and some one to work for  or just listen to this and he plunged into a story of some heroic conduct during a shipwreck  while he was reading it aloud with kindling eyes and enthusiastic interest his father opened the door  louis he said if you are doing nothing i should be obliged if you would make two copies of this letter  louis glanced at the end of what he was reading laid the paper down and opened a blottingbook  you had better come into the study or you will not write correctly  i can write whatever goes on  i particularly wish this to be legible and accurate  you have begun too low down  louis took another sheet  that pen is not fit to write with  the pens are delusions said louis trying them round in an easy idle way i never could mend a quill  how is this steel one refuses to recognise the purpose of his existence  aunt catherine do you still forbid steel pens in your school  if so it must be the solitary instance  how geese must cackle blessings on the inventor he should have a testimoniala silver inkstand representing the goose that laid the golden eggsand all writingmasters should subscribe  ha where did this pen come from  mary were you the bounteous mender  a thousand thanks  if louis fretted his father by loitering and nonsense his father was no less trying by standing over him with advice and criticisms which would have driven most youths beyond patience but which he bore with constant goodhumour till his father returned to the study when he exclaimed now mary if you like to finish the wreck it will not interrupt me  this is mere machinework  thank you said mary i should like it better afterwards  do you think i might do one copy for you  or would it not suit lord ormersfield  louis made polite demurs but she overruled them and began  he stretched himself took up his times and skimmed the remaining incidents of the shipwreck till he was shamed by seeing mary halfway down the first page when he resumed his pen overtook her and then relapsed into talk till mrs frost fairly left the room to silence him  as the two copies were completed lord ormersfield returned and mary with many apologies presented her copy and received most gracious thanks and compliments on her firm clear writing a vexation to her rather than otherwise since fitzjocelyn was called to account for dubious scrawls errors and erasures  he meekly took another sheet consoling himself however by saying i warn you that pains will only make it miss fanny  what do you mean  as if glad to be instigated he replied did you never hear of my signature being mistaken by an ingenious person who addressed his answer to miss fanny jocelyn  why fanny has been one of jems regular names for me ever since  i have the envelope somewhere as a curiosity  ill show it to you mary  you seem to be proud of it exclaimed his father nearly out of patience  pray tell me whether you intend to copy this creditably or not  i will endeavour but the fates must decide  i can scrawl or with pains i can imitate miss fanny but the other alternative only comes in happy moments  do you mean that you cannot write well if you choose  it is like other artsan inspiration  dogberry was deep when he said it came by nature  then make no more attempts  no  that schoolgirls niggle is worse than the first  fanny as i told you said louis looking vacantly up in resigned despair yet not without the lurking expression of amusement i will try again  no i thank you  i will have no more time wasted  louis passively moved to the window where he exclaimed that he saw aunt catharine sunning herself in the garden and must go and help her  did you ever see anything like that cried lord ormersfield thoroughly moved to displeasure  there was at least goodhumour said mrs ponsonby  pardon me there was almost as much to try his temper as yours  he is insensible  i think not  a word from aunt catharine rules him  though you counselled it mary i doubt whether her training has answered  henry frost should have been a warning  mary found herself blundering in her new copy and retreated with it to the study while her mother made answer i do not repent of my advice the affection between him and aunt catherine is the greatest blessing to him  poor boy said his father forgetting his letters as he stood pondering  mrs ponsonby seized the moment for reporting sir miless opinion but the earl did not betray his gratification  first sight he said  last night and this afternoon he is as unlike as these are and he placed before her louiss unlucky copies together with a letter written in a bold manly hand  three different men might have written these  and he pretends he cannot write like this if he please  i have no doubt it is to a certain extent true  yes absolutely true you do not conceive the influence that mood has on some characters before they have learnt to master themselves  i do not mean temper but the mere frame of spirits  even sense of restraint will often take away the actual power from a child or where there is not a strong will  you are right said he becoming rigid as if with pain  he is a child  you have not yet told me what you think of him  you need not hesitate  no one sees the likeness more plainly than i do  it is strong externally she said but i think it is more external than real more temperament than character  you are too metaphysical for me mary and he would fain have smiled  i want you to be hopeful  half the object would be attained if you were and he really deserves that you should  he will not let me  if i hope at one moment i am disappointed the next  and how  by nothing worse than boyishness  you confirm what my aunt tells me that there has never been a serious complaint of him  never  his conduct has always been blameless but every tutor has said the samethat he has no application and allows himself to be surpassed by any one of moderate energy  blameless conduct  how many fathers would give worlds to be able to give such a character of a son  there are faults that are the very indications of a manly spirit began the earl impatiently  not that i mean that i wishhe has never given me any troublebut just look at james frost and you would see what i mean  theres energy in himfireindependence you feel there is substance in him and like him the better for having a will and way of his own  so i think has louis but it is so often thwarted that it sinks away under the sense of duty and submission  if there were any consistency or reason in his fancies they would not give way so easily but it is all talk all extravagant notionshere one day gone the next  not a spark of ambition  ambition is not so safe a spark that we should wish to see it lighted  a man must wish to see his son hold his proper station and aim high no one can be satisfied to see him a trifler  i have been trying to find out why he trifles  as far as i can see he has no ambition and i do not think his turn will be for a life like yours  his bent is towards what is to do good to others  he would make an admirable country gentleman  a mere farmer idling away his time in his fields  no doing infinite good by example and influence and coming forward whenever duty required it  depend upon it the benefit to others is the impulse which can work on louis not personal ambition  birth has already given him more than he values  you may be right said lord ormersfield but it is hard to see so many advantages thrown away and what sometimes seems like so much ability wasted  but who can tell he is never the same for an hour together  may it not be for want of a sphere of wholesome action  he is not fit for it mary  you know i resolved that the whole burthen of our losses should fall on me i made it my object that he should not suffer and should freely have whatever i had at the same age  everything is cleared at last  i could give him the same income as i started in life with but he is so reckless of money that i cannot feel justified in putting it into his hands  say what i will not a vacation occurs but he comes to tell me of some paltry debt of ten or fifteen pounds  he comes to tell you  nay never say he has no resolution  such debts as those what are they compared with other young mens of which they do not tell their fathers  if he were like other youths i should know how to deal with him but you agree with me he is not fit to have a larger sum in his hands  perhaps not he is too impulsive and inexperienced  if you were to ask me how to make it conduce to his happiness i should say lay out more on the estate so as to employ more men and make improvements in which he would take interest  i cannot make him care for the estate  last winter when he came of age i tried to explain the state of affairs but he was utterly indifferentwould not trouble himself to understand the papers he was to sign and made me quite ashamed of such an exhibition before richardson  i wish i could defend him  and yetyou will think me unreasonable but i do believe that if he had thought the welfare of others was concerned he would have attended more  umph  i am not sure that it is not his good qualities that make him so hard to deal with  the want of selfishness and vanity seem to take away two common springs of action but i do believe that patience will bring out something much higher when you have found the way to reach it  that i certainly have not if it be there  to cultivate his sympathies with you said mrs ponsonby hesitating and not venturing to look into his face  enough mary he said hastily  you said the like to me once before  but said mrs ponsonby firmly here there is a foundation to work on  there are affections that only need to be drawn out to make you happy and himnot perhaps what you now wish but better than you wish  his face had become hard as he answered thank you mary you have always meant the best  you have always been kind to me and to all belonging to me  her heart ached for the father and son understanding each other so little and paining each other so much and she feared that the earls mind had been too much cramped and his feelings too much chilled for such softening on his part as could alone as it seemed prevent louis from being estranged and left to his naturally fickle and indolent disposition  mary had in the mean time completed her copies and left them on the earls table and wishing neither to be thanked nor contrasted with louis she put on her bonnet to go in search of aunt catharine  not finding her in the garden she decided on visiting old gervas and his wife who had gladly caught at her offer of reading to them  the visit over she returned by the favourite path above ferny dell gathering primroses and meditating how to stir up louis to finish off his rocky steps and make one piece of work complete  she paused at the summit of them and was much inclined to descend and examine what was wanting when she started at hearing a rustling beneath then a low moan and an attempt at a call  the bushes and a projecting rock cut off her view but in some trepidation she called out is any one there  little did she expect the answer  it is ifitzjocelyn  comei have had a fall  im comingare you hurt she cried as with shaking limbs she prepared to begin the descent  not that way he called it gave waygo to the left  she was almost disobeying but recalling herself to thought she hurried along the top till the bank became practicable and tore her way through brake and brier till she could return along the side of the stream  horrorstruck she perceived that a heavy stone had given way and rolled down bearing louis with it to the bottom where he lay ghastly and helpless  she called to him and he tried to raise himself but sank back  mary is it you  i thought i should have died here he said as she knelt by him exclaiming oh louis louis what a dreadful fall  it is my fault he eagerly interrupted  i am glad it has happened to no one else  and you are terribly hurt i must go for help but what can i do for you  would you like some water  water  oh i have heard it all this time gurgling there  she filled his cap and bathed his face apparently to his great relief and she ventured to ask if he had been long there  very long he said  i must have fainted after i got the stone off my foot so i missed gervas going by  i thought no one else would come near  thank god  mary almost grew sick as she saw how dreadfully his left ankle had been crushed by a heavy stone and her very turning towards it made him shudder and say dont touch me  i am shattered all over  i am afraid i should only hurt you she said with difficulty controlling herself  i had better fetch some one  he did not know how to be left again but the damp chilliness of his hands made her the more anxious to procure assistance and after spreading her shawl over him she made the utmost speed out of the thicket  as she emerged she saw lord ormersfield riding with his groom and her scream and sign arrested him but by the time they met she could utter nothing but louis  another accident was the almost impatient answer  he is dreadfully hurt she said sobbing and breathless  his foot is crushed  he has been there this hour  the alarm was indeed given  the earl seemed about to rush away without knowing whither and she had absolutely to withhold him while summoning her faculties she gave directions to poynings then she let him draw her on too fast for speaking until they reached the spot where louis lay so spent with pain and cold that he barely opened his eyes at their voices made no distinct answers as to his hurts and shrank and moaned when his father would have raised him  mary contrived to place his head on her lap bathed his forehead and chafed his hands while lord ormersfield stood watching him with looks of misery or paced about anxiously looking for the servants  they came at last all too soon for poor louis who suffered terribly in the transport and gave few tokens of consciousness except a cry now and then extorted by a rougher movement  none of the household scarcely even mrs frost seemed at first to be able to believe that lord fitzjocelyn could really have hurt himself seriously  again was the first word of every one for his many slight accidents were treated like crying wolf but frampton himself looked perfectly pale and shocked when he perceived how the matter really stood and neither he nor lord ormersfield was half so helpful as mrs frost  the shock only called out her energy in behalf of her darling and tender as her nature was she shrank from nothing that could soothe and alleviate his suffering and it did infinitely comfort him as he held her hand and looked with affection into her face even in the extremity of pain  fain would others have been the same support but his father though not leaving him was completely unnerved and unable to do anything and mrs ponsonby was suffering under one of the attacks that were brought on by any sudden agitation  mary though giddy and throbbing in every pulse was forced to put a resolute check on herselfbrace her limbs steady her voice and keep her face composed while every faculty was absorbed in listening for sounds from her cousins room and her heart was quivering with an anguish of prayer and suspense could she but hide her burning cheeks for one moment let out one of the sobs that seemed to be rending her breast throw herself on her knees and burst into tears what an infinite relief it would be  but mary had learnt to spend her life in having no self     chapter vi  farewells    what yet is there that i should do     lingering in this darksome vale   proud and mighty fair to view     are our schemes and yet they fail   like the sand before the wind     that no power of man can bind                       arndt lyra germanica   dynevor terrace was said to have dark damp kitchens but by none who had ever been in no 5 when the little compact fire was compressed to one glowing red crater of cinders their smile laughing ruddily back from the bright array on the dresser the drugget laid down the round oaken table brought forward and jane beckett in afternoon trim tending her geraniums the offspring of the parting cheveleigh nosegay or gauffreing her mistresss caps  no wonder that on raw evenings master james miss clara or my young lord had often been found gossiping with jane toasting their own cheeks as well as the bread or pinching their fingers in her gauffreing machine  yet poor little charlotte arnold learnt that the kitchen could be dreary when mrs beckett had been summoned to nurse lord fitzjocelyn and she remained in sole charge under mrs marthas occasional supervision  she found herself her household cares over all too soon on a cold light march afternoon with the clock ticking loud enough for midnight the smokejack indulging in supernatural groans and the whole lonely house full of undefined terrors with an unlimited space of the like solitude before her  she would even have been glad to be sure of an evening of mrs marthas good advice and of darning stockings  she sat down by the round table to mr jamess wristbands but every creak or crack of the furniture made her start and think of deathwatches  she might have learnt to contemn superstition but that did not prevent it from affecting her nerves  she spread her favourite study the old english baron on the table before her but the hero had some connexion in her mind with tom madison for whom she had always coveted a battlefield in france what would he feel when he heard how he had filled up his course of evil being wellnigh the death of his benefactor  if any one ought to be haunted it would assuredly be no other than tom  chills running over her at the thought she turned to the fire as the thing nearest life but at the moment started at a hollow call of her own name  a face was looking in at her through the geraniums  she shrieked aloud and clasped her hands over her eyes  dont make a row  open the door  it was such a relief to hear something unghostly that she sprang to the door but as she undid it all her scruples seized her and she tried to hold it saying dont come in  you unfortunate boy do you know what you have done  but tom madison was in a mood to which her female nature cowered  he pushed the door open saying authoritatively tell me how he is  he is as ill as he can be to be alive said charlotte actuated at once by the importance of being the repository of such tidings and by the excitement of communicating them to one so deeply concerned mr poynings came in to fetch mrs becketthe would have no one else to nurse himand he says the old lord and missus have never had their clothes off these two nights  then was it along of them stones asked the lad hoarsely  yourself should know best returned charlotte  mr poynings says twas a piece of rock as big as that warmingpan as crushed his ankle and you know  i know nothing said tom  master kept me in all day yesterday and i only heard just now at little northwold where ive been to take home some knives of squire calcotts  master may blow me up if he likes but i couldnt come till id heard the rights of it  is he so very bad  theyve sent up to london for a doctor pursued charlotte  mr walby dont give but little hope of him  poor young gentleman im sure he had a good word from high and low  well im gone cried tom vehemently  goodbye to you charlotte arnold  youll never see me in these parts more  gone  oh tom what do you mean  dye think ill stay here to have this here cast in my face  such a one as wont never walk the earth again and he burst out into passionate tears  i wish i was dead  oh hush tomthat is wicked  may be so  i am all thats wicked and you all turn against me  i dont turn against you sobbed charlotte moved to the bottom of her gentle heart  you you turned against me long ago  youve been too proud to cast one look at me these three months and he forgot me and thats what drew me on when who cared what became of menor i neither now  dont speak that way  dont say twas pride  oh no but i had to behave proper and how should i keep up acquaintance when they said you went onunsteady  aye aye  i know how it is said poor tom with brokendown humility i was not fit for you then and im next thing to a murderer now and youre like a white dove that the very fingers of me would grime  ill take myself out of your way but let what will come of me ill never forget you charlotte  oh wait tom  if i could but say it rightoh i know theres something about biding patiently and getting a blessingif youd only stop while i recollect it  i thought i heard voices exclaimed mrs martha suddenly descending on them  i wonder you arent ashamed of yourselves and the family in such trouble  downright owdacious  be this your house said tom stepping before charlotte his dejection giving way instantly to rude independence  oh very well said martha with dignity  i know what to expect from such sort of people  the house and young woman is in my charge sir and if you dont be off ill call the police  never trouble your old bones retorted tom  goodbye to you charlotte and as in defiance of martha he took her passive hand  youll remember one as loved you true and faithful but was drove desperate  goodbye  ill not trouble no one no more  the three concluding negatives with which he dashed out of the house utterly overwhelmed charlotte and made her perfectly insensible to mrs marthas objurgations  she believed in the most horrible and desperate intentions and sobbed herself into such violent hysterics that miss mercy came in to assistimagined that the rude boy had terrified her misunderstood her shamefaced attempts at explanation and left her lying on her bed crying quietly over her secret terrors and over that first strangelymade declaration of love the white dove she did not deserve it but it was so poetical and poor tom was so unhappy  she had not time even to think what was become of her own character for wisdom and prudence  the next morning between monition and triumph martha announced that the goodfornothing chap was off with a valuable parcel of mr calcotts and the police were after him with much more about his former idle habitsfrequenting of democratic oratory publichouses and fondness for bad company and strolling actors  meek and easily cowed charlotte only opened her lips to say she knew that he had taken home mr calcotts parcel  but this brought down a storm on her for being impertinent enough to defend him and she sat trembling till it had subsided and martha retreating left her to weep unrestrainedly over her wild fancies and the worlds cruelty and injustice towards one whom as she was now ready to declare she loved with her whole heart  the bell rang sharply knocks rattled at the front door  she was sure that tom had been just taken out of the river  but instinct to answer the bell awoke at the second furious clattering and double pealing which allowed no time for her to compose her tearstreaked swollen face especially as the hasty sounds suggested mr james  mr james it was but the expected rebuke for keeping him waiting was not spoken  as he saw her sorrowful looks he only said low and softly is it so charlotte  in his eyes there could be but one cause for grief and charlottes heart smote her for hypocrisy when she could barely command her voice to reply no sir my lord has had a little better night  he spoke with unusual gentleness as he made more inquiries than she could answer and when after a few minutes he turned to walk on to ormersfield he said kindly goodbye charlotte ill send you word if i find him better and the tears rose in his eyes at the thought how every one loved the patient  he was not wrong  there was everywhere great affection and sympathy for the bright fantastic being whom all laughed at and liked and northwold and the neighbourhood felt that they could have better spared something more valuable  the danger was hardly exaggerated even by charlotte  the chill of the long exposure had brought on high fever and besides the crushed ankle there had been severe contusions which had resulted in an acute pain in the side hitherto untouched by remedies and beyond the comprehension of the old northwold surgeon mr walby  as yet however the idea of peril had not presented itself to louis though he was perfectly sensible  severe pain and illness were new to him and though not fretful nor impatient he had not the stoicism either of pride or of physical indifference put little restraint on the expression of suffering and was to an almost childish degree absorbed in the present  he was always considerate and grateful and his fond affection for his aunt catharine and for good old jane never failed to show itself whenever they did anything for his relief and they were the best of nurses  poor lord ormersfield longed to be equally effective but he was neither handy nor ready and could only sit hour after hour beside his son never moving except to help the nurses or to try to catch the slightest accent of the sufferer  look up when louis would he always saw the same bowed head and earnest eyes which as mrs ponsonby told her daughter looked as they did when louisa was dying  the coming of the london surgeon was an era to which louis evidently looked anxiously with the iteration of sickness often reckoning the hours till he could arrive and when at last he came there was an evident effort to command attention  when the visit was over and the surgeon was taking leave after the consultation fitzjocelyn calmly desired to know his opinion and kept his eyes steadily fixed on his face weighing the import of each word all depended on the subduing the inflammatory action in the side and there was every reason to hope that he would have strength for the severe treatment necessary  there was no reason to despond  i understandthank you said louis  he shut his eyes and lay so still that mrs frost trusted that he slept but when his father came in they were open and lord ormersfield bending over him hoped he was in less pain  thank you there is not much difference  but the plaintive sound was gone the suffering was not the sole thought  walby is coming with the leeches at two oclock said lord ormersfield i reckon much on them  thank you  silence again but his face spoke a wish and his aunt catharine said what my dear  i should like to see mr holdsworth said louis with eyes appealing to his father  he has been here to inquire every day said the earl choosing neither to refuse nor understand  whenever it is not too much for you  it must be quickly before i am weaker said louis  let it be before walby returns father  whatever you wish my dear and lord ormersfield turning towards the table wrote a note which mrs frost offered to despatch thinking that her presence oppressed her elder nephew who looked bowed down by the intensity of grief which unexpressed seemed to pervade the whole man and weigh him to the earth and perhaps this also struck louis for the first time for after having lain silent for some minutes he softly said father  the earl was instantly beside him but instead of speaking louis gazed in his face and sighed as he murmured i was meant to have been a comfort to you  my dear boy began lord ormersfield but he could not trust his voice as he saw louiss eyes moist with tears  i wish i had he continued but i have never been anything but a care and vexation and i see it all too late  nay louis said his father trying to assume his usual tone of authority as if to prove his security you must not give way to feelings of illness  it is weak to despond  it is best to face it said the young man with slow and feeble utterance but with no quailing of eye or voice  but oh father i did not think you would feel it so much  i am not worth it  for the earl could neither speak nor breathe as if smothered by one mighty unuttered sob and holding his sons hand between both his own pressed it convulsively  i am glad mrs ponsonby is here said louis and you will soon find what a nice fellow edward fitzjocelyn is whom you may make just what  louis my own boy hush  i cannot bear this cried his father in an accent wrung from him by excess of grief  i may recover said louis finding it his turn to comfort and i should like to be longer with you to try to make up  you will  the leeches must relieve you  only keep up your spirits you have many years before you of happiness and success  the words brought a look of oppression over louiss face but it cleared as he said i am more willing to be spared those years  his father positively started  louis my poor boy he said is it really so  i know i have seemed a cold severe father  oh do not say so exclaimed louis i have deserved far lessidle ungrateful careless of your wishes  i did not know i could pain you so much or i would not have done it  you have forgiven often say you forgive now  you have far more to forgive than i said the earl  if i could tell you the halfwaywardness discontent neglect levity wasted timemy treatment of you only three days back everything purposednothing done  oh what a life to bring before the judge and he covered his face but his father heard longdrawn sobs  compose yourself my dear boy he exclaimed exceedingly grieved and perplexed  you know there is no cause to despond and eveneven if there were you have no reason to distress yourself  i can say from the bottom of my heart that you have never given me cause for real anxiety your conduct has been exemplary and i never saw such attention to religion in any young man  these are mere trifles  oh hush father exclaimed louis  you are only making it worse you little know what i am  if mr holdsworth would come  he could only tell you the same said his father  you may take every comfort in thinking how blameless you have been keeping so clear of all the faults of your age  i may not have esteemed you as you deserved my poor louis but be assured that very few can have so little to reproach themselves with as you have  louis almost smiled  poor comfort that he said even if it were true but oh father and there was a light in his eye i had thought of he hath blotted out like a cloud thy transgressions  that is right  one like you must find comfort in thinking  there is comfort ineffable said louis but if i knew what i may dare to take home to myself  it is all so dim and confused  this pain will not let anything come connectedly  would you give me that little manuscript book  it was given and as the many loose leaves fell under louiss weak hand his father was amazed at the mass of copies of prayers texts and meditations that he had brought together the earlier pages containing childish prayers written in aunt catharines hand louiss cheeks coloured at the revelation of his hidden life as his father put them together for him  it is of no use he said sadly i cannot read  perhaps my aunt would come and read this to me  let me said his father and louis looked pleased  lord ormersfield read what was pointed out  to him it was a glimpse of a very new world of contrition faith hope and prayer but he saw the uneasy expression on louiss face give place to serenity as one already at home in that sphere  thank you he said  that was what i wanted  mr holdsworth will soon come and then i dont want to say much more  only dont take this too much to hearti am not worth it and but for you and the dear terrace home i can be very glad  if i may hope the hope is so bright  here there are so many ways of going wrong and all i do always fails and yet i always tried to do him service  oh to have all perfectno failureno inconsistencyno self  can it be  i always tried to do him service sadly and dejectedly as the words were spokenmournful as was the contrast between the will and the result this was the true cause that there was peace with louis unstable negligent impetuous and weak as he had been the one earnest purpose had been his guarding the heart though not yet controlling the judgment  his soul was awake to the unseen and thus the sense of the reality of bliss ineffable and power to take comfort in the one great sacrifice came with no novelty nor strangeness  it was a more solemn more painful preparation but such as he had habitually made only now it was for a more perfect festival  his father as much awestruck by his hopes as distressed by his penitence still gave himself credit for having soothed him and went to meet and forewarn the vicar that poor fitzjocelyn was inclined to despond and was attaching such importance to the merest foibles in a most innocent life that he required the most tender and careful encouragement  he spoke in his usual tone of authoritative courtesy and then finding that his son wished to be left alone with mr holdsworth he went to the library to seek the only person to whom he could bear to talk  mary he said you were right  i have done so little to make that poor boy of mine happy that he does not wish for life  mrs ponsonby looked up surprised  are you sure of what he meant she said  was it not that this life has nothing to compare with that which is to come  but what can be more unnatural said the earl  at his age with everything before him nothing but what he felt as my harshness could so have checked hope and enjoyment  my poor louis  and though eye and voice were steady and tearless no words could express the anguish of his undertone  mrs ponsonby adduced instances showing that to early youth with heart still untainted by the world the joys of the life everlasting have often so beamed out as to efface all that earth could promise but he could not be argued out of selfreproach for his own want of sympathy and spoke mournfully of his cold manner sternness to small faults and denial of gratifications  mary the younger could not help rising from her corner to say indeed louis said the other day that you never had denied him any personal indulgence  my dear he never asked for personal indulgences said the earl his further speech was interrupted by a quick step a slow opening of the door and the entrance of james frost who grasped his outstretched hand with a breathless inquiry  he is very ill lord ormersfield paused too much oppressed to say more  no better  what did the london surgeon say what  he says there is no time to be lost in attacking the inflammation if we can subdue that he may recover but the state of the ankle weakens him severely  i believe myself that he is going fast said the earl with the same despairing calmness and james after gazing at him to collect his meaning dropped into a chair covered his face with his hands and sobbed aloud  lord ormersfield looked on as if he almost envied the relief of the outburst but jamess first movement was to turn on him as if he were neglecting his son sharply demanding who is with him  he wished to be left with mr holdsworth  is it come to this cried james  oh why did i not come down with him  i might have prevented all this  you could not have acted otherwise said the earl kindly  your engagement was already formed  i could said james  i would not  i thought it one of your excuses for helping us  it is vain to lament these things now said lord ormersfield  it is very kind in you to have come down and it will give him great pleasure if he be able to see you  if  james stammered between consternation and anger at the doubt and treated the earl with a kind of implied resentment as if for injustice suffered by louis but it was affecting to see his petulance received with patience almost with gratitude as a proof of his affection for louis  the earl stood upright and motionless before the fire answering steadily but in an almost inward voice all the detailed questions put by james who seated on one chair with his hands locked on the back of the other looked keenly up to him with his sharp black eyes often overflowing with tears and his voice broken by grief  when he had elicited that louis had been much excited and distressed by the thought of his failings he burst out whatever you may think lord ormersfield no one ever had less on his conscience  i am sure of it  i know of no one who would have given up his own way again and again without a murmur only to be called fickle  yes it has often been so meekly said lord ormersfield  fickle repeated james warming with the topic and pouring out what had been boiling within for years  he was only fickle because his standard was too high to be reached  you thought him weak  there may be weakness by nature strengthened by principle said mrs ponsonby  true cried jem who having taken no previous notice of her had at first on her speaking bent his brows on her as if to extend to her the storm he was inflicting on poor defenceless lord ormersfield he is thought soft because of his easy way but come to the point where harm displays itself you cant move him a step fartherthough he hangs back in such a quiet careless fashion that it seems as if he was only tired of the whole concern and so it goes down again as changeableness  you always did him justice said lord ormersfield laying his hand on his cousins shoulder but james retreated ungraciously  i suppose where he saw evil he actually took a dislike said mrs ponsonby  it is an absolute repugnance to anything bad  you turning again on the earl had an idea of his being too ready to run into all sorts of company but i told you there was no danger  you told me i might trust to his disgust to anything unrefined or dissipated  you knew him best  there is that about him which men not otherwise particular respect as they might a woman or a child  they never show themselves in their true colours and i have known him uphold them because he has never seen their worst side  i have always thought he learnt that peculiar refinement from your grandmother  i think said mrs ponsonby softly that it is purity of heart which makes him see heaven so bright  sydney calcott walked part of the way with me continued jem and showed more feeling than i thought was in him  he said just what i do that he never saw any one to whom evil seemed so unable to cling he spoke of him at schoolsaid he was the friend of all the juniors but too dreamy and uncertain for fellows of his own standing  he said at first they did not know what to make of him with his soft looks and cool waysthey could not make him understand bullying for he could not be frightened nor put in a passion  only once one great lout tried forcing bad language on him and then fitzjocelyn struck him fought him and was thoroughly licked to be sure but calcott said it was a moral victoryno one tried the like again  james was interrupted by mr holdsworths entrance  he said a few words apart to the earl who answered with alarm not now he has gone through enough  i told him so but he is very anxious and begged me to return in the evening  thank you  you had better join us at dinner  the vicar understood lord ormersfield better than did james and said pressing his hand my lord it is heartbreaking but the blessedness is more than we can feel  mrs ponsonby and mary were left to try to pacify james who was half mad at his exclusion from the sickroom and very angry with every hint of resignationabusing the treatment of the doctors calling mr walby an old woman and vehemently bent on prophesying the welldoing of the patient  keenly sensitive grief and suspense made him unusually irritable and he seemed to have no power of waiting patiently and trusting the event to wiser hands  mrs ponsonby dared not entertain any such ardent wishes  life had not afforded her so much joy that she should deem it the greatest good and all that she had heard gave her the impression that louis was too soft and gentle for the worlds hard encountermost pure and innocent sincere and loving at present but rather with the qualities of childhood than of manhood with little strength or perseverance so that the very dread of taint or wear made it almost a relief to think of his freshness and sweetness being secured for ever  even when she thought of his father and shrank from such grief for him she could not but see a hope that this affliction might soften the heart closed up by the first and far worse sorrow and detach it from the interests that had absorbed it too exclusively  all this was her food for silent meditation  mary sat reading or working beside her paler perhaps than her wont and betraying that her ear caught every sound on the stairs but venturing no word except the most matteroffact remark quietly giving force to the more favourable symptoms  not till after mr walbys second visit when there was a little respite in the hard lifeanddeath contest between the remedies and the inflammation could mrs frost spare a few moments for her grandson she met him on the stairsthrew her arms round his neck called him her poor jemmy and hastily told him that he must not make her cry  he looked anxiously in her face and told her that he must take her place for she was worn out  no thank you my dear i can rest byandby  it sounded very hopeless  come granny you always take the bright side  who knows which is the bright side she said  such as he are always the first  but there dear jem i told you not to make too much of granny and hastily withdrawing her hand she gave a parting caress to his hair as he stood on the step below her and returned to her charge  it would have been an inexpressible comfort to james to have had some one to reproach  his own wretchedness was like a personal injury and an offence that he could resent would have been a positive relief  he was forced to get out of the way of frampton coming up with a tray of lemonade and glared at him as if even a station on the stairs were denied then dashed out of doors and paced the garden goaded by every association the scene recalled  it seemed a mere barbarity to deprive him of what he now esteemed as the charm of his lifethe cousin who had been as a brother ever seeking his sympathy never offended by his sharp imperious temper and though often slighted or tyrannized over meeting all in his own debonnaire fashion and never forsaking the poor hardworking student so that he might well feel that the world could not offer him aught like louis fitzjocelyn  he stood in the midst of the botanical garden and with almost triumphant satisfaction prognosticated that now there would be regret that louiss schemes had been neglected or sneered at and when too late his father might feel as much sorrow as he had time for  it was the bitterness not the softness of grief in which he looked forth into the dull blue eastwindy haze deepening in the twilight and presently beheld something dark moving along under the orchard bank beneath  hollo whos there he exclaimed and the form rearing itself disclosed young madison never a favourite with him and though as a persecuted protege of louis having claims which at another time might have softened him coming forward at an unlucky moment when his irritation only wanted an object on which to discharge itself  it was plain that one who came skulking in the private grounds could intend no good and james greeted him harshly with youve no business here  im doing no harm said the boy doggedly for his temper was as stubborn as jamess was excitable  no harm lurking here in that fashion in the dark  youll not make me believe that  let me hear what brings you here  the truth mind  i came to hear how lord fitzjocelyn is said tom with brief bluntness and defiance  a likely story  what you came to ask the appletrees and james scornfully laughed  there was no backdoor i suppose  i could forgive you anything but such a barefaced falsehood when you know it was your own intolerable carelessness that was the only cause of the accident  better say twas yourself cried tom hoarse with passion and shaking all over  the provocation was intense enough to bring back jamess real principle and selfrestraint and he spoke with more dignity  you seem to be beside yourself madison he said you had better go at once before any one finds you here  lord fitzjocelyn cared for you so much that i should not wish for you to meet your deserts under present circumstances  go  i wish to have no more of your tongue  the boy was bounding off while james walked slowly after to see him beyond the grounds and finding warren the keeper desired him to be on the lookout  warren replied with the tidings that madison had run away from his place and that the police were looking out for him on the suspicion of having stolen mr calcotts parcel moralizing further on the depravity of such doings when my young lord was so ill but accounting for the whole by pronouncing poaching to be bred in the bone of the marksedge people  this little scene had done jem a great deal of good both by the exhalation of bitterness and by the final exertion of forbearance he had indeed been under two great fallacies on this daysoothing charlotte for the grief that was not caused by fitzjocelyns illness and driving to extremity the lad brimming over with sorrow not inferior to his own  little did he know what a gentle word might have done for that poor wild tempestuous spirit  yet jamess heart smote him that evening when according to louiss earnest wish mr holdsworth came again and they all were admitted to the room and he saw the feeble sign and summons to the vicar to bend down and listen  tell poor madison it was wrong in me not to go to see him  give him one of my books and tell him to go on well  that day had been one of rapid change and the remedies and suffering had so exhausted louis that he could scarcely speak and seemed hardly conscious who was present  all his faculties were absorbed in the one wish which late in the evening was granted  the scene was like an epitome of his lifethe large irregular room cumbered with the disorderly apparatus of all his multifarious pursuits while there he lay on his little narrow iron bed his features so fair and colourless as to be strangely like his mothers marble effigyhis eyes closed and his brows often contracted with pain so that there was a doubt how far his attention was free but still with a calm pure sweetness that settled down more and more as if he were being lulled into a sleep  he is asleep mrs frost said as they all rose up  they felt what that sleep might become  we might as well wish to detain a snowwreath thought mr holdsworth     chapter vii  gossamer    chaos is come againothello   that sleep was not unto death  when james and mary came simultaneously creeping to the door in the grey twilight of the morning they heard that there had been less pain and more rest and gradually throughout the day there was a diminution of the dangerous symptoms till the trembling hope revived that the patient might be given back again to life  james was still sadly aggrieved at being forbidden the sickroom and exceedingly envied lord ormersfields seat there  he declared so that mary doubted whether it were jest or earnest that the earl only remained there because society expected it from their relative positions and that it must retard poor fitzjocelyns recovery to be perpetually basilisked by those cold grey eyes  mary stood up gallantly for the earl who had always been so kind to her and on her mothers authority vouched for his strong though hidden feelings to which jem replied aye he was hiding a strong fear of being too late for the beginning of the session  i do not think it right to impute motives said mary  i would not mary if i could help it said james but through the whole course of my life i have never seen a token that his lordship is worthy of his son  if he were an ordinary practical commonplace block apt to support his dignity he might value him but all the grace peculiarity and conventionality is a mere burthen and vexation utterly wasted  mary knew that she was a commonplace block and did not wonder at herself for not agreeing with james but cherishing a strong conviction that the father and son would now leave off rubbing against each other since no unprejudiced person could doubt of the strong affection of the father nor of the warm gratitude of the son in spite of the asperity with which james spoke of the earl she was beginning to like him almost as much as she esteemed him  this had not been the case in their childhood when he used to be praised by the elders for his obedience to his grandmother and his progress in the northwold grammar school but was terribly overbearing with his juniors and whether he cuffed louis or led him into mischief equally distressed her  grown up he was peculiarly vif quick and ready unselfish in all his ways and warmly affectionatevery agreeable companion where his sensitiveness was not wounded and meriting high honour by his deeper qualities  young as he was he had already relieved his grandmother from his own maintenance he had turned to the utmost account his education at the endowed school at northwold by sheer diligence had obtained first a scholarship and then a fellowship at oxford and now by practising rigid economy and spending his vacations in tuition he was enabled to send his sister to a boardingschool  he had stolen a few days from his pupils on hearing of fitzjocelyns danger but was forced to return as soon as the improvement became confirmed  on the previous day he asked mary to walk with him to the scene of the accident and they discussed the cause with more coolness than they really felt as they shuddered at the depth of the fall and the size of the stones  james declared it all the fault of that runaway scamp young madison in whom louis had always been deceived and who had never been seen since the night of his apparition in the garden  poor boy i suppose that was the reason he ran away said mary  a very good thing too  he would never have been anything but a torment to louis  i remember telling him he was setting the stones so as to break the neck of some one  i think it would be of more use to build them up than to settle how they broke down said mary  do you think we could manage it safely  a capital thought cried james eagerly and no sooner said than done  the two cousins set to workprocured some cement from the bricklayer in the village and toiled at their masonry with right goodwill as long as light and time served them then made an appointment to meet at halfpast six next morning and finish their work  when the rendezvous took place they were rejoicing over mrs frosts report of an excellent night and over her own happy looks from which james prognosticated that all her fatigue and watching had done no harm to her vigorous frame for which gladness was always the best cordial it was a joyous beginning on that spring morning and seemed to add fresh sparkles to the dazzling dewdrops and double merriment to the blackbirds and thrushes answering each other far and wide around as the sun drew up the grey veil of morning mist they all seem holding a feast for his recovery exclaimed mary warming for once into poetry as she trudged along leaving green footmarks in the silver dew  well they may said james for who loves them better than he  i grudge myself this lovely morning when he is lying there and my poor clara is caged up at that placethe two who would the most enjoy it  your going to see her will be as good as the spring morning  poor child  i dread it sighed jem  it was his first voluntary mention of his sister  he had always turned the conversation when mrs ponsonby or mary had tried to inquire for her and mary was glad to lead him on to say more  i remember her last when you were teaching her to run alone and letting none of us touch her because you said she was your child and belonged to no one else  i should not be so ungrateful now that i am come to the sense of my responsibility in teaching her to go alone  but she has aunt catherine said mary thinking that he was putting the natural guardian out of the question as much now as in the days referred to  my grandmother never had to do with any girl before and does not profess to understand them  she let clara be regularly a boy in school at first learning the same lessons and then teaching and whatever i tried to impress in the feminine line naturally all went for nothing  she is as wild as a hare and has not a particle of a girl about her  but she is very young  there it is again  she grows so outrageously  she is not sixteen and there she is taller than granny already  it is getting quite absurd  what advice do you want on that head  seriously it is a disadvantage especially to that sort of girl who cant afford to look like a woman before her time  well as she must probably depend on herself i looked out for as good a school as could be had for the means and thought i had succeeded and that she would be brought into some sort of shape  granny was ready to break her heart but thought it quite right  then does it not answer  that is just what i cant tell  you have been used to schools i wish you could tell me whether it is a necessary evil or claras own idiosyncrasy or peculiar to the place  whether what is  her misery  misery  why there is nothing of that in her letters to my aunt there is not a complaint  she is a brave girl who spares granny when she knows it would be of no use to distress her  judge now theres the sort of letter that i get from her  mary read   dearest jemmywrite to me as quick as ever you can and tell me how louis is and let me come home or i shall run mad  it is no good telling me to command my feelings i am sure i would if i could for the girls are more detestable than ever but what can one do when one cannot sleep nor eat  all the screaming and crying has got into one bump in my throat because i cant get it out in peace  if i could only shy the inkstand at the english teachers head or get one moment alone and out of sight  let me come home  i could at least run messages and it is of no use for me to stay here for i cant learn and all the girls are looking at me  if they were but boys they would have sense or if i could but kick them  this will make you angry but do forgive me i cant help it for i am so very unhappy  louis is as much to me as you are and no one ever was so kind but i know he will get welli know he will only if i knew the pain was better and could but hear every minute  you need not come to fetch me only send me a telegraph and one to miss brigham  i have money enough for a secondclass ticket and would come that instant  if you saw the eyes and heard the whispers of these girls i am sure you would  i should laugh at such nonsense any other time but now i only ask to be wretched quietly in a corner                your affectionate nearly crazy sister                                        clara frost dynevor   mary might well say that there was nothing more expedient than going to see clara and much said poor james he should gain by that especially on the head that made him most uneasy and on which he could only hint lightlynamely whether the girls were putting nonsense in her head  if they had done her any harm she would never have written such a letter said mary  true said jem  she is a mere child and never got that notion into her head for a moment but if they put it in we are done for or if the place were ever so bad i cant remove her now when granny is thus occupied  one reason why i made a point of her going to school was that i thought doing everything that fitzjocelyn did was no preparation for being a governess  oh i hope it will not come to that  mr oliver dynevor talks of coming home in a very few years  so few that we shall be grey before he comes  no clara and i are not going to be bound to him for the wealth heaped up while my grandmother was left in poverty  we mean to be independent  mary was glad to revert to clara  i must do the best i can for her for the present said jemtry to harden her against the girls and leave her to bear it  poor dear it makes ones heart ache  and to have done it oneself too then in the holidays perhaps you will help me to judge  you will be her friend mary theres nothing she needs so much  i thought she would have found one at school but they are not the right stamp of animal  she has been too much thrown on louis and though he has made a noble thing of her that must come to an end and the sooner the better  certainly it was a perplexity for a young elder brother but there could not but remain some simple wonder in marys mind whether the obvious person mrs frost had not better have been left to decide for her granddaughter  the building operations gave full occupation to the powers of the two cousins and in good time before breakfast all was successfully completeda handrail affixed and the passage cleared out till it looked so creditable as well as solid that there was no more to wish for but that louis should be able to see their handiwork  james went away in the better spirits for having been allowed to shake louis by the hand and exchange a few words with him  mary augured that it would be the better for clara and for the pupils  all that further transpired from him was a cheerful letter to mrs frost speaking of clara as perfectly well and beginning to accommodate herself to her situation and from this mary gathered that he was better satisfied  the days brought gradual improvement to the patient under mrs frosts tender nursing and his fathers constant assiduity both of which as he revived seemed to afford him the greatest pleasure and were requited with the utmost warmth and caressing sweetness towards his aunt and towards his father with everfresh gratitude and delight lord ormersfield was like another man in the sickroom whence he never willingly absented himself for an hour  one day however when he was forced to go to northwold on business louis put on a fit of coaxing importunity  nothing would serve him but some of jane becketts choice dried pears in the corner of the oaken cupboard the key of which was in aunt kittys pocket and no one must fetch them for him but aunt kitty herself he was so absurdly earnest and grave about them that jane scolded him and mrs frost saw recovery in his arch eyes understanding all the time that it was all an excuse for complimenting jane and sending her to air herself visit the faithfull sisters and inspect the lady of eschalott  so she consented to accompany lord ormersfield and leave their charge to mrs ponsonby who found louis quite elated at the success of his manoeuvreso much disposed to talk and so solicitous for the good of his nurses that she ventured on a bold stroke  his chamber was nearly as much like a lumberroom as ever for any attempt to clear away or disturb his possessions had seemed in his halfconscious condition to excite and tease him so much that it had been at once relinquished  although the room was large it was always too much crowded with his goods and the tables and chairs that had been brought in during his illness had added to the accumulation which was the despair of mrs beckett and mr frampton mrs ponsonby thought it was time for louis to make a sacrifice in his turn and ventured to suggest that he was well enough to say where some of his things might be bestowed and though he winced she persevered in representing how unpleasant it must be to his father to live in the midst of so much confusion  the debonnaire expression passed over his face as he glanced around saying you are right i never reflected on the stretch of kindness it must have been  it shall be done  if i lose everything it will not be soon that i find it out  it evidently cost him a good deal and mrs ponsonby proposed that mary should come and deal with his treasures a plan at which he caught so eagerly that it was decided that no time was like the present and mary was called  he could move nothing but his hands but they were eagerly held out in welcome and his eyes glittered with the bright smile that once she had feared never to see again she felt a moisture in her own which made her glad to turn aside to her task even while he complimented her with an allusion to the labours of hercules  it did not seem uncalledfor when she began by raising a huge sheet of paper that had been thrown in desperation to veil the confusion upon the table and which proved to be the ordnance map of the county embellished with numerous streaks of paint  the outlines of the old saxon wappentakes said louis i was trying to make them out in blue and the roman roads in red that mark is spontaneous it has been against some paint  which paint was found in dried swamps in saucers while cakes of lake and prussian blue adhered to the drawingboard  the colourbox is probably in the walnutpress but i advise you not to irritate that yet  let me see that drawing the design for the cottages that frampton nipped in the bud  how pretty and comfortable they do look exclaimed mary pleased to come to something that was within her sphere of comprehension if they were but finished  ah  i thought of them when i was lying there in the dell   had they been allowed to stand where i wanted them there would have been no lack of people going home from work but quite impracticable came in my way and i had no heart to finish the drawing  what a pity exclaimed mary  this was richardsons veto two degrees worse than framptons and i shall never be able to abuse frampton again  i have seen him in his true light now and never was any one more kind and considerate  ha mary whats that  it looks like a rainbow in convulsions  now mary did not i tell you that i could not laugh  it is a diagram to illustrate the theory of light for clara  does she understand that cried mary  clara  she understands anything but going to schoolpoor child yes burn that map of the stratanot thatit is to be a painted window whenever i can afford one but i never could make money stay with me i never could think why  the why was evident enough in the heterogeneous masscrumpled prints blank drawingpaper and maps heaped ruinously over and under books stuffed birds geological specimens dislocated microscopes pieces of roman pavement curiosities innumerable and indescribable among which roamed blottingbooks memorandumbooks four pieces of indian rubber three pair of compasses seven paperknives ten knives thirteen odd gloves fifteen pencils pens beyond reckoning a purse a key half a poem on the siege of granada three parts of an essay upon spade husbandry the dramatis personae of a tragedy on queen brunehault scores of old letters and the dust of three years and a half  louis owned that the arrangements conduced to finding rather than losing and rejoiced at the disinterment of his longlost treasures but either he grew weary or the many fragments the ghosts of departed fancies made him thoughtful for he became silent and only watched and smiled as mary quietly and noiselessly completed her reforms and arranged table and chairs for the comfort of his father and aunt  he thanked her warmly and hoped that she would pursue her kind task another daya permission which she justly esteemed a great testimony to her having avoided annoying him  it was a great amusement to him to watch the surprised and pleased looks of his various nurses as each came in and a real gratification to see his father settle himself with an air of comfort observing that they were under great obligations to mary  still the sight of the arrangements had left a dreary dissatisfied feeling with louis it might have been caught from marys involuntary look of disappointment at each incomplete commencement that she encounteredthe multitude of undertakings hastily begun laid aside and neglectednothing properly carried out  it seemed a mere waste of life and dwelt on his spirits with a weariness of himself and his own want of steadfastnessa sense of having disappointed her and disappointed himself and he sighed so heavily several times that his aunt anxiously asked whether he were in pain  he was however so much better that no one was to sit up with him at nightonly his father would sleep on a bed on the floor  as he bade him good night louis for the first time made the request that he might have his bible given to him as well as his little book and on his father advising him not to attempt the effort of reading he said thank you i think i can read my two verses i want to take up my old habits  have you really kept up this habit constantly asked his father with wonder that louis did not understand  aunt catharine taught it to us he said  i neglected it one halfyear at school but i grew so uncomfortable that i began again  the earl gave the little worn volume saying yes louis there has been a thread running through your life  has there been one thread sadly mused louis as he found the weight of the thick book too much for his weak hands and his eyes and head too dizzy and confused for more than one verse       i am come that they might have life       and that they might have it more abundantly  the bible sank in his hands and he fell into a slumber so sound and refreshing that when he opened his eyes in early morning he did not at first realize that he was not awakening to health and activity nor why he had an instinctive dread of moving  he turned his eyes towards the window uncurtained so that he could see the breaking dawn  the sky deep blue above faded and glowed towards the horizon into gold redder and more radiant below and in the midst fast becoming merged in the increasing light shone the planet venus in her pale calm brilliance  there was repose and delight in dwelling on that fair morning sky and louis lay dreamily gazing while thoughts passed over his mind more defined and connected than pain and weakness had as yet permitted since those hours in which he had roused his faculties to meet with approaching death he had been seldom awake to aught but the sensations of the moment and had only just become either strong enough or sufficiently at leisure for anything like reflection  as he watched the eastern reddening he could not but revert to the feelings with which he had believed himself at the gate of the city that needs neither sun nor moon to lighten it and for the first time he consciously realized that he was restored to this world of life  the sensation was not unmixed  his youthful spirit bounded at the prospect of returning vigour his warm heart clung round those whom he loved and the perception of his numerous faults made him grateful for a longer probation but still he had a sense of having been at the borders of the glorious land and thence turned back to a tedious doubtful pilgrimage  there was much to occasion this state of mind  his life had been without great troubles but with many mortifications he had never been long satisfied with himself or his pursuits his ardour had only been the prelude to vexation and selfabasement and in his station in the world there was little incentive to exertion  he had a strong sense of responsibility with a temperament made up of tenderness refinement and inertness such as shrank from the career set before him  he had seen just enough of political life to destroy any romance of patriotism and to make him regard it as little more than party spirit and dread the hardening and deadening process on the mind  he had a dismal experience of his own philanthropy and he had a conscience that would not sit down satisfied with selfish ease pleasure or intellectual pursuits  his smooth bright loving temper had made him happy but the past was all melancholy neglect and futile enterprise he had no attaching homeno future visions and on the outskirts of manhood he shrank back from the turmoil the temptations and the roughness that awaited himnay from the mere effort of perseverance and could almost have sighed to think how nearly the deathpang had been over and the home of love life and light had been won for ever       i am come that they might have life       and that they might have it more abundantly  the words returned on him and with them what his father had said you have had a thread running through your life  he was in a state between sleeping and waking when the confines of reflection and dreaming came very near together and when vague impressions hardly noticed at the time they were made began to tell on him without his own conscious volition  it was to him as if from that brightening eastern heaven multitudes of threads of light were floating hither and thither as he had often watched the gossamer undulating in the sunshine  some were firm purely white and glistening here and there with rainbow tints as they tended straight upwards shining more and more into the perfect day but for the most part they were tangled together in inextricable confusion intermingled with many a broken end like fleeces of cobweb driven together by the autumn windsome sailing aimlessly or with shattered tangled strandssome white some dark some anchored to mere leaves or sprays some tending down to the abyss but all in such a perplexed maze that the eye could seldom trace which were directed up which downwards which were of pure texture which defiled and stained  in the abortive unsatisfactory attempt to follow out one fluctuating clue not without whiteness and heaving often upwards but frail wavering ravelled and tangled so that scarcely could he find one line that held together louis awoke to find his father wondering that he could sleep with the sun shining full on his face  it was hardly quite a dream said louis as he related it to mrs frost  it would make a very pretty allegory  it is too real for that just now he said  it was the moral of all my broken strands that mary held up to me yesterday  i hope you are going to do more than point your moral my dear  you always were good at that  i mean it said louis earnestly  i do not believe such an illnessay or such a dreamcan come for nothing  so back went his thoughts to the flaws in his own course and chiefly he bewailed his want of sympathy for his father  material obedience and submission had been yielded but having little cause to believe himself beloved his heart had never been called into action so as to soften the clashings of two essentially dissimilar characters instead of rebelling or even of murmuring he had hid disappointment in indifference taken refuge in levity and versatility and even consoled himself by sporting with what he regarded as prejudice or unjust displeasure  all this cost him much regret and selfreproach at each proof of the affection so long veiled by reserve  never would he have given pain had he guessed that his father could feel but he had grown up to imagine the whole man made up of politics and conventionalities and his new discoveries gave him at least as much contrition as pleasure  after long study of the debates that morning his father prepared to write  louis asked for the paper saying his senses would just serve for the advertisements but presently he made an exclamation of surprise at beholding in full progress the measure which had brought sir miles oakstead to ormersfield one of peculiar interest to the earl  his blank look of wonder amused mrs ponsonby but seemed somewhat to hurt his father  you did not suppose i could attend to such matters now he said  but i am so much better  fearing that the habit of reserve would check any exchange of feeling mrs ponsonby said did you fancy your father could not think of you except upon compulsion  i beg your pardon father said louis smiling while a tear rose to his eyes i little thought i was obstructing the business of the nation  what will sir miles do to me  sir miles has written a most kind and gratifying letter said lord ormersfield expressing great anxiety for you and a high opinion of your powers  louis had never heard of his own powers except for mischief and the colour returned to his cheeks as he listened to the kind and cordial letter written in the first shock of the tidings of the accident he enjoyed the pleasure it gave his father far more than the commendation to himself for he well knew as he said that there is something embellishing in a catastrophe and he supposed that had driven out the rosecoloured pastor  there is always indulgence at your age said the earl  you have created an impression which may be of great importance to you byandby  louis recurred to politics  the measure was one which approved itself to his mind and he showed all the interest which was usually stifled by such subjects being forced on him  he was distressed at detaining his father when his presence might be essential to the success of his party and the earl could not bear to leave him while still confined to his bed  the little scene so calm and apparently so cold seemed to cement the attachment of father and son by convincing louis of the full extent of his fathers love and his enthusiasm began to invest the earls grey head with a perfect halo of wisdom slighted and affection injured and the tenor of his thread of life shone out bright and silvery before him spun out of projects of devoting heart and soul to his fathers happiness and meriting his fondness  the grave earl was looking through a magnifyingglass no less powerful he had not been so happy since his marriage the consciousness of his own cold manner made him grateful for any demonstration from his son and the many little graces of look and manner which louis had inherited from his mother added to the charm the sense of previous injustice enhanced all his good qualities and it was easy to believe him perfect while nothing was required of him but to lie still  day and night did lord ormersfield wait upon him grudging every moment spent away from him and trying to forestall each wish till he became almost afraid to express a desire on account of the trouble it would cause mary found the earl one day wandering among the vines in the old hothouse in search of a flower when to her amusement he selected a stiff pert double hyacinth the special aversion of his son who nevertheless received it most graciously and would fain have concealed the headache caused by the scent until mrs frost privately abstracted it  another day he went unasked to hasten the birdstuffer in finishing the rosecoloured pastor and when it came himself brought it upstairs unpacked it and set it up where louis could best admire its black nodding crest and pink wings unaware that to his son it seemed a memento of his own misdeedsa perpetual lesson against wayward carelessness  it is like a new love said mrs ponsonby but oh how much depends upon louis after his recovery  you dont mistrust his goodness now mamma  i could not bear to do so  i believe i was thinking of his father more than of himself  after having been so much struck by his religious feeling i dread nothing so much as his father finding him deficient in manliness or strength of character     chapter viii  a truant disposition    gathering up each broken thread                              whytehead   tom madison is come back said the vicar as he sat beside fitzjocelyns couch a day or two after lord ormersfield had gone to london  come backwhere has he been exclaimed louis  there said the vicar with a gesture of dismay i forgot that you were to hear nothing of it  however i should think you were well enough to support the communication  what is it cried louis the blood rushing into his cheeks so suddenly that mr holdsworth felt guilty of having disregarded the precautions that he had fancied exaggerated by the fond aunt  poor fellowhe has not but checking himself he added i am particularly anxious to hear of him  i wish there were anything more gratifying to tell you but he took the opportunity of the height of your illness to run away from his place and has just been passed home to his parish  after all your pains it is very mortifying but  pains  dont you know how i neglected him latterly said louis poor fellowthen but he stopped himself again and added you heard nothing of the grounds  they were not difficult to find said mr holdsworth  it is the old story  he was as mrs smith told me a great trialmore and more disposed to be saucy and disobedient taking up with the most goodfornothing boys in the town haunting those chartist lectures and never coming home in proper time at night  the very last evening he had come in at eleven oclock and when his master rebuked him came out with something about the rights of man  he was sent to little northwold about the middle of the day to carry home some silverhandled knives of mr calcotts and returned no more smith fancied at first that he had made off with the plate and set the police after him but that proved to be an overhasty measure for the parcel had been safely left  however miss faithfulls servant found him frightening mrs frosts poor little kitchenmaid into fits and the next day james frost detected him lurking suspiciously about the garden here and set warren to warn him off  louis gave a kind of groan and struck his hand against the couch in despair then said anxiously what then  no more was heard of him till yesterday the police passed him home to the union as a vagabond  he looks very ill and ragged but he is in one of those sullen moods when no one can get a word out of him smith declines prosecuting for running away being only too glad of the riddance on any terms so there he is at his grandfathers ready for any sort of mischief  mr holdsworth said louis raising himself on his elbow you are judging like every one else from appearances  if i were at liberty to tell the whole you would see what a noble nature it was that i trifled with and they have been houndingpoor tom would it have been better for him that i had never seen him  it is a fearful thing this blind treading about among souls not knowing whether one does good or harm  if you feel so said mr holdsworth hoping to lead him from the unfortunate subject what must we do  my position if i live seems to have as much power for evil without the supernatural power for good  doing hastily or leaving undone are equally fatal  nay what hope can there be but in fear and sense of responsibility  i think not  i do more mischief than those who do not go out of their way to think of the matter at all  do you said the vicar smiling  at least i know for my own part i prefer all the trouble and perplexity you give me to a squire who would let me and my parish jog on our own way  i dare say young brewster never spoilt a tom madison  the sight of self indulgence spoils more than injudicious care does besides i look on these experiments as giving experience  nice experience of my best efforts  pardon me fitzjocelyn have we seen your best  i hope you will said louis vigorously  and to begin will you tell this poor boy to come to me  mr holdsworth had an unmitigated sense of his own indiscretion and not such a high one of fitzjocelyns discretion as to make him think the interview sufficiently desirable for the culprit to justify the possible mischief to the adviser whose wisdom and folly were equally perplexing and who would surely be either disappointed or deceived dissuasions and arguments however failed and mrs frost who was appealed to as a last resource no sooner found that her patients heart was set on the meeting than she consented and persuaded mr holdsworth that no harm would ensue equal to the evil of her boy lying there distressing himself  accordingly in due time mr holdsworth admitted the lad and on a sign from louis shut himself out leaving the runaway standing within the door a monument of surly embarrassment  raising himself louis said affectionately never mind tom dont you see how fast i am getting over it  the lad looked up but apparently saw little such assurance in the thin pale cheeks and feeble recumbent form for his face twitched all over resumed the same sullen stolidity and was bent down again  come near tom continued louis with unabated kindnesscome and sit down here  i am afraid you have suffered a great deal as the boy shambled with an awkward footsore gait  it was a great pity you ran away  i couldnt stay burst out tom half crying  why not  not to have that there cast in my teeth he exclaimed with blunt incivility  did any one reproach you said louis anxiously  i thought no one knew it but ourselves  you knew it then my lord asked tom staring  i found out directly that there was no cement said louis  i had suspected it before and intended to examine whenever i had time  well  i thought when i came back no one did seem to guess as twas all along of me cried tom  so sure i thought you hadnt known it my lord  and you never said nothing my lord  i trust not  i would not consciously have accused you of what was quite as much my fault as yours  that would not have been fair play  if i wont give it to bill bettesworth cried tom  what has he done  always telling me that gentlefolks hadnt got no notion of fair play with the like of us but held us like the dirt to be trampled on but thereill let him know  who is he  a young man what works with mr smith returned tom his sullenness having given place to a frank open manner such as any one but louis would have deemed too free and ready  was he your great friend at northwold  a chap must speak to some one was toms answer  and what kind of a some one was he  why he comes down illershall way  he knows a thing or two and can go on like an orator or a playbookor like yourself my lord  thank you  i hope the thing or two were of the right sort  tom looked sheepish  i heard something about bad companions  i hope he was not one  i ought to have come and visited you tom i have been very sorry i did not  youd better let me hear all about it for i fear there must have been worse scrapes than this of the stones  worse cried tomsure nothing could be worserer  i wish there were no evils worse than careless forgetfulness said louis  i didnt forget said tom  i meant to have told you whenever you came to see me buthis eyes filled and his voice began to alteryou never came and she at the terrace wouldnt look at me and bill and the rest of them was always at me asking when i expected my aristocrat and jeering me cause id said you wasnt like the rest of em  so then i thought id have my liberty too and show i didnt care no more than they and spite you all  how little one thinks of the grievous harm a little selfish heedlessness may do sighed louis half aloud  if you had only looked to something better than me tom  and so you ran into mischief  half confession half vindication ensued and the poor fellows story was manifest enough  his faults had been unsteadiness and misplaced independence rather than any of the more degrading stamp of evils the publichouse had not been sought for liquors sake but for that of the orator who inflamed the crude imaginations and aspirations that effervesced in the youths mind and the rudelyexercised authority of master and foreman had only driven his fierce temper further astray with sense of right sufficient to be dissatisfied with himself and taste and principle just enough developed to loathe the evils round him hardened and soured by louiss neglect and rendered discontented by chartist preachers he had come to long for any sort of change or break and the tidings of the accident coupled with the hard words which he knew himself to deserve but too well had put the finishing stroke  hearing that the police were in pursuit of him he had fancied it was on account of the harm done by his negligence  i hid about for a day he said somehow i felt as if i could not go far off till i heard how you were my lord and id made up my mind that as soon as ever i heard the first stroke of the bell id go and find the police and his lordship might hang me and glad  louis was nearer a tear than a smile  then mr frost finds me and was mad at me  nothing wasnt bad enough for me and he sets mr warren to see me off so i had nothing for it but to cut  what did you think of doing sighed louis  i made for the sea  if i could have got to them places in the indies such as that philip went to as you reads about in the versebookhe as killed his wife and lost his son and made friends with that there big rascal and had the chest of gold  philip mortham  were you going in search of buccaneers  i dont know my lord  once you told me of some english sir as kills the pirates and is some sort of a king  i thought may be now youd tell me where they goes to dig for gold  oh tom tom what a mess i have made of your notions  isnt there no such place  its a bad business and what can you want of it  i want to get shut of them as orders one about here and there with never a civil word  besides looking down theres one id like to see live like a lady  would that make her happier  ill never see her put about and slave and drudge as poor mother did exclaimed tom  thats a better spirit than the mere dislike to a master said louis what is life but obedience  id obey fast enough if folk would only speak like you donot drive one about like a dog when one knows one is every bit as good as they  im sure i never knew that  tom stared broadly  i never saw the person who was not my superior repeated louis quietly and in full earnest  not that this would make rough words pleasanter i suppose  the only cure i could ever see for the ills of the world is that each should heartily respect his neighbour  paradoxes musingly uttered and flying over his head wore to tom a natural and comfortable atmosphere and the conversation proceeded louis found that geography had been as much at fault as chronology and that the runaway had found himself not at the sea but at illershall where he had applied for work and had taken a great fancy to mr dobbs but had been rejected for want of a character since the good superintendent made it his rule to keep up a high standard among his men  wandering had succeeded in which moneyless forlorn and unable to find employment he had been obliged to part with portions of his clothing to procure food his strength began to give way and he had been found by the police sleeping under a hedge he was questioned and sent home crestfallen sullen and miserable unwilling to stay at marksedge yet not knowing where to go  his hankering was for illershall and louis thinking of the judicious care the evening school and the openings for promotion decided at once that the experiment should be tried without loss of time  he desired tom to bring him ink and paper and hastily wrote   dear mr dobbsyou would do me a great kindness by employing this poor fellow and bearing with him  i have managed him very ill but he would reward any care  have an eye to him and put him in communication with the chaplain  if you can take him i will write more at length  if you have heard of my accident you will excuse more at present                              yours very truly                                    fitzjocelyn   then arose the question how tom was to get to illershall  he did not know and louis directed his search into the places where the loose money in his pocket might have been put  when it was found tom scrupled at the proposed halfsovereign  threeandfourpence would pay for his ticket  you will want a supper and a bed  go respectably tom and keep so it will be some consolation for the mischief i have done you  you done me harm cried tom  why tis all along of you that i aint a regularlybuilt scamp  very irregularly built whatever you are said louis  but ill tell you what you shall do for me continued he with anxious earnestness do you know the hollow ashtree that shades over inglewood stile  it has a stout sucker with a honeysuckle grown into itcoming up among the moss where the great white vaseshaped funguses grew up in the autumn  i know him my lord said tom brightening at the detail given with all a sick mans vivid remembrance of the outofdoors world  i have fixed my mind on that stick  i think it has a bend at the root  will you cut it for me and trim it up for a walkingstick  that i will my lord  thank you  bring it up to me between seven and eight in the morning if you please and so i shall see you again  mr holdsworth was already entering to close the conversation which had been already overlong and exciting for louis sinking back mournfully exclaimed the medley of that poor boys mind is the worst of my pieces of work  i have made him too refined for one class and left him too rough for anotherdiscontented with his station and too desultory and insubordinate to rise nobleness of nature turning to arrogance fact and fiction all mixed up together it would be a study if one was not so sorry  nevertheless mr holdsworth could not understand how even fitzjocelyn could have given the lad a recommendation and he would have remonstrated but that the long interview had already been sufficiently trying so he did his best to have faith in his eccentric friends good intentions  in the early morning tom madison made his appearance in his best clothes erect and openfaced a strong contrast to the jaded downcast being who had yesterday presented himself  the stick was prepared to perfection and louis acknowledged it with gratitude proportioned to the fancies that he had spent on it poising it feeling the cool grey bark and raising himself in bed to try how he should lean on it hang it up there tom within my reach  it seems like a beginning of independence  i wish my lord blurted out tom in agitation youd tell me if youre to go lame for life and then i should know the worst of it  i suspect no one knows either the worst or the best said louis kindly  since the pain has gone off i have been content and asked no questions  mr walby says my ankle is going on so well that it is a real picture and a pleasure to touch it and though i cant say the pleasure is mutual i ought to be satisfied  youll only laugh at me half sobbed tom and if there was but anything i could do  ive wished my own legs was cut offand serve me rightever since i seen you lying there  thank you im afraid they would have been no use to me  but seriously if i had been moderately prudent it would not have happened  and as it is i hope i shall be glad of that roll in ferny dell to the end of my life  i did go to see after mending them stones cried tom as if injured by losing this one compensation but they are all done up and there aint nothing to do to them  look here tom if you want to do anything for me it is easily told what would be the greatest boon to me  they tell me ive spoilt you and i partly believe it for i put more of my own fancies into you than of real good and the way i treated you made you impatient of control and then because i could not keep you on as i should have wishedas unluckily you and i were not made to live together on a desert islandi left you without the little help i might have given  now tom if you go to the bad i shall know it is all my fault  that it aint the boy tried to say eagerly but louis went on  dont let my bad management be the ruin of you  take a turn from this moment  you know who can help you and who if you had thought of him would have kept you straight when i forgot  put all the stuff out of your head about one man being equal to another  equal they are but some have the trial of ruling others of obeying and the last are the lucky ones  if we could only see their souls we should know it youll find evening schools and lectures at illershall youd better take to them for youve more real liking for that sort of thing than for mischief and if you finished up your education youd get into a line that would make you happier and where you might do much good therepromise me that youll think of these things and take heed to your sundays  i promise said tom  and mind you write to me tom and tell how you get on  ill write and let you know about your grandfather and marksedge news and all  the thank you my lord came with great pleasure and alacrity  some day when you are a foreman perhaps i may bring miss clara to see coppersmelting  only mind that youll never go on soundly nor even be fit to make your pretty tidy nest for any gentle bird unless you mind one thing most of all and that is that we have had a new life given us and we have to begin now and live it for ever and ever  as he raised himself holding out his pale slender hand from his white sleeve his clear blue eyes earnestly fixed on the sky his face all one onward look something of that sense of the unseen passed into the confused turbulent spirit of the boy very susceptible of poetical impressions and his young lords countenance connected itself with all the floating notions left in his mind by parable or allegory  he did not speak as louis heartily shook his hardy red hand and bade him good speed but his bow and pulled forelock at the door had in them more of real reverence than of conventional courtesy  of tastes and perceptions above his breeding the very sense of his own deficiencies had made him still more rugged and clownish and removed him from the sympathies of his own class while he almost idolized the two most refined beings whom he knew lord fitzjocelyn and charlotte arnold  on an interview with her his heart was set he had taken leave of his halfchildish grandfather made up his bundle and marched into northwold with three hours still to spare ere the starting of the parliamentary train  sympathy hope resolution and the sense of respectability had made another man of him and above all he dwelt on the prospect held out of repairing the deficiencies of his learning the consciousness of ignorance and awkwardness was very painful and he longed to rub it off and take the place for which he felt his powers i will work thought he i have a will to it and please god when i come back next it wont be as a rough ignorant lout that ill stand before charlotte    louis said mary ponsonby as she sat at work beside him that afternoon after an expedition to the new house at dynevor terrace i want to know if you please how you have been acting like a gentleman  i did not know that i had been acting at all of late  i could not help hearing something in aunt catharines garden that has made me very curious  ha cried louis eagerly  i was sowing some annuals in our back garden and heard voices through the trellis  presently i heard quite loud my young lord has behaved like a real gentleman as he is and no mistake or id never have been here now  and presently ive promised him and i promise you charlotte to keep my church and have no more to do with them things ill keep it as sacred as they keeps the temperance pledge for sure im bound to him as he forgave me and kept my secret as if id been his own brother and when ive proved it wont that satisfy you charlotte  and what did charlotte say  i think she was crying but i thought listening any more would be unfair so i ran upstairs and threw up the drawingroom window to warn them  oh mary how unfeeling  i thought it could be doing no good  that is so like prudent people who can allow no true love under five hundred pounds a year  did you see them  how did they look  charlotte was standing in an attitude her hands clasped over her broom  the gentleman was a countrylooking boy  bearing himself like a sensible pugnacious cockrobin  poor fellow so you marred their parting  charlotte flew into the house and the boy walked off up the garden was he your madison louis for i thought my aunt did not think it right to encourage him about her house  and so he is to be thwarted in what would best raise and refine him that great bright leading star of a wellplaced affection is not to be allowed to help him through all the storms and quicksands in his way  good mary might well open her eyes but pondering a little she said he need not leave off liking charlotte if that is to do him good but i suppose the question is what is safest for her  well he is safe enough  he is gone to illershall to earn her  oh then i dont care  but you have not answered me and i think i can guess the boys secret that you have been keeping  did you not once tell me that you trusted those stones in ferny dell to him  now mary you must keep his secret  but why was it made one  did you think it unkind to say that it was his fault  of course i did  when i thought it was all over with me i could not go and charge the poor fellow with it so as to make him a marked man i was only afraid that thinking so often of stopping myself i should bring it out by mistake  mary looked down and thought then raised her eyes suddenly and said as if surprised that was really very noble in you louis then thinking on she said but how few people would think it worth while  yes said louis but i had a real regard for this poor fellow and an instinct perhaps perverse of shielding him so i could not accuse him on my own account  besides i believe i am far more guilty towards him  his neglect only hurt my anklemy neglect left him to fall into temptation  yet by the way he talks of you  yes he has the sort of generous disposition on which a little delicacy makes a thousand times more impression than a whole pile of benefits i hope and trust that he is going to repair all that is past i wish i could make out whether good intentions overrule errors in detail or only make them more fatal  mary was glad to reason out the question  abstract practical views interested her and she had much depth and observation more original than if she had read more and thought less  of course no conclusion was arrived at but the two cousins had an argument of much enjoyment and some advantage to both  affairs glided on quietly till the saturday when lord ormersfield returned  never had he so truly known what it was to come home as when he mounted the stairs with steps unlike his usual measured tread and beheld his sons look of animated welcome and eager outstretched hands  i was afraid said the earl presently that you had not felt so well and he touched his own upper lip to indicate that the same feature in his son was covered with down like a young bird  louis blushed a little but spoke indifferently  i thought it a pity not to leave it for the regulation moustache for the yeomanry  i wish i could think you likely to be fit to go out with the yeomanry  every effort must be made cried louis  what do they say in london about the invasion  it was the year 1847 when a french invasion was in every ones mouth and sydney calcott had been retailing all sorts of facts about warsteamers and artillery in a visit to fitzjocelyn whose patriotism had forthwith run mad so that he looked quite baffled when his father coolly set the whole down as the regular ten years panic  there was a fervid glow within him of awe courage and enterprise the outward symbol of which was that infant yellow moustache  he was obliged however to allow the subject to be dismissed while his father told him of sir miles oaksteads kind inquiries and gave a message of greeting from his aunt lady conway delivering himself of it as an unpleasant duty and adding as he turned to mrs ponsonby she desired to be remembered to you mary  i have not seen her for many years  is sir walter alive  no he died about three years ago  i suppose her daughters are not come out yet  her own are in the schoolroom but there is a stepdaughter who is much admired  those cousins of mine exclaimed louis it is strange that i have never seen them  i think i had better employ some of my spare time this summer in making their acquaintance  mrs ponsonby perceived that the earl had become inspired with a deadly terror of the handsome stepdaughter for he turned aside and began to unpack a parcel  it was mcullochs natural theology into which louis had once dipped at mr calcotts and had expressed a wish to read it his father had taken some pains to procure this tooscarce book for him and he seized on it with delighted and surprised gratitude plunging at once into the middle and reading aloud a most eloquent passage upon electricity  no beauty however could atone to lord ormersfield for the outrage upon method  if you would oblige me louis he said you would read that book consecutively  to oblige you certainly said louis smiling and turning to the first page but his vivacious eagerness was extinguished  mculloch is not an author to be thoroughly read without a strong effort  his gems are of the purest ray but they lie embedded in a hard crust of reasoning and disquisition and on the first morning louis barely strong enough yet for a battle with his own volatility looked and owned himself dead beat by the first chapter  mary took pity on him  she had been much interested by his account of the work and would be delighted if he would read it with her he brightened at once and the regular habit began greatly to their mutual enjoyment  mary liked the argument louis liked explaining it and the flood of allusions was delightful to both with his richness of illustration and marys actual experience of ocean and mountains  she brought him whatever books he wanted and from the benevolent view of entertaining him while a prisoner came to be more interested than her mother had ever expected to see her in anything literary  it was amusing to see the two cousins unconsciously educating each otherthe one learning expansion the other concentration of mind  mary could now thoroughly trust louiss goodness and therefore began by bearing with his vagaries and gradually tracing the grain of wisdom that was usually at their root and her eyes were opened to new worlds where all was not evil or uninteresting that aunt melicent distrusted  louis made her teach him spanish and his insight into grammar and keen delight in the majestic language and rich literature infected her while he was amused by her positive distaste to anything incomplete and playfully though half murmuringly submitted to his good governess and let her keep him in excellent order  she knew where all his property was and in her quaint straightforward way would refuse to give him whatever was not good for him  it was all to oblige mary that when he could sit up and use pen and pencil he set to work to finish his cottage plans and soon drew and talked himself into a vehement condition about marksedge  marys patronage drew on the work even to hasty learning of perspective enough for a pretty elevation intelligible to the unlearned and a hopeless calculation of the expense  the plans lay on the table when next his father came home and their interest was explained  did you draw all these yourself exclaimed the earl  where did you learn architectural drawing  i should have thought them done by a professional hand  it is easy enough to get it up from books said louis and mary kept me to the point in case you should be willing to consider the matter i would have written out the estimate but this book allows for bricks and we could use the stone at inglewood more cheaply to say nothing of beauty  well said lord ormersfield considering you have every right to have a voice in the management of the property  i should like to hear your views with regard to these cottages  colouring deeply and with earnest thanks fitzjocelyn stated the injury both to labourers and employers caused by their distance from their work he explained where he thought the buildings ought to stand and was even guarded enough to show that the rents would justify the outlay  he had considered the matter so much that he could even have encountered richardson and his father was only afraid that what was so plausible must be insecure  caution contended with a real desire to gratify his son and to find him in the right  he must know the wishes of the farmer be sure of the cost and be certain of the spot intended  his crippled means had estranged him from duties that he could not fulfil according to his wishes and though not a hard landlord he had no intercourse with his tenants took little interest in his estate and was such a stranger to the localities that louis could not make him understand the nook selected for the buildings  he had seen the arable field called great courtiers and the farm called small profits on the map but did not know their ups and downs much better than the coast of china  mary knows them said louis  she made all my measurements there before i planned the gardens  mary seems to be a good friend to your designs said the earl looking kindly at her  the best said louis  i begin to have some hope of my doings when i see her take them in hand  lord ormersfield thanked mary and asked whether it would be trespassing too much on her kindness to ask her to show him the place in question  she was delighted and they set out at once the earl almost overpowering her by his exceeding graciousness so that she was nearly ready to laugh when he complimented her on knowing her way through the byepaths of his own park so much better than he did it is a great pleasure to me that you can feel it something like home he said  i was so happy here as a child said mary heartily that it must seem to me more of a home than any other place  i hope it may always be so my dear  he checked himself as if he had been about to speak even more warmly and mary did the honours of the proposed site for the cottages a waste strip fronting a parish lane open to the south and looking full of capabilities all of which she pointed out after louiss welllearned lesson as eagerly as if it had been her own affair  lord ormersfield gave due force to all but still was prudent  i must find out he said whether this place be in my hands or included in morriss lease  you see mary this is an encumbered property with every disadvantage so that i cannot always act as you and louis would wish but we so far see our way out of our difficulties that if guided by good sense he will be able to effect far more than i have ever done  i believe was marys answer this green is in the farmers hands but that he has no use for it  i should like to be certain of his wishes  farmers are so unwilling to increase the rates that i should not like to consent till i know that it would be really a convenience to him  mary suggested that there stood the farmhouse and the earl apologetically asked if she would dislike their proceeding thither as he would not detain her long  she eagerly declared that louis would be so glad and lord ormersfield turned his steps to the door where he had only been once in his life when he was a very young man trying to like shooting  the roundeyed little maid would say nothing but walk in sir in answer to inquiries if mr norris were at home and they walked into a parlour chill with closed windows and as stiff and fine as the lilac streamers of the cap that mrs norris had just put on for their reception  nevertheless she was a sensible wellmannered woman and after explaining that her husband was close at hand showed genuine warmth and interest in inquiring for lord fitzjocelyn  as the conversation began to flag mary had recourse to admiring a handsome silver tankard on a side table  it was the prize of a ploughingmatch eight years ago and brought out a story that evidently always went with it how mrs norris had been unwell and stayed at home and had first heard of her husbands triumph by seeing the young lord galloping headlong up the homefield hurraing and waving his cap  he had taken his pony the instant he heard the decision and rushed off to be the first to bring the news to mrs norris wild with the honour of small profits  and said the farmers wife i always say norris was as pleased with what i told him as i was with the tankard  norris here came in an unpretending quiet man of the modern intelligent race of farmers  there was anxiety at first in his eye but it cleared off as he heard the cause of his landlords visit and he was as propitious as any cautious farmer could be  he was strong on the present inconveniences and agreed that it would be a great boon to have a few families brought back such as were steady and would not burden the rates but the few recurred so often as to show that he was afraid of a general migration of marksedge  lord ormersfield thereupon promised that he should be consulted as to the individuals  thank you my lord  there are some families at marksedge that one would not wish to see nearer here and ill not say but i should like to have a voice in the matter for they are apt to take advantage of lord fitzjocelyns kindness  i quite understand you  nothing can be more reasonable  i only acted because my son was persuaded it was your wish  it is so my lord  i am greatly obliged  he has often talked of it with me and i had mentioned the matter to mr richardson but he thought your lordship would be averse to doing anything  i have not been able to do all i could have wished said the earl my son will have it in his power to turn more attention to the property  and he is a thorough farmers friend as they all say earnestly exclaimed norris with warmth breaking through the civil formal manner  true said lord ormersfield gratified he is very much attached to the place and all connected with it  im sure theyre the same to him replied the farmer  as an instance my lord youll excuse itdo you see that boy driving in the cows  you would not look for much from him   well the morning the doctor from london came down that boy came to his work crying so that i thought he was ill  no master said he but whatll ever become of us when weve lost my young lord  and he burst out again fit to break his heart  i told him i was sorry enough myself but to go to his work for crying would do no good  i cant help it master says he when i looks at the pigs  didnt he find em all in the park and me nuttingand helped me his own self to drive em out before mr warren see em and lifted the little pigs over the gap as tender as if they were christians  yes thats the way with them all interposed mrs norris he has the good word of high and low  lord ormersfield smiled he smiled better than he used to do and took leave  fitzjocelyn will be a popular man he said  mary could not help being diverted at this moral deduced from the pigstory  every one is fond of him was all she said  talent and popularity continued the earl  he will have great influence  the free prepossessing manner is a great advantage where it is so natural and devoid of effort  it comes of his loving every one said mary almost indignantly  it is a decided advantage continued the earl complacently  i have no doubt but that he has every endowment requisite for success you and your mother have done much in developing his character my dear and i see every reason to hope that the same influence continued will produce the most beneficial results  mary thought this a magnificent compliment even considering that no one but her mamma had succeeded in teaching louis to read when a little boy or in making him persevere in anything now but then when lord ormersfield did pay a compliment it was always in the style of louis xiv     chapter ix  the family compact       who nurst with tender care   and to domestic bounds confined      was still a wild jackhare                             cowper   mary said mrs frost  mrs ponsonby was sitting by the open window of the library inhaling the pleasant scents of july  raising her eyes she saw her aunt gazing at her with a look somewhat perplexed but brim full of mischievous frolic  however the question was onlywhere is that boy  he is gone down with mary to his cottagebuilding  oh if mary is with him i dont care said aunt catharine sitting down to her knitting but her ball seemed restless and while she pursued it she broke out into a little laugh and exclaimed i beg your pardon my dear but i cannot help it  i never heard anything so funny  as this scheme said mrs ponsonby with a little hesitation  then you have the other side of it in your letter cried mrs frost giving way to her merriment  the arabian nights themselves the two viziers laying their heads together and sending home orders to us to make up the match  my letter does not go so far said mrs ponsonby amused but anxious  yours is the ladys side  my orders are precise  oliver has talked it over with mr ponsonby and finds the connexion would be agreeable so he issues a decree that his nephew roland dynevorpoor jemhe would not know himselfshould enter on no profession but forthwith pay his addresses to miss ponsonby since he will shortly be in a position befitting the heir of our family  you leave prince roland in happy ignorance said mrs ponsonby blushing a little  certainlyor he would fly off like a skyrocket at the first symptom of the princess  then i think we need not alter our plans  all that marys father tells me is that he does not intend to return home as yet though his successor is appointed since he is much occupied by this new partnership with oliver and expects that the investment will be successful  he quite approves of our living at the terrace especially as he thinks i ought to be informed that oliver has declared his intentions with regard to his nephew and so if anything should arise between the young people i am not to discourage it  mary is in request said mrs frost slyly and as she met mrs ponsonbys eyes full of uneasy inquiry  you dont mean that you have not observed at least his elder lordships most decided courtship dont be too innocent my dear  pray dont say so aunt kitty or you will make me uncomfortable in staying here  if the like ever crossed his mind he must perceive that the two are just what we were together ourselves  that might make him wish it the more aunt catharine had almost said but she restrained it halfway and said louis is hardly come to the time of life for a grande passion  true  he is wonderfully young and mary not only seems much older but is by no means the girl to attract a mere youth  i rather suspect she will have no courtship but from the elders  in spite of her opportunities  what would some mammaslord ormersfields bugbear for instance lady conwaygive for such a chance  three months of a lame young lord and such a lame young lord as my louis  i might have feared said mrs ponsonby if mary were not so perfectly simple  aunt melicent managed to abstract all romance and i never regretted it so little  she has looked after him merely because it came in her way as a form of kindness and is too much his governess for anything of the other sort  so you really do not wish for the other sort said mrs frost half mortified as if it were a slight to her boy  i dont know how her father might take it said mrs ponsonby eager to disarm her  with his grand expectations and his view of the state of this property he might make difficulties  he is fond of expressing his contempt for needy nobility and i am afraid after all that has passed that this would be the last case in which he would make an exception  yet you say he is fond of mary  very fond  if anything would triumph over his dislike it would be his affection for her but i had rather my poor mary had not to put it to the proof  and after all i dont think it the safest way for a marriage that the man should be the most attractive and the woman the most  sensible  say it marythat is the charm in my nephews eyes  your greatnephew is the point  no no aunt kitty you are under a delusion  the kindness to mary is no more than auld langsyne and because he thinks her too impossible  he cannot afford for his son to marry anything but a grand unquestionable heiress  marys fortune besides depending on speculations would be nothing to what lady fitzjocelyn ought to have  for shame  i think better of him  i believe he would be unworldly when louiss happiness was concerned  to return to james said mrs ponsonby decidedly i am glad that his uncle should have declared his intentions  oh my dear we are quite used to that  i am only glad that jem takes no heed  we have had enough of thatfor my own part and the tears arose i never expect that poor oliver will think he has done enough in my lifetime  these things do so grow on a man  if i had but kept him at home  it might have been the same  there would have been something to divide his attention  his brother used to be a sort of idol he seemed to love him the more for his quiet easy ways and to delight in waiting on him  i do believe he delays because he cannot bear to come home without henry  mrs ponsonby preferred most topics to that of mrs frosts sons and was relieved by the sight of the young people returning across the lawnfitzjocelyn with his ash stick but owing a good deal of support to marys firm wellknit arm  they showed well together even lameness could not disfigure the grace of his leisurely movements and the bright changefulness and delicacy of his face contrasted well with the placid nobleness of her composed expression while her complexion was heightened and her eyes lighted by exercise so that she was almost handsome  she certainly had been looking uncommonly well lately  was this the way they were to walk together through life  but mrs ponsonby had known little of married life save the troubles and she was doubly anxious for her daughters sake  she exceedingly feared unformed characters and natures that had no root in themselves marys husband must not lean on her for strength  she was glad as with new meaning she watched their proceedings to see how easily and as a matter of course louis let mary bring his footstool and his slipper fetch his books each at the proper time read spanish with him and make him look out the words in the dictionary when he knew them by intuition remind him of orders to be written for his buildings and manage him as her pupil  if she ruled it was with perfect calmness and simplicity and the playfulness was that of brother and sister not even with the coquettish intimacy of cousinhood  the field was decidedly open to roland dynevor alias james frost  mrs ponsonby was loth to contemplate that contingency though in all obedience she exposed her daughter to the infection  he was expected on that afternoon bringing his sister with him for he had not withstood the united voices that entreated him to become fitzjocelyns tutor during the vacation and the whole party had promised to remain for the present as guests at ormersfield  louis in high spirits offered to drive mrs ponsonby to meet the travellers at the station and much did he inflict on her poor shattered nerves by the way  he took no servant that there might be the more room and perched aloft on the driving seat he could only use his indefatigable tongue by leaning back with his head turned round to her  she kept a sharp lookout ahead but all her warnings of coming perils only caused him to give a moments attention to the horses and the reins before he again turned backwards to resume his discourse in the town his head was more in the right direction for he was nodding and returning greetings every moment he seemed to have a bowing acquaintance with all the world and when he drew up at the station reached down several times to shake hands with figures whom his father would barely have acknowledged exchanging goodhumoured inquiries or congratulations with almost every third person  scarcely had the train dashed up before mrs ponsonby was startled by a shout of hes there himself  louis  louis and felt as well as saw the springing ascent to the box of a tall apparition in a scanty lilac cotton dress an outgrown black mantle and a brown straw bonnet scarcely confining an overprofusion of fair hair louis let go the reins to catch hold of both hands and cry well old giraffe what have you done with jem  seeing to the luggage  you wont let him turn me out  i must sit here  you must have manners said louis look round and speak rationally to mrs ponsonby  i never saw she was there and slightly colouring the giraffe erected her length turned round a small insignificant face slightly freckled with hazel eyes as light as if they had been grey and stretched down a hand to be shaken by her new relation but she was chiefly bent on retaining her elevation  there jem she cried exultingly as he came forth followed by the trunks and portmanteaus  madcap he said but i suppose the first day of the holidays must be privileged  ha fitzjocelyn youre the right man in the right place whatever clara is  so they drove off james sitting by mrs ponsonby and taking care to inform her that in spite of her preposterous height clara was only sixteen he began to ask anxious questions as to fitzjocelyns recovery while she looked up at the pair in front and thought from the appearance of things that even louiss tongue was more than rivalled for the newcomer seemed to say a sentence in the time he took in saying a word  poor mrs ponsonby she would not have been happier had she known in which pair of hands the reins were  and louis how are you cried clara as soon as this point had been gained are you able to walk  after a fashion  and does your ankle hurt you  only if i work it too hard  one would think that lounging had become a virtue instead of a vice to hear the way i am treated  you look began clara  but oh louis cried she in a sort of hesitating wonder what a moustache  dont say a word he lowered his voice  riding is against orders but i cannot miss the yeomanry under the present aspect of affairs  the invasion  a man in the train was talking of the war steamers but jem laughed  do you believe in it  it is a time when a display of loyalty and national spirit may turn the scale  i am resolved to let no trifle prevent me from doing my part he said colouring with enthusiasm  you are quite right cried clara  you ought to take your vassals like a feudal chief   i am sure the defence of ones country ought to outweigh everything  exactly so  our volunteer forces are our strength and glory and are a happy meeting of all classes in the common cause  but say nothing clara or granny will take alarm and get an edict from walby against me  dear granny  but i wish we were going home to the terrace  thank you  how flattering  you would be always in and out and it would be so much more comfortable  is lord ormersfield at home  no he will not come till legislation can bear london no longer  ohwith a sound of great relief  you dont know how kind he has been said louis eagerly  you will find it out when you are in the house with him  clara laughed but sighed  i think we should have had more fun at home  what than with me for your host  try what i can do  besides you overlook mary  but she has been at school  well  i didnt bargain for schoolgirls at home  i should not have classed mary in that category  dont ask me to endure any one who has been at school  oh louis if you could only guessif you would only speak to jem not to send me back to that place  aunt kitty will not consent i am sure if you are really unhappy there my poor clara  no no i am ordered not to tell granny  it would only vex her and jem says it must be   i dont want her to be vexed and if i tell you i may be able to keep it in  out poured the whole flood of troubles unequal in magnitude but most trying to the highspirited girl  formal walks silent meals set manners perpetual french were a severe trial but far worse was the companionship  petty vanities small disputes fretful jealousies insincere tricks and sentimental secrets seemed to clara a great deal more contemptible than the ignorance indolence abrupt manners and boyish tastes which brought her into constant disgraceand there seemed to be one perpetual chafing and contradiction which made her miserable  and a further confidence could not help following though with a warning that jem must not hear it for she did not mind and he spent every farthing on her that he could afford  she had been teased about her dress told that her friends were mean and shabby and rejected as a walking companion because she had no parasol and that was vulgar  i am sure i wanted to walk with none of them said clara and when our english governess advised me to get one i told her i would give in to no such nonsense for only vulgar people cared about them such a scrape i got into   well then miss salter whose father is a knight and who thinks herself the great lady of the school always bridled whenever she saw me and at last lucy raynor came whispering up to beg that i would contradict that my grandmamma kept a school for miss salter was so very particular  i should like to have heard your contradiction  i never would whisper least of all to lucy raynor so i stood up in the midst and said as clear as i could that my grandmother had always earned an honest livelihood by teaching little boys and that i meant to do the same for nothing would ever make me have anything to do with girls  that spoilt it said louisthe first half was dignified  what was the second  human nature said louis  i see said clara  well they were famously scandalized and that was all very nice for they let me alone  but you brought far worse on me louis  i  ay  twas my own fault though but i couldnt help it  you must know they all are ready to bow down to the ninetyninth part of a lords little finger and miss brownthats the teacheralways reads all the fashionable intelligence as if it were the arabian nights and imparts little bits to miss salter and her pets and so it was that i heard whispered across the table the dreadful accident to viscount fitzjocelyn  did nobody write to you  yesi had a letter from granny and another from jem by the next mornings post or i dont know what i should have done  granny was too busy to write at first i didnt three parts believe it before but there was no keeping in at that first moment  what did you do  i gave one great scream and flew at the newspaper  the worst was that i had to explain and thenoh it was enough to make one sick why had i not said i was lord ormersfields cousin  i turned into a fine aristocraticlooking girl on the spot  miss salter came and fondled and wanted me to walk with her  of course she had compassion on your distressamiable feeling  she only wanted to ask ridiculous questions whether you were handsome  what did you reply  i told them not a word except that my brother was going to be your tutor  when i saw miss salter setting off by this line i made jem take secondclass tickets that she might be ashamed of me  my dear giraffe bend down your neck and dont take such a commonplace conventional view of your schoolfellows  conventional ay all agree because they know it by experience said claraim sure i do  then take the other sidesee the best  jem says you go too far and are unreasonable with your theory of making the best of every one  by no means  i always made the worst of frampton and now i know what injustice i did him  i never saw greater kindness and unselfishness than he has shown me  i should like to know what best you would make of these girls  you have to try that  can i get any possible good by staying  a vast deal  im sure italian and music and drawing are not a good compared with truth and honour and kindness  all those things only grow by staying wherever we may happen to be unless it is by our own fault  tell me what good you mean  learning not to hate learning to mend your gloves  dont jerk the reins clara or youll get me into a scrape  clara could extract no more nor did she wish it for having relieved her mind by the overflow she only wanted to forget her misfortunes her cousin louis was her chief companion they had always felt themselves on the same level of nonsense and had unreservedly shared each others confidences and projects and ten thousand bits of intelligence were discussed with mutual ardour while claras ecstasy became uncontrollable as she felt herself coming nearer to her grandmother  she finally descended with a bound almost as distressing to her brother as her ascent had been and leapt at once to the embrace of mrs frost who stood there petting kissing her and playfully threatening all sorts of means to stop her growth clara reared up her giraffe figure boasting of having overtopped all the world present except louis  she made but a cold abrupt response to her cousin marys greeting and presently rushed upstairs in search of dear old jane with an impetus that made mrs frost sigh and say poor child how happy she is and follow her smiling while james looked annoyed  never mind jem said louis who had thrown himself at full length on the sofa she deserves compensation  let it fizz  and undo everything  what do you say to that mary  mary is to say nothing said louis i mean that poor child to have her swing  i shall leave you and james to settle that said mary quitting them  i am very anxious that clara should form a friendship with mary said james gravely  friendships cant be crammed down peoples throats said louis in a weary indifferent tone  you who have been three months with mary  mary and i did not meet with labels round our necks that here were a pair of friends  pray do you mean to send that victim of yours back to school  dont set her against it  i have been telling her of the necessity all the way home  is it not to be taken into consideration that a badnot to say a basestyle of girl seems to prevail there  i cant help it fitzjocelyn cried jem ruffling up his hair as he always did when vexed  girls fit to be her companions dont go to schoolor to no school within my means  this place has sound superiors and she must be provided with a marketable stock of accomplishments so theres no choice  i can trust her not to forget that she is a dynevor  query as to the benefit of that recollection  what do you mean  that i never saw evils lessened by private selfexaltation  very philosophical but as a matter of fact what was it but the sense of my birth that kept me out of all the mischief i was exposed to at the grammar school  i always thought it had been something more respectable said louis his voice growing more sleepy  pshaw  primary motives being understood secondary stand common wear the best  as long as they dont eat into the primary  the long and short of it is exclaimed james impatiently that we must have no nonsense about clara  it is pain enough to me to inflict all this on her but i would not do it if i thought it were more than mere discomfort  her principles are fixed she is above these trumperies  but you have the sense to see that her whole welfare may depend on whether she gets fitted to be a valuable accomplished governess or a mere bonne tossed about among nurserymaids  theres where poverty galls  dont go and set my grandmother on  if she grew wretched and took clara away it would be mere condemning of her to rudeness and struggling  very well said louis as james concluded the brief sentences uttered in the bitterness of his heart one bargain i make  if i am to hold my tongue about school i will have my own way with her in the holidays  i tell you louis that it is time to have done with childishness clara is growing upi wont have you encourage her in all that wild flightinessi didnt want to have had her here at all  if she is ever to be a reasonable conformable woman it is high time to begin  i cant have you undoing the work of six months when mary might make some hand of her too  james stopped  louiss eyes were shut and he appeared to be completely asleep  if silence were acquiescence it was at least gained and so he went away and on returning intended to impress his lessons of reserve on clara and her grandmother but was prevented by finding mrs ponsonby and her daughter already in the library consulting over some letters while clara sat at her grandmothers knee in the full felicity of hearing all the northwold news  the tea was brought in and there was an inquiry for louis  he came slowly forward from the sofa at the dark end of the room but disclaimed of course the accusation of fatigue  a very bad sign said james that you have been there all this time without our finding it out  decidedly you have taken me in you dont look half as well as you promised  you are not the same colour ten minutes together just now white and nowhow you redden  dont jem cried louis as each observation renewed the tide of burning crimson in his cheek  it is like whistling to a turkeycock if i had but the blue variety it might be more comfortable as well as more interesting  clara went into a choking paroxysm of laughter which her brother tried to moderate by a look and louis rendered more convulsive by quoting       marked you his cheek of heavenly blue  and looked with a mischievous amusement at jamess illsuppressed displeasure at the merriment that knew no bounds till even mrs frost who had laughed at first as much at jamess distress as at louiss travestie or claras fun thought it time to check it by saying you are right jem he is not half so strong as he thinks himself  you must keep him in good order  take care aunt kitty said louis youll make me restive  a tutor and governess both  i appeal  shall we endure it clara  britons never shall be slaves was the eager response  worthy of the daughter of the pendragons said louis but it lost half its effect from being stifled with laughing  you should command yourself clara when you utter a sentiment  i beg to repeat miss frost dynevors novel and striking speech and declare my adhesion britons never shall be slaves  liberty fraternity and equality tyrants beware  you ungrateful boy said mrs frost thats the way you use your good governess  only the way the nineteenth century treats all its good governesses said louis  when it gets past them said mary smiling  i hope you did not think i was not ready to give you up to your tutor  mary found the renunciation more complete than perhaps she had expected  the return of his cousins had made fitzjocelyn a different creature  he did indeed read with james for two hours every morning but this was his whole concession to discipline otherwise he was more wayward and desultory than ever and seemed bent on teazing james and amusing himself by making clara extravagantly wild and idle  tired of his long confinement he threw off all prudence with regard to health as well as all struggle with his volatile habits and the more he was scolded the more he seemed to delight in making meekly ridiculous answers and going his own way  sometimes he and clara would make an appointment at some unearthly hour to see mrs morris make cheese or to find the sundew blossom open or to sketch some effect of morning sun  louis would afterwards be tired and unhinged the whole day but never convinced only capable of promoting claras chatter and ready the next day to stand about with her in the sun at the cottages to the increase of her freckles and the detriment of his ankle  their frolics would have been more comprehensible had she been more attractive but her boisterous spirits were not engaging to any one but louis who seemed to enjoy them in proportion to her brothers annoyance and to let himself down into nearly equal folly  he gave some slight explanation to mary one day when he had been reminded of one of their former occupationsah i have no time for that now  you see theres nobody else to protect that poor giraffe from being too rational  is that her great danger said mary  take my advice mary let her alone  follow your own judgment and not poor jems fidgets  he wants to be father mother both and uncle all in one and so he misses his natural vocation of elder brother  he wants to make a woman of her before her time and now he has his way with her at school he shall let her have a little compensation at home  is this good for her  is it the only way she can be happy  it is her way at least and if you knew the penance she undergoes at school you would not grudge it to her  she is under his orders not to disclose the secrets of her prisonhouse lest they should disquiet aunt catharine and she will not turn to you becausei beg your pardon maryshe has imbibed a distrust of all schoolgirls and besides jem has gone and insisted on your being her friend more than human nature can stand  it is a great pity said mary smiling but grieved i should not have been able to do her much goodbut if i could only try  ill tell you said louis coming near with a look between confidence and embarrassment is it in the power of woman to make her dress look rather more like other peoples without inflaming the blood of the dynevorscautiously you know  even my father does not dare to give her halfasovereign for pocketmoney but do ask your mother if she could not be made such that those girls should not make her their laughingstock  you dont mean it  aye i do and she has not even told james lest he should wish to spend more upon her  she glories in it but that is hardly wholesome  then she told you  oh yes  we always were brothers  it is great fun to have her here i always wished it and im glad it has come before they have made her get out of the boy  he will be father to the woman some day and that will be soon enough without teasing her  mary wished to ask whether all this were for claras good but she could not very well put such a question to him and after all it was noticeable that noisy and unguarded as claras chatter was there never was anything that in itself should not have been said though her manner with louis was unceremonious it was never flirting and refinement of mind was as evident in her roughandready manner as in his highbred quietness  this seemed to account for mrs frosts noninterference which at first amazed her niece but aunt catharines element was chiefly with boys and her love for clara though very great showed itself chiefly in still regarding her as a mere child petting her to atone for the privations of school and while she might assent to the propriety of jamess restrictions always laughing or looking aside when they were eluded  james argued and remonstrated  he said a great deal always had the advantage in vehemence and appeared to reduce louis to a condition of quaint debonnaire indifference and warfare seemed the normal state of the cousins the one fiery and sensitive the other cool and impassive and yet as appropriate to each other as the pepper and the cucumber to borrow a bon mot from their neighbour sydney calcott  if jem came to mary brimful of annoyance with louiss folly a mild word of assent was sufficient to make him turn round and do battle with the imaginary enemy who was always depreciating fitzjocelyn  to make up for claras avoidance of mary he rendered her his prime counsellor and many an hour was spent in pacing up and down the garden in the summer twilight while she did her best to pacify him by suggesting that thorough relaxation would give spirits and patience for claras next half year and that it might be wiser not to overstrain his own undefined authority while the lawful power aunt catharine did not interfere  surely she might safely be trusted to watch over her own granddaughter and while clara was so perfectly simple and louis such as he was more evil than good might result from inculcating reserve at any rate it was hard to meddle with the poor childs few weeks of happiness and to this james always agreed and then he came the next day to relieve himself by fighting the battle over again  so constantly did this occur that aunt kitty in her love of mischief whispered to mrs ponsonby that she only hoped the two viziers would not quarrel about the three thousand sequins three landed estates and three slaves  still louiss desertion had left unoccupied so many of the hours of marys time that he had previously absorbed that her mother watched anxiously to see whether she would feel the blank  but she treated it as a matter of course  she had attended to her cousin when he needed her and now that he had regained his former companion clara she resigned him without effort or mortification as far as could be seen she was forced to fall back on other duties furnishing the house working for every one and reading some books that louis had brought before her  the impulse of selfimprovement had not expired with his attention and without any shadow of pique she was always ready to play the friend and elder sister whenever he needed her and to be grateful when he shared her interests or pursuits  so the world went till lord ormersfields return caused claras noise to subside so entirely that her brother was sufficiently at ease to be exceedingly vivacious and entertaining and mrs ponsonby hoped for a great improvement in the state of affairs     chapter x  the better part of valour    for who is he whose chin is but enriched   with one appearing hair that will not follow   these culled and choicedrawn cavaliers gainst france   work work your thoughts and therein see a siege                                          king henry v   the next forenoon mary met james in the park wandering in search of his pupil whom he had not seen since they had finished their mornings work in the study  some wild freak with clara was apprehended but while they were conferring mary exclaimed whats that as a clatter and clank met her ear  only the men going out to join old brewsters ridiculous yeomanry said jem  oh i should like to see them cried mary running to the top of a bank whence she could see into the hollow road leading from the stables to the lodge  four horsemen the sun glancing on their helmets were descending the road and a fifth at some distance ahead was nearly out of sight  ah she said louis must have been seeing them off  how disappointed he must be not to go  i wish i was sure said james with a start  i declare his folly is capable of anything  why did i not think of it sooner  clara here rushed upon them with her cameleopard gallop sending her voice before her can you see them  scarcely said mary making room for her  wheres louis hastily demanded her brother  gone to the yeomanry meeting said clara looking in their faces in the exultation of producing a sensation  james was setting off with a run to intercept him but it was too late and clara loudly laughed as she said you cant catch him  ive done with him cried james  can madness go further  james  i am ashamed of you cried the giraffe with great stateliness  here are the enemy threatening our coasts and our towns full of disaffection and sedition and when our yeomanry are lukewarm enough to go off grouseshooting instead of attending to their duty what is to become of the whole country if somebody does not make an exertion  the tranquillity of all england may depend on the face our yeomanry show  on lieutenant fitzjocelyns yellow moustache  pray how long have you been in the secret of these heroic intentions  ever since i came home  we all knew that he meant to go out if he could said mary in a tone calculated to soothe jem and diminish claras glory in being sole confidante but we did not think him well enough  i hope it will do him no harm  exertions in a good cause can do no harm boldly declared clara then with sudden loss of confidence do you really think it will  just cripple him for life said james  mr walby wished him not to attempt riding said mary  he thinks any strain on the ankle just now might hurt him very much but it may be over caution  mr walby is an old woman said clara  now jem you said so yourself  besides it is all for his duty  of course he would risk anything for the good of his country  dont say another word clara exclaimed james or you will drive me distracted with your folly  one grain of sense and even you would have stopped it but neither you nor he could miss a chance of his figuring in that masquerade dress  look at the sun exactly like a redhot oven  we shall have him come home as ill as ever  clara had another milder and more sorrowful version of the scolding from her grandmother but lord ormersfield escaped the days anxiety by being so busy with richardson that he never emerged from the study and did not miss his son  it was an exceedingly sultry day and the hopeful trusted that louis would be forced to give in before much harm could be done but it was not till five oclock that the hoofs were heard on the gravel and jem went out to revenge himself with irony for his uneasiness  i hope you are satisfied he said dulce est pro patria mori  louis was slowly dismounting and as he touched the ground gave a slight cry of pain and caught at the servants arm for support  no more than i expected said james coming to help him and at the same moment lord ormersfield was heard exclaiming  fitzjocelyn what imprudence  take care hastily interrupted james finding louis leaning helplessly against him unable to speak or stand and his flushed cheek rapidly changing to deadly white  they lifted him up the steps into the hall where he signed to be laid down on the seat of the cool north window and trying to smile said it was only the hot sun and his foot aching rather it would soon go off  and when with much pain and difficulty frampton had released his swollen foot from the regulationboot into which he had foolishly thrust it he went on more fluently  he had thought it his duty especially when mr shaw the captain of his troop had chosen to go awayhe had believed it could do no harmhe was sure it was only a little present discomfort and in the present crisis  he addressed his aunt but his eyes were on his father and when he heard not a single word from him he suddenly ceased and presently laying his head down on the windowsill he begged that no one would stand and watch him he should come into the library in a few minutes  the few minutes lasted however till near dinnertime when he called to mary as she was coming downstairs and asked her to help him into the library he could remain no longer exposed to framptons pity as dinner went in  he dragged himself along with more difficulty than he had found for weeks and sank down on the sofa with a sigh of exhaustion while clara who was alone in the room reared herself up from an easychair where she had been sitting in an attitude that would have been despair to her mistress  ha clara said louis presently you look as if you had been the object of invective  i dont care exclaimed clara  i know you were in the good old cause  conde at jarnac charles xii at pultowawhich said louis  i thought of both myselfonly unluckily i made such frightful blunders  i was thankful to my men for bringing me off like other great commanders  oh louis but at least you were in your placeyou set the example  unluckily these things descend from the sublime to the other thing when one is done up and beginning to doubt whether selfwill cannot sometimes wear a mask  im sure they are all quite cross enough to you already without your being cross to yourself  an ingenious and elegant impersonal said louis  clara rushed out into the garden to tell the stiff old rosetrees that if lord ormersfield were savage now he would be more horrid than ever  meanwhile louis drew a long sigh murmuring have i gone and vexed him again  mary have i been very silly  the halfpiteous doubt and compunction had something childish which made her smile as she answered you had better have done as you were told  the surest road to silliness said louis whose tendency was to moralize the more the more tired he was is to think one is going to do something fine  it is dismal work to come out at the other end of an illusion  with a foot aching as i am afraid yours does  i should not mind that but that i made such horrid mistakes  these weighed upon his mind so much that he went on half aloud rehearsing the manoeuvres and orders in which he had failed from the difficulty of taking the command of his troop for the first time when bewildered with pain and discomfort  the others came in and james looked rabid louis stole a glance now and then at his father who preserved a grave silence while clara stood aloof comparing the prostrate figure in blue and silver to all the wounded knights in history or fiction  he was past going in to dinner and the party were civil and melancholy mrs frost casting beseeching looks at her grandson who sat visibly chafing at the gloom that rested on the earls brow and which increased at each message of refusal of everything but iced water  at last mrs frost carried off some grapes from the dessert to tempt him and as she passed through the open windowher readiest way to the librarythe earls thanks concluded with a disconsolate murmur quite ill and abominable folly a mere soliloquy and nearly inaudible but sufficient spark to produce the explosion  fitzjocelyns motives deserve no such name as folly james cried with stammering eagerness  i know you did not encourage him said lord ormersfield  i did said a young clear voice raised in alarm at her own boldness jem knew nothing of it but i thought it right  lord ormersfield made a little courteous inclination with his head which annihilated clara upon the spot  i doubt whether i should have done right in striving to prevent him said james  who can appreciate the moral effect of heroism  heroism in the cause of a silver jacket  now that is the most unfair thing in the world cried james always most violent when he launched out with his majestic cousin there is not a man living more careless of his appearance  you do him justice mrs ponsonby  yes i do not believe that vanity had anything to do with it  a man who would bear what he has done today would do far more  if it had been for any reasonable cause said the earl  you may not understand it lord ormersfield exclaimed james but i do  in these times of disaffection a sound heart and whole spirit in our volunteer corps may be the saving of the country and who can tell what may be the benefit of such an exhibition of selfsacrificing zeal  the time demands every mans utmost and neither risk nor suffering can make him flinch from his duty  my dear jem said a voice behind him at the window i never see my follies so plainly as when you are defending them  come and help me up stairs granny is ordering me up a nights rest will set all smooth  it was not a nights rest neither did it set things smooth  in vain did louis assume a sprightly countenance and hold his head and shoulders erect and stately there was no concealing that he was very pale and winced at every step  his ankle had been much hurt by the pressure of the stirrup and he was not strong enough to bear with impunity severe pain exertion and fatigue on a burning summer day it was evident that his recovery had been thrown back for weeks  his father made no reproaches but was grievously disappointed  his exaggerated estimate of his sons discretion had given place to a no less misplaced despondency quite inaccessible to mrs ponsonbys consolations as to the spirit that had prompted the performance  he could have better understood a youth being unable to forego the exhibition of a handsome person and dress than imagine that any one of moderate sense could either expect the invasion or use these means of averting it  if imagination was to be allowed for so much the worse a certain resemblance to the childish wilfulness with which his wife had trifled with her health occurred to him increasing his vexation by gloomy shadows of the past  his silent mortification and kind anxiety went to his sons heart louis was no less disappointed in himself in finding his own judgment as untrustworthy as ever since the exploit that had been a perpetual feast to his chivalrous fancy had turned out a mere piece of selfwilled imprudence destroying all the newlybestowed and highlyvalued good opinion of his father and even in itself incompetently executed  he had made a fool of himself every way that had been jamess first dictum and he adopted it from conviction  in the course of the day goodnatured fat sir gilbert brewster the colonel of the yeomanry who had been seriously uneasy at his looks and had tried to send him home rode over to inquire for him complimenting him on being thorough game to the last  louis relieved his mind by apologies for his blunders whereupon he learnt that his good colonel had never discovered them and now only laughed at them and declared that they were mere trifles to what the whole corps officers and men committed whenever they met and no one cared except one old sergeant who had been in the light dragoons louiss very repentance for them was another piece of absurdity  he smiled indeed but seemed to give himself up as a hopeless subject his spirits flagged as they had not done throughout his illness and unwell languid and depressed he spent his days without an attempt to rally he was only too conscious of his own inconsistency but he had not energy enough to resume any of the habits that mary had so diligently nursed neglected even his cottagebuilding would not trouble himself to consider the carpenters questions forgot messages put off engagements and seemed to have only just vigour enough to be desultory tease james and spoil clara  lord ormersfield became alarmed and called in doctors who recommended sea air and james suggested a secluded village on the yorkshire coast where some friends had been reading in the last long vacation  this was to be the breakup of the party mrs frost and the two marys would resort to dynevor terrace clara would return to school and james undertook the charge of louis who took such exceedingly little heed to the arrangements that jem indignantly told him that he cared neither for himself nor anybody else     chapter xi  a halting proposal    shallow  will you upon good dowry marry her   slender  i will do a greater thing than that upon your request                                   merry wives of windsor   the first thing that louis did appear to care for was a letter that arrived about three days previous to their departure addressed to lord fitsgosling hawmsfield park northwold  rather too personal as he observed he must tell his correspondent that it hurt his feelings  the correspondent was tom madison whose orthography lagged behind his other attainments if his account might be trusted of they lectures on kemistry  his penmanship was much improved and he was prospering with hopes of promotion and higher wages when he should have learnt to keep accounts  he liked mr dobbs and the chaplain and wished to know how to send a crown per post to old granfer up at marksedge because he is too ignorant to get a border sinned  please my lord give my duty to him and all enquiring friends and to schirlt up at the teras  highly amused louis lay on the uppermost step from the library window in the cool summer evening laughing over the letter there aunt kitty he said i commit that tender greeting to your charge and as she looked doubtful yes do theres a good aunt and mistress  i am afraid i should not be a good mistress i ought not to sanction it  better sanction it above board than let it go on by stealth said louis  you are her natural protector  so much the more reason against it  i ought to wish her to forget this poor boy of yours  ay and light hymens torch with some thriving tallow chandler who would marry a domestic slave as a good speculation without one spark of the respectful chivalrous love that  hush you absurd boy  well then if you wont i shall go to jane  the young ladies are all too cold and too prudent but jane has a soft spot in her heart and will not think true love is confined within the rank that keeps a gig  i did think aunt kitty had been above vulgar prejudices  not above being coaxed by you you gosling you said aunt kitty only you must come out of the dew the sun is quite gone  presently said louis as she retreated by the window  i would not have been too cold or too prudent said clara  i well believe it  you will be one if you are not the other said mary gathering her work up with the dread of one used to tropical dews  are not you coming in  when i can persuade myself to write a letter of good advice a thing i hate  which asked mary giving or receiving it  receiving of coursegiving of course said clara and louis at the same instant  take mine then said mary and come out of the damp  mary is so tiresome about these things cried clara as their cousin retreated  such fidgetting nonsense  i once argued it with her said louis without stirring and she had the right side that it is often more selfdenying to take care of ones health than to risk it for mere pleasure or heedlessness  theres no dew said clara and if there was it would not hurt and if it did i should be too glad to catch a cold or something to keep me at home  oh if i could only get into a nice precarious state of health  you would soon wish yourself at school or anywhere else so that you could feel some life in your limbs half sighed louis  ive more than enough  oh how my feet ache to run and my throat feels stifled for want of making a noise and the hatefulness of always sitting upright with my shoulders even  come you might pity me a little this one night louis i know you do for jem is always telling me not to let you set me against it  no i dont pity you  pity is next akin to contempt  nonsense louis  do be in earnest  i have seldom seen the human being whom i could presume to pity certainly not you bravely resisting folly and temptation and with so dear and noble a cause for working  you mean the hope of helping to maintain grandmamma  which you will never be able to do unless you pass through this ordeal and qualify yourself for skilled labour  i know that said clara but the atmosphere there seems to poison and take the vigour out of all they teach  oh so different from granny teaching me my notes or jem teaching me french  growling at you  he never growled half as much as i deserved  i cared to learn of him but i dont care for anything nowno not for drawing which you taught me  theres no heart in it  the whole purpose is to get amazing numbers of marks and pass each other  all dates and words and gabble gabble  ay theres an epitome of the whole world all ambition and vanity and gabble gabble said louis sadly  and what is a gosling that he should complain  you dont mean that in reality  you are always merry  some mirth is because one does not always think clara and when one does think deeply enough there is better cheerfulness  deeply enough said clara  ah i see  knowing that the world of gabble is not what we belong to only a preparation  is that it  it is what i meant  ah i but how to make that knowledge help us  theres the point  now and then i think i see but then i go off on a wrong tack i get a silly fit and a hopeless one and lose my clue and yet after all there is a highway and wayfaring men though fools shall not err therein murmured louis as he gazed on the first star of evening  oh tell me how to see my highway at school  if i only kept my own at home i might  but you have the advantageyou have a fixed duty and you always have kept hold of your purposes much better than i  my purpose said clara  i suppose that is to learn as fast as i can that i may get away from that place and not be a burthen to granny and jem  perhaps jem will marry and be poor and then i shall send his sons to school and college  and pray what are your social duties till that time comes  thats plain enough said clara to keep my tone from being deteriorated by these girls  why louis whats that for as with a bow and air of alarm he hastily moved aside from her  if you are so much afraid of being deteriorated  nonsense  if you only once saw their trumpery cabals and vanities and mean equivocations you would understand that the only thing to be done is to keep clear of them take the learning i am sent for but avoid them  and where is the golden rule all this time said louis very low  but ought not one to keep out of what is wrong  yes but not to stand aloof from what is not wrong  look out not for what is inferior to yourself but what is superior  ah you despair but my giraffe will you promise me this  tell me next christmas a good quality for every bad one you have found in them you shake your head  nay you must for the credit of your sex  i never found the man in whom there was not something to admire and i had rather not suppose that women are not better than men  will you promise  ill try but  but mind it takes kind offices to bring the blossoms out therethats pretty well considering our mutual sentiments as to good advice  have you been giving me good advice  not bad i hope  i thought only people likelike marycould give advice  ah your blindness about mary invalidates your opinion of your schoolfellows  it shows that you do not deserve a good friend  ive got you i want no other  quite wrong  not only is she full of clear kind solid sense like a pillar to lean on but she could go into detail with you in your troubles  you have thrown away a great opportunity and i am afraid i helped you  i shall hold you in some esteem when you areto conclude sententiouslyworthy of her friendship  claras laugh was loud enough to bring out the earl to summon them authoritatively out of the dew  louis sat apart writing his letter clara now and then hovering near curious to hear how he had corrected toms spelling  he had not finished when the ladies bade him goodnight and as he proceeded with it his father said what is that engrossing correspondence louis  such a sensible letter that i am quite ashamed of it said louis  i wonder at the time you chose for writing when you are so soon to part with our guests  i have no excuse if you think it uncivil  i never have spirit to set about anything till the sun is down  his father began at once to speak softly no i intended no blame i only cannot but wonder to see you so much engrossed with clara dynevor  poor child she wants some compensation  i have no doubt of your kind intentions but it would be safer to consider what construction may be placed on attentions so exclusive  louis looked up in blank incredulous amazement and then almost laughingly exclaimed is that what you mean  why she is an infant a baby  not in appearance  you dont know her father said louis  i love her with all my heart and could not do more  why she is and always has been my sheyoungerbrother  i am aware said the earl without acknowledging this peculiar relationship that this may appear very ridiculous but experience has shown the need of caution  i should be concerned that your heedless goodnature should be misconstrued so as to cause pain and disappointment to her or to lead you to neglect one who has every claim to your esteem and gratitude  louis was bewildered  i have been a wretch lately he said but i did not know i had been a bear  i did not mean that you could be deficient in ordinary courtesy but i had hoped for more than mere indifferent civility towards one eminently calculated lord ormersfield for once failed in his period  are we talking at cross purposes exclaimed fitzjocelyn  what have i been doing or not doing  if my meaning require explanation it is needless to attempt any is your ankle painful tonight  not a word more except about his health could louis extract and he went to his room in extreme perplexity  again and again did he revolve those words  quick as were his perceptions on most points they were slow where selfconsciousness or personal vanity might have sharpened them and it was new light to him that he had come to a time of life that could attach meaning to his attentions  whom had he been neglecting  what had his father been hoping  who was eminently calculated and for what  it flashed upon him all at once  i see i see he cried and burst into a laugh  then came consternation or something very like it  he did not want to feel embarked in manhood  and then his faraway dream of a ladylove had been so transcendently fair so unequalled in grace so perfect in accomplishments so enthusiastic in selfdevoted charity all undefined floating on his imagination in misty tints of glory that all this should be suddenly brought down from cloudland to sink into mary ponsonby with the honest face and downright manner for whom romance and rapture would be positively ridiculous  yet the notion would not be at once dismissed  his declaration that he would do anything to gratify his father had been too sincere for him lightly to turn from his suggestion especially at a moment when he was full of shame at his own folly and eagerness to retain the ground he had lost in his fathers opinion and above all to make him happy his heart thrilled and glowed as he thought of giving his father real joy and permanently brightening and enlivening that lonely solitary life  besides who could so well keep the peace between him and his father and save him by hints and by helpfulness from giving annoyance he had already learnt to depend on her she entered into all his interests and was a most pleasant companionso wise and good that the most satisfactory days of his life had been passed under her management and he had only broken from it to play the fool  he was sick of his own volatile quixotism and could believe it a relief to be kept in order without trusting to his own judgment  she had every right to his esteem and affection and the warm feeling he had for her could only be strengthened by closer ties  the unworldliness of the project likewise weighed with him had she been a millionaire or a dukes daughter he would not have spent one thought on the matter but he was touched by seeing how his fathers better feelings had conquered all desire for fortune or connexion  and then mary could always find everything he wanted  i will do it he determined  never was son more bound to consider his father  of course she will make a much better wife than i deserve  most likely my fancies would never have been fulfilled she will save me from my own foolishness  what ought a man to wish for more than a person sure to make him good  andwell after all it cannot be for a long time  they must write to lima  perhaps they will wait till her fathers return or at least till i have taken my degree  this last encouraging reflection always wound up the series that perpetually recurred throughout that night of broken sleep and when he rose in the morning he felt as if each waking had added a year to his life and looked at the glass to see whether he had not grown quite elderly  no indeed  i am ridiculously youthful especially since i shaved off my moustache in my rage at the yeomanry mania  i must systematically burn my cheeks to look anything near her age  and he laughed at himself but ended with a longdrawn sigh  he was in no state of mind to pause he was tired of selfdebate and was in haste to render the step irrevocable and then fit himself to it and he betook himself at once to the study where he astonished his father by his commencement with crimson cheeksi wished to speak to you  last night i did not catch your meaning at once  we will say no more about it was the kind answer  if you cannot turn your thoughts in that direction there is an end of the matter  i think said louis that i could  my dear boy said the earl with more eagerness than he could quite control you must not imagine that i wish to influence your inclinations unduly but i must confess that what i have seen for the last few months has convinced me that nothing could better secure your happiness  i believe so said louis gazing from the window  right cried the earl with more gladness and warmth than his son had ever seen in him  i am delighted that you appreciate such sterling excellence  yes louis and his voice grew thick there is nothing else to trust to  i know it said louis  she is very good  she made me very happy when i was ill  you have seen her under the most favourable circumstances  it is the only sort of acquaintance to be relied on  you have consulted your own happiness far more than if you had allowed yourself to be attracted by mere showy gifts  i am sure she will do me a great deal of good said louis still keeping his eyes fixed on the evergreens  you could have done nothing to give me more pleasure said the earl with heartfelt earnestness  i know what she is and what her mother has been to me  that aunt of hers is a stiff wrongheaded person but she has brought her up wellvery well and her mother has done the rest  as to her father that is a disadvantage but from what i hear he is never likely to come home and that is not to be weighed against what she is herself  poor mary how rejoiced she will be that her daughter at least should no longer be under that mans power  it is well you have not been extravagant like some young men louis  if you had been running into debt i should not have been able to gratify your wishes now but the property is so nearly disencumbered that you can perfectly afford to marry her with the very fair fortune she must have unless her father should gamble it away in peru  this was for lord ormersfield the incoherency of joy and louis was quite carried along by his delight  the breakfastbell rang and the earl rising and drawing his sons arm within his own pressed it saying bless you louis it was extreme surprise and pleasure to fitzjocelyn and yet the next moment he recollected that he stood committed  how silent he washow unusually gentle and gracious his father to the whole party quite affectionate to mary and not awful even to clara there was far too much meaning in it and louis feared mrs ponsonby was seeing through all  a morning of greek would be insupportable thought he and yet he felt as if the fetters of fate were being fast bound around him when he heard his father inviting james to ride with him  he wandered and he watched he spoke absently to clara but felt as if robbed of a protector when she was summoned upstairs to attend to her packing and mary remained alone writing one of her long letters to lima  now or never thought he before my courage cools  i never saw my father in such spirits  he sat down on an ottoman opposite to her and turned over some newspapers with a restless rustling  can i fetch anything for you asked mary looking up  no thank you  you are a great deal too good to me mary  i am glad said mary absently anxious to go on with her letter but looking up again at himi am sure you want something  nonothingbut that you should be still more good to me  what is the matter said mary suspecting that he was beginning to repent of his lazy fit and wanted her to hear his confession  i mean mary said he rising and speaking faster if youif you would take charge of me altogether  if you would have me i would do all i could to make you happy and it would be such joy to my father andrather like an afterthoughtto me  her clear sensible eyes were raised and her colour deepened but the confusion was on the gentlemans sideshe was too much amazed to feel embarrassment and there was a pause till he added i know better than to think myself worthy of you but you will take me in handand indeed mary there is no one whom i like half so well  poor louis was this his romantic and poetical wooing  stop if you please louis exclaimed mary  this is so very strange  and she seemed ready to laugh  andwhat do you say mary  i do not know  i cannot tell what i ought to say she returned rising  will you let me go to mamma  she went and louis roamed about restlessly till on the stairs he encountered mrs frost who instantly exclaimed why my dear what is the matter with you  i have been proposing to mary said he in a very low murmur his eyes downcast but raised the next moment to see the effect as if it had been a piece of mischief  wellproposing what  myself most innocently whispered  youyoumaryand aunt catharine was scarcely able to speak in the extremity of her astonishment  you are not in earnest  she is gone to her mother said louis hanging over the baluster so as to look straight down into the hall and both were silent till mrs frost exclaimed my dear dear child it is an excellent choice  you must be very happy with her  yes i found my father was bent on it  that was clear enough said his aunt laughing but resuming a tone of some perplexity  yet it takes me by surprise i had not guessed that you were so much attracted  i do like her better than any one  no one is so thoroughly good no one is likely to make me so good nor my father so happy  there was some misgiving in mrs frosts tone as she said dear louis you are acting on the best of motives but  dont pray dont aunt kitty cried louis rearing himself for an instant to look her in the face but again throwing half his body over the rail and speaking low  i could not meet any one half so good or whom i know as well  i look up to her andyesi do love her heartilyi would not have done it otherwise  i dont care for beauty and trash and my father has set his heart on it  yes but she hesitated  my dear i dont think it safe to marry because ones father has set his heart on it  indeed said louis straightening himself i do think i am giving myself the best chance of being made rational and consistent  i never did so well as when i was under her  nnnobut  and think how my father will unbend in a homelike home where all should be made up to him he continued deep emotion swelling his voice  my dear boy  and you are sure of your own feeling  quite sure  why i never saw any one said he smilingi never cared for any one half so much except you aunt kitty no i didnt wont that do  i know i should not have liked your grandpapayour uncle i meanto make such comparisons  perhaps he had not got an aunt kitty said louis  no no  i cant have you so like a novel  no dont be anxious it cant be for ever so long and of course the more i am with her the better i must like her  it will be all right  i dont think you know anything about it said mrs frost but there thats the last i shall say  youll forgive your old aunt  he smiled and playfully pressed her hand adding but we dont know whether she will have me  mary had meantime entered her mothers room with a look that revealed the whole to mrs ponsonby who had already been somewhat startled by the demeanour of the father and son at breakfast  oh mamma what is to be done  what do you wish my child asked her mother putting her arm round her waist  i dont know yet said mary  it is so odd  and the disposition to laugh returned for a moment  you were not at all prepared  oh no  he seems so young  and she added blushing i cannot tell but i should not have thought his ways were like the kind of thing  nor i and the less since clara has been here  oh said mary without a shade on her calm sincere brow he has clara so much with him because he is her only friend  the total absence of jealousy convinced mrs ponsonby that the heart could hardly have been deeply touched but mary continued in a slightly trembling voice i do not see why he should have done this unless  unless that his father wished it  oh said mary somewhat disappointed but how could lord ormersfield possibly  he has an exceeding dread of louiss making as great a mistake as he did said mrs ponsonby and perhaps he thinks you the best security  and you think louis only meant to please him  my dear i am afraid it may be so  louis is very fond of him and easily led by a strong character  she pressed her daughter closer and felt rather than heard a little sigh but all that mary said was then i had better not think about it  nay my dear tell me first what you think of his manner  it was strange and a little debonnaire i think said mary smiling but tears gathering in her eyes  he said i was too good for him  he said he would make me happy and that he and his father would be very happy  a great tear fell  something about not being worthy  mary shed a few more tears while her mother silently caressed her and recovering her composure she firmly said yes mamma i see it is not the real thing  it will be kinder to him to tell him to put it out of his head  and you my dear  oh mamma you know you could not spare me  if this were the real thing dearest  no whispered mary i could not leave you alone with papa  mrs ponsonby went on as if she had not heard as it is i own i am relieved that you should not wish to accept him  i cannot be sure it would be for your happiness  i do not think it would be right said mary as if that were her strength  he is a dear noble fellow and has the highest purest principles and feelings  i cant but love him almost as if he were my own child i never saw so much sweetness and prettiness about any one except his mother and oh how far superior he is to her  but then he is boyish he is weaki am afraid he is changeable  not in his affections said mary reproachfully  no but in purposes  an impulse leads him he does not know where and now i think he is acting on excellent motives without knowing what he is doing  theres no security that he might not meet the person who  oh mamma  he would strive against temptation but we have no right to expose him to it  to accept him now it seems to me would be taking too much advantage of his having been left so long to our mercy and it might be that he would become restless and discontented find out that he had not chosen for himselfregretand have his tone of mind lowered  oh stop mamma i would not let it be on any account  no my dear i could not part with you where we were not sure the real thing was felt for you  if he had been strongly bent on it he would have conducted matters differently but he knows no better  you and i dont part said mary  neither spoke till she renewed her first question  what is to be done  shall i go and speak to him my dear  perhaps i had better if you will come with me  then hesitatingi will go to my room for a moment and then i shall be able to do it more steadily  mrs ponsonbys thoughts were anxious during the five minutes of marys absence but she returned composed according to her promise whatever might be the throbbings beneath  as mrs ponsonby opened the door she saw louis and his aunt together and was almost amused at their conscious start the youthful speed with which the one darted into the further end of the corridor and the undignified haste with which the other hopped down stairs  by the time they reached the drawingroom he had recovered himself so as to come forward in a very suitable simple manner and mary said at once louis thank you but we think it would be better not  not exclaimed fitzjocelyn  not repeated mary i do not think there is that between us which would make it right  there would be cried louis gaining ardour by the difficulty if you would only try  mrs ponsonby tell her we would make her happy  you would try said mrs ponsonby kindly but i think she is right indeed louis you must forgive me for saying that you are hardly old enough to make up your mind  madison is younger said louis boyishly enough to make her smile but earnestly proceeding wont you try me  will you not say that if i can be steady and persevering  no said mrs ponsonby it would not be fair towards either of you to make any conditions  but if without them i should do bettermary will you say nothing  we had better not think of it said mary her eyes on the ground  why is it that i am too foolish too unworthy  she made a great effort  not that louis  do not ask any more it is better not you have done as your father wishednow let us be as we were before  my father will be very much disappointed said louis with chagrin  i will take care of your father said mrs ponsonby and as mary took the moment for escaping she proceeded to say some affectionate words of her own tender feeling towards louis to which he only replied by saying sadly and with some mortification never mind i know it is quite right  i am not worthy of her  that is not the point but i do not think you understand your own feelings or how far you were actuated by the wish to gratify your father  i assure you cried louis you do not guess how i look up to mary her unfailing kindness her entering into all my nonsenseher firm sound judgment that would keep me rightand all she did for me when i was laid up  oh why cannot you believe how dear she is to me  how dear is just what i do believe but still this is not enough  just what aunt kitty says said louis perplexed yet amused at his own perplexity  you will know better byandby she answered smiling in the meantime believe that you are our very dear cousin as ever  and she shook hands with him detecting in his answering smile a little relief although a great deal of disappointment  mary had taken refuge in her room where a great shower of tears would have their course though she scolded herself all the time have done have done  it is best as it is  he does not really wish it and i could not leave mamma  we will never think of it again and we will be as happy as we were before  her mother meanwhile was waiting belowstairs thinking that she should spare louis something by taking the initiative in speaking to his father and she was sorry to see the alacrity with which the earl came up to her with a congratulatory well mary  she could hardly make him comprehend the real state of the case and then his resignation was far more trying than that of the party chiefly concerned  her praise of fitzjocelyn had little power to comfort i see how it is he said calmly do not try to explain it away i acquiescei have no doubt you acted wisely for your daughter  nothing would have delighted me more if he were but a few years older  you need not tell me the poor boys failings said his father sadly  it is on account of no failing but would it not be a great mistake to risk their happiness to fulfil our own scheme  i hoped to secure their happiness  ay but is there not something too capricious to find happiness without its own free will and choice  did you never hear of the heart  oh if she be attached elsewhereand he seemed so much relieved that mrs ponsonby was sorry to be obliged to contradict him in haste and explain that she did not believe fitzjocelyns heart to be yet developed whereupon he was again greatly vexed  so he has offered himself without attachment  i beg your pardon mary i am sorry your daughter should have been so treated  do not misunderstand me  he is strangely youthful and simple bent on pleasing you and fancying his warm brotherly feeling to be what you desire  it would be the safest foundation  yes if he were ten years older and had seen the world but in these things he is like a child and it would be dangerous to influence him do not take it to heart you ought to be contented for i saw nothing so plainly as that he loves nobody half so well as you  only be patient with him  you are the same mary as ever he said softened and she left him hoping that she had secured a favourable audience for his son who soon appeared at the window somewhat like a culprit  i could not help it he said  no but you may set a noble aim before youyou may render yourself worthy of her esteem and confidence and in so doing you will fulfil my fondest hopes  i asked her to try me but they would make no conditions  i am sorry this could not be since you wished it  if you are not sorry on your own account there are no regrets to be wasted on mine  candidly father said louis much as i like her i cannot be sorry to keep my youth and liberty a little longer  then you should never have entered on the subject at all said lord ormersfield beginning to write a letter and poor louis in his praiseworthy effort not to be reserved with him found he had been confessing that he had not only been again making a fool of himself but what was less frequent and less pardonable of his father likewise   he limped out at the window and was presently found by his greataunt reading what he called a raving novel to see how he ought to have done it  she shook her head at him and told him that he was not even decently concerned  indeed i am he replied  i wished my father to have had some peace of mind about me and it does not flatter ones vanity  dear softhearted aunt kitty with all her stores of comfort ready prepared and unable to forgive or even credit the rejection of her louis without a prior attachment gave a hint that this might be his consolation  he caught eagerly at the idea  i had never once thought of that  it cant be any spaniard out in perushe has too much sense what are you looking so funny about  what is it nearer home  thats it then  famous  it would be a capital arrangement if that terrible old father is conformable  what an escape i have had of him  i am sure it is a most natural and proper preference  stop stop louis you are going too fast  i know nothing  dont say a word to jem on any account indeed you must not  it is all going on very well now but the least notion that he was observed or that it was his uncle olivers particular wish and there would be an end of it  she was just wise enough to keep back the wishes of the other vizier but she had said enough to set louis quite at his ease and put him in the highest spirits  he seemed to have taken out a new lease of boyishness and though constrained before mary laughed talked and played pranks so as unconsciously to fret his father exceedingly  claras alert wits perceived that so many private interviews had some signification and mrs frost found her talking it over with her brother and conjecturing so much that granny thought it best to supply the key thinking perhaps that a little jealousy would do jem no harm  but the effect on him was to produce a fit of hearty laughter as he remembered poor lord ormersfields unaccountable urbanity and suppressed exultation in the mornings ride  i honour the ponsonbys he said for not choosing to second his lordships endeavours to tyrannize over that poor fellow body and soul  poor louis he is fabulously dutiful  but clara recovering from her first stupor of wonder began scolding him for presuming to laugh at anything so cruel to louis  it was not the part of a friend  and with tears of indignation and sympathy starting from her eyes she was pathetically certain that though granny and jem were so unfeeling as to laugh his high spirits were only assumed to hide his suffering  poor louis what had he not said to her about mary last night  now she knew what he meant  and as to mary she was glad she had never liked her she had no patience with her of course she was far too prosy and stupid to care for anything like louis it was a great escape for him  it would serve her right to marry a horrid little crooked clerk in her fathers office and poor dear dear louis must get over it and have the most beautiful wife in the world  dont you remember jem the lady with the splendid dark eyes on the platform at euston square when you so nearly made us miss the train with the brow that you said  hush clara dont talk nonsense     chapter xii  childe roland    a house there is and thats enough   from whence one fatal morning issues   a brace of warriors not in buff   but rustling in their silks and tissues   the heroines undertook the task   thro lanes unknown oer stiles they ventured   rapped at the door nor stayed to ask   but bounce into the parlour entered                             grays long story   no carmine  nor scarlet lake in powder  could procure some my lord  thank you the actinia would not live  i must take what i can find a lump of gamboge  if you stay much longer he will not retain his senses muttered james frost who was leaning backwards against the counter where the bewildered bookseller of the little coasttown of bickleypool was bustling in the vain endeavour to understand and fulfil the demands of that perplexing customer lord fitzjocelyn  some drawingpaper  this is hardly absorbent enough  if you have any block sketchbooks  could procure some my lord  james looked at his watch while the man dived into his innermost recesses  the tide he said  never mind we shall only stick in the mud  how could you expect to find anything here  a halfcrown paintbox is their wildest dream  keep quiet jem go and look out some of those library books like a wise man  a wise man would be at a loss here said james casting his eye along the battered purple backs of the circulatinglibrary books  wisdom wont condescend  ah thank you this will do nicely those coloursyes and the seaside book  ill choose one or two what is most popular here  james began to whistle but louis taking up a volume became engrossed beyond the power of hints and hardly stepped aside to make way for some ladies who entered the shop  a peremptory touch of the arm at length roused him and holding up the book to the shopman he put it into his pocket seized his ashstick put his arm into his cousins and hastened into the street  did you ever see began jem  most striking  i did not know you had met with her  what an ideathe false self conjuring up phantoms  what are you talking of  did you not see her  elizabeth barrett  was she there  is that her name  do you know her  i had heard of her but never  howwhere  who is she  i only saw her name in the titlepage  whats all this  you did not see her  who  did not some ladies come into the shop  some ladies  is it possible  why i touched you to make you look  i thought it was your frenzy about the tide  what now  james made a gesture of despair  the loveliest creature i ever saw you may see her yet as she comes out  come back  dont be so absurd said fitzjocelyn laughing and with instinctive dislike of staring resisting his cousins effort to wheel him round what you will withdrawing his arm  i shall put off without you if you dont take care  and laughing he watched jem hurry up the sloping street and turn the corner then turned to pursue his own way his steps much less lame and his looks far more healthful than they had been a month before  he reached the quaynarrow slippery and fishy but not without beauty as the green water lapped against the hewn stones and rocked the little boats moored in the wide bay sheltered by a richlywooded promontory  jem in a fit of romance  well whose fault will it be if we miss the tide  ill sit in the boat and read that poem again oh here he comes out of breath  well jem did the heroine drop glove or handkerchief  or on a second view was she minus an eye  you were said james hurrying breathlessly to unmoor the boat  let me row said louis your breath and senses are both lost in the fair vision  it is of no use to talk to you  i shall ask no questions till we are out of the harbour or you will be running foul of one of those colliersa tribute with which the fair unknown may dispense  the numerous black colliers and lighters showed that precautions were needful till they had pushed out far enough to make the little fishy town look graceful and romantic and the tide was ebbing so fast that louis deemed it prudent to spend his strength on rowing rather than on talking  james first broke silence by exclaimingdo you know where beauchastel is  on the other side of the promontory  dont you remember the spire rising among the trees as we see it from the water  that church must be worth seeing  i declare ill go there next sunday  another silence and louis saidi am curious to know whether you saw her  she was getting into the carriage as i turned the corner so i went back and asked bull who they were  i hope she was the greengrocers third cousin  pshaw  i tell you it was mrs mansell and her visitors  oho  no wonder beauchastel architecture is so grand  what an impudent fellow you are jem  the odd thing is said james a little ashamed of louis having put mansell and beauchastel together as he had not intended that it seems they asked bull who we were  i thought one old lady was staring hard at you as if she meant to claim acquaintance but you shot out of the shop like a skyrocket  luckily theres no danger of that  no one will come to molest us here  depend on it they are meditating a descent on his lordship  you shall appear in my name then  too like a bad novel besides you dont look respectable enough for my tutor  and now i think of it no doubt she was asking bull how he came to let such a disreputable old shootingjacket into his shop  the young men worked up an absurd romance between them as merrily they crossed the estuary and rowed up a narrow creek with a whitewashed village on one side and on the other a solitary house the garden sloping to the water and very nauticalthe vane a unionjack waved by a brilliant little sailor on the top of a mast and the arbour half a boat set on end whence as james steered up to the stone steps that were one by one appearing there emerged an old grizzly weatherbeaten sailor who took his pipe from his mouth and caught hold of the boat  thank you captain cried fitzjocelyn  ive brought home the boat safe you see by my own superhuman exertionsno thanks to mr frost there  thats his way captain retorted jem leaping out and helping his cousin you may thank me for getting him home at all  but for me he would have his back against the counter and his head in a book this very moment  ask him what he was after returned louis  which of us dye think most likely to lag captain hannaford cried jem preventing the question  which would you choose to have on board  yed both of ye make more mischief than work said the old seaman who had been looking from one to the other of the young men as if they were performing a comedy for his special diversion  so you would not enter us on board the eliza priscilla cried louis  no no said the old man shrewdly and with an air of holding something back whereupon they both pressed him and obtained for answer no no i wouldnt sail with yousigning towards fitzjocelynin my crew yed be more trouble than yere worth  and as to you sir if i wouldnt sail with ye id like still less to sail under you  he finished with a droll deprecating glance and louis laughed heartily but james was silent and as soon as they had entered the little parlour declared that it would not do to encourage that old skipperhe was waylaying them like the ancient mariner and was actually growing impudent  an old mans opinion of two youngsters is not what i call impudence began louis with an emphasis that made jem divert his attack  those two cousins had never spent a happier month than in these small lodgings built by the old retired merchantseaman evidently on the model of that pride of his heart the eliza priscilla his little coasting trader now the charge of his only surviving son for this was a family where drowning was like a natural death and old captain hannaford looked on the probability of sleeping in ebbscreek churchyard much as bayard did at the prospect of dying in his bed his old deaf wife kept the little cabinlike rooms most exquisitely neat and the twelveyearsold priscilla the orphan of one of the lost sons waited on the gentlemen with an oldfashioned womanly deportment and staid countenance that in the absence of all other grounds of distress louis declared was quite a pain to him  the novelty of the place the absence of restraint the easy life and above all the freshness of returning health rendered his spirits exceedingly high and he had never been more lighthearted and full of mirth  james elated at his rapid improvement was scarcely less full of liveliness and frolic enjoying to the utmost the holiday which perhaps both secretly felt might be the farewell to the perfect carelessness of boyish relaxation  bathing boating fishing dabbling were the order of the day and withal just enough quarrelling and teasing to add a little spice to their pleasures louis was over head and ears in maritime natural history but jem backed by mrs hannaford prohibited his messes from making a permanent settlement in the parlour though festoons of seaweed trellised the porch ammonites heaped the grassplat tubs of seawater flanked the approach to the front door and more than one bowl with inmates of a suspicious nature was often deposited even on the parlour table  on the afternoon following the expedition to bickleypool louis was seated with an earthenware pan before him coaxing an actinia with raw beef to expand her blossom to be copied for miss faithfull another bowl stood near containing some feathery serpulas and the weeds were heaped on the locker of the window behind him and on the back of the chair which supported his lame foot  the third and only remaining chair accommodated james with a book placed on the table and a semicircle swept round it within which nothing marine might extend  louis was by turns drawing enticing his refractory sitter exhorting her to bloom and complimenting her delicate beauty until james with a groan exclaimed is silence impossible to you fitzjocelyn i would go into the garden but that i should be beset by the intolerable old skipper  i beg your pardoni thought you never heard nor heeded me  i dont in general but this requires attention and it is past all bearing to hear how you go on to that jelly  read aloud then it will answer two purposes  this is divinityhooker said james sighing wearily  so much the better  i read some once i wish i had been obliged to go on  you are the oddest fellowafter all i believe you have a craving after my profession  is that a discovery said louis washing the colour out of his brush the only person i envy is a country curateexcept a town one  dont talk like affectation growled james  do you know jem said louis leaning back and drawing the brush between his lips i am persuaded that something will turn up to prevent it from being your profession  your persuasions are wrong then  that fabulous uncle in the indies  you know i am determined to accept nothing from my uncle were he to lay it at my feetwhich he never will  literally or metaphorically asked louis softly  pshaw  you dynevors dont resemble my seapink  see how she stretches her elegant fringes for this very unpleasant bit of meat  there  i wont torment you any more read and stop my mouth  you are in earnest  you seem to think that if a man cannot be a clergyman he is not to be a christian  then dont break in with your actinias and stuff  certainly not said louis gravely  the first interruption came from james himself  leaping to his feet with a sudden bound he exclaimed there they are and stood transfixed in a gaze of ecstasy  you have made me smudge my lake said louis in the mild tone of diamond diamond  i tell you there they are cried james rushing into wild activity  one would think it the fair unknown said louis not troubling himself to look round nor desisting from washing out his smudge  it is it isit is all of them  here they come i tell you and the place is a very mermans cave  take carethe serpuladont as james hurriedly opened the door leading to the stairsdisposed of the raw meat on one step and the serpulas on another and hurled after them the heap of seaweed all but one trailing festoon of luckie minnies lines which while his back was turned louis by one dexterous motion wreathed round the crown of his straw hat otherwise never stirring but washing quietly on until he rose as little priscilla opened the door and stood aside mutely overawed at the stream of flounced ladies that flowed past and seemed to fill up the entire room  it was almost a surprise to find that after all there were only three of them  i knew i was not mistaken said a very engaging affectionate voice it is quite shocking to have to introduce myself to youlady conway  my aunt cried louis with eager delightand my cousin he added turning with a slight blush towards the maiden whom he felt rather than saw to be the worthy object of yesterdays rapture  not quite she answered not avoiding the grasp of his hand but returning it with calm distant politeness  not quite repeated lady conway  your real cousins are no farther off than beauchastel  where you must come and see them added the third ladya portly cordial goodnatured dame whom lady conway introduced as mrs mansell who had known his mother well and louis making a kind of presentation of his cousin james the two elder ladies were located on two of the chairs the younger one as if trying to be out of the way placed herself on the locker  jem stood leaning on the back of the other chair and louis stood over his aunt in an ecstasy at the meetingat the kind warm manner and pleasant face of his auntand above all at the indescribable pleasure imparted by the mere presence of the beautiful girl though he hardly dared even to look at her and she was the only person whose voice was silent in the chorus of congratulation on the wonderful chance that had brought the aunt and nephew together the one had been a fortnight at beauchastel the other a month at ebbscreek without guessing at each others neighbourhood until lady conways attention had been attracted at the library by louiss remarkable resemblance to her sister and making inquiries she had learnt that he was no other than lord fitzjocelyn  she was enchanted with the likeness declaring that all she wished was to see him look less delicate and adding her entreaties to those of mrs mansell that the two young men would come at once to beauchastel  louis looked with wistful doubt at james who he knew could not brook going to fine places in the character of tutor but to his surprise and pleasure james was willing and eager and made no demur except that fitzjocelyn could not walk so far and the boat was gone out mrs mansell then proposed the ensuing monday when she said she and mr mansell should be delighted to have them to meet a party of shooting gentlemenof course they were sportsmen louis answered at once for james but for himself he could not walk nor even ride the offered shootingpony and thereupon ensued more minute questions whether his ankle were still painful  not more than so as to be a useful barometer  i have been testing it by the seaweeds  if i am good for nothing else i shall be a walking weatherglass as well as a standing warning against mantraps  you dont mean that you fell into a mantrap exclaimed mrs mansell in horror  that will be a warning for mr mansell  i have such a dread of the frightful things  a trap ingeniously set by myself said louis  i was only too glad no poor poacher fell into it  your father told me that it was a fall down a steep bank exclaimed lady conway  exactly so but i suppose he thought it for my credit to conceal that my trap consisted of a flight of stone stops very solid and permanent with the trifling exception of cement  if the truth were known said james i believe that a certain scamp of a boy was at the bottom of those steps  im the last person to deny it said louis quietly though not without rising colour there was a scamp of a boy at the bottom of the steps and very unpleasant he found itthough not without the best consequences and among them the present and he turned to lady conway with a pretty mixture of gracefulness and affection enough to win the heart of any aunt  mrs mansell presently fell into raptures at the sight of the drawing materials which must she was sure delight isabel but she was rather discomfited by the sight of the subjectcalled it an odious creature then goodhumouredly laughed at herself but would not sit down again evidently wishing to escape from close quarters with such monsters  lady conway likewise rose and looked into the basin exclaiming in her turn ah  i see you understand these things  yes they are very interesting  virginia will be delighted she has been begging me for an aquarium wherever we go  you must tell her how to manage it  look isabel would not she be in ecstasies  miss conway looked but did not seem to partake in the admiration i am perverse enough never to like what is the fashion she said  i tried to disgust fitzjocelyn with his pets on that very ground said james but their charms were too strong for him  fashion is the very testimony to them said louis  i think i could convince you  he would perhaps have produced his lovely serpula blossoms but he was forced to pass on to his aunt and mrs mansell who had found something safer for their admiration in the shape of a great cornu ammonis in the garden  he can throw himself into any pursuit said james as he paused at the door with miss conway but suddenly becoming aware of the slimy entanglement round his hat he exclaimed absurd fellow and pulled it off rather petulantly adding with a little constraint recovery does put people into mad spirits  i fancy the honest folks here look on in amaze  miss conway gave a very pretty smile of sympathy and consolation that shone like a sunbeam on her beautiful pensive features and dark soft eyes  then she began to admire the view as they stood on the turf beside captain hannafords two small cannon overlooking the water towards bickleypool with a purple hill rising behind it  a yacht was sailing into the harbour and james ran indoors to fetch a spyglass while lady conway seized the occasion of asking her nephew his tutors name  louis who had fancied she must necessarily understand all his kindred was glad to guard against shocks to jems sensitive pride and eagerly explained the disproportion between his birth and fortune and his gallant efforts to relieve his grandmother from her burthens  he was pleased to find that he had touched all his auditors and to hear kindhearted mrs mansell repeat her special invitation to mr frost dynevor with double cordiality  if you must play practical jokes said james as they watched the carriage drive off i wish you would choose better moments for them  i thought you would be more in character as a merman brave said louis  i wonder what character you thought you appeared in  i never meant you to discover it while they were here nor would you if you were not so careful of your complexion  come throw it at my head now as you would have done naturally and we shall have fair weather again  i am only concerned at the impression you have made  too late now is it  you dont mean to be bad company for the rest of the day  it is too bad after such a presence as has been here she is a poem in herself  it is like a vision to see her move in that calm gliding way  such eyes so deep so tranquil revealing the sphere apart where she dwells  an ideal  how can you be savage after sitting in the same room and hearing that sweet low voice  meantime the young lady sat back in the carriage dreamily hearing and sometimes answering the conversation of her two elders as they returned through pretty forestdrives into the park of beauchastel and up to the handsome wellkept house where after a few words from mrs mansell she ascended the stairs  isabel cried a bright voice and a girl of fourteen came skating along the polished oak corridor  come and have some tea in the schoolroom and tell us your adventures  and so saying she dragged the dignified isabel into an oldfashioned sittingroom where a little pale child two years younger sprang up and with a cry of joy clung round the elder sister  my white bindweed said isabel fondly caressing her have you been out on the pony  oh i yes we wanted only you  sit down there  and as isabel obeyed the little louisa placed herself on her lap with one arm round her neck and looked with proud glee at the kind sensiblefaced governess who was pouring out the tea  the reconnoitring party eagerly cried virginia  did you find the cousin  yes we did  oh  then what is he like  you will see when he comes on monday  comingoh  and is he so very handsome  i can see how pretty a woman your aunt louisa must have been  news laughed virginia when mamma is always preaching to me to be like her  is he goodnatured asked louisa  i had not full means of judging said isabel more thoughtfully than seemed justified by the childish question  his cousin is coming too she added mr frost dynevor  another cousin exclaimed virginia  no a relation of lord ormersfielda person to be much respected he is heir to a lost estate and of a very grand old family  lord fitzjocelyn says that he is exerting himself to the very utmost for his grandmother and orphan sister denying himself everything  he is to be a clergyman  there was a book of divinity open on the table  he must be very good said louisa in a low impressed voice and fondling her sisters hand  will he be as good as sir roland  oh i am glad he is coming cried virginia  we have so wished to see somebody very good  a bell ranga signal that lady conway would be in her room where she liked her two girls to come to her while she was dressing louisa reluctantly detached herself from her sister and virginia lingered to say dress quickly please please isabel  i know there is a new bit of sir roland done  oh i hope mr dynevor is like him  not quite said isabel smiling as they ran away  poor children i am afraid they will be disappointed but long may their craving be to see somebody very good  i am very glad they should meet any one answering the description said the governess  i dont gather that you are much delighted with the object of the expedition  a pretty boyvery pretty  it quite explains all i have ever heard of his mother  as you told the children  more than i told the children  their aunt never by description seemed to me my ideal as you know  i would rather have seen a likeness to lord ormersfield whothough i dont like himhas something striking in the curt dry melancholy dignity of his manner  and how has lord fitzjocelyn displeased you  perhaps there is no harm in himhe may not have character enough for that but talk attitudes everything betrays that he is used to be worshippedtakes it as a matter of course and believes nothing so interesting as himself  dont you think you may have gone with your mind made up  if you mean that i thought myself uncalled for and heartily detested the expedition you are right but i saw what i did not expect  was it very bad  a very idle practical joke such as i dislike particularly  a quantity of wet seaweed wound round mr dynevors hat  miss king laughed  really my dear i dont think you know what young men like from each other  mr dynevor did not like it said isabel though he tried to pass it off lightly as the spirits of recovery  those spiritsi am afraid he has too much to suffer from them   there is something so ungenerous in practical wit especially from a prosperous man to one unprosperous  well isabel i wont contradict but i should imagine that such things often showed people to be on the best of terms  isabel shook her head and left the room to have her dark hair braided with little heed from herself as she sat dreamily over a book  before the last bracelet was clasped she was claimed by her two little sisters who gave her no peace till her desk was opened and a manuscript drawn forth that they might hear the two new pages of her mornings work  it was a fouquelike tale relieving and giving expression to the yearnings for holiness and loftiness that had grown up within isabel conway in the cramped round of her existence  the story went back to the troubadour days of provence where a knight the heir of a line of shattered fortunes was betrothed to the heiress of the oppressors that thus all wrongs might be redressed  they had learnt to love when sir roland discovered that the lands in dispute had been won by sacrilege  he met adeline at a chapel in a little valley to tell the whole  they agreed to sacrifice themselves that restitution should be made the knight to go as a crusader to the holy land the lady after waiting awhile to tend her aged father to enter a convent and restore her dower to the church  twice had isabel written that parting pouring out her heart in the highsouled tender devotion of roland and his adeline and both feeling and description were beautiful and poetical though unequal  louisa used to cry whenever she heard it yet only wished to hear it again and again and when virginia insisted on reading it to miss king tears had actually been surprised in the governesss eyes  yet she liked still better adelines meek and patient temper where breathed the feeling isabel herself would fain cherishthe deep earnest spiritual life and high consecrated purpose that were with the provencal maiden through all her enforced round of gay festivals light minstrelsy tourneys and courts of love  thus far had the story gone  isabel had been writing a wild mysterious ballad reverting to that higher love and the true spirit of selfsacrifice which was to thrill strangely on the ears of the thoughtless at a contention for the golden violet and which she had adapted to a favourite air to the extreme delight of the two girls to them the chapel in the valley roland and his adeline were very nearly real and were the hidden joy of their heartsall the more because their existence was a precious secret between the three sisters and miss king who viewed it as such an influence on the young ones that with more meaning than she could have explained she called it their telemaque  the followingup of the teaching of isabel and miss king might lead to results as little suspected by lady conway as fenelons philosophy was by louis xiv  lady conway was several years older than her beautiful sister and had married much later  perhaps she had aimed too high and had met with disappointments unavowed for she had finally contented herself with becoming the second wife of sir walter conway and was now his serene goodnatured prosperous widow  disliking his estate and neighbourhood and thinking the daughters wanted london society and london masters she shut up the house until her son should be of age and spent the season in lowndessquare the autumn either abroad in visits or at wateringplaces  beauchastel was an annual resort of the family  isabel was more slenderly portioned than her halfsisters and she was one of the nearest surviving relations of her mothers cousin mr mansell whose large comfortable house was always hospitable and whose wife a great dealer in goodnatured confidential gossip used to throw out hints to her great friend lady conway that much depended on isabels marriagethat mr mansell had been annoyed at connexions formed by others of his relationsbut though he had decided on nothing the dear girls choice might make a great difference  nothing could be more passive than miss conway  she could not remember her mother but her childhood had been passed under an admirable governess and though her own miss longman had left her miss king the successor was a person worthy of her chief confidence  at twoandtwenty the schoolroom was still the home of her affections and her ardent love was lavished on her little sisters and her brother walter  going out with lady conway was mere matter of duty and submission she had not such high animal spirits as to find enjoyment in her gaieties and her grave pensive character only attained to walking through her part she had seen little but the more frivolous samples of society scorned and disliked all that was worldly and manoeuvring and hung back from levity and coquetry with utter distaste  removed from her natural home where she would have found duties and seen various aspects of life she had little to interest or occupy her in her unsettled wanderings and to her the sap of life was in books in dreams in the love of her brother and sisters and in discussions with miss king her favourite vision for the future the going to live with walter at thornton conway when he should be of age  but walter was younger than louisa and it was a very distant prospect  her characteristic was a calm serene indifference in which her stepmother acquiesced as lovers of peace do in what they cannot help and the more willingly that her tranquil dignity and pensive grace exactly suited the style of her tall queenly figure delicate features dark soft languid eyes and clear olive complexion just tinged with rosebud pink  what louis said of her to his tutor on the monday night of their arrival was beyond the bounds of all reason and it was even more memorable that jem was neither satirical nor disputatious assented to all and if he sighed it was after his door was shut  a felicitous day ensued spent by james in shooting by fitzjocelyn in the drawingroom whither mrs mansell had requested isabels presence as a favour to herself  the young lady sat at work seldom raising her eyes but this was enough for him his intense admiration and pleasure in her presence so exhilarated him that he rattled away to the utmost louisa was at first the excuse  in no further doubt of his goodnature she spent an hour in the morning in giving him anagrams to guess and after she had repaired to the schoolroom he went on inventing fresh ones and transposing the ivory letters rambling on in his usual style of pensive drollery  happiness never set him off to advantage and either there was more froth than ordinary or it appeared unusually ridiculous to an audience who did not detect the undercurrent of reflection  his father would have been in despair mrs ponsonby or mary would have interposed but the ladies of beauchastel laughed and encouraged himall but isabel who sat in the window and thought of adeline spighted and angered both by a navarrese coxcomb with sleeves down to his heels and shoes turned up to his knees  she gave herself great credit for having already created him a viscount  in the afternoon louis drove out lionizing with his aunt but though the ponies stopped of themselves at all the notable views sea hill and river were lost on him  lady conway could have drawn out a far less accessible person and her outpouring of his own sentiments made him regard her as perfect  she consulted him about her winters resort  louisa required peculiar care and she had thought of trying mineral bathswhat was thought of northwold what kind of houses were there  the northwold faculty themselves might have taken a lesson from fitzjocelyns eloquent analysis of the chemical properties of the waters and all old mr frosts spirit would seem to have descended on him when he dilated on the house beautiful  lodgers for miss faithfull what jubilee they would cause  and such lodgers  no wonder he was in ecstasy  all the evening the sound of his low deliberate voice was unceasing and his calm announcements to his two little cousins were each one more startling than the last while james to whom it was likewise all sunshine was full of vivacity and a shrewd piquancy of manner that gave zest to all he said and wonderfully enlivened the often rather dull circle at beauchastel  morning came and when the ladies descended to breakfast it was found that lord fitzjocelyn had gone out with the sportsmen  the children lamented and their elders pronounced a young gentlemans passion for shooting to be quite incalculable  when late in the day the party returned it was reported that he did not appear to care much for the sport but had walked beside mr mansells shootingpony and had finally gone with him to see his model farm this was a sure road to the old squires heart and no one was more delighted with the guest for aunt catharines sake louis was always attracted by old age and his attentive manners had won mr mansells heart even before his inquiries about his hobby had completed the charm  to expound and to listen to histories of agricultural experiments that really answered was highly satisfactory to both and all the evening they were eager over the great accountbook which was the pride of the squires heart while virginia and louisa grumbled or looked imploring and isabel marvelled at there being any interest for any one in old mr mansells conversation  what is the meaning of this asked james as they went up stairs  louis shrugged like a frenchman looked debonnaire and said goodnight  again he came down prepared for shooting though both pale and lame but he quietly put aside all expostulations walking on until about fifty yards from the house a pebble turning under the injured foot caused such severe pain that he could but just stagger to a tree and sit down  there was much battling before mr mansell would consent to leave him or he to allow james to help him back to the house before going on to overtake the party  very irate was jem at folly that seemed to have undone the benefits of the last month and at changeableness that was a desertion of the queen to whom all homage was due  he was astonished that louis turned into the study a room little inhabited in general and said make hasteyou will catch the others dont fall in with the ladies  i mean to send your aunt to you  pray dont  cant you suppose that peace is grateful after having counted every mortal hour last night  was that the reason you were going to walk ten miles without a leg to stand upon  fitzjocelyn is this systematic  what is said louis wearily  your treatment ofyour aunt  on what system should aunts be treated  of all moments to choose for caprice  exactly when i thought even you were fixed  pur troppo sighed louis  ha cried jem you have not gone and precipitated matters  i thought you could never amaze me again but even you might have felt she was a being to merit rather more time and respect  even i am not devoid of the organ of veneration  his meek tone was a further provocation and with uplifted chin hair ruffled like the crest of a shetland pony flashing eyes and distinct enunciation james exclaimed you will excuse me for not understanding you  you come here you devote yourself to your aunt and cousinsyou seem strongly attracted then all on a sudden you rush out shootingan exercise for which you dont care and when you cant walk you show the most pointed neglect  and after being doneup yesterday you repeat the experiment today as if for the mere object of laming yourself for life  i could understand pique or temper but you have not the  the sense said louis no nor anything to be piqued at  if there be a motive said james i have a right to demand not to be trifled with any longer  i wish you could be content to shoot your birds and leave me in peace you will only have your fun spoilt like mine and go into a fury  the fact is that my father writes in a state of perturbation he says i might have understood from the tenor of his conduct that he did not wish me to be intimate with my aunts family  he cannot know anything about them for it is all one warning against fashion and frivolity  he does not blame usespecially not you  i wish he did  but he desires that our intercourse should be no more than propriety demands and plunges into a discourse against first impressions beauty and the like  so thats the counterblast  you ought to help me jem said louis dejectedly  ill help you with all my heart to combat your fathers prejudices  an hours unrestrained intercourse with these people would best destroy them said louis but in the mean timei wonder what he means  he means that he is in terror for his darling scheme  mrs ponsonby was very right sighed louis  ay  a pretty condition you would be in if she had not had too much principle to let you be a victim to submission  thats what youll come to though  you will never know the meaning of passion you will escape something by it though you will be twisted round his lordships finger and marry his choice  i hope she will have red hair  negative and positive obedience stand on different grounds said louis with such calmness as often fretted james but saved their friendship  besides till i had this letter i had no notion of any such thing  jamess indignation resulted in fierce stammering while louis deliberately continued a viva voce selfexamination with his own quaint naivete betraying emotion only by the burning colour of cheek and brow  no i had no such notion  i only felt that her presence had the gladdening inspiriting calming effect of moonlight or starlight i reverenced her as a dream of poetry walking the earth  ha now one hears the sound of itthat is like it  i did not think it was such a confirmed case  i should have gone on in peace but for this letter and never thought about it at all  so much the better for you  my father is too just and candid not to own his error and be thankful  and you expect her to bear with your alternations in the mean time  towards her i have not alternated  when i have made giggle with clara under the influence of the starry sky did you suppose me giggling with lyra or the pleiades  i should dread to see the statue descend it seemed irreverence even to gaze  the lofty serenity keeps me aloof  i like to believe in a creature too bright and good for human natures daily food  our profane squinting through telescopes at the lady moon reveals nothing but wornout volcanoes and dry oceans black gulfs and scorched desolation but verily that may not be lady moons faultonly that of our base inventions  so i would be content to mark herisabel i meanqueenly moonlike namewalk in beauty and tranquillity unruffled without distorting my vision by personal aims at bringing her down to my level  theredont laugh at me jem  no i am too sorry for you  why he exclaimed impatient of compassion do you think it desperate  i see your affection given to a most worthy object and i know what your notions of submission will end in  once for all jem said fitzjocelyn do you know how you are using my father  no isabel conway may be the happiness or the disappointment of my lifei cannot tell  i am sure my father is mistaken and i believe he may be convinced but i am bound not to fly in the face of his direct commands and till we can come to an understanding i must do the best i can and trust to  the last word was lost as he turned to nurse his ankle and presently to entreat james to join the sportsmen but jem was in a mood to do nothing pleasing to himself nor to any one else  a sacrifice is usually irritating to the spectators who remonstrate rather than listen to selfreproach and louis had been guilty of three great offencesbeing in the right making himself ridiculous and submitting tamelybesides the hightreason to isabels beauty it was well that the earl was safe out of the way of the son of the pendragons  fitzjocelyn was in pain and discomfort enough to make james unwilling to leave him though his goodwill did not prevent him from keeping up such a stream of earplugs and sinister auguries that it was almost the climax of goodtemper that enabled louis to lie still trying to read a great quarto parks travels and abstaining from any reply that could aggravate matters  as the one would not go to luncheon the other would not and after watching the sound of the ladies setting out for their drive louis said that he would go and lie on the turf but at that moment the door was thrown open and in ran virginia explanations were quickly exchangedhow she had come to find vertots malta for isabel and how he had been sent in by hurting his foot  were you going to stay in all day said virginia  oh come with us we have the ponycarriage and we are going to a dear old ruin walking and driving by turns  do pray come theres plenty of room  there could be no objection to the schoolroom party and it was no small relief to escape from james and hope he was amused so fitzjocelyn allowed himself to be dragged off in triumph and james was acceding to his entreaty that he would go in search of the shootingparty when as they reached the halldoor they beheld miss conway waiting on the steps  there was no receding for her any more than for louis so she could only make a private resolution against the ponycarriage and dedicate herself to the unexceptionable company of little sister governess and tutor for james had resigned the shooting and attached himself to the expedition  it was an excellent opportunity of smoothing his cousins way and showing that all was not caprice that might so appear so he began to tell of his most advantageous traits of character and to explain away his whimsical conduct with great ardour and ingenuity he thought he should be perfectly satisfied if he could win but one smile of approbation from that gravely beautiful mouth and it came at last when he told of fitzjocelyns devoted affection to mrs frost and his unceasing kindness to the old ladies of dynevor terrace  thus gratified he let himself be led into abstract questions of principlea style of discussion frequent between miss king and isabel but on which the latter had never seen the light of a mans mind thrown except through books  the gentlemen whom she had met were seldom either deep or earnest except those too much beyond her reach and she had avoided anything like confidence or intimacy but mr dynevor could enlighten and vivify her perplexed reflections answer her inquiries confirm her opinion of books and enter into all that she ventured with diffidence to express  he was enchanted to find that no closer approach could dim the lustre of louiss moon and honoured her doubly for what she had made herself in frivolous society  he felt sure that his testimony would gain credit where fitzjocelyns would be regarded as loveblinded and already beheld himself forcing full proof of her merits on the reluctant earl beholding louis happy and isabel emancipated from constraint  a five miles walk gave full time for such blissful discoveries for miss conway was resolute against entering the ponycarriage and walked on protesting against ever being fatigued while louis was obliged to occupy his seat in the carriage with a constant change of companions  i think my dear said miss king when the younger girls had gone to their mothers toilette that you will have to forgive me  meaning said isabel that you are bitten too  ah miss king you could not withstand the smile with which he handed you in  could you withstand such an affectionate account of your cruel tyrannical practical joker  facts are stubborn things  do you know what mr dynevor is doing at this moment  i met him in the gallery hurrying off to ebbscreek for some lotion for lord fitzjocelyns ankle  i begged him to let mrs mansell send but nono one but himself could find it and his cousin could not bear strangers to disarrange his room  if anything were wanting it would be enough to see how simply and earnestly such a man has been brought to pampernay to justify almost to adore the whims and follies of this youth  if anything were wanting to what  to your dislike  it would not be so active as dislike unless isabel spoke with drooping head and miss king did not ask her to finish but said he has not given you much cause for alarm  so he is at least a thorough gentleman  it may be conceit or wrong selfconsciousness but from the moment the poor boy was spied in the shop i had a perception that mamma and mrs mansell marked him down personally he would be innocent but through all his chatter i cannot shake off the fancy that i am watched or that decided indifference is not needed to keep him at a distance  i wish you could have seen him without knowing him  in vain dear miss king  i cant bear handsome men  i see his frivolity and shallowness and for amiability what do you think of keeping his cousin all the morning from shooting for such a mere nothing and then sending him off for a ten miles walk  for my part i confess that i was struck with the good sense and kindness he showed in our teteatetei thought it justified mr dynevors description  yes i have no doubt that there is some good in him  he might have done very well if he had not always been an idol  isabel was the more provoked with lord fitzjocelyn when byandby he appeared in the drawingroom and related the result of his cousins mission  jem who would know better than himself where to find his property had not chosen to believe his description of the spot where he had left the lotion and in the twilight louis had found his foot coiled about by the feelers and claws of a formidable monsterno other than a bottled scorpion a recent present from captain hannaford  he did not say how emblematic the scorpion lotion was of that which jem had been administering to his wounded spirit all the morning but he put the story in so ludicrous a light that isabel decided that mr dynevor was ungenerously and ungratefully treated as a butt and she turned away in displeasure from the group whom the recital was amusing to offer her sympathy to the tutor and renew the mornings conversation     chapter xiii  frosty but kindly    go not eastward go not westward   for a stranger whom we know not   like a fire upon the hearthstone   is a neighbours homely daughter   like the moonlight or the starlight   is the handsomest of strangers                       legend of hiawatha   what a laboured production had the letter been  how many copies had the statesman written how late had he sat over it at night how much more consideration had he spent on it than on papers involving the success of his life  a word too much or too little might precipitate the catastrophe and the bare notion of his sons marriage with a pupil of lady conway renewed and gave fresh poignancy to the past  at first his anxieties were past mention but he grew restless under them and the instinct of going to mrs ponsonby prevailed  at least she would know what had transpired from james or from fitzjocelyn to mrs frost  she had heard of ecstatic letters from both the cousins and mary had been delighted to identify miss conway with the isabel of whom one of her school friends spoke rapturously but the last letter had beenfrom james to his grandmother declaring that lord ormersfield was destroying the happiness of the most dutiful of sons who was obedient even to tameness and so absurd that there was no bearing him  his lordship must hear reason and learn that he was rejecting the most admirable creature in existence her superiority of mind exceeding even her loveliness of person  he had better beware of tyranny it was possible to abuse submission and who could answer for the consequences of thwarting strong affections  all the ground fitzjocelyn had gained in the last six weeks had been lost and for the future james would not predict  an uncomfortable matter said mrs ponsonby chiefly for the sake of reading her daughters feelings  if it were not in poor louiss mind already his father and james would plant it there by their contrary efforts  oh i hope it will come right said mary  louis is too good and his father too kind for it not to end well  and then mamma he will be able to prove what nobody will believethat he is constant  you think so do you said her mother smiling  mary blushed but answered where he really cared he would be constant  his fancy might be taken and he might rave but he would never really like what was not goodif he does think about miss conway we may trust she is worthy of him  oh i should like to see her  marys eyes lighted up with an enthusiasm that used to be a stranger to them  it was not the overacted indifference nor the tender generosity of disappointment it seemed more to partake of the fond unselfish eldersisterly affection that she had always shown towards louis and it set her mother quite at ease  seeing lord ormersfield riding into the terrace mary set out for a walk that he might have his teteatete freely with her mother  on coming home she met him on the stairs and he spoke with a sad softness and tone of pardon that alarmed her so much that she hastened to ask her mother whether louis had really avowed an attachment  oh no said mrs ponsonby he has written a very rightminded letter on the whole poor boy though he is sure the conways have only to be known to be appreciated  rather too true  it is in his miss fanny hand stiff and dispirited and his father has worked himself into such a state of uneasiness that i think it will end in his going to ebbscreek at once  o mamma you wont let him go and torment louis  why mary have you been learning of james  perhaps he would torment him more from a distance and besides i doubt what sort of counsellor james is likely to make in his present mood  i never could see that james made any difference to louis said mary i know people think he does because louis gives up wishes and plans to him but he is not led in opinions or principles as far as i can see  not unless his own wishes went the same way  at least lord ormersfield will see miss conway  i am afraid that will do no good  it will not be for the first time lady conway has been his dread from the time of his own marriage and if she should come to northwold he will be in despair i do think he must be right she must be making a dead set at louis  not miss conway said mary  i know she must be good or he would not endure her for a moment  mary you do not know the power of beauty  i have heard of it said mary i have seen how dona guadalupe was followed  but those people were not like louis  no mamma i think james might be taken in i dont think louis could beunless he had a very grand dream of his own before his eyes and then it would be his own dream not the lady that he saw and byandby he would find it out and be so vexed  and i trust before he had committed himself  mamma i wont have you think miss conway anything but up to his dreams  i know she is  only think what jane drummond says of her  when the idea of going to see how matters stood had once occurred to the earl he could not stay at home the ankle and the affections preyed on him by turns and he wrote to sir miles oakstead to fix an earlier day for the promised visit as well as to his son to announce his speedy arrival  then he forgot the tardiness of crosscountry posts and outran his letter so that he found no one to meet him at bickleypool and on driving up to the gate at ebbscreek found all looking deserted  after much knocking priscilla appeared roundeyed and gasping and verified his worst fears with gone to bochattle however she explained that only one gentleman was gone to dine there the other was rowing him round the point with grandfatherthey would soon be backindeed they ought for the tide was so low they would have to land down by the shingle bar  she pointed out where the boat must come in and thither the earl directed his steps feeling as if he were going to place himself under a nutmeggrater as he thought how james frost would receive the implied distrust of his guardianship  the sunset gleam was fading on the sleepy waves that made but a feint of breaking along the shining expanse of moist uncovered sand when two figures were seen progressing from the projecting rocks casting long shadows before them  lord ormersfield began to prepare a mollifying addressbut behold  was it the effect of light so much to lengthen jems form nay was it making him walk with a stick  a sudden unlookedfor hope seized the earl  the next minute he had been recognised and in the grasping hands and meeting eyes all was forgotten save the true fond affection of father and son  i did not expect this pleasure  they told me you were dining out  only rowing jem to the landingplace  i told him to make my excuses it is a dinner to half the neighbourhood and my foot is always troublesome if i do not lay it up in the evening  i am glad you are prudent said his father dismissing his fears in his gratification and proceeding to lay his coming to the score of his foot  fitzjocelyn did not wish to see through the pleahe was much too happy in his fathers unusual warmth and tenderness and in the delights of hospitality  mrs hannaford was gone out and eatables were scarce but a teadinner was prepared merrily between priscilla the captain and louis who gloried in displaying his schoolfagging accomplishments with toast eggs and rashershobbled between parlour and kitchen helping priscilla joking with the captain and waiting on his father so eagerly and joyously as to awaken a sense of adventure and enjoyment in the earl himself  no meal with frampton behind his chair had ever equalled fitzjocelyns cookery or attendance and louiss reminiscences of the penalties he had suffered from his seniors for burnt toast awoke like recollections of schoolboy days hitherto in utter oblivion and instead of the intended delicate conversation father and son found themselves laughing over a tirocinium or review of schools  still the subject must be entered on and when lord ormersfield had mentioned the engagement to go to oakstead he added all is well since i have found you here  let me tell you that i never felt more grateful nor more relieved than by this instance of regard for my wishes  though knowing the fitful nature of louiss colour he would have been better satisfied not to have called up such an intensity of red and to have had some other answer than i wish you saw more of them  i see them every year in london  london gives so little scope for real acquaintance ventured louis again with downcast eyes  you forget that lady conway is my sisterinlaw  louis would have spoken but his father added before you were born i had full experience of her  you must take it on trust that her soft prepossessing manners belong to her as a woman of the world who cannot see you without designs on you  of course said louis i yield to your expressed wishes but my aunt has been very kind to me and he added after trying to mould the words to their gentlest form you could not see my cousins without being convinced that it is the utmost injustice  i do not censure them said his father as he hesitated between indignation and respect i only tell you louis that nothing could grieve me more than to see your happiness in the keeping of a pupil of lady conway  he met a look full of consternation and of struggles between filial deference and the sense of injustice  all louis allowed himself to say was however surely when i am her own nephew when our poverty is a flagrant factshe may be acquitted of anything but caring for me forfor my mothers sake  there was a silence that alarmed louis who had never before named his mother to the earl  at last lord ormersfield spoke clearly and sternly in characteristic succinct sentences but taking breath between each  you shall have no reason to think me prejudiced  i will tell you facts  there was a match which she desired for such causes as lead her to seek you  the poverty was greater and she knew it  on one side there was strong affection on that which she influenced there wasnone whatever  if there were scruples she smothered them  she worked on a young innocent mind to act out her deceit and without a misgiving onon his part that his feelings wore not returned the marriage took place  it could not have been all her own fault cried louis  it must have been a willing instrumentmuch to blame  his father cut him short with sudden severity such as startled him never say so louis  she was a mere child educated for that sole purpose her most sweet and docile nature wasted and perverted  and you know this of your own knowledge said fitzjocelyn still striving to find some loophole to escape from such testimony  the earl paused as if to collect himself then repeated the words slowly and decidedly of my own knowledge  i could not have spoken thus otherwise  may i ask how it ended  as those who marry for beauty alone have a right to expect  there was neither confidence nor sympathy  she died early  iwethose who loved her as their own lifewere thankful  louis perceived the strong effort and great distress with which these words were uttered and ventured no answer glancing hastily through all his connexions to guess whose history could thus deeply affect his father but he was entirely at a loss and lord ormersfield recovering himself added say no more of this but believe me it was to spare you from her manoeuvres that i kept you apart from that family  the northwold baths have been recommended for louisa said fitzjocelyn  before we knew of your objections we mentioned miss faithfulls lodgings  what the earl was about to utter he suppressed  you cannot look at those girls and name manoeuvring cried louis  poor things  after a silence lord ormersfield added with more anxiety than prudence set my mind at rest louis  there can have been no harm done yet in so short a time  idontknow said louis slowly  i have seldom spoken to her to be sure  she actually makes me shy  i never saw anything half so lovely  i cannot help her reigning over my thoughts  i shall never believe a word against her though i cannot dispute what you say of my aunt  she is of another mould i wish you could let me hope that  a gesture of despair from his father cut him short  i will do whatever you please he concluded  you will find that time conquers the fancy said the earl quickly i am relieved to find that you have at least not committed yourself it would be no compliment to mary ponsonby  louiss lip curled somewhat but he said no more and made no objections to the arrangements which his father proceeded to detail doubtful of the accommodations of ebbscreek lord ormersfield had prudently retained his fly and though louis intending to sleep on the floor protested that there was plenty of room he chose to return to the inn at bickleypool  he would call for louis tomorrow to take him for a formal call at beauchastel and the day after they would go together to oakstead leaving james to return home about ten days sooner than had been previously concerted  lord ormersfield had not been gone ten minutes before jamess quick bounding tread was heard far along the dry woodland paths he vaulted over the gate and entered by the open window exclaiming as he did so hurrah  the deed is done the letter is off to engage the house beautiful  doom is doom were the first words that occurred to louis  the lion and the prince  whats that  there was once a king began louis as if the tale were the newest in the world whose son was predestined to be killed by a lion after much consideration his majesty enclosed his royal highness in a tower warranted wildbeast proof and forbade the chase to be mentioned in his hearing  the result was that the lockedup prince died of lookjaw in consequence of tearing his hand with a nail in the picture of the lion  i shall send that apologue straight to ormersfield  you may spare that trouble  my father has been with me all the evening  oh his doubleganger visits you  that accounts for your freaks  doublegangers seldom come in yellowbodied flys  his lordship in propria persona  you dont mean it  he is sleeping at the george at bickleypool  there is a letter coming tomorrow by the post to say he is coming today with every imaginable civility to you but i am to go to the rosecoloured pastors with him on wednesday  so theres an end of our peace and comfort  i am afraid we have sadly discomposed his peace  did you discover whether his warnings have the slightest foundation  he told me a history that somewhat accounts for his distrust of my aunt  i think there must be another side to it and nothing can be more unjust than to condemn all the family but it affected him so exceedingly that i do not wonder at his doing so  he gave no names but i am sure it touched him very nearly  can you tell who it could have been  and he narrated enough to make james exclaim it ought to touch him nearly  he was talking of himself  impossiblemy mother cried louis leaping up  yeshis own version of his married life  how do you know  you cannot remember it said louis though too well convinced as he recollected the suppressed anguish and the horror with which all blame of the young wife had been silenced  i have heard of it again and again  it was an unhappy illassorted marriage she was gay he was cold  my aunt catharine says so  as far as she can blame anything  your mother was a sweet blossom in a cold wind  she loved and pitied her with all her heart  your aunt was talking this very evening of your father having carried her sister to ormersfield away from all her family and one reason of her desire to go to northwold is to see those who were with her at last  louis was confounded  yes i see he said  how obtuse not to read it in his own manner  how much it explains and he silently rested his brow on his hands  depend upon it there are two sides to the story  i would not be a pretty petted admired girl in his keeping  do you think it mends matters with me to fasten blame on either said louis sadly  no i was realizing the perception of such a thread of misery woven into his life and thinking how little i have felt for him  endowing him with your own feelings and then feeling for him  no  i cannot estimate his feeling  he is of harder firmer stuff than i and for that very reason i suspect suffering is a more terrific thing  i heard the doctors saying when i bore pain badly that it would probably do the less future harm a bad moral but i believe it is true of the mental as of the physical constitution answering something between a look and a shrug of james he mused on aloudi understand better what the wreck of affection must have been  for my part said james i do not believe in the affection that can tyrannize over and blight a woman  nay james i cannot doubt  my very namemy having been called by it are the more striking in one so fond of usage and precedent things that passed between him and mrs ponsonby while i was illmuch that i little regarded and ill requitedshow what force of love and grief there must have been  the cold grave manner is the broken inaccessible edge of the cliff rent asunder  if romance softens the rough edge you are welcome to it  i may as well go to bed  not romancethe sad reality of my poor fathers history  i trust i shall never treat his wishes so lightly  impatient of onesided sympathy james exclaimed as if you did not give way to him like a slave  yes like a slave said louis gravely  i wish to give way like a son who would try to comfort him for what he has undergone  now i should have thought your feeling would have been for your mother  if my mother could speak to me said louis with trembling lips she would surely bid me to try my utmost as far as in me lies to bring peace and happiness to my father  i cannot tell where the errors may have been and i will never ask  if she was as like to me as they say i could understand some of them  at least i know that i am doubly bound to give as little vexation to him as possible and i trust that you will not make it harder to me  you lost your father so early that you can hardly estimate  the trial said james willing to give what had passed the air of a joke  exactly sogood night     chapter xiv  new inhabitants

i think you will wish for a fuller account of him than can be obtained from his own letters  indeed i should be much obliged if you would kindly exercise your influence to persuade him that he is not in a condition to be imprudent with impunity  sir miles oakstead was absolutely shocked to see the alteration in his appearance as well as in his spirits and although both our kind host and hostess are most solicitous on his account it happens unfortunately that they are at this juncture quite alone so that he is without companions of his own age  i must not however alarm you  the fact is that circumstances have occurred which though he has acted in the most exemplary manner have harassed and distressed him a good deal and his health suffers from the difficulty of taking sufficient exercise james will triumph when he hears that i regret having shortened his stay by the seaside for neither the place nor the weather seems to agree with him he has had a recurrence of wakeful nights and is very languid  poor boy yesterday he wandered out alone in the rain lost his way and came home so fatigued that he slept for three hours on the sofa but today he seems betterhas more colour and has been less silent  we go to leffingham castle from monday till thursday when i shall take him to london for hastings to decide whether it be fit for him to return to christchurch after the vacation according to his own most anxious wish  with my love to mary ponsonby and her daughter and best remembrances to james                                       your affectionate nephew

1847that correct date must be a sign that he is getting into harness  well dear aunt kitty to make a transition from the third to the first person like mrs norris you have in this short scene an epitome of the last fortnight  lady oakstead is an honourable matron whom i pity for having me in her way a man unable to be got rid of by the lawful exercises of shooting and riding and with a father always consulting her about him and watching every look and movement till the blood comes throbbing to my temples by the mere attraction of his eyes  to be watched into a sense of impatience and ingratitude is a trial of life for which one is not prepared  my father and sir miles are very busy i hang here an anomaly sitting with them as being less in their way than in lady oaksteads and wondering what i shall be twenty years hence  i am sick of the only course of life that will content my father and i can see no sunshine likely to brighten it but at least no ones happiness is at stake but my own  here is a kind cordial letter from lady conway pressing me to join her at scarborough make expeditions c  my father is in such a state about me that i believe i could get his consent to anything but i suppose it would not be fair and i have said nothing to him as yet  on monday we go to leffingham which i hear is formality itself  after that more state visits unless i can escape to oxford  my father fancies me not well enough but pray unite all the forces of the terrace to impress that nothing else will do me any good  dragging about in this dreary heartless way is all that ails me and reading for my degree would be the best cure  i mean to work hard for honours and if possible delude myself with hopes of success  work is the need here there is this one comfort  there is no one to talk to no birds in last years nest sons absent daughters disposed of but unluckily the pastoress under a mistaken sense of kindness has asked the vicars son to walk with me and he is always lying in waitan ensign in a transition state between the sheepish schoolboy and the fast man with an experience of three months of depot  having roused him from the pristine form i regret the alternative  did i ever write so savage a letter  dont let it vex you or i wont send it  what a bull  there is such a delectable scotch mist that no one will suspect me of going out and i shall actually cheat the ensign and get a walk in solitude to hearten me for the dismal state dinner party of the evening  october 14this it in the book of fate that i should always treat this rosecoloured pastor like a carrion crow  i have done it again and it has but brought out more of my fathers marvellous kindness and patience  i plunged into the scotch mist unsuspected and unpursued  the visible ebullition of discontent had so much disgusted me that i must needs see whether anything could be done with it and fairly face the matter as i can only do in a walk  pillow counsel is feverish and tumultuous one is hardly master of oneself  the soft cool mistladen air heavy but incensebreathing was a far more friendly adjunct in the quiet decay of naturemournful but not foul nor corrupt because man had not spoilt it  it suited me better than a sunny glaring day such as i used to revel in and the brightness of which last spring made me pine to be in the free air  such days are past with me i had better know that they are and not strive after them  personal happiness is the lure not the object in this world  i have my northwold home and i am beginning to see that my fathers comfort depends on me as i little imagined and sufficiently to sweeten any sacrifice  so i have written to refuse scarborough for there is no use in trying to combine two things pleasing my father and myself  i wish the determination may last but mine have never been good for much and you must help me  neither thinking nor fog conduced to seeing where i was going and when my ankle began to give out and i was going to turn i ran into a hedge which looming through the mist i had been taking for a fine range of distant mountainsrather my way of dealing with other objects  being without a horse on whose neck to lay the reins i could only coast the hedge hoping it might lead me back to oakstead park which i had abandoned in my craving for space and dread of being dogged by the ensign  but the treacherous hedge led me nowhere but to a horsepond and when i had struggled out of the adjacent mire and attained a rising ground i could only see about four yards square of bare down all the rest being grey fog  altogether the scene was worth something  i heard what i thought the tinkling of a sheep bell through the cloud which dulled the sound like cotton wool i pursued the call when anon the veil began to grow thin and revealed looking just like a transparency a glimpse of a little village in a valley almost under my feet trees river churchspire and all and the bell became clearer and showed me what kind of flock it was meant for  i turned that way and had just found a path leading down the steep when down closed the clouda natural dissolving viewleaving me wondering whether it had been mirage or imagination till presently the curtain drew up in earnest  out came not merely form but colour as i have seen a camera clear itselfblue sky purple hills russet and orange woods a great elm green picked out with yellow a mass of brown oaks a scarlet maple a beech grove skirting a brilliant water meadow with a most reflective stream running through it and giving occasion for a single arched bridge and a water mill with a wheel draperied with white foam two swans disporting on the water i would not declare they were not geese a few cottony flakes of mist hanging over damp corners the hill rising green with the bright whitewashed cottages of this district on the side a rich red sandstonecoloured church late architecture tower rather moulderingall the more picturesque churchyard all white headstones and ochreous sheep surmounted by a mushroomshaped dark yew tree railed in with intensely white rails the whole glowing in the parting coupdesoleil of a wet day every tear of every leaf glistening and everything indescribably lustrous it is a picture that ones mental photograph ought to stamp for life and the cheering and interest it gave no one but you can understand i wished for you i know  it looks so poor in words  after the service i laid hold of the urchin whose hearty stare had most reminded me of tom madison and gave him a shilling to guide me back to oakstead a wise measure for down came the cloud blotting all out like the castle of st john and by the time i came home it was pitch dark and raining hard and my poor father was imagining me at the foot of another precipice  i was hoping to creep up in secret but they all came out fell upon me lady oakstead sent me tea and ordered me to rest and so handsomely did i obey that when next i opened my eyes and saw my father waiting as i thought for me to go down to dinner with him i found he had just come up after the ladies had quitted the diningroom  so kind and so little annoyed did he seem that i shook myself to be certified that i had broken no more bones but it was all sheer forbearance and considerationenough to go to ones heartwhen it was the very thing to vex him most  with great penitence i went down and the first person i encountered was the very curate i had seen in my misterious village much as if he had walked out of a story book on fraternizing i found him to be a friend of holdsworth  lady oakstead is going to take me this afternoon to see his church c thoroughly and behold i learn from him that she is a notable woman for doing good in her parish never so happy as in trotting to cottages though her good deeds are always in the background thereupon i ventured to attack her this morning on cottage garniture and obtained the very counsel i wanted about ovens and piggeries we began to get on together and she is to put me up to all manner of information that i want particularly  i must go now not to keep her waiting never mind the first half of my letteri have no time to cancel it now  i find my father wants to put in a note dont believe a word that he says for i am much better today body and mind        goosey goosey gander      where shall we wander   anywhere everywhere to remain still                      your most affectionate                                     fits gosling   dear aunt kitty  one of her failings was never to be able to keep a letter to herself  she fairly cried over her boys troubles and mrs ponsonby would not have known whether to laugh or cry but for jamess doleful predictions which were so sentimental as to turn even his grandmother to the laughing party and left him no sympathizer but mary who thought it very hard and cruel to deride louis when he was trying so earnestly to be good and suffering so much  why should they allaunt catharine herselfbe merry over his thinking the springdays of his life past away and trying so nobly and patiently to resign himself  it is the way of the world mary said james  people think they are laughing at the mistaking a flock of sheep for the army of pentapolin of the naked arm when they are really sneering at the lofty spirit taking the weaker side  they involve the sublime temper in the ridiculous accident and laugh both alike to scorn  not mamma and aunt catharine said mary  besides is not half the harm in the world done by not seeing where the sublime is invaded by the ridiculous  i see nothing ridiculous in the matter said james  his father has demanded an unjustifiable sacrifice  fitzjocelyn yields and suffers  i do believe lord ormersfield must relent you see how pleased he is saying that louiss conduct is exemplary  he would sacrifice a dozen sons to one prejudice  perhaps miss conway will overcome the prejudice  i am sure if he thinks louiss conduct exemplary louis must have the sort of happiness he used to wish for most and his father would do his very best to gratify him  that sentence was marys cheval de bataille in her discussions with james who could never be alone with her without broaching the subject the two cousins often walked together during jamess month at northwold  the town church was not very efficiently served and was only opened in the morning and late evening on sundays without any afternoon prayers and james was often in the habit of walking to ormersfield church for the three oclock service and asking mary to join him  their return was almost always occupied in descriptions of miss conways perfections and mary learnt to believe that two beings evidently compounded of every creatures best must be destined for each other  how well it is she thought that i did not stand in the way  oh how unhappy and puzzled i should be now  how thankful i am that dear mamma understood all for us so well  how glad i am that louis is waiting patiently not doing anything selfwilled  as long as his father says he is exemplary it must make one happy and mamma will convince lord ormersfield  it will all turn out well and how delightful it will be to see him quite happy and settled  mary and her mother had by this time taken root at dynevor terrace and formed an integral part of the inhabitants  their newspaper went the round of the houses their name was sent to the northwold bookclub and enrolled among the subscribers to local charities and miss mercy faithfull found that their purse and kitchen would bear deeper hauls than she could in general venture upon  mary was very happy working under her and was a welcome and cheerful visitor to the many sick aged and sorrowful to whom she introduced her  if mary could only have induced aunt melicent to come and see with her own eyes to know mrs frost and the faithfull sisters and above all to see mamma in her own house she thought one of her most eager wishes would have been fulfilled  but invite as she and her mother might they could not move miss ponsonby from bryanstone square  railroads and country were both her dread and she was not inclined to overcome her fears on behalf of a sisterinlaw whom she forgave but could not love  you must give it up my dear said mrs ponsonby  i let the time for our amalgamation pass  melicent and i were not tolerant of each other  since she has given you back to me i can love and respect her as i never did before but a little breach in youth becomes too wide in age for either repentance or your affection my dear to be able to span it  mary saw what a relief it was that the invitations were not accepted and though she was disappointed she blamed herself for having wished otherwise  tranquillity was such a boon to that wearied spirit each day was so much gain that went by without the painful fluttered look of distress and never had mrs ponsonby had so much quiet enjoyment with her daughter and her aunt  mary was perfectly contented in seeing her better and had no aims beyond the present trivial commonplace life with so many to help by little ordinary services and her mother serene and comfortable  placid and yet active she went busily through the day and did not forget the new pleasures to which louis had opened her mind  she took up his books without a pang and would say briskly and unblushingly to her mother how strange it was that before she had been with him she had never liked at all what she now cared for so much  the winter portended no lack of excitement  miss faithfulls rooms were engaged  when miss mercy ran in breathless to mrs frost with the tidings she little knew what feelings were excited the hope and fear the doubt and curiosity the sense of guilt towards the elder nephew in not preventing what she could not prevent the rejoicing on behalf of the younger nephew the ladylike scorn of the motives that brought the lodgers yet the warm feeling towards what was dear to louis and admired by jem  what a flapping and battering of carpets on the muchenduring stump what furious activity of martha  what eager help of little charlotte who was in a perfect trepidation of delight at the rumour that a real beauty fit for a heroine was coming  what trotting hither and thither of miss mercy  what netting of blinds and stitching of chintz by miss salome  what envy and contempt on the part of other landladies on hearing that miss faithfulls apartments were engaged for the whole winter  what an anxious progress was miss mercys when she conducted mrs frost and mary to a final inspection and what was her triumph when mary sitting down on the wellstuffed armchair pronounced that people who would not come there did not understand what comfort was  every living creature gazedmrs frost through her blind mary behind her hydrangea in the balcony charlotte from her attic windowwhen the lodgers disembarked in full forcetwo ladies two children one governess three maids two men two horses one king charless spaniel  let it be what it might it was a grand windfall for the miss faithfulls  marys heart throbbed as the first carriage thundered upon the gravel and a sudden swelling checked her voice as she was about to exclaim there she is when the second lady emerged and moved up the garden path  she was veiled and mantled but accustomed as was marys eye to the spanish figure and walk the wonderful grace of movement and deportment struck her as the very thing her eye had missed ever since she left peru  what the rest of the strangers were like she knew not she had only eyes for the creature who had won louiss affection and doubtless deserved it as all else that was precious  so they are come charlotte said mrs frost as the maiden demurely brought in the kettle  yes maam and stooping to put the kettle on and growing carnationcoloured over the fire  oh maam i never saw such a young lady  she is all one as the kings sister in the lord of the isles  while the object of all this enthusiasm was arriving at the terrace she was chiefly conscious that sir roland was sinking down on the ramparts of acre desperately wounded in the last terrible siege and she was considering whether palmer or minstrel should carry the tidings of his death to adeline  it was her refuge from the unpleasant feelings with which she viewed the experiment of the northwold baths upon louisas health  as the carriage stopped she cast one glance at the row of houses they struck her as dreary and dilapidated she drew her mantle closer shivered and walked into the house  small rooms dingy furniturethat is mammas affair passed through her mind as she made a courteous acknowledgment of miss mercys greeting and stood by the drawingroom fire  roland slowly awoke from his swoon a whiterobed old man with a red eightpointed cross on his breast was bending over him  he knew himself to be ini cant remember which tower the hospitallers defended  i wonder whether marianne can find the volume of vertot  isabel isabel shrieked virginia who with louisa had been roaming everywhere here is a discovery in the schoolroom  come  it was an old framed print of a large house as much of a sham castle as the nature of things would permit and beneath were the words cheveleigh the seat of roland dynevor esquire  there cried virginia you see it is a castle a dear old feudal castle  think of that isabel  why it is as good as seeing sir roland himself to have seen mr dynevor frost disinherited  oh if his name were only roland instead of that horrid james  his initials are j r said isabel  it is a curious coincidence  it only wants an adeline to have the castle now said louisa  oh there shall be an heiress and she shall be beautiful and he shant go crusadinghe shall marry her  the sisters had not been aware that the schoolroom maid who had been sent on to prepare was busy unpacking in a corner of the room they say miss louisa she interposed that mr frost is going to be married to a great heiresshis cousin miss ponsonby at no 7  isabel requited the forwardness by silently leaving the room with the sisters and virginia apologized for not having been more cautious than to lead to such subjects  it is all gossip she said angrily  mr dynevor would never marry for money  nay let us find in her an adeline said isabel  the next day miss mercy had hurried into no 7 to declare that the ladies were all that was charming but that their servants gave themselves airs beyond credence especially the butler who played the guitar and insisted on a second table when there was a peal of the bell and mary from her post of observation really believed it was lady conway herself whereupon miss mercy without listening to persuasions popped into the back drawing room to effect her retreat  lady conway was all eagerness and cordiality enchanted to renew her acquaintance venturing so early a call in hopes of prevailing on mrs ponsonby to come out with her to take a drive  she conjured up recollections of marys childhood declared that she looked to her for drawing isabel out and was extremely kind and agreeable  mary thought her delightful with something of louiss charm of manner and mrs ponsonby believed it no acting for lady conway was sincerely affable and affectionate with great warmth and kindness and might have been all that was excellent had she started into life with a different code of duty  so there was to be an intimacy  for fitzjocelyns sake as well as for the real goodnature of the advances mrs ponsonby would not shrink back more than befitted her selfrespect  of that quality she had less than mrs frost who with her innate punctilious spirit avoided all favours or patronage  it was curious to see the gentle old lady fire up with all the dignity of the pendragons at the least peril of incurring an obligation and though perfectly courteous easy and obliging she contrived to keep at a greater distance than if she had been mistress of cheveleigh  there she would have remembered that both she and lady conway were aunts to louis at northwold her care was to become beholden for nothing that she could not repay  lady conway did her best when driving out with mrs ponsonby to draw her into confidence  there were tender reminiscences from her heart of poor sweet louisa tearful inquiries respecting her last weeks certainties that mrs ponsonby had been of great use to her for poor darling she had been thoughtlessso much to turn her head  there was cause for regret in their own educationthere was then so much less attention to essentials  lady conway could not have borne to bring up her own girls as she herself and her sisters had grown up she had chosen a governess who made religion the first object and she was delighted to see them all so attached to her she had never had any fears of their being too seriouspeople had learnt to be reasonable now did not insist on the impracticable did not denounce moderate gaieties as had once been done to the alarm of poor louisa  sweetest louisas son  she could not speak too warmly of him and she declared herself highly gratified by mr mansells opinion of his modesty attention and good sense  mr mansell was an excellent judge he had such as opinion of lord ormersfields public character  and at a safe interval she mentioned the probability that beauchastel might be settled on isabel if she should marry so as to please mr mansell he cared for connexion more than for wealth if he had a weakness it was for rank  mrs ponsonby thought it fair that the earl should be aware of these facts  he smiled ironically  he left his card with his sisterinlaw and to have it over while louis was safe at oxford invited the party to spend a day at ormersfield with mrs frost to entertain them  he was far too considerate of the feelings that he attributed to the ponsonbys to ask them to come and as three out of the six in company were more or less in a state of haughtiness and coolness lady conways graces failed entirely and poor innocent virginia and louisa protested that they had never spent so dull a day and that they could not believe their cousin fitzjocelyn could belong to such a tiresome place  isabel who had undergone more dull days than they had contrived to get through it by torturing adeline with utter silence of all tidings from the east and by a swarm of suitors with the fantastic viscount foremost  she never was awake from her dream until mr holdsworth came to dinner and was so straightforward and easy that he thawed every one  afterwards he never failed to return an enthusiastic reply to the question that all the neighbourhood were asking each othernamely whether they had seen miss conway  no one was a more devoted admirer than the lady of eschalott whose webs had a bad chance when there was one glimpse of miss conway to be obtained from the window and the vision of whose heart was that mrs martha might some day let her stand in the housemaids closet to behold her idol issue forth in the full glory of an evening dressa thing charlotte had read of but never seen anything nearer to it than miss walby coming to tea and her own miss clara in the scantiest of all white muslins  but mrs martha was in an unexampled state of vixenish crossness and snapped venomously at mild mrs beckett for the kindest offers of sparing charlotte to assist her in her multiplied labours  she seemed to be running after time all day long with five dinners and teas upon her hands poor woman and allowing herself not the slightest relaxation except to rush in for a few seconds to no 7 to indulge herself by inveighing against the whole of the fine servants and yet she was so proud of having lodgers at all that she hated them for nothing so much as for threatening to go away  the object of her bitterest invectives was the fastidious butler mr delaford who by her account could do nothing for himself grudged her mistresses their very sittingroom drank wine with the ladies maids like a gentleman and ordered fish for the second table talked of having quitted a duke and submitting to live with lady conway because he compassionated unprotected females and my lady was dependent on him for the care of sir walter in the holidays  to crown his offences he never cleaned his own plate but drew sketches and played the guitar moreover mrs martha had her notions that he was making that sickly frenchified maid of miss conways much too fond of him and as to his calling himself mr delafordwhy mrs martha had a shrewd suspicion that he was some kin to her first cousins brotherinlaws shopmans wife in tottenhamcourtroad whose name she knew was ford and who had been picked out of a gutter  the establishment of such a fact appeared as if it would be the triumph of mrs marthas life  in the meantime she more than hinted that she would wear herself to the bone rather than let charlotte arnold into the house and jane generally assenting though seldom going all lengths used to divert the conversation by comparisons with mr framptons politeness and consideration  he never came to no 5 to give trouble only to help  the invectives produced on charlottes mind an effect the reverse of what was intended  mr delaford a finer gentleman than mr frampton and mr poynings must be a wonder of nature  the guitarredolent of serenades and spanish cloaksoh but once to see and hear it the very rudeness of mrs marthas words so often repeated gave her a feeling in favour of their object  she had known mrs martha unjust before poor tom if he had only been a spaniard he would have sung about the white dovehis pretty thoughtin a serenade but then he might have poignarded mr james in his passion which would have been less agreeableshe supposed he had forgotten her long agoand so much the better  it was a sunday evening  every one was gone to church except charlotte who was left to keep house  though november it was not cold the day had been warm and showery and the full moon had risen in the most glorious brightness riding in a sky the blue of which looked almost black by contrast with her brilliancy  charlotte stood at the back door gazing at the moon walking in brightness and wandered into the garden to enjoy what to her was beyond all other delights reading gessners death of abel by moonlight  there was quite sufficient light even if she had not known the idyll almost by heart and in a trance of dreamy undefined delight she stood beside the dark ivycovered wall each leaf glistening in the moonbeams which shed a subdued pearliness over her white apron and collar paled but gave a shadowy refinement to her features and imparted a peculiar soft golden gloss to the fair braids of hair on her modest brow  a sound of opening the back gate made her give one of her violent starts but before she could spring into the shelter of the house she was checked by the civil words i beg your pardon i was mistakeni took this for no 8  three doors off began charlotte discovering with a shy thrill of surprise and pleasure that she had been actually accosted by the great mr delaford and the moonlight quite as becoming to him as to her made him an absolute italian count tall dark pale and whiskered he did not go away at once he lingered and said softly i perceive that you partake my own predilection for the moonlight hour  charlotte would have been delighted had it not been a great deal harder to find an answer than if the old lord had asked her a question but she simpered and blushed which probably did just as well  mr delaford supposed she knew the poets lines       how sweet the moonlight sleeps on yonder bank   oh yes sirso sweet exclaimed the lady of eschalott under her breath though yonder bank was only represented by the chequerwork of mrs ponsonbys latticed trellis and mr delaford proceeded to quote the whole passage in a deep mellow voice but with a great deal of affectation and charlotte gasped so beautiful  i perceive that you have a fine taste for poetry said mr delaford so graciously that charlotte presumed to say oh sir is it true that you can play the guitar  he smiled upon her tone of veneration and replied a triflea little instrumental melody was a great resource  if his poor performance would afford her any gratification he would fetch his guitar  oh sirthank youa psalmtune perhaps  it is sundayif you would be so kind  he smiled superciliously as he regretted that his music was not of that description and charlotte felt ready to sink into the earth at the indignity she had done the guitar in forgetting that it could accompany anything but such songs as valancourt sang to emily  she begged his pardon humbly and he declared that he had a great respect for a ladys scruples and should be happy to meet her another evening  if mrs beckett would allow her said charlotte overpowered with gratitude there would be the moon full tomorrowhow delightful  he could spare a short interval between the dinner and the tea and with this promise he took leave  honest little charlotte told mrs beckett the whole story and all her eager wishes for tomorrow evening and jane sighed and puzzled herself and knew it would make martha very angry but could not help being goodnatured  jane had a great deference for marthas strong rough character but then martha had never lived in a great house and did not know what was what nor the difference between low people and upper servants   so jane acted chaperon as far as her easy discretion went and had it to say to her own conscience and to the angry martha that he never said one word that need offend any young woman  there was a terrible storm belowstairs in the house beautiful at the idea of delaford taking up with mrs frosts little kitchenmaiddelaford the ladysmaid killer par excellence wherever lady conway went and whose coquetries whitened the cheeks of miss conways poor marianne the object of his attentions whenever he had no one else in view  he had not known charlotte to be a kitchenmaid when he first beheld her and her fair beauty and retiring grace had had full scope assisted by her veneration for himself and now the scorn of the grand mrs fanshawe and the amusement of teasing marianne only made him the more bent on patronizing the little rustic as he called her  he was deferential to mrs beckett who felt herself in her element in discussing plate china and large establishments with him and he lent books talked poetry and played the guitar to charlotte and even began to take her portrait with her mouth all on one side  delaford was an admirable servant said the whole conway family he was trusted as entirely as he represented and lady conway often gave him charge over her son in sports and expeditions beyond ladies management he was in effect nearly the ruler of the household and never allowed his lady to go anywhere if he did not approve  if it had not been for the little rustics attractions perhaps he might have made strong demonstrations against the house beautiful  little did miss faithfull know the real cause of her receiving or retaining her lodgers     chapter xv  motley the only wear    for better far than passions glow     or aught of worldly choice   to listen his own will to know     and listening hear his voice                   the angel of marriagerev i williams   the friendships that grew up out of sight were far more effective than anything that lady conway could accomplish on the stage  miss king and the miss faithfulls found each other out at once and the governess was entreated to knock at the door at the bottom of the stairs whenever her pupils could spare her  then came eager wishes from her pupils to be admitted to the snuggery and they were invited to see the curiosities  isabel believed the very good was found and came with her sisters  she begged to be allowed to help in their parish work under miss mercy faithfulls guidance and sir roland stood still while she fancied she was learning to make little frocks but really listening to their revelations of so new a world  she went out with miss mercyshe undertook a class and a district and began to be happier than ever before though how much of the absolute harder toil devolved on miss king neither she nor the governess understood  this led to intercourse with mary ponsonby and isabel was a very different person in that homely friendly parlour from the lofty frigid miss conway of the drawingroom  cold hauteur melted before marys frank simplicity and they became friends as fast as two ladies could beyond the age of romantic plunges where on one side there was goodwill without enthusiasm on the other enthusiasm and reserve they called each other miss conway and miss ponsonby and exchanged no family secrets but they were for all that faster friends than young ladies under twenty might imagine  one winters day the crisp exhilarating frost had lured them far along the high road beyond mr calcotts park palings talking over isabels favourite theme what to wish for her little brother when the sound of a large clock striking three made isabel ask where she was  it was the stable clock at ormersfield said mary did you not know we were on that road  no i did not  and isabel would have turned but mary begged her to take a few steps up the lane that they might see how lord fitzjocelyns new cottages looked  isabel complied and added after a pause are you one of lord fitzjocelyns worshippers  i should not like to worship any one said mary looking straightforward  i am very fond of him because i have known him all my life  and he is so good  then i think i may consider you exempt  it is the only fault i have to find with northwold  you are the only person who does not rave about himthe only person who has not mentioned his name  have i not  i think that was very unkind of me  very kind to me said isabel  i meant to him said mary blushing if you thought that i did not think most highly of him  dont go on  i was just going to trust to you for a calm dispassionate statement of his merits and i shall soon lose all my faith in you  my mother began mary but just then lord ormersfield came forth from one of the cottages and encountered the young ladies  he explained that fitzjocelyn was coming home next week and he had come to see how his last orders had been executed since frampton and the carpenter had sometimes chosen to think for themselves  he was very anxious that all should be right and after a few words revealed a perplexity about ovens and boilers in which marys counsel would be invaluable  so with apologies and ceremonies to miss conway they entered and isabel stood waiting in the dull kitchen smelling of raw plaster wondering at the extreme eagerness of the discussion with the mason over the yawning boiler the earl referring to his sons letter holding it halfayard off and at last giving it to mary to decipher by the waning light  so far had it waned that when the fixtures had all been inspected lord ormersfield declared that the young ladies must not return alone and insisted on escorting them home  every five minutes some one thought of something to say there was an answer and by good luck a rejoinder then all died away and mary pondered how her mother would in her place have done something to draw the two together but she could not  she feared the walk had made isabel more adverse to all connected with ormersfield than even previously for the ormersfield road was avoided and the question as to fitzjocelyns merits was never renewed  mary thought his cause would be safest in the hands of his great champion who was coming home from oxford with him and was to occupy his vacation in acting tutor to little sir walter conway  louis came the day after his return with his father to make visits in the terrace and was as wellbehaved and uninteresting as morning calling could make him   he was looking very wellhis general health quite restored and his ankle much better though he was still forbidden to ride and could not walk far  you must come and see me aunt kitty he said i am not available for coming in to see you  im reading and ive made a resignation of myself he added with a slight blush and debonnaire shrug glancing to see that his father was occupied with james  they were to dine with lady conway on the following tuesday  in the interim no one beheld them except jem who walked to ormersfield once or twice for some skating for his little pupil walter and came back reporting that louis had sold himself body and soul to his father  clara came home a degree more civilized and burning to confide to louis that she had thought of his advice had been the less miserable for it and had much more on which to consult him  she could not conceive why even grandmamma would not consent to her accompanying the skaters though she was giving herself credit for protesting that she was not going on the ice only to keep poor louis company while the others were skating  she was obliged to defer her hopes of seeing him until tuesday when she had been asked to drink tea in the schoolroom and appear in the evening  mrs frost had consented as a means of exempting herself from the party  and claras incipient feminine nature began to flutter at her first gaiety  the event was magnified by a present from jem of a broad rosecoloured sash and white muslin dress with a caution that she was not to consider the tucks up to the waist as a provision for future growth  she flew to exhibit the finery to the miss faithfulls and to consult on the makingup and to her consternation was caught by miss conway kneeling on the floor being measured by miss salome  to isabel there was a sort of touching novelty in the simplicity that could glory in pink ribbon when embellished by being a brothers gift she looked on with calm pleasure at such homely excitement and even fetched some bows of her own for examples and offered to send marianne down with patterns  clara was enchanted to recognise in miss conway the vision of the eustonsquare platform  the grand quiet style of beauty was exactly fitted to impress a mind like hers so strongly imbued with sentiments like those of louis and regarding isabel as necessarily louiss destiny she began to adore her accordingly with a girlreverence quite as profound far more unselfish and little less ardent than that of man for woman  that a female vision of perfection should engross claras imagination was a step towards softening her but poor child the dawn of womanhood was to come in a painful burst  surprised at her own aspect with her light hair dressed by jane and wreathed with ivy leaves by grandmamma and her skirts so full that she could not refrain from making a gigantic cheese she was inspected and admired by granny and jane almost approved by jem himself and exalted by the consciousness of being welldressed she repaired to the schoolroom tea at the house beautiful  virginia and louisa were she thought very poor imitations of louiss countenancethe one too round the other too thin and sallow but both they their brother and miss king were so utterly unlike anything at school that she was at once at ease and began talking with walter over schoolboy fun in which he could not be a greater proficient than herself  walter struck up a violent friendship for her on the spot and took to calling her a fellow in oblivion of her sex and virginia and louisa fell into ecstasies of laughter which encouraged clara and walter to compote with each other which should most astonish their weak minds  in the drawingroom lady conway spoke so graciously that clara was quite distressed at looking over her head  mary looked somewhat oppressed saying her mother had not been so well that day and she was disposed to keep in the background and occupy herself with clara but it was quite contrary to the giraffes notions to be engrossed by any one when louis was coming  as if she had divined marys intentions of keeping her from importuning him she was continually gazing at the door ready at once to claim his attention  at first the gentlemen only appeared in a black herd at the door where mr calcott had stopped lord ormersfield short in his eagerness to impress on him the views of the county on a policebill in course of preparation for the next session  the other magistrates congregated round but james frost and sydney calcott had slipped past to the piano where lady conway had sent miss calcott and isabel  why did not fitzjocelyn come too was murmured by the young group in the recess opposite the door and when at last he became visible leaning against the wall listening to the squire virginia declared he was going to serve them just as he used at beauchastel  oh no he shantill rescue him exclaimed clara and leaping up to her cameleopard attitude she sprang forward and with a voice audible in an unlucky lull of the music she exclaimed louis louis dont you see that i am here  as he turned with a look of surprise and almost rebuke her own words came back to her ears as they must have sounded to others her face became poppycoloured nothing light but her flaxen eyebrows and she scarcely gave her hand to be shaken  no i did not know you were coming he said and almost partaking her confusion as he felt all eyes upon her he looked in vain for a refuge for her  how welcome was marys kind face and quiet gesture covering poor claras retreat as she sank into a dark nook sheltered by the old black cabinet  louis thanked mary by a look as much as to say just like you and was glad to perceive that james had not been present he had gone to ask miss faithfull to supply the missing stanzas of a jacobite song and just then returned saying that she knew them but could not remember them  fitzjocelyn however capped the fragment and illustrated it with some anecdotes that interested miss conway  james had great hopes that she was going to see him to the best advantage but still there was a great drawback in the presence of sydney calcott  idolized at home successful abroad young calcott had enough of the prig to be a perpetual irritation to jem frost all the more because he could never make louis resent nor accept as other than natural the goodnatured supercilious patronage of the steady distinguished senior towards the idle junior  jacobite legends and stuart relics would have made miss conway oblivious of everything else but sydney calcott must needs divert the conversation from that channel by saying ah there fitzjocelyn is in his element  he is a perfect handbook to the byways of history  for the diffusion of useless knowledge said louis  illustrated by the examination when the only fact you could adduce about the argonauts was that charles v founded the order of the golden fleece  i beg your pardon it was his greatgrandfather  i had read my quentin durward too well for that  i suspect said isabel that we had all rather be examined in our quentin durward than our charles v  ah said young calcott i had all my dates at my fingers ends when i went up for the modern history prize  now my sister could beat me  a proof of what i always say observed louis that it is lost labour to read for an examination  from personal experience asked sydney  a strasburg goose nailed down and crammed before a fire becomes a strasburg pie said louis  never did isabel look more bewildered and sydney did not seem at once to catch the meaning  james added a goose destined to fulfil the term of existence is not crammed but the pie stimulus is not required to prevent it from starving  is your curious and complimentary culinary fable aimed against reading or against examinations asked sydney  against neither only against the connecting preposition  then you mean to find a superhuman set of students  no im past that  men and examinations will go on as they are the goose will run wild the requirements will be increased he will nail himself down in his despair and he who crams hardest and has the hottest place will gain  then how is the labour lost asked isabel  you are new to fitzjocelyns paradoxes said sydney as if glorying in having made louis contradict himself  the question is what is lost labour said louis  both sydney calcott and miss conway looked as if they thought he was arguing on after a defeat  calcott is teaching her his own obtuseness thought james in a pet and he exclaimed is the aim to make men or winners of prizes  the aim of prizes is commonly supposed to be to make men loftily observed sydney  exactly so and therefore i would not make them too analogous to the strasburg system said louis  i would have them close searching but not admitting of immediate cramming  pray how would you bring that about  by having no subject on which superficial knowledge could make a show  oh  i see whither you are working round  that wont do now my dear fellow we must enlarge our field or we shall lay ourselves open to the charge of being narrowminded  you have not strength of mind to be narrowminded said louis shaking his head  ah well i have no more to say my trust is in the narrow mind the only expansive one  he was at that moment called away lord ormersfields carriage had been announced and his son was not in a quarter of the room where he wished to detain him  james could willingly have bitten sydney calcott for the observation poor fitzjocelyn he came out strong tonight  very clever said isabel wishing to gratify james  oh yes very if he had ever taken pains said sydney  there is often something in his paradoxes  after all i believe he is reading hard for his degree is he not jem  his feelings would not be hurt by the question for he never piqued himself upon his consistency  luckily for the general peace the calcott household was on the move and jem solaced himself on their departure by exclaiming well done strasburg system  a highpower greekimbibing machine he may be but as to comprehending fitzjocelyn  nay said isabel i think lord fitzjocelyn ought to carry about a pocket expositor if he will be so very startling   he did not stay to tell us what to understand by narrow minds  did you ever hear of any one good for anything that was not accused of a narrow mind exclaimed james  if that were what he meant said isabelbut he said his trust was in the narrow mind  in what is popularly so called said james  i think said mary leaning forward and speaking low that he did not mean it to be explained away  i think he was going to say that the heart may be wide but the mind must be so far narrow that it will accept only the one right not the many wrong  i thought narrowness of mind consisted in thinking your own way the only right one said isabel  every one says so said mary and that is why he says it takes strength of mind to be narrowminded  is not the real evil the judging people harshly because their ways are not the same not the being sure that the one way is the only right  others may be better than ourselves and may be led right in spite of their error but surely we are not to think all paths alike  and is that lord fitzjocelyns definition of a narrow mind said isabel  it sounds like faith and love  are you sure you did not make it yourself miss ponsonby  i could not said mary blushing as she remembered one sunday evening when he had said something to that effect which had insensibly overthrown the theory in which she had been bred up namely that all the sincere were right and yet that practically every one was to be censured who did not act exactly like aunt melicent  she rose to take leave and clara clung to her emerging from the shade of her cabinet with colour little mitigated since her disappearance james would have come with them but was detained by lady conway for a few moments longer than it took them to put on their shawls and clara would not wait  she dragged mary down the steps into the darkness and groaned out o mary he can never speak to me again  my dear he will not recollect it  it was very awkward but new places and new people often do make us forget ourselves  everybody saw everybody heard  o i shall never bear to meet one of them again  i think very few saw or heard began mary  he did  i did  thats enough  the rest is nothing  i have been as bad as any one at school  i shall never hold up my head there again as i have done and louis  oh  dear child it will not be remembered  you only forgot how tall you were and that you were not at home  he knows you too well to care  james shouted from behind to know why they had not been let into the house and as clara rushed in at the door and he walked on with mary to leave her at home and fetch his grandmother who had been spending the evening with mrs ponsonby he muttered i dont know which is most intolerable  he neglects her talks what if it be not nonsense might as well be and as if she were not ready enough to misunderstand sydney calcott must needs thrust in his wits to embroil her understanding  mary cant you get her to see the stuff he is made of  if she cannot do that for herself no persuasion of mine will make her said mary  no you do not half appreciate him either  no one does  and yet you could if you tried do something with her  i see she does not think you prejudiced  you made an impression tonight  mary felt some consternation  could it depend on her   she could speak naturally and from her heart in defence of louis when occasion served but something within her forbade the thought of doing so on a system  was that something wrong  she could not answer but contented herself with the womanly intuition that showed her that anything of persuasion in the present state of affairs would be ineffectual and unbecoming  meantime clara had fled to her little room to bid her childhood farewell in a flood of bitter tears  exaggerated shame past disdain of the foibles of others the fancy that she was publicly disgraced and had forfeited louiss good opinion each thought renewed her sobs but the true pang was the perception that old times were passed for ever  he might forgive he would still be friend and cousin but womanhood had broken on her and shown that perfect freedom was at an end  happy for her that she wept but for the parting from a playfellow  happy that her feelings were young and undeveloped free from all the cruel permanence that earlier vanity or selfconsciousness might have given happy that it could be so freely washed away  when she had spent her sobs she could resolve to be wise and steady so as to be a fit governess to his children and the tears flowed at the notion of being so distant and respectful to his lordship  but what stories she could tell them of his boyhood  and in the midst ofnow my dears i will tell you about your papa when he was a little boy she fell asleep  that party was a thing to be remembered with tingling cheeks for life and clara dreaded her next meeting with louis but the days passed on without his coming to the terrace and the terror began to wear off especially as she did not find that any one else remembered her outbreak  mary guarded against any unfavourable impression by a few simple words to isabel and miss king as to the brotherly terms that had hitherto prevailed and poor claras subsequent distress clara came in for some of the bright tints in which her brother was viewed at the house beautiful walter was very fond of her and she had been drawn into a friendship for virginia cemented in the course of long walks when the schoolroom party always begged for mr and miss dynevor because no one else could keep walter from disturbing louisas nerves by teasing her pony or sliding on dubious ice  as mrs ponsonby often joined in lady conways drive mary and isabel were generally among the walkers and mary was considered by louisa as an inestimable ponyleader and an inexhaustible magazine of stories about sharks earthquakes llamas and icebergs  james and miss conway generally had either book or principle to discuss and were usually to be found somewhat in the rear either with or without miss king  one day however james gave notice that he should not be at their service that afternoon and as soon as walters lessons had been despatched he set out with rapid steps for ormersfield park clenching his teeth together every now and then with his determinate resolution that he would make louis know his own mind and would stand no nonsense  ah  james good morning said the earl as he presented himself in the study  you will find louis in his room  i wish you would make him come out with you  he is working harder than is good for him  he spoke of his son far differently from former times but jem only returned a judiciously intoned poor fellow  lord ormersfield looked at him anxiously and hesitating said you do not think him out of spirits  oh he carries it off very well  i know no one with so strong a sense of duty replied jem never compassionate to the father  again the earl paused then said he may probably speak more unreservedly to you than to me  he shuns the topic  he says there is no use in aggravating the feelings by discussion  he would fain submit in heart as well as in will  lord ormersfield sighed but did not appear disposed to say more and charitably hoping that a dagger had been implanted in him jem ran upstairs and found louis sitting writing at a table which looked as if mary had never been near it  jem  thats right  ive not seen you this age  what are you about  i wanted particularly some one to listen  it is an essay on the police  is this earnest  sober earnest  sir miles and all that set are anxious to bring the matter forward and my father has been getting it up as he does whatever he may have to speak upon  his eyes are rather failing for candlelight work so i have been helping him in the evening till it struck me that it was a curious subject to trace in historythe censors the attempts in germany and spain to supply the defective law the spanish and italian dread of justice  i became enamoured of the notion and when i have thrown all the hints together i shall try to take in my father by reading them to him as an article in the quarterly  oh very well if your soul is there that is an end of the matter  of what matter  things cannot run on in this way  it is not a thing to lay upon me to go on working in your cause with her when you will not stir a step in your own behalf  i am very much obliged to you but i never asked you to work in my cause  i beg your pardon jem dont fly into a welsh explosion  no one ever meant more kindly and generously he checked himself in amaze at the demonstration he had elicited but as it was not accompanied with words he continued no one can be more grateful to you than i but as far as i can see there is nothing for it but to be thankful that no more harm has been done and to let the matter drop and he dropped his hand with just so much despondency as to make jem think him worth storming at instead of giving him up and he went over the old ground of louis being incapable of true passion and unworthy of such a being if he could yield her without an effort merely for the sake of peace  i say jem said louis quietly all this was bad enough on neutral ground it is mere treason under my fathers own roof and i will have no more of it  then cried james with a strange light in his eyes you henceforth renounce all hopesall pretensions  i never had either hope or pretension  i do not cease to think her as i always did the loveliest creature i ever beheld  i cannot help that and the state i fell into after being with her on tuesday convinced me that it is safest to stay here and fill up time and thought as best i may  for once fitzjocelyn said james with a gravity not natural to him i think better of your father than you do  i would neither treat him as so tyrannical nor so prejudiced as your conduct supposes him  how  he is as kind as possible  we never had so much in common  yes  your submission so far and the united testimony of the terrace will soften him  show your true sentiments  a little steadiness and perseverance and you will prevail  dont make me feverish jem  a summons to lord fitzjocelyn to come down to a visitor in the library cut short the discussion and james took leave at once neither cousin wishing to resume the conversation  the darts had not been injudiciously aimed  the father and son were both rendered uneasy  they had hitherto been unusually comfortable together and though the life was unexciting louiss desire to be useful to his father and the pressing need of working for his degree kept his mind fairly occupied  though wistful looks might sometimes be turned along the northwold road when he sallied forth in the twilight for his constitutional walk he did not analyse which number of the terrace was the magnet and he avoided testing to the utmost the powers of his foot  the affection and solicitude shown for him at home claimed a full return nor had james been greatly mistaken in ascribing something to the facility of nature that yielded to force of character but jem had stirred up much that louis would have been contented to leave dormant and the hope that he had striven to excite came almost teazingly to interfere with the passive acquiescence of an indolent will  perturbed and doubtful he was going to seek counsel as usual of the open air as soon as the visitor was gone but his father followed him into the hall asking whither he was going  i do not know  i had been thinking of trying whether i can get as far as marksedge  marksedge would be fatal to the ankle solitude to the spirits thought the earl and he at once declared his intention of walking with his son as far as he should let him go  louis was half vexed half flattered and they proceeded in silence till conscious of being ruffled and afraid of being ungracious he made a remark on the farm that they were approaching and learnt in return that the lease was nearly out the tenant did not want a renewal and that richardson intended to advertise  he breathed a wish that it were in their own hands and this led to a statement of the condition of affairs the same to which a year before he had been wilfully deaf and to which he now attended chiefly for the sake of gratifying his father though he better understood what depended on it  at least it was making the earl insensible to the space they were traversing and the black outlines of marksedge were rising on him before he was aware  then he would have turned but louis pleaded that having come so far he should be glad to speak to madisons grandfather and one or two other old people and he prevailed  lord ormersfield was not prepared for the real aspect of the hamlet  richardson always declared that the cottages were kept in repair he said  richardson never sees them  he trusts to reeves  the people might do something themselves to keep the place decent  they might but they lose heart out of sight of respectability  i will just knock at this doori will not detain you a moment  the dark smoky room damp illpaved floor and cracked walls produced their effect and the name and voice of the inmate did more lord ormersfield recognised a man who had once worked in the garden and came forward and spoke astonished and shocked to find him prematurely old  the story was soon told there had been a seasoning fever as a welcome to the halfreclaimed moorland ague and typhus were frequent visitors and disabling rheumatism a more permanent companion to labourers exhausted by long wet walks in addition to the daily toil at an age less than that of the earl himself he beheld a bowed and broken cripple  fitzjocelyn perceived his victory and forebore to press it too hastily lest he should hurt his fathers feelings and walked on silently thinking how glad mary would be to hear of this expedition and what a pity it was that the unlucky passage of last august should have interfered with their comfortable friendship  at last the earl broke silence by saying it is very unfortunate and louis echoed very  my poor uncle dynevor  he was without exception the most wrongheaded person i ever came in contact with yet so excessively plausible and eager that he carried my poor father entirely along with him  louis nothing is so ruinous as to surrender the judgment  fully assenting louis wondered whether marksedge would serve no purpose save the elucidation of this truism and presently another ensued  mischief is sooner done than repaired  as i have been allowing you there has never been ready money at command  i thought there were no more mortgages to be paid off  the rents of the fitzjocelyn estate and the houses in the lower town must come to something  he was then told how these with his mothers fortune had been set apart to form a fund for his establishment and for the first time he was shown the object of arrangements against which he had often in heart rebelled  his first impulse was to exclaim that it was a great pity and that he could not bear that his father should have denied himself on his account  do you think these things are sacrifices to me said the earl  my habits were formed long ago  mine have been formed on yours said louis  i should be encumbered by such an income as you propose unless you would let me lay it out in making work for the men and improving the estate and that i had rather you undertook for i should be certain to do something preposterous and then be sorry  mrs ponsonby judged rightly  it was her very advice  then cried louis as if the deed were done  you would not find the income too large in the event of your marriage  a most unlikely event  his father glanced towards him if there had been a symptom of unhappiness relenting was near but it so chanced that marksedge was reigning supreme and he was chiefly concerned to set aside the supposition as an obstacle to his views  the same notion as james frosts occurred to the earl that it could not be a tenacious character which could so easily set aside an attachment apparently so fervent but the resignation was too much in accordance with his desires to render him otherwise than gratified and he listened with complacency to louiss plans  nothing was fixed but there was an understanding that all should have due consideration  this settled louiss mind recurred to the hint which his father had thrown out and he wondered whether it meant that the present compliance might be further stretched but he thought it more likely to be merely a reference to ordinary contingencies  things were far too comfortable between him and his father to be disturbed by discussion and he might ultimately succeed better by submitting and leaving facts and candour to remove prejudice  to forget perplexity in the amusement of a mystification he brought down his essay concealing it ingeniously within a review flanked by bluebooks and when lord ormersfield was taking out a pair of spectacles with the reluctance of a man not yet accustomed to them he asked him if he would like to hear an article on the police question  at first the earl showed signs of nodding and said there was nothing to the purpose in all the historical curiosities at the outset so that louis alarmed lest he should absolutely drop asleep skipped all his favourite passages and came at once to the results of the recent inquiries  the earl was roused  who could have learnt those facts that was tellingwell put but how did he get hold of it the very thing he had said himselfwhat quarterly was it  surely the christmas number was not out  hitherto louis had kept his countenance and voice but in an hiatus where he was trying to extemporize his father came to look over his shoulder to see what ailed the book and glancing upwards with a merry debonnaire face he made a gesture as if convicted  do you mean that this is your own composition  i beg your pardon for the pious fraud  it is very good  excellently done said lord ormersfield  there are redundanciesmuch to betray an unpractised handbutstay let me hear the rest very differently did he listen now broad awake attacking the logic of every third sentence or else double shotting it with some ponderous word and shaking his head at utopian views of crime to be dried up at the fountain head  next he must hear the beginning and ruthlessly picked it to pieces demolishing all the vehme gericht and santissima hermandad as irrelevant and when he had made louis ashamed and vexed with the whole production astonishing him by declaring that it would tell and advising him to copy it out fair with these little alterations  these little alterations would as he was well aware evaporate all the spirit and though glad to have pleased his father his perseverance quailed before the task but he said no more than thank you  the next day before he had settled to anything lord ormersfield came to his room saying you will be engaged with your more important studies for the next few hours  can you spare the paper you read to me last night  i can spare it better than you can read it i fear said louis producing a mass of blotted ms in all his varieties of penmanship and feeling a sort of despair at the prospect of being brought to book on all his details  his father carried it off and they did not meet again till late in the day when the first thing louis heard was i thought it worth while to have another opinion on your manuscript before rewriting it  i tried to read it to mrs ponsonby but we were interrupted and i left it with her  presently after  i have made an engagement for you  lady conway wishes that you should go to luncheon with her tomorrow  i believe she wants to consult you about some birthday celebration  louis was much surprised and somewhat entertained  when will you have the carriage pursued the earl  will not you come  no i am not wanted  in fact i do not see how you can be required but anything will serve as an excuse  in justice however i should add that our friends at the terrace are disposed to think well of the younger part of the family  except for the cold constraint of the tone louis could have thought much ground gained but he was sure that his holiday would be damped by knowing that it was conceded at the cost of much distress and uneasiness  going to northwold early enough for a call at no 5 he was greeted by mrs frost with my dear what have you been about  i never saw your father so much pleased in his life  he came in on purpose to tell me and i thought it exceedingly kind  so you took him in completely what an impudent rogue you always were  i never meant it to go beyond the study  i was obliged to write it down in selfdefence that i might know what he was talking of  i believe he expects you to be even with sydney calcott after all it is really very clever  where did you get all those funny stories  what you have gone and read it  ah ha  mrs ponsonby gave us a pretty little literary soiree dont be too proud it was only ourselves except that mary brought in miss conway  jem tried to read it but after he had made that spanish society into hammer men dead mary got it away from him and read through as if it had been in print  what an infliction  it is very disrespectful to think us so frivolous  we only wished all reviews were as entertaining  it is too bad when i only wanted to mystify my father  it serves you right for playing tricks  what have you been doing to him louis  you will turn him into a doting father before long  what have you done with clara  she goes every day to read italian with miss conway and the governess is so kind as to give her drawing lessons  she is learning far more than at school and they are so kind  i should hardly know how to accept it but jem does not object and he is really very useful there spends a great deal of time on the boy and is teaching the young ladies latin  they are leaving you lonely in the holidays  you ought to come to ormersfield your nephews would take better care of you  ah i have my marys  if i were only better satisfied about the dear old one  she is far less well than when she came  indeed  is mary uneasy  she says nothing but you know how her eye is always on her and she never seems to have her out of her thoughts  i am afraid they are worried about lima  from what oliver says i fear mr ponsonby goes on worse than ever without either his family or his appointment to be a restraint  i hope they do not know all  mary would not believe it that is one comfort  ah louis there are things that the heart will not believe but which cut it deeply  however if that could be any comfort to them he wishes them to spare nothing here  he tells them they may live at the rate of five thousand pounds ayear poor dears  indeed he and oliver are in such glory over their equatorial steam navigation that i expect next to hear of a crash  you dont look as if it would be a very dreadful sound  if it would only bring my poor oliver back to me  yesnothing would make jem so civil to him as his coming floated in on a plank wet through with a little bundle in one hand and a parrot in the other  mrs frost gave one of her tender laughs and filled up the picture jane would open the door jane would know master olivers black eyes in a momentno no  i must see him first  if he once looked up i could not miss him whatever colour he may have turned  i wonder whether he would know me  dont you know that you grow handsomer every year aunt kitty  dont flatter sir  well i most go to my aunt  he tarried to hear the welcome recital of all the kind deeds of the house of conway  he presently found lady conway awaiting him in the drawingroom and was greeted with great joy  that is well  i hoped to work on your father by telling him i did not approve of young men carrying industry too far  that is not my habit  then it is your excuse for avoiding troublesome relations  no not a word  i know nothing about the secret that occupied isabel at mrs ponsonbys select party  but i really wanted you  you are more au fait as to the society here than the ponsonbys and dynevors  ah when does that come off  what is to come off  miss ponsonby and mr dynevor  what a good creature he is  i cannot see much likelihood of it but you are more on the scene of action  she could do much better with such expectations but on his account i could not be sorry  it is shocking to think of that nice young sister being a governess  i think it a duty to give her every advantage that may tend to form her  with her connexions and education i can have no objection to her as a companion to your cousins and with a few advantages though she will never be handsome she might marry well they are a most interesting family isabel and i are most anxious to do all in our power for them  clara is obliged said louis with undetected irony but secret wonder at the dexterity with which the patronage must have been administered so as not to have made the interesting family fly off at a tangent  isabel made her appearance in her almost constant morning dress of soft dovecoloured merino entirely unadorned and looking more like a maiden in a romance than ever  she had just left adeline standing on the steps of a stone cross exhorting the provencals to arm against a descent of moorish corsairs and she held out her hand to fitzjocelyn much as adeline did when the fantastic viscount professed his intention of flying instead of fighting and wanted her to sit behind him on his courser  lady conway pronounced her council complete and propounded the fete which she wished to give on the 12th of january in honour of louisas birthday  isabel took up a pencil and was lost in sketching wayside crosses and vessels with lateen sails only throwing in a word or two here and there when necessary  dancing was still lady conway feared out of the question with fitzjocelyn  and always will be i suspect  so much for my bargain with clara to dance with her at her first ball  you like dancing exclaimed isabel rejoiced to find another resemblance to the fantastic viscount  last years yeomanry ball was the best fun in the world  there isabel said lady conway you ought to be gratified to find a young man candid enough to allow that he likes it  but since that cannot be i must find some other plan  what cannot be exclaimed louis  you dont mean to omit the dancing  it could not be enjoyed without you  your cousins and friends could not bear to see you sitting down  isabels lips were compressed and the foam of her waves laughed scornfully under her pencil  they must get accustomed to the melancholy spectacle said louis i do not mean to intermit the yeomanry ball if it take place while i am at home  the chaperons are the best company after all reconsider it my dear aunt or you will keep me from coming at all  lady conway was only considering of tableaux and louis took fire at the notion he already beheld waverley in his beloved yeomanry suit isabel as flora clara as davie gellatleythe character she would most appreciate  isabel roused herself to say that tableaux were very dull work to all save the actors and soon were mere weariness to them  her stepmother told her she had once been of a different mind when she had been isabel bruce kneeling in her cell the ring before her  i was young enough then to think myself isabel was her answer and she drew the more diligently because fitzjocelyn could not restrain an interjection and a look which meant what an isabel she must have been  she sat passive while lady conway and louis decked up a scene for flora macivor but presently it appeared that the waverley of the piece was to be according to louis not the proper owner of the yeomanry uniform but james frost  his aunt exclaimed and the rehearsals were strong temptation but he made answer noyou must not reckon on me my father would not like it  the manful childishness the childish manfulness of such a reply were impenetrable  if his twoandtwenty years did not make him ashamed of saying so nothing else could and it covered a good deal he knew that his fathers fastidious pride would dislike his making a spectacle of himself and thought that it would be presuming unkindly on todays liberty to involve himself in what would necessitate terms more intimate than were desired  the luncheon silenced the consultation which was to be a great secret from the children but afterwards when it was resumed with the addition of james frost fitzjocelyn was vexed to find the tableaux discarded not avowedly because he excluded himself from a share but because the style of people might not understand them the entertainment was to be a christmastreenot so hackneyed a spectacle in the year 1848 as in 1857and louis launched into a world of couplets for mottoes  next came the question of guests when lady conway read out names from the cardbasket and fitzjocelyn was in favour of everybody till jem after many counterstatements assured lady conway that he was trying to fill her rooms with the most intolerable people in the world  my aunt said she wanted to give pleasure  ah theres nothing so inconvenient to ones friends as good nature who cares for what is shared indiscriminately  i dont think i can trust fitzjocelyn with my visitinglist just yet said lady conway  you are too far above to be sensible of the grades beneath with your place made for you  not at all said louis  northwold teaparties were my earliest most natural dissipation and i spoke for these good people for my own personal gratification  nay i cant consent to your deluding lady conway into mrs walby  if there be any one you wish me to ask my dear fitzjocelyn began lady conway  oh no thank you jem is quite right  i might have been playing on your unguarded innocence but i am the worst person in the world to consult for all the county and all the town are so kind to me that i dont know whom i could leave out  now the pendragon there will help you to the degree of gentility that may safely be set to consort together  what an unkind fling thought isabel  louis took leave exclaiming to himself on the stairs there if comporting oneself like a donkey before the object be a token ive done it effectually  didnt i know the exclusiveness of the woman yet how could i help saying a word for the poor little walbys and after all if they were there no one would speak to them but aunt kitty and i  and isabel i am sure she scorned the fastidious nonsense i saw it in her eye and lip  after a quarter of an hour spent in hearing her praises from miss faithfull he betook himself to mrs ponsonbys not quite without embarrassment for he had not been alone with the mother and daughter since august  i am glad you did not come before said mary heartily i have just done and she returned to her writingtable while her mother was saying  we like it very much  you have not been copying that wretched concern exclaimed louis why mary you must have been at it all night  it is a weeks work  copying is not composing said mary  but you have mended it made it consecutive  if i had guessed that my father meant to trouble any one with it  if you take pains with it it may be very valuable said mrs ponsonby  we have marked a few things that you had better revise before it goes to oakstead  goes to oakstead said louis faintly  your father talks of sending it to see if sir miles does not think it might tell well in one of the reviews  i hope not  i should lose all my faith in anonymous criticism if they admitted such a crude undergraduates omnium gatherum  besides what an immense task to make it presentable  is that the root of your humility  possibly  but for very shame i must doctor it if mary has wasted so much time over it  it does not look so bad in your hand  it struck me whether you had rendered this spanish story right  of course not  i never stuck to my dictionary  a sound dose of criticism ensued tempered by repetitions of his fathers pleasure and next came some sympathy and discussion about the farm and marksedge in which the ladies took their usual earnest part and mary was as happy as ever in hearing of his progress  he said no word of their neighbours but he could not help colouring when mary said as he wished her goodbye we like the party in the house beautiful so much  miss conway is such an acquisition to me and they are doing all you could ever have wished for clara  mary was glad that she had said it  louis was not so glad  he thought it must have been an effort then derided his vanity for the supposition     chapter xvi  the fruit of the christmastree    age twine thy brows with fresh spring flowers   and call a train of laughing hours   and bid them dance and bid them sing   and thou too mingle in the ring                              wordsworth   the 12th of january was the last day before james and louis meant to return to oxford jem taking clara on from thence to school  it was to be the farewell to christmasone much enjoyed in dynevor terrace fitzjocelyns absence was almost a relief to clara she could not make up her mind to see him till she could hope their last encounter had been forgotten and in the mean time her anticipations were fixed on the great 12th  she was aware of what the entertainment would consist but was in honour bound to conceal her knowledge from virginia and louisa who on their side affected great excitement and curiosity and made every ostentation of guessing and peeping  gifts were smuggled into the house from every quartersome to take their chance some directed with mottoes droll or affectionate  clara prepared a few trifles in which she showed that school had done something for her fingers and committed her little parcels to her brothers care and miss mercy was the happiest of all continually knocking at the locked door of the back drawingroom with gilded fir cones painted banners or moss birdsnests from miss salome  miss king and isabel had undertaken the main business  when roused from her pensive stillness isabel could be very eager active and animated and she worked with the exhilaration that she could freely enjoy when unrestrained by perceiving that she was wanted to produce an effect  what womans height and hand could not perform fell to the share of james who with his stepladder and dexterous hands was invaluable  merrily merrily did the three work laughing over their suspended bonbons their droll contrivances or predicting the adaptations of their gifts and more and more gay was the laugh the tutor more piquant the governess more keen and clever the young lady more vivacious as the twilight darkened and the tree became more laden and the streamers and glass balls produced a more brilliant effect  proudly when the task was accomplished did they contemplate their work and predict the aspect of their tinsel and frippery when duly lighted up  then as they dispersed to dress james ran home and hastily tapped at his sisters door  what is the matter she cried  have the tassels come off my purse  nothing of the kind but he came quite in and looked round restlessly then hastily said you gave me nothing for miss conway  i wished it very much said clara but i could not bear to do anything trumpery for her  oh if one could give her anything worth having  clara i had thoughtbut i did not know if you would like to part with it  i had thought of it too said clara but i thought you would not like it to be given away  pulling out a drawer she opened an odd little box of queer curiosities whence she took a case containing an exquisite ivory carving a copy of the madonna della sedia so fine that a magnifier alone could fully reveal the delicacy and accuracy of the features and expression  it was mounted as a bracelet clasp and was a remnant of poor mr dynevors treasures  it had been given to mrs henry frost and had descended to her daughter  should you be willing wistfully asked james  that i should  i have longed to give her what she would really care for  she has been so very kindand her kindness is so very sweet in its graciousness  i shall always be the happier for the very thinking of it  i am glad began jem warmly but breaking off he addedthis would make us all more comfortable  it would lessen the weight of obligation and that would be satisfactory to you  i dont know  i like people to be so kind that i cant feel as if i would pay them off but as if i could do nothing but love them  you did not imagine that i rate this as repayment  oh no no  no it is rather that nothing can be too precious then pausingyou are sure you are willing clary  only too glad  i like it to be something valuable to us as well as in itself  if i only had a bit of black velvet i could set it up  in ten minutes jem had speeded to a shop and back again and stood by as clara stitched the clasp to the ribbon velvet while there was an amicable dispute he insisting that the envelope should bear only the initials of the true donor and she maintaining that he gave the black velvet  she had her way and wrote from her grateful c f d and j r f d and as james took the little packet he thanked her with an affectionate kissa thing so unprecedented at an irregular hour that claras heart leapt up and she felt rewarded for any semblance of sacrifice  he told his grandmother that he had agreed with his sister that they could do no otherwise than present the ivory clasp and mrs frost who had no specially tender associations with it was satisfied to find that they had anything worth offering on equal terms  she was to be of the party and setting forth they found the house beautiful upside downeven the faithfull parlour devoted to shawls and bonnets and the two good old sisters in the drawingroom miss salome under the protection of little louisa in an easy chair opposite the folding doors  small children were clustered in shy groups round their respective keepers  lady conway was receiving her guests with the smile so engaging at first sight isabel moving from one to the other with stately grace and courtesy virginia watching for clara and both becoming merged in a mass of white skirts and glossy heads occupying a wide area  mrs frost was rapturously surrounded by halfadozen young men sydney calcott foremost former pupils enchanted to see her and keeping possession of her all the rest of the evening  she was a dangerous person to invite for the northwold youth had no eyes but for her  the children were presently taken down to tea in the diningroom by miss king and miss mercy and presently a chorus of little voices and peals of laughter broke out confirming the fact whispered by delaford to his lady that lord fitzjocelyn had arrived and had joined the downstairs party  while coffee went round in the drawingroom isabel glided out to perform the lighting process  oh mr dynevor she exclaimed finding him at her side i did not mean to call you away  mere unreason to think of the performance alone said james setting up his trusty ladder  what would become of that black lace  thank you it may be safer and quicker  so far the evening is most successful said jem lighting above as she lighted below  that it is  i like northwold better than any place i have been in since i left thornton conway  there is so much more heartiness and friendliness here than in ordinary society  i think fitzjocelyns open sympathies have conduced  isabel laughed and he checked himself disconcerted  i beg your pardon she said i was amused at the force of habit if i were to say the terrace chimneys did not smoke you would say it was lord fitzjocelyns doing  do not bid me do otherwise than keep him in mind  down fell the highest candle the hot wax dropping on isabels arm caused her to exclaim bringing jem down in horror crying i have hurt you you are burnt  oh no only startled  there is no harm done you see as she cracked away the cooled waxnot even a mark to remind me of this happy christmas  and it has been a happy christmas to you he said remounting  most happy  nothing has been so peaceful or satisfactory in my wandering life  shall i find you here at easter  i fear not  mamma likes to be in london early but perhaps she may leave the schoolroom party here as louisa is gaining so much ground and that would be a pledge of our return  too much joy said james almost inaudibly  i hope walter may spend his holidays here she pursued  it is a great thing for him to be with any one who can put a few right notions into his head  jem abstained from as usual proposing fitzjocelyn for his example but only said that walter was very susceptible of good impressions  and most heartily we thank you for all you have done for him said isabel doubting whether walters mother appreciated the full extent of it indeed we have all a great deal to thank you for  i hope my sisters and i may be the better all our lives for the helps and explanations you have given to us  is that the last candle  how beautiful  we must open  miss conway  yesshe paused with her hand on the key  no nodo not wait taking the key himself  yetyes i musti must thank you for such words  my words said isabel smiling  for thanking you or being happy here  both both  those words will be my neverfailing charm  you little guess how i shall live on the remembrance  oh if i could only convey to you what feelings you have excited  the words broke from him as if beyond his control and under the pressing need of not wasting the tapers he instinctively unlocked the door as he spoke and cut himself short by turning the handle perhaps without knowing what he was about  instantly lady conway and miss king each pushed a folding leaf isabel and james drew back on either side and the spectators beheld the tall glistening evergreen illuminated with countless little spires of light glancing out among the dark leaves and reflected from the gilt fircones glass balls and brilliant toys  sister sister cried miss mercy standing by miss faithfulls chair in the rear of the throng and seizing her hand in ecstasy it is like a dream like what we have read of  oh the dear little children  so very kind of lady conway  could you have imagined she quite gasped  it is very pretty but it was a nicer christmastree last year at lady runnymedes said louisa with the air of a critic  there we had coloured lamps  little fastidious puss said louis i thought you keeping in the background out of politeness but i see you are only blasee with christmastrees  i pity you  i could no more be critical at such a moment than i could analyse the jewels in aladdins cave  oh if you and miss faithfull talk cousin fitzjocelyn you will make it seem quite new  you will deride the freshness of our simplicity said louis but presently added miss salome have we not awakened to the enchanted land  did ever mortal tree bear stars of living flame  here are realized the fabled apples of goldnay the fircones of nineveh the jewelfruits of eastern story depend from the same bough yonder lamps shine by fairy spell  now cousin fitzjocelyn do you think i suppose you so silly  soft  the dryad of the enchanted bower advances  her floating robes her holly crown beseem her queenly charms  as if you did not know that it is only isabel  only  may the word be forgiven to a sister  isabel  the name is allexpressive  she is looking even more lovely than usual said miss faithfull i never saw such a countenance  she has a colour tonight added miss mercy which does as you say make her handsomer than ever  dear dear  i hope she is not tired  i am so sorry i did not help her to light the tree  i do not think it is fatigue said her sister  i hope it is animation and enjoymentall i have ever thought wanting to that sweet face  you are as bad as my prosaic cousin said louis disenchanting the magic bower and the woodnymph into fir wax and modern young ladyhood  there cousin it is you who have called her a modern young lady  before louisa had expressed her indignation there was a call for her  the sovereign of the bower beckons said louis  favoured damsel know how to deserve her smiles  fairy gifts remain not with the unworthy  as he put her forward some one made way for her  it was mary and he blushed at perceiving that she must have heard all his rhodomontade as if to make amends he paused and asked for mrs ponsonby  much more comfortable tonight thank you and the pleasant honest look of her friendly eyes relieved him by not reproaching him  i wish she were here  it is a prettier more visionary sight than i could have conceived  i wish she could see it but she feared the crowd  many people in a room seem to stifle her  is lord ormersfield here  no it would not be his element  but imagine his having taken to walking with me  i really think he will miss me  really said mary amused  it is presumptuous but he does not see well at night and is not quite broken in to his spectacles  mary i hope you will walk over to see after him  nothing would be so good for him as walking you back and staying to dinner with you  go right into the library he would be greatly pleased  cant you make some book excuse  and you have the cottages to see  the people inaugurated the boilers with christmas puddings  mr holdsworth told us how pleased they were  and the norrises  mrs norris is delighted she has found a woman to wash and says it will save her a maid  the people can get milk now i assure you they look more wholesome already  and beecher has actually asked for two more houses in emulation  and richardson found himself turned over to me  oh thats right  ive been at the plans all the afternoon  i see how to contrive the fireplace in the back room that we could not have in the first set and make them cheaper too  my father has really made a point of that old decrepit hailes being moved from marksedge and mary he and richardson mean inglewood to be made over to me for good  i am to put in a bailiff and do as i can with ithave the profits or bear the losses  i think i have an idea  in spite of her willingness to hear the idea mary could not help asking have you sent off the police article  hush mary it is my prime object to have it well forgotten  oh did not sir miles like it  he said it wanted liveliness and anecdote  so the santissima hermandad and all the extraneous history were sent to him and then he was well content and only wanted me to leave out all the christian chivalryall i cared to say  you dont mean not to finish  your father was so pleased isabel so much struck  it is a pity  no no you may forgive me maryit is not pure laziness  it was mere rubbish without the point which was too strong for the two politicians rubbish any way  dont tell me to go on with it it was a mere trial much better let it die away  i really have no time if i dont mind my own business i shall be a plucked gosling and that would go to his lordships heart  besides i must get these plans done  do you remember where we got the firebricks for the ovens  mary was answering when walter came bursting through the crowd where is he  fitzjocelyn it is your turn  here is a curious specimen for our great naturalist said mrs frost a glow in her cheeks and her voice all stifled mirth and mischief  it was a large nest of moss and horsehair partly concealed under the lower branches and containing two huge eggs streaked and spotted with azure and vermilion and a purple and yellow feather labelled dropped by the parent animal in her flight on the discovery of the nest by the crew of hms flying dutchman  north greenland april 1st 1847  qu  female of equus pegasus  respectfully dedicated to the right honourable viscount fitzjocelyn  a fine specimen said the viscount at once with the air of a connoisseur by no means taken by surprise  they are not very uncommon i found one myself about the same date in the justiceroom i dare say mr calcott recollects the circumstance  oh my dear fellow exclaimed sydney instead of his father you need not particularize  you always were a discoverer in that line  true said louis but this is unique  north greenlandah i thought it was from a frosty country  ha clara  not i i know nothing of it cried clara in hurry and confusion not yet able to be suspected of taking liberties with him  no said louis turning about his acquisition i thought i knew the female that laid these eggs  the proper name is i fancy glacies dynevorensisvar catharinaperhaps  walter and louisa had brought their mother to see the nest the point of which she comprehended as little as they and not understanding how much amusement was betokened by her nephews gravity she protested that none of her party had devised it nor even been privy to it and that mr dynevor must bear the blame but he was very busy detaching the prizes from the tree and hastily denied any concern with it  aunt catharine was obliged to console lady conway and enchant louis by owning herself the sole culprit with no aid but miss mercys together they had disposed the nest in its right locality as soon as the earls absence was secure  i had not courage for it before him she laughed  as for this fellow i knew he would esteem it a compliment  as a tribute to his imagination said isabel who in her mood of benevolence could be struck with the happy understanding between aunt and nephew revealed by such a joke so received  it would be a curious research said louis whether more of these nidifications result from overimagination or the want of it  often from want of imagination and no want of cowardice said isabel  that sort of nest has not illuminated eggs like these said louis they are generally extremely full of gunpowder and might be painted with a skull and crossbones  i say clara has aunt kitty considered the consequences  she has sacrificed her ostrich eggs  i can never part with these original productions of her genius  he exhibited his mares nest with his own gay bonhommie to all who were curious and presently when every ones attention had been again recalled to the wonders which isabel was distributing and he had turned aside to dispose of his treasure he heard a sound of soliloquy half aloud i wonder whether she has it from clara who stood a little apart  what asked louia  my ivory clasp with the madonna said clara  jem and i thought it the only thing worthy of miss conway  hem said louis it is not your fault clara but it would be graceful to learn to receive a favour  a favour but not a grand thing like this said clara showing a beautiful little case of working implements  hardly worth even intrinsically your mothers bracelet said louis but i am not going to talk treason to the family doctrine though it is very inconvenient to your friends  then you think we ought not to have done it  that depends on what i cant decide  whats that  whether you give it out of love or out of pride  i think we gave it out of one and excused it by the other  very satisfactory  to reward you here is something for you to do i shall never get at aunt kitty tonight  i see the midshipman young brewster will not relinquish her so will you or will she administer this letter to the lady of eachalott  you dont mean that is tom madison exclaimed clara  why it is like copperplate  no more fitsgoslings  no indeed  is he not a clever fellow  he has just reached the stage of civilization that breaks out in dictionary words  i have been in return telling him the story of the irish schoolmaster who puzzled the magistrates bench by a petition about a small cornuted animal meaning a kid  but i should think it would be very edifying to charlotte to see herself commemorated as the individual at the terrace and his grandfather as his aged relative  he sends the old man ten shillings this time for he is promoted  dont you think i may be proud of him is mary gone home  she must hear about him  as he turned away in search of mary clara felt a soft hand on her shoulder and isabel beckoned her to follow into the back drawingroom where the tree was burnt out and deserted  i may thank you said isabel in a low sweet voice pressing her hand  and jem said clara he thought of it first  it is the most beautiful christmas gift but i do not like for you to part with it my dear  we both wished it and grandmamma gave leave  we longed for you to have something we prized like this for it belonged to my mamma  it is jems present too for he went out and bought the black velvet  clasp it on for me dear clara  there and isabel kissed the fingers which obeyed  it shall never leave my arm  claras face burnt with surprise and pleasure amounting to embarrassment as isabel expressed hopes of meeting again and engaged her to write from school  she looked for her brother to take his share of thanks but he was determinately doing his duty in cutting chicken and cake for those who desired supper and he did not come in their way again till all the guests were gone and goodnight and goodbye were to be said at once  lady conway was warm in expressing her hopes that walter would enjoy the same advantages another holidays and told mr dynevor she should write to him  but jem made little answer nothing like a promise clara thought he had become stiff from some unknown affront perhaps some oppressive present for he seemed to intend to include all the young ladies in one farewell bow  but isabel advanced with outstretched hand and flushing cheek and her murmured thank you and confiding pressure drew from him such a grasp as could not easily be forgotten  claras heart was all the lighter because she was sure that fitzjocelyn had forgiven and what was more forgotten  she had spoken naturally to him once more and was ready for anything noweven though they had missed all confidential discussions upon school  she gave charlotte tom madisons letter  the little maiden took it and twirled it about rather superciliously  what business had my young lord she thought to fancy she cared for that poor fellow very likely he was improved and she was glad of it but she knew what was genteel now  yes she would read it at once there was no fear that it would make her soft and foolishshe had got above that     chapter xvii  the rivals    which king bezonianhenry iv   sir roland of provence remained in suspense whether to be a novice or an irrevocably pledged hospitalier  the latter was most probable and when adelines feelings had been minutely analysed miss conway discovered that she had better not show her mornings work to her sisters  clara and louis pronounced jem to be as savage as a bear all through the journey  clara declared it was revenge for having been civil and amiable all through the vacation and louis uttered a theatrical aside that even that could not have been maintained if he had not occasionally come to ormersfield to relieve himself a little upon their two lordships  laugh as he might fitzjocelyn was much concerned and perplexed by his cousins illhumour when it appeared more permanent than could be puffed off in a few ebullitions  attempts to penetrate the gloom made it heavier and louis resolved to give it time to subside  he waited some days before going near james and when he next walked to his college found him engaged with pupils  he was himself very busy and had missed his cousin several times before he at length found him alone  why jem old fellow what are you about  youve not been near my rooms this term  are you renouncing me in anticipation of my plucking  you wont be plucked unless you go out of your senses for the occasion  no thanks to your advice and assistance if i am not  but it would conduce to my equanimity jem to know whether we are quarrelling as in that case i should know how to demean myself  ive no quarrel with you  you have far more reasonbut added jem catching himself up dont you know i have no leisure for trifling the ordination is the second week in march  the ordination  ayyou know it  my fellowship depends on it  i never liked to contemplate it  he sat down and mused while james continued his occupation  presently he said look here  sir miles oakstead asked me if i had any clever oxford friend to recommend  if he comes into office he  ill be no great mans hangeron  this matter is not imminent  you are barely fourandtwenty  wait a year or two even a few months would  you have tried my forbearance often enough broke in james my object isas you very well knowto maintain myself and mine without being liable to obnoxious patronage  if you think i should disgrace the office speak out  louis without raising his eyes only answered with a smile  then what do you mean  as to your notions of a vocation ninetynine out of a hundred are in my case  i have been bred up to thisnothing else is openi mean to do my duty and surely that is vocationno one has a right to object  no one i beg your pardon meekly said louis taking up his stick to go but both knew it was only a feint and james whose vehemence was exhausting itself resumed in an injured tone what disturbs you what is this scruple of yoursyou who sometimes fancy you would have been a curate yourself  i have just inclination enough to be able to perceive that you have none  and is every one to follow his bent  this is not a step to be taken against the grain even for the best earthly motives  jem  i only beg you to ask advice  for the very reason that you are irreproachable you will never have it offered  the present time for instance said james laughing as best he might  that is nothing  i have no faith in my own judgment but thinking as i do of the profession and of you i cannot help believing that my distaste for seeing you in it must be an instinct  give me your true opinion and its grounds candidly knowing that i would not ask another man living  nor me if i did not thrust it on you  now for it  let us hear your objection  simply this  i do not see that anything impels you to take holy orders immediately except your wish to be independent and irrevocably fixed before your uncle can come home  this seems to me to have a savour of something inconsistent with what you profess  it might be fine anywhere else but will it not bear being brought into the light of the sanctuary  no i cannot like it  i have no doubt many go up for ordination far less fit than you butjem i wish you would not if you would but wait a year  no fitzjocelyn my mind is made up  i own that i might have preferred another course and heaven knows it is not that i think myself worthy of this but i have been brought up to this and i will not waver  it is marked out for me as plainly as your earldom for you and i will do my duty in it as my appointed calling  there lies my course of honest independence you call it pridesee what those are who are devoid of it there lie my means of educating my sister providing for my grandmother  i can see no scruple that should deter me  fitzjocelyn having said his say it was his turn and his nature to be talked down  in short concluded james walking about the room there is no alternative  waiting for a college living is bad enough but nothing else can make happiness even possible  one would think you meant one sort of happiness said louis with a calm considering tone and look of inquiry which james could not brook  what else he cried  fool and madman that i am to dwell on the hopeless  why should it be hopeless began louis  hush you are the last person with whom i could discuss this subject he said trying to be fierce but with more sorrow than anger  i must bear my burthen alone  believe me i struggled hard if you and i be destined to clash one comfort is that even i could never quarrel with you  i have not the remotest idea of your meaning  so much the better  no so much the worse  you are not capable of feeling what i do for her or you would have hated me long ago  do not stay here  i do not know that i can quite bear the sight of youbut dont let me lose you louis  james wrung the hand of his cousin and no sooner was he alone than he began to pace the room distractedly  poor jem soliloquized fitzjocelyn  at least i am glad the trouble is love not the ordination  but as to his meaning  he gives me to understand that we are rivalsit is the most absurd thing i ever knewi declare i dont know whether he means mary or isabel  i suppose he would consider marys fortune a barrierno she is too serene for his stormsworthy most worthybut she would hate to be worshipped in that wild way  besides i am done for in that quarter no clashing there nay the other it can never beafter all his efforts to lash me up at christmas  yet he was much with her he made clara sacrifice the clasp to her  hm  she is an embodied romance deserving to be raved about while for poor dear mary it would be simply ridiculous  i wish i could guessit is too absurd to doubt and worse to ask and whats more he would not stand it  if i did but know  im not so far gone yet but that i could leave the field to him if that would do him any good  heigh ho it would be en regle to begin to hate him and be as jealous as bluebeard but there  i dont know which it is to be about and one cant be jealous for two ladies at once luckily for it would be immensely troublesome unless a good hearty quarrel would be wholesome to revive his spirits  it is a bad time for it though well i hope he does not mean maryi could not bear for her to be tormented by him  that other creature might reign over him like the full moon dispersing clouds  well this is the queerest predicament i ever heard of  and on he wandered almost as much diverted by the humour of the doubt as annoyed by the dilemma  he had no opportunity for farther investigation james removed himself so entirely from his society that he was obliged to conclude that the prevailing mood was that of not being quite able to bear the sight of him  his consolation was the hope of an opening for some generous proceeding though how this should be accomplished was not visible since it was quite as hard to be generous with other peoples hearts as to confer a benefit on a pendragon  at any rate he was so confident of jems superiority as to have no fear of carrying off the affection of any one whom his cousin wished to win  james was ordained and shortly after went to some pupils for the easter vacation which was spent by louis at christchurch in studying hard  the preparation for going up for his degree ended by absorbing him entirely as did every other pursuit to which he once fairly devoted himself and for the first time he gave his abilities full scope in the field that ought long ago to have occupied them when finally a third class was awarded to him he was conscious that it might have been a first but for his past waste of time  he was sorry to leave oxford he had been happy there in his own desultory fashion and the additional time that his illness had kept him an undergraduate had been welcome as deferring the dreaded moment of considering what was to come next  he had reached mans estate almost against his will  he was to go to join his father in london and he carried thither humiliation for having by his own fault missed the honours that too late he had begun to value as a means of gratifying his father  the earl however could hardly have taken anything amiss from louis after having for so many years withheld all the lassezaller of paternal affection when the right chord had once been touched his fondness for his grownup son had the fresh exulting pride and almost blindness that would ordinarily have been lavished on his infancy lord ormersfields sentiments were few and slowly adopted but they had all the permanence and force of his strong character and his affection for fitzjocelyn partook both of parental glory in a promising only son and of that tenderness at once protecting and dependent that fathers feel for daughters  this was owing partly to louiss gentle and assiduous attentions during the last vacation and also to his long illness and remarkable resemblance to his mother which rendered fondness of him a sort of tribute to her and restored to the earl some of the transient happiness of his life  it was a second youth of the affections but it was purchased by a step towards age  the anxiety fatigue and various emotions of the past year had told on the earl and though still strong vigorous and healthy the first touch of autumn had fallen on himhe did not find his solitary life so selfsufficing as formerly and craved the home feeling of the past christmas  so the welcome was twice as warm as louis had expected and as he saw the melancholy chased away the stern grey eyes lighted up and the thin compressed lips relaxed into a smile he forgot his aversion to the wellappointed rooms in jermyn street and sincerely apologized that he had not brought home more credit to satisfy his father  oakstead was talking it over with me was the answer and we reckoned up many more thirdclass men than first who have distinguished themselves  many thanks to sir miles said louis laughing  my weak mind would never have devised such consolation  perhaps the exclusive devotion to study which attains higher honours may not be the beat introduction to practical life  it is doing the immediate work with the whole might  you do work with all your might  ay but too many irons in the fire and none of them redhot through have been my bane  you do not set out in life without experience i am glad your education is finished louis said his father turning to contemplate him as if the sight filled up some void  are you said louis wearily  i dont think i am  it becomes my dutyor yours which is a reliefto find out the next stage  have you no wishes  not at the present speaking thank you  if i went out and talked to any one i might have too many  no views for your future life  thus far to do as little harm as may beto be of some use at homeand to make turnips grow in the upland at inglewood i have some vague fancy to see foreign parts especially now they are all in such a rowit would be such funbut i suppose you would not trust me there now  here i am for you to do as you please with mea gracious permission considering that you did not want it  only the first practical question is how to get this money from jem to clara  i should like to call on her but i suppose that would hardly be according to the proprieties  i would walk to the school with you if you wish to see her  my aunt will be glad to hear of her if we go home tomorrow  are you thinking of going home exclaimed louis joyfully coming to life  yes but for a cause that will grieve you  mrs ponsonby is worse and has written to ask me to come down  materially worse  i fear so  i showed my aunts letter to hastings who said it was the natural course of the disease but that he thought it would have been less speedy  i fear it has been hastened by reports from peru she had decided on going out again but the agitation overthrew her and she has been sinking ever since said lord ormersfield mournfully  poor mary  for her sake i must be on the spot if for no other cause  if i had but a home to offer her  louis gave a deep sigh and presently asked for more details of mrs ponsonbys state  i believe she is still able to sit up and employ herself at times but she often suffers dreadfully  they are both wonderfully cheerful  she has little to regret  what a loss she will be  oh father what will you do without her  i am glad that you have known her  she has been more than a sister to me  things might have been very different if that miserable marriage had not separated us for so many years  how could it have happened  how was it that sheso good and wisedid not see through the man  she would if she had been left to herself but she was not  my mother discovered when too late that there had been foolish impertinent jokes of that unfortunate trifler poor henry frost that made her imagine herself suspected of designs on me  mary would never have attended to such folly cried louis  mary is older  besides she loved the man or thought she did i believe she thinks herself attached to him still  but for marys birth there would have been a separation long ago  there ought to have been but after my fathers death there was no one to interfere what would i not have given to have been her brother well  i never could see why one like her was so visited then rousing himself as though tender reminiscences were waste of time he added there you see the cause of the caution i gave you with regard to clara dynevor it is not fair to expose a young woman to misconstructions and idle comments which may goad her to vindicate her dignity by acting in a manner fatal to her happiness  now he added having drawn his moral if we are to call on clara this would be the fittest time  i have engaged for us both to dine at lady conways this evening i thought you would not object  thank you but i am sure you cannot wish to go out after such news  there is not sufficient excuse for refusing  there is to be no party and it would be a marked thing to avoid it  louis hazarded a suggestion that the meeting with clara would be to little purpose if they were all to sit in state in the drawingroom and she was asked for on the plea of going to see the new houses of parliament  the earl of ormersfields card and compliments went upstairs and miss frost dynevor appeared with a demure and astonished countenance which changed instantly to ecstasy when she saw that the earl was not alone  not at all afraid of love but only of misconstructions he goodnaturedly kept aloof while clara clinging to louiss arm was guided through the streets and in and out among the blocks of carved stone on the banks of the thames interspersing her notes of admiration and his notes on heraldry with more comfortable confidences than had fallen to their lot through the holidays  his first hope was that clara might reveal some fact to throw light on the object of her brothers affections but her remarks only added to his perplexity  once when they had been talking of poor mary and lamenting her fate in having to return to her father louis hazarded the conjecture that she might find an english home  there is her aunt in bryanston square said clara  or if she would only live with us  you see i am growing wise as you call it i like her now  that may be fortunate said louis  you know her destination according to northwold gossip  nonsense  jem would scorn an heiress if she were ten times prettier he will never have an escutcheon of pretence like the one on the old soup tureen that the lady of eschalott broke and jane was so sorry for because it was the last of the old cheveleigh china  louis made another experiment  have you repented yet of giving away your clasp  no indeed  miss conway always wears it  she should be richly welcome to anything i have in the world  you and jem saw much more of them than i did  whose fault was that  jem was always raving about your stupidity in staying at home  he began to question whether his interview with james had been a dream as they were walking back towards the school clara went on to tell him that lady conway had called and taken her to a rehearsal of a concert of ancient music and that isabel had taken her for one or two drives into the country  this must conduce to make school endurable said louis  i think i hate it more because i hate it less  translate if you please  the first halfyear i scorned them all and they scorned me and that was comfortable  and consistent  well  the next you had disturbed me i could not go on being savage with the same satisfaction and their tufthunting temper began to discharge itself in such civility to me that i could not give myself airs with any peace  have you made no friends  one and a half  the whole one is a good rough stupid girl who comes to school because she cant learn and is worth all the rest put together  the half is caroline salter who is openly and honestly purseproud has no toadeating in her nature and straightforwardly contemns highblood and no money  we fought ourselves into respect for one another and now i verily believe we are fighting ourselves into friendship  she is the only one that is proud not vain so we understand each other  as to the rest they adore caroline halters enamelled watch one day and the next i should be their dearest if i would but tell them what we have for dinner at ormersfield and what colour your eyes are  the encounters have made you so epigrammatic and satirical that there is no coming near you  oh louis if you knew all you would despise me as i do myself i do sometimes get drawn into talking grandly about ormersfield and though i always say what i am to be i know that i am as vain and proud as any of them i am proud of being poor and of the pendragons and of not being silly  i dont know which is selfrespect and which is pride  i have always had my doubts about that quality of selfrespect i never could make out what one was to respect  oh dear les voila cried clara as entering hanover square they beheld about twenty damsels coming out of the garden in couples  i would not have had it happen for the whole world she added abruptly withdrawing the arm that had clung to him so trustfully across many a perilous crossing  she seemed to intend to slip into the ranks without any farewells but the earl with politeness that almost confounded the little elderly governess returned thanks for having been permitted the pleasure of her company and louis between mischief and goodnature would not submit to anything but a hearty cousinly squeeze of the hand nor relinquish it till he had forced her to utter articulately the message to grandmamma that she had been muttering with her head averted  at last it was spoken sharply and her hand drawn petulantly away and without looking back at him her high stiff head vanished into the house towering above the bright rainbow of ribbons veils and parasols  the evening would have been very happy had not lord ormersfield looked imperturbably grave and inaccessible to his sisterinlaws blandishments  she did not use the most likely means of disarming him when she spoke of making a tour in the summer  it had been a long promise that isabel and virginia should go to see their old governess at paris but if france still were in too disturbed a state they might enjoy themselves in belgium and perhaps her dear fitzjocelyn would accompany them as their escort  his eyes had glittered at the proposal before he recollected the sorrow that threatened his father and began to decline protesting that he should be the worst escort in the world since he always attracted accidents and adventures  but his aunt discovering that he had never been abroad became doubly urgent and even appealed to his father  as far as i am concerned fitzjocelyn may freely consult his own inclinations said the earl so gravely that lady conway could only turn aside the subject by a laugh and assurance that she did not mean to give him up  she began to talk of james frost and her wishes to secure him a second time as walters tutor in the holidays  you had better take him with you said louis he would really be of use to you and how he would enjoy the sight of foreign parts  isabel raised her head with a look of approbation such as encouraged him to come a little nearer and apeak of the pleasure that her kindness had given to clara  there is a high spirit and originality about clara which make her a most amusing companion  isabel replied i am very glad of an hour with her especially now that i am without my sisters  she must be such a riddle to her respectable schoolfellows that intercourse beyond them must be doubly valuable  poor child  is there no hope for her but going out as a governess  unluckily we have no church patronage for her brother the only likely escapeunless indeed the uncle in peru whom i begin to regard as rather mythical should send an unavoidable shower of gold on them  i hope not said isabel i could almost call their noble poverty a sacred thing  i never saw anything so beautiful as the reverent affection shown to mrs dynevor on walters birthday when she was the queen of the night and looked it and her old pupils vied with each other in doing her honour  i have remembered the scene so often in looking at our faded dowagers here  i would defy midas to make my aunt catharine a faded dowager said louis  no but he could have robbed their homage of halfnay all its grace  they talked of northwold and isabel mentioned various details of mrs ponsonby which she had learnt from miss king and talked of mary with great feeling and affection  never had louis had anything so like a conversation with isabel and he was more bewitched than ever by the enthusiasm and depth of sensibilities which she no longer concealed by coldness and reserve  in fact she had come to regard him as an accessory of northwold and was delighted to enjoy some exchange of sympathy upon terrace subjectsabove all when separated from the schoolroom party  time had brought her to perceive that the fantastic viscount did not always wear motley and it was almost as refreshing as meeting with clara to have some change from the two worlds in which she lived  in her imaginary world adeline had just been rescued from the corsairs by a knight hospitalier with his vizor down and was being conducted home by him with equal probabilities of his dying at her feet of a concealed mortal wound or conducting her to her convent gate and going off to be killed by the moors  the world of gaiety was more hollow and wearisome than ever and the summons was as unwelcome to her as to fitzjocelyn when lord ormersfield reminded him that the ladies were going to an evening party and that it was time to take leave  come with us fitzjocelyn said his aunt  they would be charmed to have you and she mentioned some lions whose names made louis look at his father  i will send the carriage for you said the earl but louis had learnt to detect the tone of melancholy reluctance in that apparently unalterable voice and at once refused  perhaps it was for that reason that isabel let him put on her operacloak and hand her down stairs i dont wonder at you she said i wish i could do the same  i wished it at first he answered but i could not have gone without a heavy heart  are you young enough to expect to go to any gaieties without a heavy heart  i am sorry for you said he in his peculiar tone i suppose i am your elder  i am almost twentyfour she said with emphasis  indeed  that must be the age for care to judge by the change it has worked in jem frost  the words were prompted by a keen sudden desire to mark their effect but he failed to perceive any for they were in a dark part of the entry and her face was turned away  fitzjocelyn said the earl on the way home do not think it necessary to look at me whenever you receive an invitation  it makes us both appear ridiculous and you are in every respect your own master  i had rather not thank you said louis in an almost provokingly indifferent tone  it is full time you should assume your own guidance  how little he knows how little that would suit him thought louis sighing despondingly  am i called on to sacrifice myself in everything and never even satisfy him     chapter xviii  rest for the weary    therefore arm thee for the strife   all throughout this mortal life   soldier now and servant true   earth behind and heaven in view                        rev i williams   the first impression on arriving at northwold was that the danger had been magnified  mrs frosts buoyant spirits had risen at the first respite and though there was a weight on marys brow she spoke cheerfully and as if able to attend to other interests telling louis of her fathers wish for some good workmen to superintend the mines and asking him to consult his friends at illershall on the subject  lord ormersfield came down encouraged by his visit to the invalid whom he had found dressed and able to converse nearly as usual  she begged him to come to dinner the next day and spend the evening with her promising with a smile that if he would bring louis their aunt should chaperon mary  when the earl went upstairs after dinner the other three closed round the fire and talked in a tranquil subdued strain on various topics sometimes grave sometimes enlivened by the playfulness inherent in two of the party  aunt kitty spoke of her earlier days and louis and mary ventured questions that they would have ordinarily deemed intrusive yet it was less the matter than the manner of their dialoguethe deep unavowed fellowfeeling and mutual reliancewhich rendered it so refreshing and full of a kind of repose  louis felt it like the strange bright stillness when birds sing their clearest fullest notes and the horizon reach of sky beams with the softest brightest radiance just ere it be closed out by the thundercloud whose first drops are pausing to descend and to mary it was peacepeace which she was willing gratefully to taste to the utmost from the instinctive perception that the call had come for her to brace all her powers of selfcontrol and fortitude while to the dear old aunt besides her enjoyment of her darlings presence each hour was a boon that she could believe the patient or the daughter relieved and happy  louis was admitted for a few minutes visit to the sickchamber and went up believing that he ought to be playful and cheerful but he was nearly overcome by mrs ponsonbys own brightness as she hoped that her daughter and aunt had made themselves agreeable  thank you i never was so comfortable not even when my foot was bad  i believe you consider that a great compliment  yes i never was so much off my own mind nor on other peoples and the recollection of all he owed to mrs ponsonbys kindness rushing over him he looked so much affected that mary was afraid of his giving way and spoke of other matters her mother responded and he came away quite reassured and believing mrs frosts augury that at the next call the invalid would be in the drawingroom  on the way home however his father overthrew such hopes and made him aware of the true state of the casenamely that this was but the lull before another attack which whether it came within weeks or days would probably be the last  does mary know  she does  she bears up nobly  and what is to become of her  the earl sighed deeply  lima is her destiny  her mother is bent on it and says that she wishes it herself but on one thing i am resolved she shall not go alone  i have told her mother that i will go with her and not leave her without seeing what kind of home that man has for her  marythe mother i meanpersists in declaring that he has real affection for his child and that her presence will save him  if anything could broke out louis  it should it ought but i do not trust him  i know robert ponsonby as his wife has never chosen to know him  this was not a time for disguise and i told her plainly what i thought of risking her daughter out there  but she called it marys dutysaid that he was fully to be trusted where his child was concerned and that mary was no stranger at lima but could take care of herself and had many friends besides oliver dynevor there  but i told her that go with her i would  you to take the voyage  was not she glad  i think she was relieved but she was overgrateful and distressed and entreating me to be patient with him  she need not fear  i never was a hasty man and i shall only remember that she bears his name and that he is marys fatherprovided always that it is fit mary should remain with him  miserable  i can understand that death may well come as a friendbut her daughter he exclaimed giving way more than he might have done anywhere but in the dark how can she endure to leave her to such a fatherto such prospects  she knows it is not only to such a father that she leaves her murmured louis  her wordsalmost her words said the earl between earnestness and impatience but when these things come to pressing realities it is past me how such sayings are a consolation  not if they were no more than sayings  there was silence  louis heard an occasional groaning sigh from his father and sat still with feelings strongly moved and impelled to one of his sudden and impetuous resolutions  the next morning he ordered his horse saying he would bring the last report from the terrace  that afternoon mrs ponsonby observed a tremulousneas in marys hand and a willingness to keep her face turned away and on more minute glances a swelling of the eyelids was detected  my dear said mrs ponsonby you should take a walk today  pray go out with the conways  oh no thank you mamma  if the cousins come in from ormersfield i shall tell louis to take you to look at his farm  it would be very good for youmy dear what is it for marys ears and neck all that she could see were crimson  oh mamma he has been doing it again  i did not mean to have told you said mary the strong will to be calm forcing back the tears and even the flush  nay dear child nothing can hurt me now  you must let me share all with you to the last what did you say to him  i told him that i could not think of such things now said mary almost indignantly  and he  he begged my pardon and said he only did it because he thought it might be a relief to you  only did he say only  i am not sure  at least she added with a deep sigh i thought he meant only  and you my dearest if you had not thought he meant only  dont ask me mamma i cannot think about it  mary dearest i do wish to understand you  is it of any use for me to ask myself said mary  i think it is  i do not say that there might not be insuperable obstacles but i believe we ought to know whether you are still indifferent to louis  oh that i never was  nobody could be  you know what i mean said her mother slightly smiling  mamma i dont know what to say replied mary after a pause  i had thought it wrong to let my thoughts take that course but when he spoke in his own soft gentle voice i felt and i cant help it thathecouldcomfortmebetterthanany one  not hesitating but slowly almost inaudibly she brought out the words and as the tears gushed out irrepressibly with the last she hastened from the room and was seen no more till she had recovered composure and seemed to have dismissed the subject  louis kept this second attempt a secret he was not quite sure how he felt and did not wish to discuss his rejection  at breakfast he received a note from mrs ponsonby begging him to come to the terrace at three oclock and the hope thus revived made him more conversational than he had been all the former day  he found that mary was out walking and he was at once conducted to mrs ponsonbys room where he looked exceedingly rosy and confused till she began by holding out her hand and saying i wish to thank you  i am afraid i vexed mary said louis with more than his usual simplicity but do you think there is no hope  i knew it was a bad time but i thought it might make you more at ease on her account  you meant all that was most kind  i thought i might just try pursued he disconsolately whether she did think me any steadier  i hope she did not think me very troublesome  i tried not to harass her much  my dear louis it is not a question of what you call steadiness  it is the old story of last summer when you thought us old ones so much more romantic than yourself  you are thinking of miss conway said louis blushing but with curious naivete  well i have been thinking of that and i really do not believe there was anything in it  i did make myself rather a fool at beauchastel and jem would have made me a greater one but you know my father put a stop to it  thinking her handsomer than other people cant be love can it  not alone certainly  and actually he pursued i dont believe i ever think of her when i am out of the way of her  no indeed if i had not believed that was all over do you think i could have said what i did yesterday  not unless you believed so  well but really you dont consider how little i have seen of her i was in awe of her at first and since i have kept away on purpose i never got on with her at all till the other evening  i dont believe i care for her one bit  then suddenly pausing and changing his tone you dont trust me after all  i do  i trust your principle and kindness implicitly but i think the very innocence of your heart prevents you from knowing what you are about  it is very hard said louis every one will have it that i must be in love till i shall have to believe so myself and when i know it cannot come to good  you are making yourself more simple than you really are said mra ponsonby half provoked  louis shut his eyes and seemed to be rousing his faculties then taking a new turn he earnestly said you know that the promises must settle the question and keep my affections fast  ah louis there is the point  others true and sincere as yourself have broken their own hearts and those of others from having made vows in wilful ignorance of latent feelings  it would be a sin in me to allow you to bind yourself to mary with so little comprehension as you have of your own sentiments  then i have done wrong in proposing it  what would have been wrong in some cases was more of blindnessay and kindnessin you  louis i cannot tell you my gratitude for your wish to take care of my dear girl she said with tears in her eyes i hope you fully understand me  i see i have made a fool of myself again and that you have a right to be very angry with me  not quite said mrs ponsonby smiling but i am going to give you some advice  settle your mind as to miss conway  your father is beginning to perceive that his distrust was undeserved he has promised me not to object in case it should be for your true happiness and i do believe for my own part that in some respects she is better fitted for his daughterinlaw than my poor mary  no one ever was half as good as mary cried louis  and this is what you tell me  mind i dont tell you to propose to her nor to commit yourself in any way i only tell you to put yourself in a position to form a reasonable judgment of your own feelings  that is due to her to yourself and to your wife be she who she may  louis sighed and presently added smiling i am not going to rave about preferences for another but i do want to know whether anything can be done for poor jem frost  ha has he anything of this kind on his mind  he does it in grand styledisconsolate frantic and frosty but he puzzles me completely by disclosing nothing but that he has no hope and thinks me his rival  can nothing be done  no louis said mrs ponsonby decidedly i have no idea that there is anything in that quarter  what may be on his mind i cannot tell i am sure that he is not on marys  louis rose  i have tired you he said and you are very patient with my fooleries  you have been very patient with many a lecture of mine louis  there are very few who would have thought me worth lecturing  ah louis if i did not like you so well for what you are i should still feel the right to lecture you when i remember the night i carried you to your father and tried to make him believe that you would be his comfort and blessing i think you have taught him the lesson at last  you have done it all said louis with deep feeling  and now may i say what more i want to see in you  if you could acquire more resolution more manlinesswill you pardon my saying so  ah  i have always found myself the identical weak man that all books give up as a hopeless case said louis accepting the imputation more easily than she could have supposed possible  no she said vigorously you have not come to your time of life without openings to evil that you could not have resisted if you had been really weak  distasteand rather a taste for being quizzed said louis  those are not weakness  your will is indolent and you take refuge in fancying that you want strength  rouse yourself not to be drifted aboutmake a line for yourself  my father will have me walk in no line but his own  you have sense not to make duty to him an excuse for indolence and dislike of responsibility  you have often disappointed yourself by acting precipitately and now you are throwing yourself prone upon him in a way that is unwise for you both  i dont know what to do said louis  when i thought the aim of my life was to be to devote myself to his wishes youay and he tootell me to stand alone  it will be a disappointment to him if you do not act and decide for yourselfyes and worse than disappointment  he knows what your devotional habits are and if he sees you wanting in firmness or energy he will set down all the rest as belonging to the softer parts of your nature  on the contrary exclaimed louia indignantly all the resolution i ever showed came from nothing else  i know it  let him see that these things make a man of you and louisyou feel what a difference it might make  louis bowed his head thoughtfully  you who are both son and daughter to him may give up schemes and pleasures for his sake and may undertake work for which you have no natural turn but however you may cross your inclinations never be led contrary to your judgment  then and with perseverance i think you will be safe  perseveranceyour old lesson  yes you must learn to work over the moment when novelty is gone and failure begins even though your father should treat the matter as a crotchet of your own  if you know it is worth doing go on and he will esteem you and it  my poor private judgment you work it hard when it has generally only run me fulldrive into some egregious blunder  not your true deliberate judgment exercised with a sense of responsibility  humility must not cover your laziness  you have such qualities and such talents as must be intended to do good to others not to be trifled away in fitful exertions  make it your great effort to see clearly and then to proceed steadfastly without slackening either from weariness or the persuasions of others  and you wont let me have the one person who can see clearly and keep me steady  to be your husband instead of your wife  no louis you must learn to take yourself on your own hands and lean neither on your father nor on any one else on earth before you can be fit for mary or  and if i did began louis  you would make a man of yourself she said interrupting him that is the first thingnot a reed shaken with the wind  you can do it there is nothing that grace cannot do  i know there is not said louis reverently  and oh the blessing that you would so bring on yourself and on your dear father  you have already learnt to make him happier than i ever looked to see him and you must be energetic and consistent that so he may respect not you but the power which can give you the strength  louiss heart was too full to make any answer  mrs ponsonby lay back in her chair as though exhausted by the energy with which she had spoken the last words and there was a long silence  he thought he ought to go and yet could not resolve to move  at last she spokegoodbye louis  come what may i know mary will find in you theall that i have found your father  thank you at least for saying that said louis  if you would only hold out a hopei wish it more than ever now  i do not believe that i should ever do as well with any one else  will you not give me any prospect  be certain of your own heart louis  nay as she saw his face brighten do not take that as a promise  let me give you a few parting words as the motto i should like to leave with youquit yourselves like men be strong  and so louis whatever be your fixed and resolute purpose so it be accordant with the will of heaven you would surely i believe attain it and well do you know how i should rejoice to seeshe broke off and said more feebly i must not go on any longer  let me wish you goodbye louis i have loved you only less than my own child  louis knelt on one knee beside her held her hand and bowed down his face to hide the shower of tears that fell while a mothers kiss and a mothers blessing were on his brow  he went down stairs and out of the house and took his horse from the inn stables without one word to any one  the ostlers said to each other that the young lord was in great trouble about the lady at the terrace  mary came home and if she knew why that long walk had been urged on her she gave no sign  she saw her mother worn and tired and she restrained all perception that she was conscious that there had been agitation  she spoke quietly of the spring flowers that she had seen and of the people whom she had met she gave her mother her tea and moved about with almost an increase of the studied quietness of the sickroom  only when mrs frost came in for an hour mary drew back into a corner with her knitting and did not speak  mary said her mother when she came back from lighting her aunt down stairs come to me my child  mary came and her mother took both her hands  they were chilly and there was a little pulse on marys temple that visibly throbbed and almost seemed to leap with fearful rapidity  dear child i had no power to talk before or i would not have kept you in suspense  i am afraid it will not do  i was sure of it said mary almost in a whisper  dear mamma you should not have vexed and tired yourself  i comforted myself said mrs ponsonby i said things to him that i had longed to say and how beautifully he took them  but i could not feel that he knew what he was about much better than he did the first time  it would not be right said mary in her old tone  i think your father might have been persuaded  i would have written and done my utmost  oh mamma anything rather than you should have that worry  and i think things will be differenthe is softened and will be more so  but it is foolish to talk in this way and it may be well that the trial should not be made though that was not the reason i answered louis as i did  i suppose it will be miss conway said mary trying to smile  at least it ought to be no one else till he has seen enough of her to form a judgment without the charm of prohibition and this he may do without committing himself as they are so nearly connected  i must ask his father to give him distinct permission and then i shall have done with these things  mary would not break the silence nor recall her to earthly interests but she returned to the subject saying wistfully can you tell me that you are content dear child  quite content thank you mammai am certain it is right said mary it would be taking a wrong advantage of his compassion  i fall too far short of what would be wanted to make him happy  she spoke firmly but her eyes were full of tears  her mother felt as if no one could fail of happiness with mary but controlling the impulse said it is best dearest for you could not bear to feel yourself unable to make him happy or to fancy he might have more peace without you  my dear your prospect is not all i could have wished or planned but this would be too cruel  it is my duty to go to papa said mary  what would be selfish could not turn out well  if you could be sure of his feelingsif he were only less strangely youthfulno she added breaking off as if rebuking herself it is not to be thought of but i do not wonder at you my poor maryi never saw any one so engaging nor in whom i could place such confidence  i am so glad said mary gratefully  you used not to have that confidence  i feared his being led  now i feel as sure as any one can dare of his goodness  but i have been talking to him about selfreliance and consistency  he is so devoid of ambition and so inert and diffident when not in an impetuous fit that i dread his doing no good as well as no evil  mary shook her head  did she repress the expression of the sense that her arm had sometimes given him steadiness and fixed his aim  the resemblance to his mother struck me more than ever continued mrs ponsonby  there is far more mind and soul but almost the same natureall bright indolent sweetness craving for something to lean on but he shows what she might have been with the same principles dear boy may he do well  he will be very happy with miss conway said mary  she will learn to appreciate all he says and doesher enthusiasm will spur him on i shall hear of them  the unbreathed sigh seemed to be added to the weight of oppression on marys patient breast but she kept her eye steady her brow unruffled  all the joys did indeed appear to be passing from her with her mother and she felt as if she should never know another hour of gladness nor of rest in full free openhearted confidence but she could not dwell either on herself or on the future and each hour that her mother was spared to her was too precious to be wasted or profaned by aught that was personal  mrs ponsonby herself realized the weary soon to be at rest the harassed well nigh beyond the reach of troubling  she treated each earthly care and interest as though there were peace in laying it down for the last time  at intervals as she was able she wrote a long letter to her husband to accompany the tidings of her death and she held several conversations with mary on her conduct for the future she hoped much from marys influence for mr ponsonby was fond of his daughter and would not willingly display himself in his worst colours before her and marys steadiness of spirits and nerves might succeed where her own liability to tears and trembling had always been a provocation  her want of judgment in openly preferring her own relations to his uncongenial sister had sown seeds of estrangement and discord which had given mrs ponsonby some cause for selfreproach and she felt great hope that her daughter would prevail where she had failed  there was little danger that he would not show mary affection enough to make her homeduties labours of love and at her age and with her disposition she could both take care of herself and be an unconscious restraint on her father  the trust and hope that she would be the means of weaning her father from evil and bringing him home a changed man was mrs ponsonbys last bright vision  as to scruples on lord ormersfield becoming marys escort on the voyage mrs ponsonby perceived his determination to be fixed beyond remonstrance  perhaps she could neither regret that her daughter should have such a protector nor bear to reject his last kindness and she might have lingering hopes of the consequences of his meeting her husband at a time when the hearts of both would be softened  these matters arranged she closed out the world  louis saw her but once again when other words than their own were spoken and when the scene brought back to him a like one which had seemed his own farewell to this earth  his thread of life was lengthenedhere was the moment to pray that it might be strengthened  firm purpose was wakening within him and the battlecry rang again in his earsquit yourselves like men be strong  his eye sought mary  she looked indeed like one who could suffer and be strong  her brow was calm though as if a load sat on her borne too patiently to mar her peace  the end shone upon her though the path might be hid in gloom one step at a time was enough and she was blest above all in her mothers good hope  a hush was on them all as though they were watching while a tired overtasked child sank to rest  there was a space of suffering when mary and miss mercy did all that love could do and kept mrs frost from the sight of what she could neither cheer nor alleviate and when all she could do was to talk over the past with lord ormersfield  then came a brief interval of relief and consciousness precious for ever to marys recollection  the last words of aught beneath weremy dearest love to your father  tell him i know now how much he has to forgive  the tender impulsive overhasty spirit had wrought for itself some of the trials that had chastened and perfected it even while breaking down the earthly tabernacle so as to set free the weary soul to enter into rest     chapter xix  moonshine    he talked of daggers and of darts     of passions and of pains   of weeping eyes and wounded hearts     of kisses and of chains   but still the lady shook her head     and swore by yea and nay   my whole was all that he had said     and all that he could say                      w mackworth praed   marys strength gave way  she was calm and selfpossessed as ever she saw lord ormersfield wrote to her aunt made all necessary arrangements and after the funeral moved to mrs frosts house but though not actually ill she was incapable of exertion could not walk up stairs without fatigue and after writing a letter or looking over papers aunt catharine would find her leaning back so wan and exhausted that she could not resist being laid down to rest on the sofa  she shrank from seeing any fresh face and the effort of talking to the earl resulted in such weariness and quiet depression that mrs frost dared not press her to admit any one else except louis who rode to the terrace almost every day but when the kind aunt believing there must be solace in the sight of her boy begged to bring him in mary answered with unusual vehemence pray dont tell him i cannot see any one  and when mrs frost returned from a sorrowful talk with louis she believed that mary had been weeping  louis was sad enough  out of the few friends of his childhood he could ill afford to lose one and he grieved much for his father to whom the loss was very great  the earl strove in his old fashion to stifle sorrow in letters of business but could not succeed the result was that he would discuss the one marys past and the other marys future till time waxed so short that he gladly accepted his sons assistance  conversations with richardson and orders to frampton devolved on louis and the desire to do no mischief caused him to employ his intellect in acquiring a new habit of attention and accuracy  his reverence for mary was doubled and he was much concerned at his exclusion attributing it to his mistimed proposals and becoming sensible that he had acted boyishly and without due respect  with a longing desire to do anything for her he dared not even send her a greeting a flower or a book lest it should appear an intrusion and but for his mournful looks his aunt would have been almost vexed at his so often preventing her from going to make another attempt to induce his cousin to see him  mary first roused herself on finding that lord ormersfield was taking it for granted that she would wait to hear from her father before sailing for peru  the correspondence which had passed since her mother had begun to decline had convinced her that he expected and wished for her without loss of time and the vessel whose captain he chiefly trusted was to sail at the end of may  she entreated to be allowed to go alone declaring that she had no fears and would not endure that the earl should double cape horn on her account but he stood fasthe would not be deprived of the last service that he could render to her mother and he had not reliance enough on her father to let her go out without any guardian or friend  recent letters from mr ponsonby and from oliver dynevor reiterated requests for an intelligent man conversant with mining operations and oliver had indicated a person whom he remembered at chevleigh but as his mother said he forgot that people grew old in the eastern hemisphere and the application was a failure  finding that mary regarded it as her charge fitzjocelyn volunteered to go to illershall to consult his friend mr dobbs and his first meeting with mary was spent in receiving businesslike instructions as to the person for whom he should inquire  there were some who felt dubious when he was seen walking back from the station with a young man who in spite of broadcloth and growth was evidently tom madison  i could not help it mary said louis it was not my fault that dobbs would recommend him  mr dobbs had looked this way and that and concluded with well lord fitzjocelyn i do not know who would answer your purpose better than the young fellow you sent here a year ago  it appeared that tom had striven assiduously both to learn his business and to improve himself and having considerable abilities already brightened and sharpened by louis his progress had been surprising he had no low tastes and was perfectly to be relied on for all essential points but mr dobbs owned that he should be relieved by parting with him as he was not liked by his fellows and was thought by the foremen to give himself airs  quarrels and misunderstandings had arisen so often that he himself had been obliged to exert an influence on his behalf which he feared might make him obnoxious to the accusation of partiality  he considered that the lad had worth substance and promise far beyond his fellows but his blunt haughty manners impatience of rough jokes and rude avoidance of the unrefined made him the object of their dislike so that it was probable that he would thrive much better abroad and in authority and at his age he was more likely to adapt himself to circumstances and learn a new language than an older man more used to routine  the vision of the land for digging gold and silver seemed about to be realized just as tom had been growing learned enough to despise it enterprise and hopes of fortune made him wild to go and mary after reading dobbss letter and laying before louis the various temptations of lima found that he thought england to the full as dangerous for his protege  she therefore sent for the young man and decided as dispassionately as she could upon taking him  the ormersfield world was extremely indignant frampton and gervas prophesied that no good would come of such a choice and marvelled at the vicar who gave the lad lodging in his house and spent the evenings in giving him such mathematical instruction and teaching of other kinds as he thought most likely to be useful to him  to his surprise however tom was much more grave and soberminded under his promotion than could have been expected  louis who had undertaken his outfit was almost disappointed to find him so much out of heart and so little responsive to cheerful auguries and at last a little hint at bantering about the individual at the terrace explained his despondence  it was all over  charlotte had hardly spoken to him while he was waiting at no 5 and miss faithfulls martha had told him there had been nothing but walking and talking with lady conways fine butler and that charlotte would never have nothing more to say to him  now just as he might have spoken  was it not enough to knock the heart out of it all  he never wished to go near no 5 again  louis strongly advised him at least to know his fate and declared that for his part he would never take any mrs marthas word rather than that of the lady herself  speak out and of course montroses famous motto came in and was highly appreciated by tom though he still shook his head ruefully as he recollected what a lout he had been at his last meeting with charlotte and how little he could compare with such a fine gentleman as had been described and she always had a taste for gentility  well tom i would not wish to see a better gentleman any day than you have stuff enough in you to make and if charlotte be a girl worth having shell value that more than french polish  youre getting polished too tom and will more as you get better and sounder and that polish will be true and not french  meantime charlotte had been in twenty states of mind  had tom striven at once to return to the former terms the lady of eschalott might have treated it as mere natural homage compared him with delafords delicate flatteries and disclaimed him  she had been chilling and shy at the first meeting expecting him to presume on his promotion but when he was gone came no more except for necessary interviews with miss ponsonby and then merely spoke civilly and went away directly her heart began to fail her neglect mortified her she was first affronted sure she did not care and resolved to show that she did not but then the vexation became stronger she wondered if he had heard of delaford was angry at her intercourse with the butler being deemed an offence and finally arrived at a hearty longing for a return to old times vanity or affection one or the other demanded toms allegiance  and tom came at last  he did not come by moonlighthe did not come at all romantically but as she was washing vegetables he stood by the scullery door and made no elegant circumlocutions  would she be his wife some time or other and he would try to be worthy of her  fitzjocelyn had judged her rightly  sound true love had force enough to dispel every illusion of sentimental flattery  charlotte burst into a flood of tears and sobbing behind her apron confessed that she never liked nobody like tom but she was afraid he would think she had been false to him for she did like mr delafords talk all about poetry and serenades but she never would heed him no more not if he went down on his knees to her  tom was a great deal more likely to perform that feat  he stood his ground when mrs beckett came in and told her all about it and the good old soul mingled her tears with charlottes wished them joy and finished washing the greens  nevertheless mrs frost thought the kitchenclock was very slow  their walking together was recognised  martha was very angry with jane and predicted that the young vagabone would never be heard of more and that the only benefit would be that it would settle the girls mind and hinder her from encouraging any more followers  and even mrs frost had her doubts  her prudent counsel interfered with toms wish to carry out poor little charlotte as his wife and they had to content themselves with a betrothal until they should have saved something exchanging brooches each with a memorial lock of hair during the remaining week the lady of eschalott neither ate nor slept and though she did her work her tears never seemed to cease  she defended herself by averring that miss ponsonbys pillow was soaked every morning but if marys heavy eyelids corroborated her her demeanour did not  mary was busy in dismantling the house and in packing up speaking little but always considerate and selfpossessed and resolute in avoiding all excitement of feeling  she would not go to ormersfield as the earl proposed even for one day and a few books connected with the happy lessons of last summer were given into mrs frosts keeping with the steady calm word i had better not take them  she made no outpouring even to that universal loving confidante aunt catharine and the final parting did not break down her selfrestraint though as the last bend of her head was given the last chimney of northwold disappeared her sensation of heartache almost amounted to sickening  she was going to bryanston square  her aunt had been as kind as possible and had even offered to come to northwold to fetch her home but mary had been too considerate to allow her to think of so dreadful a journey and had in fact been glad to be left only to her own aunt catharine  the last letters which had passed between mrs ponsonby and annt melicent had been such as two sincere christian women could not fail to write in such circumstances as must soften down all asperities alleviate prejudice and variance and be a prelude to that perfect unity when all misunderstandings shall end for ever and thus mary had the comfort of knowing that the two whom she loved so fondly had parted with all mutual affection and cordial honour  she really loved the little prim stiff figure who stood on the stairs to welcome her  the house had been her home for ten of the most homeforming years of her life and felt familiar and kindly it was very quiet and it was an unspeakable comfort to be with one who talked freely of her father with blind partiality and love and did not oppress her with implied compassion for her return to him  yet mary could not help now and then being sensible that good aunt melicent was not the fountain of wisdom which she used to esteem her now and then a dictum would sound narrow and questionable objections to books seemed mistaken judgments of people hard and without sufficient foundation and when mary tried to argue she found herself decidedly set down with as much confident superiority as if she had been still sixteen years old  six years spent in going to the other side of the world and in seeing so many varieties of people did not seem to aunt melicent to have conferred half so much experience as sleeping every night in bryanston square daily reading the morning post and holding intercourse with a london world of a dozen old ladies three curates and a doctor  the worst of it was that a hurt and angry tenderness was always excited in marys mind by the manner of any reference to northwold or ormersfield  it seemed to be fixed beyond a doubt that everything there must have been wrong and fashionable and even poor dear aunt kitty was only spoken of with a charitable hope that affliction had taught her to see the error of her days of worldly display  it was allowed that there was nothing objectionable in clara frost who was subdued by the sight of marys deep mourning and in silent formal company could be grave and formal too  but there was a severe shock in a call from lady conway and isabel and on their departure mary was crossexamined in the hope that they had been outrageously gay at northwold and for want of any such depositions was regaled with histories of poor lady fitzjocelyns vanities which had not lost by their transmission through twentytwo years and twice as many mouths  still more unpleasant was the result of a visit from the earl and his son to appoint the day of starting for liverpool  louis was in no mood to startle any one he was very sad at heart and only anxious to be inoffensive but his air was quite enough to give umbrage and cause the instant remark i never saw such a puppy  nothing but such angry incoherency occurred to mary that she forcibly held her peace but could not prevent a burning crimson from spreading over her face  she went and stood at the window glad that miss ponsonby had just taken up the newspaper which she daily read from end to end and then posted for lima  by and by came a little dry cough as she went through the presentations at the levee and read out viscount fitzjocelyn by the earl of ormersfield  marys mind made an excursion to the dear yeomanry suit till her aunt having further hunted them out among the earls and viscounts summed up at the end severely demanded whether she had known of their intention  i knew he was to be presented  quite the young man of fashion  no doubt beginning that course as if the estate were not sufficiently impoverished already  i am not surprised at the report that lord ormersfield was very anxious to secure your fortune for his son  this was too much and mary exclaimed he never believes in any fortune that depends on speculation  oh so there was nothing in it said miss ponsonby who would have liked the satisfaction of knowing that her niece had refused to be a countess and while mary was debating whether her silence were untruthful her bent head and glowing cheek betrayed her  ah my dear i will ask no questions i see you have been annoyed  it always happens when a girl with expectations goes among needy nobility  you would not say that if you knew the circumstances said mary looking down  i wont distress you my dear i know you are too wise a girl to be dazzled with worldly splendours and that is enough for me  the poor old furniture at ormersfield  mary held her tongue though reproaching herself for cruel injustice to all that was dearest to her but how deny her refusal or explain the motives  not that her aunt wanted any explanation except her own excellent training which had saved her niece from partaking her mothers infatuation for great people  she had a grand secret to pour into the bosom of her intimates in some teteatete teaparty byandby and poor mary little guessed at the glorification of her prudence which was flowing from her aunts wellmended pen in a long letter to mr ponsonby  she thought it right that he should be informed she said that their dear mary had conducted herself according to their fondest wishes that the relations among whom she had unfortunately been thrown had formed designs on her fortune such as they had every reason to expect that every solicitation had been employed but that mary had withstood all that would have been most alluring to girls brought up to esteem mere worldly advantages  it was extremely gratifying the more so as the young gentleman in question might be considered as strikingly handsome to the mere outward eye which did not detect the stamp of frivolity and the effect of an early introduction to the world of fashion and dissipation  she trusted that their dear young heiress would have a better fate owing to her own wisdom than being chosen to support the extravagance of a young titled adventurer  having worked herself up into enthusiastic admiration of her own work miss ponsonby was kinder than ever to her niece and pitied her for being harassed with lord fitzjocelyns company to liverpool  mary was not as much relieved as she had expected when her hand had been released from his pressure and she had seen the last glimpse of his returning boat  henceforth her imagination was to picture him only with isabel conway  and so viscount fitzjocelyn was left with more liberty than he knew what to do with  he was disinclined to begin the pursuit of miss conway as if this would involve a want of delicacy and feeling and he had no other object  the world was before him but when he drove to the liverpool station he was unwilling to exert his mind to decide for what ticket to ask  the bias was given by the recollection of a message from his father to frampton  it would be less trouble to go home than to write and besides aunt catharine was alone  she was his unfailing friend and it would be a great treat to have her to himself  home then he went where he spent the long summer days in listless desultory busy idleness often alone dreaming over last year often passing his evenings with his aunt or bringing her to see his designs dining out whenever he was invited and returning odd uncertain answers when mr calcott asked him what he was going to do  mr holdswolth was going to leave james in charge of his parish and take a walking tour in cornwall and perversely enough louiss fancy fixed on joining him and was much disappointed when mrs frost proved beyond dispute that an ankle which a little over haste or fatigue always rendered lame would be an unfair drag upon a companion and that if he went at all it must not be on his own feet  at last lady conway made a descent upon northwold  paris had become so tranquil that she had no hesitation in taking her two elder daughters to make their promised visit and such appeals were made to louis to join them that it became more troublesome to refuse than to comply and at the shortest notice he prepared to set out as the escort of the conway family  now for it he thought  if she be the woman i cannot fail to find it out between the inns and the sights  short as the notice was the lady of eschalott could have wished it shorter  no sooner had mr delaford set foot in the house beautiful than mrs martha announced to him that he would be happy to hear that charlotte arnold was going to be married to a very respectable young man whom she had known all his life and to whom mr dynevor and miss ponsonby had given an appointment to the gold mines out of respect for lord fitzjocelyn  mr delaford gravely declared himself glad to hear it  but delafords purpose in life was that no maiden should fail of being smitten with his charms and he took charlottes defection seriously to heart  his first free moment was devoted to a call in number 5 but charlotte was scouring in the upper regions and mrs beckett only treated him to another edition of the gold mines in which if they became silver the power and grandeur of mr oliver were mightily magnified  mr delaford thrummed his most doleful tunes on the guitar that evening but though the june sun was sinking beauteously charlotte never put her head out  however the third time he found her and then she was coy and blushing reserved and distant and so much prettier and more genuine than all his former conquests that something beyond vanity became interested  he courted the muses and walked in with a pathetic copy of verses which some day or other might serve to figure in the county newspaper complaining of desertion and cruelty  charlotte sat at the little round table jane was upstairs and without her guardian she felt that she must guard herself  he laid the verses down before her with a most piteous countenance  please dont mr delaford she said i asked mrs beckett to tell you  she has transfixed my breast was the commencement and out poured a speech worthy of any hero of charlottes imagination but it was not half so pleasant to hear as to dream of and the utmost she could say was a reiteration of her please dont  at last she mustered courage to say i cant listen sir  i never ought to have done it  i am promised now and i cant  a melodramatic burst of indignation frightened her nearly out of her senses and happily brought jane down  he was going the next day but he returned once more to the charge very dolorous and illused but charlotte had collected herself and taken counsel by that time i never promised you anything sir she said  i never knew you meant nothing  ah miss arnold you cannot interpret the heart and he put his hand upon it  nor i dont believe you meant it neither continued charlotte with spirit  they tell me tis the way you goes on with all young women as have the illluck to believe you and that tis all along of your hardheartedness that poor miss marianne looks so dwining  when ladies will throw themselves at a gentlemans head what can a poor man do  courtesy to the sex is my motto but never never did i love as i love you said delafordnever have i spoken as i do now my heart and hand are yours fairest charlotte  for shame mr delaford dont you know i am promised  he went on disregardingmy family is above my present situation confidential though it be but i would at once quit my present posti would open an extensive establishment for refreshment at some fashionable wateringplace  my connexions could not fail to make it succeed  you should merely superintendhave a large establishment under youand enjoy the society and amusements for which you are eminently fitted  we would have a library of romance and poetryattend the theatre weeklyandfinishing as if to clench the whole charlotte do you know what my property consists of  i have four hundred pounds and expectations  if charlotte had not been guarded what would have been the effect of the library of poetry and romance  but her own poetry romance and honest heart all went the same way and she cried outi dont care what you have not i  ive promised and ill be trueget along with you  the village girl hard pressed was breaking out  you bid me go  cruel girl your commands shall be obeyed  i go abroad  you know the disturbed state of the continentin some conflict for liberty where the desperate poniard is upliftedthere  oh dont talk so dreadful  pray  do you bid me pause  at a word from you  you are the arbitress of my destiny  no ive nothing to dodo go  only promise youll not do nothing dangerous  reject me and life is intolerable  where the maddened crowd rise upon their tyrants there in thickest of the fray  youll be the first to take to your heels ill be bound  aint you ashamed of yourself to be ranting and frightening a poor girl that fashion cried the friendly dragon martha descending on them  do you apply that language to me maam  that i do and richly you deserve it too sir  see if your missus doesnt hear of your tricks if i find you at this again  the sex fairly scolded the courteous delaford off the field and though she turned her wrath on charlotte for having encouraged him and wondered what the poor young man over the seas would think of it her interposition had never been so welcome  charlotte cried herself into tranquillity and was only farther disturbed by a dismal epistle conveyed by the shoeboy on the morning of departure breathing the language of despair and yet announcing that she had better think twice of the four hundred pounds and expectations for that it was her destiny that she and no other should be the bride of delaford  if i could only know he would do nothing rash sighed charlotte  jane comforted her martha held that he was the last man in the world who would do anything rash  miss conways marianne who was left behind treated charlotte as something ignominious but looked so ill miserable and pining that miss mercy was persuaded she was going into a decline and treated her with greater kindness than she had met since she was a child  in the meantime fitzjocelyn had begun with a fit of bashfulness the knowledge that this was the crisis and that all his friends looked to the result of the expedition made him feel as if he were committing himself whenever he handed isabel in or out of a carriage and find no comfort except in virginias chattering  this wore off quickly the new scene took effect on his impressible mind and the actual sights and sounds drove out all the rest  his high spirits came back he freely hazarded mrs frosts old boardingschool french and laughed at the infinite blunders for which virginia took him to task was excessively amused at delafords numerous adventures and enjoyed everything to the utmost  to miss conway he turned naturally as the person best able to enter into the countless associations of every scene and isabel becoming aware of his amount of knowledge and tone of deep thought perceived that she had done mr frost dynevor injustice in believing his friendship blind or unmerited  they were on most comfortable terms  they had walked all over versailles together and talked under their breath of the murdered queen they had been through the louvre and isabel knowing it well of old found all made vivid and new by his enthusiastic delight they had marvelled together at the poor withered popular trees whose name had conferred on them the fatal distinction of trees of liberty they had viewed like earnest people the scenes of republican paris and discussed them with the same principles but with sufficient difference in detail for amicable argument  they had thought much of things and people and not at all of each other  only isabel thought she would make the viscount into a vidame both as more quaint and less personal and involving slight erasures and louis was surprised to find what was the true current of his thoughts  with isabel propitious without compunction in addressing her with all the novelty and amusement before him he found himself always recurring to mary trying all things by marys judgment wondering whether he should need approval of his theories in marys eyes craving marys sympathies following her on her voyage and imagining her arrival was it the perverse spirit of longing after the most unattainable  he demanded of himself whether it were a fatal sign that he regretted the loss of isabel when she went to spend a few days with her old governess  miss longman had left the conway family in order to take care of the motherless children of a goodfornothing brother who had run too deeply into debt to be able to return to england  he was now dead but she was teaching english and obtaining advantages of education for her nieces which detained her at paris and as she had a bed to offer her former pupil isabel set her heart on spending her last three days in the unrestrained intercourse afforded by a visit to her  louis found that though their party had lost the most agreeable member yet it was not the loss of the sun and that he was quite as ready to tease his aunt and make virginia laugh as if isabel had been looking on with a smile of wonder and commiseration for their nonsense     chapter xx  the fantastic viscount    search for a jewel that too casually   hath left mine arm it was thy masters  shrew me   if i would lose it for a revenue   of any kings in europecymbeline   my dear fitzjocelyn what is to be done  have you heard  delaford says these horrid creatures are rising  there was an attack on the hotel de ville last night  a thousand people killed at leastthe national guard called out  one of the lions of paris my dear aunt virginia is seeing it in style  seeing it  we must go at once  they will raise those horrid barricadeswe shall be closed in  and isabel gone to that governess i wish i had never consented  how could i come here at all fitzjocelyn what is to be done  drive round that way if you are bent on going said louia coolly meantime virginia my dear i will thank you for some coffee  how can you talk of such things cried his aunt  it is all those savage wretches mad because the national workshops are closed delaford declares they will massacre all the english  poor wretches i believe they are starving  i think you are making yourself illthe most pressing danger  come virginia persuade your mamma to sit down to breakfast while i go to reconnoitre where are the passports  virginia had lost all terror in excitement but neither she nor her mother could bear to let him go out to return they knew not when the carriage had already been ordered but lady conway was exceedingly frightened at the notion of driving anywhere but direct to the railway station she was sure that they should encounter something frightful if they went along the boulevards  could not delaford go to fetch isabel suggested virginia he might take a carriage belonging to the hotel  delaford was summoned and desired to go to fetch miss conway but though he said yes my lady he looked yellow and white and loitered to suggest whether the young lady would not be alarmed  i will go with you said louis  order the carriage and i shall be ready  lady conway to whom his presence seemed protection was almost remonstrating but he said delaford is in no state to be of use he would take bonjour for a challenge  let me go with him or he will take care the young lady is alarmed  when we are all together we can do as may seem best and i shall be able better to judge whether we are to fight or fly  outside the door he found delaford who begged to suggest to his lordship that my lady would be alarmed if she were left without either of them he could hardly answer it to himself that she should remain without any male protector  oh yes pray remain to defend her said louis much amused and hastening downstairs he ordered the carriage to drive to rue  off the boulevard st martin  he thought there were signs boding tempest  shops were closed and men in blouses were beginning to assemble in knotshere and there the redcap loomed ominously in the far end of narrow alleys and in the wider streets the only passengers either seemed in haste like himself or else were national guards hurrying to their alarmpost  he came safely to miss longmans apartments where he found all on the alertthe governess and her nieces recounting their experiences of february which convinced them that there was more danger in returning than in remaining  miss longman was urgent to keep isabel and lord fitzjocelyn for at least a few hours which she declared would probably be the duration of any emeute but they knew this would cause dreadful anxiety and when fitzjocelyn proposed returning alone isabel insisted on accompanying him declaring that she had no fears and that her mother would be miserable if her absence should detain them  perhaps she was somewhat deceived by the cool almost ludicrous light in which he placed the revolution as a sort of periodical spasm and miss longmans predictions that the railway would be closed only quickened her preparations  after receiving many entreaties to return in case of alarm they took leave louis seating himself beside the driver as well to keep a lookout as to free miss conway from fears of a teteatete  except for such a charge of ladies he would have been delighted at the excitement of an emeute but he was far from guessing how serious a turn affairs were taking  the dark blue groups were thickening into crowds muskets and pikes were here and there seen and once he recognised the sinister red flag a few distant shots were heard and the driver would gladly have hastened his speed but swarms of haggardlooking men began to impede their progress and strains of mourir pour la patrie now and then reached their ears  close to the porte st denis they were brought to a full stop by a dense throng above whose heads were seen a line of carriages the red flag planted on the top  many hands were seizing the horses heads and louis leapt down but not before the door had been opened and voices were exclaiming descendez citoyenne au nom de la nation descendez  the mob were not uncivil they made way for louis and bade him reassure her that no harm was intended but the carriage was required for the service of the nation  isabel had retreated as far as she could from their hands but she showed no signs of quailing her eyes were bright her colour high and the hand was firm which she gave to louis as she stepped out there was a murmur of admiration and more than one bow and muttered apology about necessity and the nation as the crowd beheld the maiden in all her innate nobleness and dignity  which way asked louis finding that the crowd were willing to let them choose their course  home said isabel decidedly there is no use in turning back  they pressed on past the barricade for which their carriage had been required a structure of confiscated vehicles the interstices filled up with earth and paving stones which men and boys were busily tearing up from the trottoirs and others carrying to their destination  they were a gaunt hungry wolfishlooking race and the first words that isabel spoke were words of pity when they had passed them and continued their course along the boulevards here in desolate tranquillity  poor creatures they look as if misery made them furious and yet how civil they were  were you much alarmed  i wish i could have come to you sooner  thank you i knew that you were at hand and their address was not very terrific poor things  i do not imagine there was any real danger  i wish i knew whether we are within or without the barricades  if within we shall have to cross another  we are actually becoming historical  he broke off amazed by isabels change of countenance as she put her hand to the arm he held hastily withdrew it and exclaimed my bracelet oh my bracelet turning round to seek it on the pavement  the ivory clasp asked louis perceiving its absence  oh yes she cried in much distress i would not have lost it for all the world  you may have left it at miss longmans  no no i was never without it  she turned and made a few retrograde steps searching on the ground as if conscious only of her loss shaking off his hand when he touched her arm to detain her  a discovery broke on him  well that he could bear it  hark he said there is cannon firing  miss conway you cannot go back  i will do my utmost to recover your clasp but we must not stay here  i had forgotten  i beg your pardon i did not think said isabel with a species of rebuked submission as if impressed by the calmness that gave authority to his manner and she made no remark as he made her resume his arm and hurried her on past houses with closed doors and windows  suddenly there was the sound of a volley of musketry far behind heaven help the poor wretches said louis and isabels grasp tightened on his arm  again againthe dropping sound of shot became continual  and now it was in front as well as in the rear and the booming of cannon resounded from the heart of the city  they were again on the outskirts of a crowd  it is as i thought said louis we are between both  there is nothing for it but to push on and see whether we can cross the barricades are you afraid to encounter it  no said isabel  there is a convent not far off i think  we might find shelter for you there  yet they might break in  it might not be easy to meet i believe you are safer with me  will you trust in me  i will not have you endanger yourself for me  dispose of me as you willin a convent or anywhere  your life is precious your safety is the first thing  you are speaking in irony  i did not mean it i beg your pardon  but she coloured and faltered you must distinctly understand that this is only as englishman to englishwoman  as englishman to englishwoman repeated louis in her own formula or rather he added lowering his voice trust me for the sake of those who gave the clasp  he was answered by her involuntary pressure of his arm and finally to set her at ease he said hurriedly if it went wrong with me it would be to lima that i should ask you to send my love  there was no time for more  they were again on the freshlytorn ground whence the pavement had been wrenched  the throng had thickened behind them and seemed to be involving them in the vortex above their heads louis could see in front between the tall houses the summit of another barricade complete surmounted with the red flag and guarded by a fierce party of ruffians  all at once tremendous yells broke out on all sides  the rattle of a drum now and then might be distinguished shouts and shrieks resounded and there was a sharp fire of musketry from the barricade and from the adjoining windows there was a general rush to the front and louis could only guard isabel by pressing her into the recess of the closed doorway of one of the houses and standing before her preventing himself from being swept away only by exerting all his english strength against the lean wild beings who struggled past him howling and screaming  the defenders sprang upon the barricade and thrust back and hurled down the national guards whose heads were now and then seen as they vainly endeavoured to gain the summit  this desperate struggle lasted for a few minutes then cries of victory broke out and there was sharp firing on both sides which however soon ceased the red flag and the blouses remaining still in possession  isabel had stood perfectly silent and motionless through the whole crisis and though she clung to her protectors arm it was not with nervous disabling terror even in the frightful tumult of the multitude  there was some other strength with her  you are not hurt said louis as the pressure relaxed  oh no thank god  you are not  are you ready  we must make a rush before the next assault  a lane opened in the throng to afford passage for the wounded isabel shrank back but louis drew her on hastily till they had attained the very foot of the barricade where a space was kept clear and there was a cry au large or we shall fire  let us pass citizens said louis hastily rehearsing the french he had been composing  you make not war on women  let me take this young lady to her mother  grim looks were levelled at them by the fierce blackbearded men and their mutterings of belle made her cling the closer to her guardian  let her pass the poor child said more than one voice  heinthey are english who take the bread out of our mouths  if you were a political economist said louis gravely fixing his eyes on the shrewdlooking sallow speaker i would prove to you your mistake but i have no time and you are too good fellows to wish to keep this lady here a mark for the garde nationale  he is right there said several of the council of chiefs and a poissarde with brawny arms and a tall white cap thrusting forward cried out let them go the poor children  what are they doing here they look fit to be set up in the church for waxen images  take care you do not break us exclaimed louis whose fair cheek had won this tribute and his smile and the readiness of his reply won his admission to the first of the steps up the barricade  halte la cried a largelimbed formidablelooking ruffian on the summit pointing his musket towards them none passes here who does not bring a stone to raise our barricade for the rights of the red republic and cry la liberte legalite et la fraternite let it fit his perfidious tongue as it may  theres my answer said louis raising his right arm which was dripping with blood you have made me mount the red flag  ha cried the friendly fishwife wounded in the cause of the nation let him go  he has not uttered the cry shouted the rest  louis looked round with his cool pensive smile  liberty he said what we mean by liberty is freedom to go where we will and say what we will  i wish you had it my poor fellows fraternityit is not shooting our brother  egalitei preach that too but in my own fashion not yours  let me passsi cela vou est egal  his nonchalant intrepiditya quality never lost on the frenchraised an acclamation of le brave anglais  no one stirred a hand to hinder their mounting to the banquette and several hands were held out to assist in surmounting the parapet of this extempore fortification isabel bowed her thanks and louis spoke them with gestures of courtesy and shouts of high applause followed them as they sped along the bloodstained street  the troops were reforming after the repulse and the point was to pass before the attack could be renewed as well as not to be mistaken for the insurgents  they were at once challenged but a short explanation to the officer was sufficient and they were suffered to turn into the rue richelieu where they were only pursued by the distant sounds of warfare  oh lord fitzjocelyn cried isabel as he slackened his pace and gasped for breath  you are sure you are not hurt he said  oh no no but you  it is very little he saida stray shotonly enough to work on their feelings  what goodnatured rogues they were  i will only twist my handkerchief round to stop the blood  thank you  isabel tried to help him but she was too much afraid of hurting him to draw the bandage tight  they dashed on finding people on the watch for tidings and meeting bodies of the national guard and when at length they reached the place vendome they found the whole establishment watching for them and virginia flew to meet them on the stairs throwing her arms round her sister while lady conway started forward with the agitated joy and almost anger of one who felt injured by the fright they had made her suffer  there you are  what has kept you  delaford said they were slaughtering every one on the boulevards  i warned you of the consequences of taking me said louis dropping into a chair  mamma he is all over blood screamed virginia  lady conway recoiled with a slight shriek  it is a trifle said louis isabel is safe  there is all cause for thankfulness  we could never have got through if she had not been every inch a heroine  oh lord fitzjocelyn if i could thank you  dont said louis with so exactly his peculiar droll look and smile that all were reassured  isabel began to recount their adventure  in the midst of those horrid wretches and the firing cried lady conway  my dear how could you bear it  i should have died of fright  there was no time for fear said isabel with a sort of scorn i should have been ashamed to be frightened when lord fitzjocelyn took it so quietly  i was only afraid lest you should repeat their horrid warcry  i honour your refusal   of course one would not in their sense poor things and on compulsion said louis his words coming the slower from the exhaustion which made him philosophize rather than exert himself in a true sense it is the warcry of our life  how can you talk so cried lady conway  delaford says the ruffians are certain to overpower the guard  we must go directly very likely this delay of yours may prevent us from getting off at all  i will find out whether the way be open said louis when i have  his words failed him for as he rose the handkerchief slipped off a gush of blood came with it and he was so faint that he could hardly reach the sofa  lady conway screamed virginia rang the bells isabel gave orders that a surgeon should be called  spirits from the vasty deep muttered louis in the midst of his faintness the surgeons have graver work on hand  for heavens sake dont talk so cried his aunt without daring to look at him i know your arm is broken  broken bones are a very different matter experto crede  this will be all right when i can stop the bleeding and steadying himself with difficulty he reached the door and slowly repaired to his own room while the girls sent fanshawe and delaford to his assistance  lady conway unable to bear the sight of blood was in a state of nervous sobbing which virginias excited restlessness did not tend to compose and isabel walked up and down the room wishing that she could do anything looking reproachfully at her mother and exalting to the skies the courage presence of mind and fortitude of the wounded knight  presently delaford came down with a message from lord fitzjocelyn that it was of no use to wait for him for as the butler expressed it the haemorrhage was pertinacious and he begged that the ladies would depart without regard to him  in fact said delaford it was a serious crisis and there was no time to be lost an english gentleman captain lonsdale who had already offered his services would take care of his lordship and my lady had better secure herself and the young ladies  leave fitzjocelyn cried virginia  is it very dangerous delaford asked lady conway  i would not be responsible for the consequences of remaining my lady was the answer  shall i order the horses to be brought out  i dont know  is the street full of people  oh there is firing what shall i do  isabel what do you say  isabel was sitting still and upright she hardly raised her eyelids as she tranquilly said nothing shall induce me to go till he is better  isabel this is most extraordinary  do you know what you are saying  isabel did not weaken her words by repetition but signed to delaford to leave them and he never ventured to disregard miss conway virginia hung about her and declared that she was quite right and lady conway in restless despair predicted that they would all be massacred and that her nephew would bleed to death and appealed to every one on the iniquity of all the doctors in paris for not coming near him  poor louis himself was finding it very forlorn to be left to fanshawe whose one idea was essences and delaford who suggested nothing but brandy  some aunts and cousins he had who would not have left him to their tender mercies  he was growing confused and feeble speculating upon arteries and then starting from a delusion of marys voice to realize his condition and try to waken his benumbed faculties  at last a decided step was heard and he saw standing by him a vigorous practicallooking englishman and a blackeyed whitehooded little soeur de charite  captain lonsdale on hearing the calls for surgical aid had without a word hurried out and secured the brisk little sister who with much gesticulation took possession of the arm and pronounced it a mere trifle which would have been nothing but for the loss of blood the ball having simply passed through the fleshy part of the arm avoiding the bone  louis pleased with this encounter as a result of the adventure was soon in condition to rise though with white cheeks and tottering step and to present to lady conway her new defender  the sight of a bold lively english soldier was a grand consolation even though he entirely destroyed all plans of escape by assuring her that there was a tremendous disturbance in the direction of the northern railway and that the only safe place for ladies was just where she was  he made various expeditions to procure intelligence and his tidings were cheerful enough to counteract the horrible stories that delaford was constantly bringing in throughout that saturday the dreadful 24th of june 1848  it was late before any one ventured to go to bed and louis weak and weary had wakened many times from dreamy perceptions that some wonderful discovery had been made always fixing it upon mary and then finding himself infinitely relieved by recollecting that it did not regard her  he was in the full discomfort of the earlier stage of this oftrepeated vision when his door was pushed open and delafords trembling voice exclaimed my lord i beg your pardon the massacre is beginning  let me know when it is over said louis nearly in his sleep  delaford reiterated that the city was bombarded thousands of armed men were marching on the hotel and my lady ought to be informed  a distant cannonade the trampling of many feet and terrified voices on the stairs finally roused louis and hastily rising he quitted his room and found all the ladies on the alert  lady conway was holding back virginia from the window and by turns summoning isabel to leave it and volubly entreating the master of the hotel to secure it with featherbeds to defend them from the shot  oh fitzjocelyn she screamed tell him sotell him to take us to the cellars  why will he not put the mattresses against the windows before they fire  i should prefer a different relative position for ourselves and the beds said louis in his leisurely manner as he advanced to look out these are the friends of order my dear aunt you should welcome your protectors  their beards and their bayonets by gaslight are a grand military spectacle  they will fire  there will be fighting here  they will force their way in  dont virginiai desire you will not go near the window  we are all right  you are as safe as if you were in your own drawingroom said captain lonsdale walking in and with his loud voice drowning the panic that louiss cool gentle tones only irritated  isabel looked up and smiled as louis stood by her leaving his aunt and virginia to the martial tones of their consoler  i could get no one to believe me when i said it was only the soldiers she observed with some secret amusement  the featherbed fortress was the leading idea said louis some ladies have a curious pseudo presence of mind  generally i believe said isabel a womans presence of mind should be to do as she is told and not to think for herself unless she be obliged  thinking for themselves has been fatal to a good many said louis relapsing into meditationthis poor paris among the rest i fancy what a dawn for a sunday morning  how cold the lights look and how yellow the gas burns  we may think of home and be thankful and kneeling with one knee on a chair he leant against the shutter gazing out and musing aloud  thankful indeed said isabel thoughtfully  yesfirst it was thinking not at all and then thinking not in the right way  isabel readily fell into the same strain  they turned from daylight and followed the glare of their own gas said she  so they began a backward tracing of the calamities of france and as louiss words came with more than usual slowness and deliberation they had only come to cardinal de richelieu when captain lonsdale exclaimed i am sorry to interrupt you lord fitzjocelyn but may i ask whether you can afford to lose any more blood  thank you yes the bandage is loosened but i was too comfortable to move said louis sleepily and he reeled as he made the attempt so that he could not have reached his room without support  the captain had profited sufficiently by the sisters example to be able to staunch the blood but not till the effusion had exhausted louis so much that all the next day it mattered little to him that the city was in a state of siege and no one allowed to go out or come in even a constant traveller like captain lonsdale fertile in resource and undaunted in search of all that was to be seen was obliged to submit the more willingly that fitzjocelyn needed his care and the ladies terror was only kept at bay by his protection he sat beside the bed where lay louis in a torpid state greatly disinclined to be roused to attend when his aunt would hasten into the room full of some horrible rumour brought in by delaford and almost petulant because he would not be alarmed  all he asked of the tricolor or of the drapeau rouge for the present was to let him alone and he would drop into a doze again while the captain was still arguing away her terror  more was true than he would allow her to credit and when the little soeur de charite found a few minutes for visiting her patients wound her bright face was pale with horror and her eyes red with weeping  our good archbishop she sobbed when she allowed herself to speak and to give way to a burst of tears  ah the martyr  ah the good pastor  the miserablebut nomy poor people they knew not what they did  and as louis completely awakened questioned her she told how the good archbishop affre had begun that sunday of strife and bloodshed by offering his intercessions at the altar for the unhappy people and then offering his own life  the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep were his words as he went forth to stand between the hostile parties and endeavour to check their fury against one another  she herself had seen him followed by a few priests and preceded by a brave and faithful ouvrier who insisted on carrying before him a green branch as an emblem of his peaceful mission  she described how at the sight of his violet robes and the white cross on his breast the brave boy gardes mobiles came crowding round him all black with powder begging for his blessing some reminding him that he had confirmed them while others cried your blessing on our muskets and we shall be invincible while some of the women asked him to carry the bandages and lint which they wished to send to the wounded  on he went comforting the wounded absolving the dying and exhorting the living and at more than one scene of conflict the combatants paused and yielded to his persuasions but at the barricade at the faubourg st antoine while he was signing to the mob to give him a moment to speak a ball struck him and followed by the weeping and horrorstruck insurgents he was borne into the curates house severely wounded while the populace laid down their weapons to sign a declaration that they knew not who had fired the fatal shot  no no it was none of our people repeated the little nun  not one of them poor lost creatures as too many are would have committed the actso sacrilegious so ungrateful  ah you must not believe them wicked  it is misery that drove them to rise  hold  i met a young manalas i knew him well when he was a childi said to him ah my son you are on the bad train  bread motherit is bread we must have he answered  why would you speak to one who has not eaten for twentyfour hours  i told him he knew the way to our kitchen  no mother he said i shall not eat i shall get myself killed  many a lamentable detail of this description did she narrate as she busied herself with the wound and louis listened as he had listened to nothing else that day and nearly emptied his travelling purse for the sufferers  isabel and virginia waylaid her on the stairs to admire and ask questions but she firmly though politely put them aside unable to waste any time away from her childrenher poor wounded  on monday forenoon tranquillity was restored the rabble had been crushed and the organized force was triumphant  still the state of siege continued and no one was allowed free egress or ingress but the captain pronounced this all nonsense and resolutely set out for a walk taking the passports with him and promising lady conway to arrange for her departure  byandby he came in subdued and affected by the procession which he had encounteredthe dying archbishop borne home to his palace on a litter carried by workmen and soldiers while the troops who lined the streets paid him their military salutes and the people crowded to their doors and windowsone voice of weeping and mourning running along parisas the good prelate lay before their eyes pale suffering peaceful and ever and anon lifting his feeble hand for a last blessing to the flock for whom he had devoted himself  the captain was so much impressed that as he said he could not get over it and stayed for some time talking over the scene with the young ladies before starting up as if wondering at his own emotion he declared that he must go and see what they would do next  presently afterwards fitzjocelyn came down stairs  his aunt was judiciously lying down in her own apartment to recruit her nerves after her agitation and had called virginia to read to her and isabel was writing her journal alone in the sittingroom  lady conway would have been gratified at her eager reception of him but as he seemed very languid and indisposed for conversation she continued her occupation while he rested in an armchair  presently he said is it possible that you could have left that bracelet at miss longmans  pray do not think about it exclaimed isabel i am ashamed of my childishness  perhaps but for that delay you would not have been hurt and her eyes filled with tears as her fingers encircled the place where the bracelet should have been  perhaps but for that delay we might both have been shot said louis  no indeed i could not wonder at your prizing it so much  i little thought that would be the end of it said isabel  i am glad you know its history so that i may have some excuse and she tried to smile but she blushed deeply as she dried her eyes  excuse more than excuse said louis remembering his fears that it would be thrown away upon her  i know  he has told you cried isabel starting with bashful eagerness  he has told me what i understand now said louis coming near in a glow of grateful delight  oh i am so glad you appreciate him thank you  you are inferring too much said isabel turning away in confusion  dont you mean it exclaimed louis  i thought  we must not mistake each other said isabel recovering her selfpossession  nothing amounting to what you mean ever passed except a few words the last evening and i may have dwelt on them more than i ought faltered she with averted head  not more than he has done i feel certain said louis i see it all dear old jem  theres no such fellow in existence  but here perceiving that he was going too far he added almost timidly i beg your pardon  you have no occasion she said smiling in the midst of her blushes i feared i had said what i ought not  i little expected such kind sympathy  she hastily left him and lady conway soon after found him so full of bright halfveiled satisfaction that she held herself in readiness for a confession from one or both every minute and now that the panic was over gave great credit to the red republicans for having served her so effectually and forgave the young people for having been so provoking in their coolness in the time of danger since it proved how well they were suited to each other  she greatly enjoyed the universallyimplied conviction with regard to the handsome young pair nor did they struggle against it neither of them made any secret of their admiration for the conduct of the other and the scrupulous appellations of miss conway and lord fitzjocelyn were discarded for more cousinly titles  the young hero fell somewhat in his aunts favour when he was missing at the travellers early breakfast although delaford reported him much better and gone out  what if he should be late for the trainwhat if he should be taken up by the police  virginia scolded her sister for not being equally restless and had almost hunted the captain into going in search of him when at last ten minutes before the moment of departure in he came white lame and breathless but his eyes dancing with glee and his lips archly grave as he dropped something into isabels lap  her bracelet exclaimed virginia as isabel looked up with swimming eyes unable to speak  where did you find it  in the carriage in the heart of the barricade at the porte st denis  it is too much cried isabel recovering her utterance and rising with her hands locked together in her emotion  you make me repent my having lamented for it  i had an old respect for claras clasp  i never saw a prettier attention said his aunt  it is only a pity that you cannot fasten it on for her  that could only be done by the right hand muttered louia under his breath enjoying her blush  you have not told us how you got it said virginia  it struck me that there was a chance and i had promised to lose none i found the soldiers in the act of pulling down the barricade what an astonishing construction it is  i spoke to the officer who was very civil and caused me to depose that i had hired the carriage and belonged to the young lady  i believe my sling had a great effect for they set up a shout of acclamation when the bracelet appeared lying on the cushion as quietly as if it were in its own drawer  the value will be greater than ever now isabel said lady conway you will never lose it again  isabel did not gainsay her  the captain shrugged his shoulders and looked sagacious at his patients preparation for the journey before him  louis gravely looked into his face as he took leave of him and said you are wrong  the captain raised his eyebrows incredulously  as they left the city the bells of all the churches were tolling for the martyred archbishop and not for him alone was there mourning and lamentation through the city death and agony were everywhere in some of the streets each house was a hospital and many a groan and cry of mortal pain was uttered through that fair summerday  louis in a low voice reminded isabel that on this same day the english primate was consecrating the abbey newly restored for a missionary college and his eyes glistened as he dwelt with thanksgiving upon the contrast and thought of the peace within our walls and plenteousness within our palaces  he lay back in his corner of the carriage too much tired to talk though byandby he began to smile over his own musings or to make some lazily ludicrous remark to amuse virginia   his aunt caressed her wounded hero and promoted his intercourse with isabel to his exquisite amusement in his passive debonnaire condition especially as isabel was perfectly insensible to all these manuoevres  there she sat gazing out of window musing first on the meeting with the live sir roland secondly on the amends to be made in the chapel in the valley  the cloten of the piece must not even be a vidame nothing distantly connected with a v even though this prototype was comporting himself much more like the nonchalant fantastic viscount than like her resolute highminded knight at the porte st denis     chapter xxi  the hero of the barricades    the page slew the boar   the peer had the gloire                quentin durward   great uneasiness was excited at dynevor terrace by the tidings of the insurrection at paris  after extracting all possible alarm from her thirdhand newspaper mrs frost put on her bonnet to set off on a quest for a sight of the last days times  james had offered to go but she was too restless to remain at home and when he had demonstrated that the rumour must be exaggerated and that there was no need for alarm he let her depart and as soon as she was out of sight caught up the paper to recur to the terrible reports of the first days warfare  he paced about the little parlour reviling himself for not having joined the party to infuse a little common sense fitzjocelyn no more fit to take care of himself than a baby probably running into the fray from mere rash indifference  isabel exposed to every peril and terror  why had he refused to join them the answer was maddening he hated himself as he found his love for his cousin melting under the influence of jealousy and of indignation that his own vehement passion must be sacrificed to the tardy uncertain love which seemed almost an insult to such charms  what needs dwelling on it he muttered doubtless they are engaged by this time  i shall surely do something desperate if they come here under my very eye  would that i could go to the antipodes ere i forfeit louiss love  but my grandmother clara  was ever man so miserably circumstanced  a hand was on the door and he strove to compose his face lest he should shock his grandmother  it was not mrs frost  louis for heavens sake where are they  in the house beautiful  james breathedand you what makes you so pale  what have you done to your arm  a little affair of the barricades  i have been watering the french republic with my blood  rushing into the thickest of the row of course  only escorting miss conway through an assault of the garde nationale said louis in a tone as if he had been saying walking up the high street  how could he help teasing when he could make such amends  james began to pace up and down again muttering something about madness and frenzy  it was not voluntary said louis  when the carriage was confiscated for the service of the nation what could we doi can tell you jem he added fervently what a gallant being she is it was the glorious perfection of gentle lofty feminine courage walking through the raging multitudethrough shots through dreadful sights like una through the forest in christian maidenly fearlessness  james had flung himself into a chair hiding his face and steadying his whole person by resting his elbow on his knee and his brow on his hand as he put a strong force on himself that he might hear louis out without betraying himself  louis paused in ardent contemplation of the image he had called up and poor james gruffly whispered go on you were happy  very happy in knowing what cause i have to rejoice for you  james gave a great start and trembled visibly  i did not tell you pursued louis that the single moment when she lost her firmness was when she thought she had lost a certain ivory clasp  james could endure no more louis he said you must try me no longer  what do you mean  louis affectionately put his hand on his shoulder i mean dear jem that i understand it now and it is a noble heart that you have won and that can value you as you deserve  james wrung his hand and looked bewildered inquiring and happy but his quivering lips could form no words  it was a time to reveal the depths of the heart said louis  a few words and the loss of the bracelet betrayed much and afterwards as far as a lady could she confessed that something which passed between you the last evening  louis cried james i could not help it  i had been striving against it all along but if you could imagine how i was tried  you never would come to plead your own cause and i thought to work for you but my words are too near the surface  i cut myself short  i have bitterly reproached myself ever since but i did not know the harm i had done you  can you forgive me  can youno it is vain to ask you never can be happy  my dear jem you go on at such a pace there is no answering you there is no forgiveness in the case  further acquaintance had already convinced me that she was lovely and perfect but that she is na mine ain lassie  yes she caught my imagination and you and my father would have it that i was in love and i supposed you knew best but when i was let alone to a rational consideration i found that to me she is rather the embodied isabel of romance a beauteous vision than thethein short that there is another who has all that i am wanting in  no no dear jem it was you who made the generous sacrifice have no scruples about me i am content with the part of unas lion only thankful that sansloy and sansfoy had not quite demolished him before he had seen her restored to the red cross knight  it was too much for james he hid his face in his hands and burst into tears  such joy dawning on him without having either offended or injured his cousin produced a revulsion of feeling which he could not control and hearing the streetdoor opened he ran out of the room just before his grandmother came hurrying in on the wings of the intelligence heard below  yes  i knew my own boy would come to me she cried  even miss conway has not begun to keep him from me yet  nor ever will aunt kitty  there are obstacles in the way  you must be granny and mother and sister and wife and all my womankind a little longer if you please  and he sat down fondly at her feet on a footstool which had been his childish perch  not distressed you insensible boy  very happy about isabel said he turning to look at her with eyes dancing with merry mystification  a foolish girl not to like my louis  i thought better of her but i suppose my lady has taught her to aim higher  so she does said louis earnestly  ungrateful girl  why charlotte tells me you led her straight over the barricades with cannon firing on you all the time  but not cupid  then it is true and you have really hurt yourself  and so pale my poor boywhat is it  i must nurse you  i had so little blood left that a gnat of tolerable appetite could have made an end of me on sunday without more ado  but instead of that i had a good little sister of charity and wasnt that alone worth getting a bullet through ones arm  aunt catharine was shuddering thankfully through the narration when james came down his brow unclouded but his manner still agitated as if a burthen had been taken away and he hardly knew how to realize his freedom from the weight  mrs frost could not part with her boy and jane beckett evidently had a spite against they french bandages so that louis only talked of going home enough to get himself flattered and coaxed into remaining at no 5 as their patient  the two young men went in the afternoon to inquire after the conway party when they found that her ladyship was lying down but isabel who had been summoned from a wholesale conflagration of all the ms relating to the fantastic viscount brought down miss king apparently to converse for her for she did little except blush and seemed unable to look at either of the friends  as they took leave louisa came into the room with a message that mamma hoped to see mr frost dynevor tomorrow and trusted that he had made no engagements for the holidays  james murmured something inaudible and ran down stairs snarling at louis as he turned to the miss faithfulls door and telling him he wanted to obtain a little more petting and commiseration  i could not waste such an opportunity of looking interesting said louis laughing as he tapped at the door  delaford marshalled out the poor tutor with a sense of triumph  his hopes at least were destroyed thought the butler and he proceeded to regale marianne with the romance of the barricadeshow he had himself offered to be miss conways escort but lord fitzjocelyn had declared that not a living soul but himself should be the young ladys champion and seeing the young nobleman so bent on it mr delaford knew that the force of true affection was not to be stayed no more than the current of the limpid stream and had yielded the point and though perhaps his experience might have spared her the contaminating propinquity of the low rabble yet considering the circumstances he did not regret his absence since he was required for my ladys protection and no doubt two fond hearts had been made happy  then in the midnight alarm when the young nobleman had been disabled delaford had been the grand championhe had roused the establishment he had calmed every ones fears he had suggested arming all the waiters and fortifying the windows he had been the only undaunted representative of the british lion when the environs swarmed with deadly foes with pikes and muskets flashing in the darkness  fanshawe had been much too busy with her ladyships nerves and too ignorant of french to gather enough for his refutation had she wished for it and in fact she had regarded him as the only safeguard of the party devoutly believing all his reports and now she was equally willing to magnify her own adventures  what a hero delaford was all over the terrace and its vicinity  people looked out to see the defender of the british name and charlotte arnold mended stockings and wondered whether her cruelty had made him so desperately courageous  she could almost have been sorry that the various arrivals kept the domestic establishments of both houses so fully occupied  poor tom she had been a long time without hearing of him and a hero was turning up on her hands  the world was not tranquil abovestairs  the removal of the one great obstacle to jamess attachment had only made a thousand others visible and he relapsed into illsuppressed irritability to the disappointment of louis who did not perceive the cause  at night however when mrs frost had gone up after receiving a promise meant sincerely however it might be kept that poor louis should not be kept up late james began with a groan  now that you are here to attend to my grandmother i am going to answer this advertisement for a curate near the lands end  heyday  it is beyond human endurance to see her daily and not to speak i should run wild  it would be using lady conway shamefully  and some one else  what should hinder you from speaking  you talk as if every one was heir to a peerage  i know what i am saying  i do not see the way to your marriage just yet but it would be mere trifling with her feelings after what has passed already not to give her the option of engaging herself  im sure i dont know what i said  i was out of myself  i was ashamed to remember that i had betrayed myself and dared not guess what construction she put on it  such a construction as could only come from her own heart  after some raptures james added attempting to be cool you candidly think i have gone so far that i am bound in honour to make explanation  i am sure it would make her very unhappy if you went off in magnanimous silence to the lands end and remaining as the boys tutor without confession would be a mere delusion and treachery towards my aunt  that woman  she is not her mother  who knows how far she will think herself bound to obedience  with that sort of relationship nobody knows what to be at  i dont think isabel wishes to make her duty to lady conway more stringent than necessary  they live in utterly different spheres and at least you can be no worse off than you are already  i may be exposing her to annoyance  women have ten million ways of persecuting each other  had you seen isabels eye when she looked on the wild crowd you would know how little she would heed worse persecution than my poor aunt could practise  it will soon be my turn to say you dont deserve her  james was arguing against his own impulse and his scruples only desired to be talked down louiss generous and inconsiderate ardour prevailed and after interminable discussion it was agreed that after some communication with the young lady herself an interview should be sought with lady conway for which james was already bristling prepared to resent scorn with scorn  in the morning he was savage with shamefacedness could not endure any spectator and fairly hunted his cousin home to ormersfield where louis prowled about in suspensegave contradictory orders to frampton talked as if he was asleep made frampton conclude that he had left his heart behind him and was ever roaming towards the northwold turnpike  at about four oclock a black figure was seen posting along the centre of the road and heated panting and glowing james came upmade a decided and vehement nod with his head but did not speak till they had turned into the park when he threw himself flat on the grass under an old thorn and louis followed his example while farmer morriss respectable cows stared at the invasion of their privacy  tout va bien asked louis  as well as a man in my position can expect  she is the most noble of created beings louis  and what is her mother  dont call her mother  you shall hear  i could not stay at home i went to the faithfulls room i found miss mercy waiting for her to join in a walk to some poor person  i went with them  i checked her when she was going into the cottage  we have been walking round brackleys fields  and poor miss mercy  never remembered her till this moment  she will forgive  and her ladyship  thats the worst of it  she was nearly as bad as you could have beenso intensely civil and amiable that i began to think her all on my side  i really could be taken in to suppose she felt for us  i have no doubt she did  my good aunt is very sincerely loth to hurt peoples feelings  she talked of her duty  she sympathized  it was not till i was out of the house that i saw it was all by way of letting me down easytrapping me into binding myself on honour not to correspond  not correspond cried louis in consternation  are you not engaged  as far as understanding each other goes  but who knows what may be her machinations or isabels sense of obedience  does she forbid it  no  she went to speak to isabel  i fancy she found it unwise to test her power too far so she came down and palavered meassured me that i was personally all that heart could wishshe loved her dear child the better for valuing solid merit  faugh how could i stand such gammon  but i must perceive that she was peculiarly circumstanced with regard to isabels family she must not seem to sanction an engagement till i could offer a home suited to her expectations  she said something of my uncle oliver but i disposed of that  however i dare say it made her less willing to throw me overboard  anyway she smoothed me and nattered me till i ended by agreeing that she has no choice but to remove instanter from the terrace and forbid me her abode  and as i said she wormed a promise from me not to correspond  you have no great loss there depend upon it that isabel would neither brave her openly by receiving your letters nor submit to do anything underhand  nor would i ask herbut it is intolerable to have been tricked into complacent consent  i am glad your bellemere knows how to manage you  i told you she was only less unbearable than yourself  you have it from the same stock  the better for your future peace  i honour her  if she had let the welsh dragon show his teeth in style he would only have had to make unpleasant apologies when the good time comes  when sighed james  if isabel be the woman i take her for she will be easily content  she is sick of parade she has tried how little it can do for a mind like hers she desires nothing but a home like our ownbut what prospect have i of any such thing  even if the loss of my fellowship were compensated how could i marry and let clara be a governess clara must be my first consideration  but i say we ought to be going home  i thought i was at home  my grandmother and jane wont be pacified till they see you  they think you are not fit to be in a house by yourself  they both fell on me for having let you go  you must come back or my grandmother will think you gone off in despair as you ought to be and i shall never dare to speak to her  at your service said the duteous fitzjocelyn  ill leave word at the lodge  bythebye are you up to walking  candidly now i think of it i doubt whether i am  come and let us order the carriage  nonoi cant stand waitingill go home and get over the first with grannyyou come after  yes thats right  so the hunted louis waited contentedly while james marched back chary of his precious secret and unwilling to reveal it even to her and yet wanting her sympathy  the disclosure was a greater shock than he had expected from her keen and playful interest in matters of love and matrimony  it was a revival of the mournful past and she shed tears as she besought him not to be imprudent to remember his poor father and not rush into a hasty marriage  he and his sister had been used to poverty but it was different with miss conway  he bitterly replied that lady conway would take care they were not imprudent and that instant the grannys heart melted at the thought of his uncertain prospect and at hearing of the struggles and sufferings that he had undergone  they had not talked half an hour before she had taken home isabel conway to her heart as a daughter and flown in the face of all her wisdom but assuring him that she well knew that riches had little to do with happiness auguring an excellent living and with great sagacity promising to settle the terrace on his wife and repeating in perfect good faith all the wonderful probabilities which her husband had seen in it forty years ago  when louis arrived he found her alone and divided between pride in her grandsons conquest and some anxiety on his own account which took the form of asking him what he meant by saying that isabel aimed higher than himself  did she not said louis and with a sort of compunction for a playful allusion to the sacred calling he turned it off with why what do you think of roland ap dynasvawr ap roland ap gruffydd ap rhys ap morgan ap llywellwyn ap roderic ap caradoc ap arthur ap uther ap pendragon running this off with calm slow impressive deliberation  certify me louis dear before i can quite rejoice that this fun is not put on  did you think me an arrant dissembler  no indeed before i guessed how it was with them i had found outoh aunt kitty shall i ever get mary to believe in me after the ridiculous way in which i have behaved to her  is this what you really mean  indeed it is  the very presence of isabel could not keep me from recurring to her and at home not a room not a scene but is replete with recollections of all that she was to me last year  and that i should only understand it when half the world is between us how mad i was  how shall i ever persuade her to forget my past folly  past nay folly and inconsistency are blended in all i do and now they have lost me the only person who could help me to conquer them  and now she is beyond my reach and i shall never be worthy of her  he was much agitated  the sight of jamess success and the return to his solitary home had stirred up his feelings very strongly and he needed his aunts fond soothing and sympathybut it was not difficult to comfort and cheer him  his disposition was formed more for affection than passion and his attachment to mary was of a calmer nature than his fiery cousin would have allowed to be love it took a good deal of workingup to make it outwardly affect his spirits or demeanour in general it served only as an ingredient in the pensiveness that pervaded all his moods even his most arrant nonsense  the building of castles for james and the narration of the pleasing delusion in which he had brought home his aunt were sufficient to enliven him  he was to go the next morning to call upon lady conway and see whether he could persuade her into any concessions james was very anxious that isabel and his grandmother should meet and was beginning to propose that louis should arrange an interview for them in miss faithfulls room before the departure which was fixed for monday  i intend to call upon lady conway said mrs frost with dignity that made him feel as if he had been proposing something contraband  louis went first and was highly entertained by the air of apology and condolence with which his aunt received him  she told him how excessively concerned she was and how guilty she felt towards hima score on which he assured her she had no need to reproach herself she had heard enough from isabel to lead to so much admiration of his generosity that he was obliged to put a stop to it without being skilful enough to render sincerity amiable but she seemed satisfied eagerly assured him of her approval and declared that she fully understood him  had she explained he would have thought her understanding went too far  she entirely forgave him  after all he was her own sisters son and isabel only a stepdaughter and though she had done her duty by putting isabel in the way of the connexion she secretly commended his prudence in withstanding beauty and repairing the dilapidated estate with peruvian gold  she sounded him as a very wise man on the chances of oliver dynevor doing something for his nephew but did not receive much encouragement though he prophesied that james was certain to get on and uttered a rhapsody that nearly destroyed his new reputation for judgment  lady conway gave him an affectionate invitation to visit her whenever he could and summoned the young ladies to wish him goodbye  the mute blushing gratitude of isabels look was beautiful beyond description and virginias countenance was exceedingly arch and keen though she was supposed to know nothing of the state of affairs  lady conway was alone when mrs frost was seen approaching the house the lady at once prepared to be affably gracious to her apologies and deprecations of displeasure but she was quite disconcerted by the dignified manner of her entrancetall noblelooking in all the simple majesty of age and of a high though gentle spirit lady conway was surprised into absolute respect and had to rally her ideas before with a slight laugh she could say i see you are come to condole with me on the folly of our two young people  i think too highly of them to call it folly said the heiress of the dynevors  why in one way to be sure hesitated lady conway we cannot call it folly to be sensible of each others merits and ifif mr dynevor have any expectationsi think your son is unmarried  he is but she added smiling you will not expect me to allow that my youngest child is old enough to warrant any calculations on that score  it is very unfortunate i pity them from my heart  an engagement of this kind is a wretched beginning for life  oh do not say so cried the old lady it may often be the greatest blessing the best incentive to both parties  lady conway was too much surprised to make a direct answer but she continued if my brother could exert his interestand i know that he has so high an opinion of dear mr dynevorand you have so much influence  that dear generous fitzjocelyn too  as soon as mrs frost understood whom lady conway designated as her brother she drew herself up and said coldly that lord ormersfield had no church patronage and no interest that he could exert on behalf of her grandson  again it was most unlucky and lady conway proceeded to say that she was the more bound to act in opposition to her own feelings because mr mansell was resolved against bequeathing beauchastel to any of his cousinhood who might marry a clergyman disliking that the place should fall to a man who ought not to reside  it was a most unfortunate scruple but in order to avoid offending him and losing any chance the engagement must remain a secret  mrs frost replied that mr mansell was perfectly right and seemed in nowise discomfited or conscious that there was any condescension on her ladyships part in winking at an attachment between miss conway and a dynevor of cheveleigh  she made neither complaint nor apology there was nothing for lady conway to be gracious about and when the request was made to see miss conway her superiority was so fully established that there was no demur and the favour seemed to be on her side  the noble old matron had long been a subject of almost timid veneration to the maiden and she obeyed the summons with more bashful awe than she had ever felt before and with much fear lest the two elders might have been combining to make an appeal to her to give up her betrothal for jamess sake  as she entered the old lady came to meet her held out both arms and drew her into her bosom with the fond words my dear child  isabel rested in her embrace as if she had found her own mother again  my dear child again said mrs frost i am glad you like my jem for he has always been a good boy to his granny  the homeliness of the words made them particularly endearing and isabel ventured to put her arm round the slender waist  yes darling continued the grandmother you will make him good and happy and you must teach him to be patient for i am afraid you will both want a great deal of patience and submission  he will teach me whispered isabel  lady conway was fairly crying  i am glad to know that he has you to look to when his old grandmother is gone  oh dont say  i shall make way for you some day said mrs frost caressing her you are leaving us my dear  it is quite right and we will not murmur but would not your mamma spare you to us for one evening could you not come and drink tea with us that we may know each other a little better  the stepmothers affectionate assent and even emotion were a great surprise to isabel and james began to imagine that nothing was beyond mrs frosts power  louis saved james the trouble of driving him away by going to dine with mr calcott and the evening was happy even beyond anticipation the grandmother all affection james all restless bliss isabel serene amid her blushes and yet the conversation would not thrive till mrs frost took them out walking and when in the loneliest lane conceived a wish to inquire the price of poultry at the nearest farm and sent the others to walk on  long did she talk of the crops discourse of the french and bohemian enormities and smilingly contradict reports that the young lord was to marry the young lady before the lovers reappeared without the most distant idea where they had been  after that they could not leave off talking they took granny into their counsels and she heard isabel confess how the daydream of her life had been to live among the very good  she smiled with humble selfconviction of falling far beneath the standard as she discovered that the enthusiastic girl had found all her aspirations for goodness realized by dynevor terrace and regarding it as peace joy and honour to be linked with it  the newlyfound happiness and the effort to be worthy of it were to bear her through all uncongenial scenes she had such a secret of joy that she should never repine again  ah  isabel and what am i to do said james  you ask she said smiling  you who have northwold for your home and live in the atmosphere i only breathe now and then  your presence is my atmosphere of life  mrs frost tell him he must not talk so wrongly so extravagantly i mean  it may be wrong it is not extravagant  it falls only too far short of my feeling  what will the terrace be without you  it will not be without my thoughts  how often i shall think i see the broad road and the wide field and the mountainash berries that were reddening when we came and the canary in the window  how little my first glance at the houses took in what they would be to me  and then they had to settle the haunts she was to revisit at beauchastel  an invitation thither was the ostensible cause of the rapid breakup from the house beautiful but the truth was not so veiled but that there were many surmises among the uninitiated  jane had caught something from my young lords demeanour which certified her and made her so exceedingly proud and grand that though she was too honourable to breathe a word of her discovery she walked with her kind old head three inches higher and as a great favour showed charlotte a piece of poor dear master henrys bridecake kept for luck and a little roll of treasured real brussels lace that she had saved to adorn her cap whenever mr james should marry  charlotte was not absolutely as attentive as she might have been to such interesting curiosities  she had one eye towards the window all the time she wanted to be certified how deeply she had wounded the hero of the barricade and she had absolutely not seen him since his return  the little damsel missed homage  you are not heeding me exclaimed jane at last  yes i beg your pardon maam  charlotte take care  mind me one thing at a time said jane oracularly  not one eye here the other there  im sure i dont know what you mean mrs beckett  come dont colour up and say you dont know nothing  why did you water your lemon plant three times over but that you wanted to be looking out of window  why did you never top nor tail the gooseberries for the pudding but sent them up fit to choke my poor missus  if master jem hadntbless me what was i going to saybut we should soon have heard of it  no no charlotte ive been a mother to you ever since you came here a little starveling thing and ill speak plain for your good  if you fancy that genteel butler in there say so downright but first sit down and write away a letter to give up the other young man  charlottes cheeks were in a flame and something vehement at the end of her tongue when with a gentle knock and by your favour ladies in walked mr delaford  jane was very civil but very stiff at first till he thawed her by great praise of lord fitzjocelyn the mere prelude to his own magnificent exploits  charlotte listened like a very desdemona  he was very pathetic and all that was not selfexaltation was aimed at her  nothing could have been more welcome than the bullets to penetrate his heart and he turned up his eyes in a feeling manner  charlottes heart was exceedingly touched and she had tears in her eyes when she moved forward in the attitude of the porcelain shepherdess in the parlour to return a little volume of selections of tender poetry bound in crimson silk that he had lent to her some time since would she not honour him by accepting a trifling gift  she blushed she accepted and with needlelike pen in characters fine as hair upon a scroll garlanded with forgetmenots and borne in mid air by two portly doves was charlotte arnolds name inscribed by the hero of the barricades  oh vanity vanity how many garbs dost thou wear  delaford went away satisfied that he had produced an impression such as he could improve if they should ever be thrown together again  the lady of eschalott remained anything but satisfied  she was touchy and fretful found everything a grievance left cobwebs in the corners and finally went into hysterics because the cat jumped at the canarybirds cage     chapter xxii  burgomasters and great oneeyers    when full upon his ardent soul   the champion feels the influence roll   he swims the lake he leaps the wall   heeds not the depth nor plumbs the fall   unshielded mailless on he goes   singly against a host of foes                        harold the dauntless   jem  jem have you heard  what should i hear  mr lester is going to retire at christmas  does that account for your irrational excitement  and it has not occurred to you that the grammarschool would be the making of you  endowment 150 poundsthirty forty boys at 10 pounds per annum 400 pounds at least  that is 550 poundssay 600 pounds for certain and it would be doubled under a scholar and a gentleman1200 pounds a year  and you might throw it open to boarders set up the houses in the terrace and let them atsay 40 pounds  nine houses nine times forty  well done fitzjocelyn  at this rate one need not go out to peru  exactly so you would be doubling the value of your own property as a secondary consideration and doing incalculable good  as if there were any more chance of my getting the school than of the rest of it  so you really had not thought of standing  i would most gladly if there were the least hope of success  i cant afford to miss any chance but it is mere folly to talk of it onehalf of the trustees detest my principles the others would think themselves insulted by a young man in deacons orders offering himself  it is evident that you are the only man on whom they can combine who can save the school and do any good to all those boysmind you the important middle class whom i would do anything to train in sound principles  so far it is in my favour that i am one of the few university men educated here  you are your grandmothers grandsonthat is everything and you have more experience of teaching than most men twice your age  james made a face at his experience but little stimulus was needed to make him attempt to avail himself of so fair an opening coming so much sooner than he could have dared to expect  it was now september and the two months of waiting and separation seemed already like so many years  by the time mrs frost came in from her walk she found the two young gentlemen devising a circular and composing applications for testimonials  after the first start of surprise and telling james he ought to go to school himself mrs frost was easily persuaded to enter heartily into the project but she insisted on the first measure being to consult mr calcott  he was the head of the old sound and respectable partythe chairman of everything both in county and boroughand had the casting vote among the eight trustees of king edwards school who by old custom nominated each other from the landholders within the town  she strongly deprecated attempting anything without first ascertaining his views and as the young men had lashed themselves into great ardour the three walked off at once to lay the proposal before the squire  but mr calcott was not at home  he had set off yesterday with miss calcott and miss caroline for a tour in wales and would not return for a week or ten days  to the imaginations of lord fitzjocelyn and mr frost this was fatal delay  besides he would be sure to lingerhe would not come home for a monthnay six weeks at leastwhat candidates might not startwhat pledges might not be given in the meantime  james vehement and disappointed went home to spend the evening on the concoction of what his grandmother approved as a very proper letter to be despatched to meet the squire at the postoffice at caernarvon and resigned himself to grumble away the period of his absence secretly relieved at the postponement of the evil day of the canvass at which all the pendragon blood was in a state of revolt  but louis in his solitude at ormersfield had nothing to distract his thoughts or prevent him from lapsing into one of his most singleeyed fits of impetuosity  he had come to regard james as the sole hope for northwold school and northwold school as the sole hope for james and had created an indefinite host of dangerous applicants only to be forestalled by the most vigorous measures evening night and morning did but increase the conviction till he ordered his horse and galloped to the terrace as though the speed of his charger would decide the contest  eloquently and piteously did he protest against jamess promise to take no steps until the squires opinion should be known  he convinced his cousin talked over his aunt and prevailed to have the letter rewritten and sent off to the post with the applications for testimonials  then the rough draft of the circular was revised and corrected till it appeared so admirable to louis that he snatched it up and ran away with it to read it to old mr walby who was one of the trustees and very fond of his last years patient  his promise good easy man was pretty sure to be the prize of the first applicant but this did not render it less valuable to his young lordship who came back all glorious with an eighth part of the victory and highly delighted with the excellent apothecarys most judicious and gratifying sentimentsnamely all his own eager rhetoric to which the good man had cordially given his meek puzzleheaded assent  thenceforth mr walby was to think all fitzjocelyns strongest recommendations of his cousin  there was no use in holding back now  james was committed and besides there was a vision looming in the distance of a scholar from a foreign university with less than half a creed  thenceforth prompt measures were a mere duty to the rising generation and louis dragged his coriolanus into the town to call upon certain substantial tradesmen who had voices among the eight  civility was great but the portly grocer and gentlemanly bookseller had both learned prudence in many an election neither would make any immediate replythe one because he never did anything but what mr calcott directed and the other never pledged himself till all the candidates were in the field and he had impartially printed all their addresses  richardson the solicitor and manofbusiness to the ormersfield estate appeared so sure a card that james declared that he was ashamed of the farce of calling on him but they obtained no decided reply  louis was proud that richardson should display an independent conscience and disdained his cousins sneering comment that he had forgotten that there were other clients in the county besides the fitzjocelyns  no power could drag mr frost a step further  he would not hear of canvassing that very intelligent mr ramsbotham of the factory who had been chosen at unawares by the trustees before his principles had developed themselves far less on his nominee the wealthy butcher always more demonstratively of the same mind  james declared first that he would have nothing to do with them secondly that he could not answer it to the earl to let louis ask a favour of them thirdly that he had rather fail than owe his election to them fourthly that it would be most improper usage of mr calcott to curry favour with men who systematically opposed him and fifthly that they could only vote for him on a misunderstanding of his intentions  the eighth trustee was a dead letteran old gentleman long retired from business at his bank to a cottage at the lakes where he was written to but without much hope of his taking the trouble even to reply  however if the choice lay only between james and the representative of the new lights there could be little reasonable fear  much fretting and fuming was expended on the nonarrival of a letter from mr calcott but on the appointed tenth day he came home and the next morning james was at ormersfield in an agony of disappointment the squire had sent him a note kind in expression regretting his inability to give his interest to one for whom he had always so much regard and whose family he so highly respected but that he had already promised his support to a mr powell the undermaster of a large classical school whom he thought calculated for the situation both by experience and acquirements  james had been making sure enough of the school to growl at his intended duties but he had built so entirely on success and formed so many projects that the disappointment was extreme it appeared a cruel injury in so old a friend to have overlooked him  he had been much vexed with his grandmother for regarding the veto as decisive and he viewed all his hopes of happiness with isabel as overthrown  louis partook and exaggerated his sentiments  they railedthe one fiercely the other philosophicallyagainst the squires domineering they proved him narrow and prejudicedafraid of youth afraid of salutary reform bent on prolonging the dull old system and on bringing in a mere usher  they recollected a mauvais sujet from the said classical school argued that it never turned out good scholars nor good men and that they should be conferring the greatest benefit on northwold burghers yet unborn by recalling the old squire to a better mind or by bringing in james frost in spite of him  not without hopes of the first though as james told him no one would have nourished them save himself louis set forth for little northwold with the same valour which had made him the champion of the marksedge poacher  he found the old gentleman goodnatured and sympathizing for he liked the warm friendship of the two boys and had not the most remote idea of their disputing his verdict  it is very unlucky that i was from home he said  i am afraid the disappointment will be the greater from its having gone so far  may i ask whether you are absolutely pledged to mr powell  why yes  i may say so  considering all things it is best as it is i should have been unwilling to vex my good old friend mrs frost and yet smiling benignantly on his fretted auditor i have to look out for the school first of all you know  perhaps i shall not allow that mr powell is the best lookout for the school sir  eh  the best under the circumstances  such a place as this wants experience and discipline more than scholarship  powell is the very man and has been waiting for it long and young frost could do much better for himself if he will only have patience  then his age is all that is against him  the only inferiority to mr powell  hm yes i may say so  inferior  no he is superior enough it is a mere joke to compare them but this is not a post for one of your young unmarried men  if that be all cried louis the objection would be soon removed it may be an inducement to hear that you would be making two people happy instead of one  now dont tell me so almost angrily exclaimed the squire  jem frost marry  he has no business to think of it these ten years  he ought to be minding his grandmother and sister  to marry on that school would be serving poor mrs frost exactly as his poor absurd father did before him and she is too old to have all that over again i thought he was of a different sort of stamp  my aunt gives her full consent  ive no doubt of it just like her  but he ought to be ashamed to ask her at her age when she should have every comfort he could give her pray who is the lady  there was some nonsense afloat about miss conway but i never believed him so foolish  it is perfectly true but i must beg you not to mention it i ought not to have been betrayed into mentioning it  you need not caution me  it is not news i should be forward to spread  what does your father say to it  the engagement took place since he left england  i should think so  then pausing he added with condescending goodnature well fitzjocelyn i seem to you a terrible old flintstone but i cant help that  there are considerations besides true love you know and for these young people they cant have pined out their hearts yet as by your own showing they have not been engaged three months  if it were sydney himself i should tell him that love is all the better for keepingif it is good for anything and where there is such a disparity it ought above all to be tested by waiting  so tell master jem with my best wishes to take care of his grandmother  i shall think myself doing him a kindness in keeping him out of the school if it is to hinder him from marrying at fourandtwenty and a girl brought up as she has been  and mr calcott said louis rising you will excuse my viewing my cousins engagement as an additional motive for doing my utmost to promote his success in obtaining a situation for which i consider him as eminently fitted  good morning sir  good morning my lord  lord fitzjocelyn departed so grave so courteous so dignified so resolute so comically like his father that the old squire threw himself back in his chair and laughed heartily  the magnificent challenge of war to the knife was no more to him than the adjuration he had heard last year in the justiceroom and he no more expected these two lads to make any effectual opposition than he did to see them repeal the gamelaws  the viscount meanwhile rode off thoroughly roused to indignation the good sense of sixty naturally fell hard and cold on the ears of twentytwo and it was one of the moments when counsel inflamed instead of checking him  never angry on his own account he could be exceedingly wrathful for others and the unlucky word disparity drove him especially wild  in mere charity he thought it right to withhold this insult to the pendragons from his cousins ears but this very reserve seemed to bind him to resent it in jamess stead and he was far more blindly impetuous than if as usual he had seen james so vehement that he was obliged to try to curb and restrain him  he would not hear of giving in  when the ramsbotham candidate appeared and james scrupled to divide the contrary interest louis laid the whole blame of the split upon mr calcott while as to poor mr powell no words were compassionate enough for his dull slouching ungentlemanly air and he was pronounced to be an old writingmaster fit for nothing but to mend pens  but mr walbys was still their sole promise  the grocer followed the squire the bookseller was liberal and had invited the ramsbotham candidate to dinner  on this alarming symptom fitzjocelyn fell upon richardson and talked and talked and talked till the solicitor could either bear it no longer or feared for the ormersfield agency and his vote was carried off as a captive  this triumph alarmed mrs frost and james who knew how scrupulously the earl abstained from seeking anything like a favour at northwold and they tried to impress this on louis but he was exalted far above even understanding the remonstrance  it was all their disinterestedness he had no notion of that guarded pride which would incur no obligation  no no if jem would be beholden to no one he would accept all as personal kindness to himself  expect a return he returned goodwillof course he would do any one a kindness claims involving himself he would take care of that and off he went laughing  he came in the next day announcing a still grander and more formidable encounter  he had met mr ramsbotham himself and secured his promise that in case he failed in carrying his own man he and the butcher would support mr frost  the fact was that lord fitzjocelyns advocacy of the poacher his free address his sympathy for the masses and his careless words had inspired expectations of his liberal views mr ramsbotham was not sorry to establish a claim and was likewise gratified by the frank engaging manners which increased the pleasure of being solicited by a noblemana distinction of which he thought more than did all the opposite party  to put james beyond the perils of the casting vote was next the point without divulging his tactics louis flew off one morning by the train made a sudden descent on the recluse banker at ambleside barbarously used his gift of the ceaseless tongue till the poor old man was nearly distracted touched his wifes tender heart with good old mrs frost and the two lovers and made her promise to bring him comfortably and quietly down to stay at ormersfield and give his vote  and so when the election finally came on mr calcott found himself left with only his faithful grocer to support his protege  three votes were given at once for the reverend james roland frost dynevor the bookseller followed as soon as he saw how the land lay and ramsbotham and co swelled the majority as soon as they saw that their friend had no chance  poor mr powell went home to his drudgery with his wrinkles deeper than ever and his wife sighed as she resigned her last hope of sending her son to the university  mr calcott had for the first time in his life been overridden by an unscrupulous use of his neighbours rank and of the youthfulness that inspired hopes of fixing a claim on an untried inexperienced man  the old squire was severely hurt and mortified but he was very magnanimousgenerously wished james joy and congratulated mrs frost with all his heart  he was less cordial with louis but the worst he said of him was that he was but a lad his father was out of the way and he wished he might not find that he had got himself into a scrape he could not think why a man of old ormersfields age should go figuring round cape horn instead of staying to keep his own son in order  sydney was absent but the rest of the family and their friends were less forbearing than the person chiefly concerned  they talked furiously and made a strong exertion of forgiveness in order not to cut fitzjocelyn  sir gilbert brewster vowed that it would serve him right to be turned out of the troop and that he must keep a sharp look out lest he should sow disaffection among the yeomanry  making friends with ramsbotham never taking out a gun  the country was gone to the dogs when such as he was to be a peer      end of vol i
